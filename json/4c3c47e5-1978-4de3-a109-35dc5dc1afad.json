Lanthe had wanted to accompany her, but Sabine said nine was too young.</p><p>So Lanthe waited in this meadow, her favorite spot below the high mountain abbey where she lived with Sabine and her parents. A fir-tree forest surrounded the small clearing, and a placid lake reflected the sky like a mirror. Her dress hem continually danced with swaying wild-flowers.</p><p>Here, she could coax rabbits to share dandelions with her, naming the creatures and talking to them. Other times, she\u2019d spend hours lying in the grass, gazing up at puffy white clouds to spot shapes.</p><p>But today was cloudless. Which was why she frowned when a shadow passed over the sun.</p><p>She shielded her eyes to peer upward\u2014and saw . . . wings. Deadly wings. They belonged to a boy, one who looked as shocked as she was.</p> <p>He was a Vrekener! An enemy to her kind.</p><p>As she scrambled to her feet, their eyes met. His had gone as wide as hers. They stared, right up until the moment he flew headfirst into a tree.</p><p>Spell broken, she hiked up her dress and ran for her life. Before she\u2019d made the cover of forest, he dropped in front of her, spreading his wings.</p><p>She gasped, momentarily stunned by the sight of them. Vrekener wings were jagged\u2014more dragon than dove\u2014with a tapering flare at three points along the bottom. The flares farthest from the body on either side were tipped with talons. Scary talons.</p><p>She whirled around to flee in the other direction, skirting the lake. Though she was as fast as a fey, he again caught up with her, corralling her with those wings. On the inside, they were gray, with lines of light forking out all over them.</p><p>Lanthe and the boy stared at each other, his gaze flicking over her face. Whatever he saw there made him exhale a sharp breath. Puh.</p> <p>No use running. And no one would ever hear her scream. Her parents were all the way up in the abbey, a pair of recluses. Would Sabine find Lanthe\u2019s mangled body down here?</p><p>Not if I use my sorcery. At the thought, she began to tremble. Lanthe didn\u2019t want to call on her powers. It seemed every time she did ended in disaster. But she would against a Vrekener.</p><p>Even if he was the most handsome boy she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>Looking to be a year or two older than she was, he had vivid gray eyes, tanned skin, broad cheekbones, and sandy brown hair that tumbled over his forehead and around his horns. Those jutting spikes were smooth and silvery.</p><p>He had even, white teeth, with a pair of fangs! She had the mad urge to tap one of those points with the pad of her forefinger\u2014</p><p>\u201cI smell magics on you,\u201d the Vrekener said, narrowing those gray eyes. \u201cAre you a little Sorceri?\u201d</p><p>There was no denying her species, so she raised her hands threateningly. Power easily leapt to them, swirls of dazzling blue light sparkling in her palms. \u201cI am the Queen of Persuasion, a great and terrible sorceress,\u201d she said in an ominous voice, even while fighting the urge to bite her fingernails. \u201cIf you come any closer to me, Vrekener, I will be forced to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem bothered whatsoever by her show of sorcery. As if she hadn\u2019t spoken, he said, \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re a little lamb. From the sky, you look like one, crawling around in a white frock and eating flowers.\u201d</p> <p>She drew her head back, sputtering, \u201cWh-what?\u201d Was he jesting with her?</p><p>Yes, his eyes gleamed with amusement. While she was fearing for her life\u2014and threatening his\u2014he acted as if he\u2019d just stumbled upon a new playmate.</p><p>One he\u2019d been longing for.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sorceress?\u201d</p><p>She was so startled she found herself saying, \u201cMelanthe. Of the Deie Sorceri family.\u201d</p><p>He sounded out her name. \u201cMel-anth-ee.\u201d Then he pressed his hand over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m Thronos Talos, Prince of the Skye.\u201d His tone was filled with importance.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of you,\u201d she said, casting a glance over her shoulder toward the abbey. If Sabine caught this boy here with Lanthe, her overprotective big sister would kill him with her fantastical powers.</p><p>Lanthe didn\u2019t like things to be killed, not even handsome Vrekeners.</p><p>As the Queen of Illusions, Sabine could make her victims see anything she chose, changing the appearance of their surroundings. She could also reach into a person\u2019s mind, draw forth his worst nightmare, then present it to him.</p><p>Unlike Lanthe, Sabine never hesitated to use her powers. . . .</p><p>\u201cIs that where you live?\u201d the Vrekener asked, interrupting her thoughts. Was he following her gaze to the mountaintop?</p><p>\u201cNo! Not at all. We live far away from here. I walk leagues to get to this meadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He clearly disbelieved her, but didn\u2019t seem angered by her lie. \u201cStrange that I sense sorcery from that direction. Lots of it.\u201d</p><p>Vrekeners tracked Sorceri by scent\u2014and by power outlays. Lanthe would have to get her parents to use more caution. Or try to. They were consumed with creating ever more gold. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He let it go. \u201cSo what\u2019s persuasion?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her palms, startled to see how much sorcery she wielded. Did she really mean to hurt him? He didn\u2019t seem as threatening anymore.</p><p>Pursing her lips, she called back her power. \u201cI can make anyone do anything I tell them to do. It\u2019s called persuasion, but it should be called commanding.\u201d</p><p>Years ago, when she\u2019d first used it, she\u2019d crossly told Sabine to shut her mouth. For an entire week, no one had understood why Sabine hadn\u2019t been able to open it. Her sister had almost starved.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds impressive, lamb. So you\u2019re as powerful as you are pretty?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated. He thought she was pretty? She gazed down at her frayed dress. Though faded nearly white from repeated washing, it used to have color. Sorceri loved color. Her feet were bare because she\u2019d outgrown her boots. She didn\u2019t feel very pretty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you get called beautiful all the time,\u201d he said confidently.</p><p>No. She didn\u2019t. She rarely encountered anyone besides her family. If Sabine complimented her, she\u2019d remark on Lanthe\u2019s ability, not her looks. And sometimes her parents didn\u2019t seem to see her at all\u2014</p><p>The boy started striding toward her.</p><p>\u201cWait, wh-what are you doing?\u201d She tripped back until she met a tree.</p><p>\u201cJust making certain of something.\u201d He leaned his face in close to her hair, and then he . . . he scented her! When he drew back, he wore a cocky grin, as if he\u2019d just won a prize or discovered a new realm.</p><p>For some reason, that grin made her feel as if she\u2019d run all the way up the mountain. Her heart pounded, and she couldn\u2019t seem to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like sky. And home.\u201d He said this as if it was significant\u2014a weighty and undeniable truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Gods, this boy confused her.</p><p>\u201cTo me, you smell like no one else in the world ever has, or ever will.\u201d His gray irises glowed silver with emotion. A breeze ruffled his sandy brown hair. \u201cIt means you and I are going to be best friends. When we grow up, we\u2019ll be . . . more.\u201d</p><p>She focused on the words best friends, and ached with yearning. She\u2019d always wanted a friend! She loved Sabine, but her sister was twelve and usually had grown-up stuff on her mind, like how to get warm clothing for the coming winter, or enough food to feed four.</p><p>Lanthe supposed someone had to be concerned with those things\u2014since their parents were always preoccupied. When Lanthe had been a baby, she\u2019d called for Ai-bee over their own mother.</p><p>But Lanthe could never be best friends with a Vrekener, despite how intriguing she found him. \u201cYou should go, Thronos Talos,\u201d she said, just as her stomach growled, embarrassing her and deepening his amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou might be a great and terrible sorceress, but you can\u2019t eat sorcery, can you?\u201d He spread those spellbinding wings. \u201cWill you stay here if I go find food for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders went back, his silvery eyes alight\u2014as if with pride. \u201cThat\u2019s my job now, lamb.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re enemies. We\u2019re not supposed to be like\u201d\u2014she waved from herself to him\u2014\u201cthis.\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Four months later</p><p>Thronos . . . told.</p><p>And then Lanthe made him pay for it.</p><p>\u201cSorceri are licentious, gambling, paranoid hedonists; their love of wine-swilling and carousing is matched only by their delight in thievery. For Sorceri powers to go unchecked would be disastrous.\u201d</p><p>\u2014THRONOS TALOS, KNIGHT OF RECKONING, HEIR TO THE SKYE</p><p>\u201cMeaningless sex is like eating the worm at the bottom of a tequila bottle: fun in the moment, but not something you\u2019d want to repeat over and over.\u201d</p><p>\u2014MELANTHE OF THE DEIE SORCERI, QUEEN OF PERSUASION</p><p>ONE</p><p>An island, somewhere in the Pacific Ocean</p><p>MODERN TIMES</p><p>As Lanthe sprinted down a shaking, smoky tunnel, she focused on her friends ahead: Carrow, a witch, and Carrow\u2019s newly adopted daughter, Ruby. The witch was holding the seven-year-old girl in her arms as she ran headlong for an exit out of this godsforsaken maze.</p><p>Lanthe followed, gripping her sword with a gauntleted hand, her metal claws digging into the handle. She tried to smile for Ruby, who was frowning back at her.</p><p>Carrow\u2014or Crow, as Ruby called her\u2014and Lanthe had attempted to turn their dire escape into a fun-filled adventure for her. Snarky and adorable Ruby clearly wasn\u2019t sold.</p><p>Charging into the tunnels had seemed like such a good idea at the time, a way out of the Order prison they\u2019d all been jailed in\u2014and an escape from other immortals. After tonight\u2019s cataclysmic overthrow, Loreans stalked the fiery halls, hunting for prey. Carrow\u2019s estranged husband, who might or might not be evil, hunted for her.</p><p>Another quake rocked the tunnel, grit raining down over Lanthe\u2019s black braids. Unfortunately, Lanthe had her own stalker\u2014Thronos, a crazed, winged warlord who\u2019d been obsessed with capturing her for the last five hundred years.</p><p>But Vrekeners feared enclosed spaces; anything underground was a forbidding landscape, much less a failing tunnel. He\u2019d never follow her into this subterranean maze.</p><p>Explosions sounded somewhere in the distance, and the tunnel rumbled. Seemed like such a good idea. She gazed up, saw the immense ceiling supports bowed from strain. No wonder. New mountains were sprouting from the earth all over this prison island, courtesy of Lanthe\u2019s fellow Sorceri.</p><p>A boulder dropped in her path, slowing her progress. Rock dust wafted over her like a grainy curtain, spattering her face and Sorceri mask. Carrow and Ruby grew indistinct in the haze. The two turned a corner, out of sight.</p><p>As Lanthe increased her speed, she gave a frustrated yank on her torque, a treat from the humans for all their immortal captives. The indestructible collar prevented them from using their innate abilities, neutralizing strength, endurance, and healing.</p><p>Some of the prisoners\u2014all of the most evil ones\u2014had had theirs removed this night. Lanthe still wore one, which wasn\u2019t fair, since few would consider her \u201cgood.\u201d</p><p>Without that torque, she would have been able to command stronger beings to protect her and her friends. She would have been able to read an opponent\u2019s mind, run with supernatural speed, or create a portal to step through\u2014away from this island nightmare forever.</p><p>Away from Thronos.</p><p>Lanthe hiked up her metal breastplate\u2014not ideal for running for one\u2019s life. Nor were her metal mesh skirt and thigh-high stiletto boots. Still she sped forward, wishing her thoughts would stop returning to her age-old foe.</p><p>During their captivity, she\u2019d had the shock of her life when guards had dragged Thronos by their cell. He\u2019d let himself be seized by the Order and taken to her prison\u2014Lanthe knew it. With malice in his eyes, he\u2019d grated to her, \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>When Carrow had asked about that, Lanthe had been sparing of the details: \u201cWould you believe that Thronos and I were childhood friends?\u201d</p><p>Later, Carrow had pressed, so Lanthe had admitted, \u201cHe\u2019s broken because of me. I \u2018persuaded\u2019 him to dive from a great height. And not to use his wings.\u201d Most of his skin had been slashed and scarred, the bones of his wings and limbs fractured\u2014before his immortality had taken hold, before he could regenerate.</p><p>What more could Lanthe say? How to explain the bond she and Thronos had shared? Until he\u2019d betrayed her fragile trust . . .</p><p>Well, Carrow, Thronos led his clan to my family\u2019s secret lair one night. His father killed my parents, lopped their heads right off with a Vrekener fire scythe. My fierce sister Sabine retaliated, taking the father\u2019s life. When she was nearly murdered, I gave Thronos wounds that would last an eternal lifetime, then left him to die.</p><p>Alas, since then, things have gone downhill.</p><p>\u201cAir\u2019s getting fresher!\u201d Carrow called from somewhere ahead. \u201cAlmost there!\u201d</p><p>At last, the smoke was clearing. Which meant Lanthe needed to catch up. Who knew what could be awaiting them out in the night? Thousands of immortals had escaped.</p><p>Had this many enemies ever been so concentrated in one inescapable place?</p><p>She readied her sword. A vague memory arose of holding her first one. Mother had absently handed each of her daughters a golden sword, telling them, \u201cNever depend solely on your powers. If you and your sister want to survive to adulthood, you\u2019d best get handy with one of these. . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now Lanthe kept her weapon poised for\u2014</p><p>Pain on her ankle?</p><p>Body reeling forward?</p> <p>One second Lanthe had been sprinting; the next she was on her face, sword tumbling in front of her. Something had her! Claws sank into her ankle, piercing the leather of her boot. She screamed and thrashed, but it hauled her back.</p><p>Ghoul? Demon? Wendigo? She stabbed her metal claws into the ground, scrabbling for purchase, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>Her own nightmare.</p><p>Thronos.</p><p>His scarred face was bloodied, his towering body tensed. A maniacal glint shone in his gray eyes as his wings unfurled\u2014they seemed to flicker in the dim tunnel. A trick of light.</p> <p>The bastard had actually braved an underground shaft. Vrekeners never abandon their hunt.</p><p>\u201cRelease me, you dick!\u201d She kicked out with more force, but she was no match for his strength. Wait, why didn\u2019t he have a collar? Thronos was akin to an angel, a warrior for right.</p><p>She knew he\u2019d become a warlord. Had he turned evil over these centuries?</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Thronos!\u201d Carrow yelled, charging. She\u2019d parked Ruby somewhere, returning to take on a Vrekener.</p><p>For Lanthe. I knew I liked that witch.</p><p>Before she could reach Lanthe, Thronos had used one of his wings to send Carrow sprawling. The witch scrambled up again, drawing her own sword.</p> <p>Lanthe continued to thrash, filled with dread. Thronos was too strong; like Lanthe, Carrow still had her collar.</p><p>When the witch charged again, a wing flashed out once more, but Carrow anticipated the move, hunching down to slide under it. She shoved her sword up, piercing the wing, leaving her weapon to hang like a giant splinter.</p><p>He gave a yell, releasing Lanthe to pluck the sword free. Blood poured from him, pooling in the gravel.</p><p>Carrow lunged for Lanthe, snaring her hand. Before she could get Lanthe up and running, Thronos seized Lanthe\u2019s leg again, wrenching her back\u2014but Carrow and Lanthe kept their hands locked.</p><p>It was a losing proposition. Ruby was vulnerable without Carrow. And for all the grief, heartache, and pain Thronos and his kind had dished out to Lanthe over the years, she didn\u2019t believe he could murder her in cold blood.</p><p>She chanced another look back. No matter how much he\u2019d looked like he was about to.</p><p>His blood-splattered face was as grim as a reaper\u2019s, his lips thinned, his scars whitening. The age-old question arose: did he want to abduct her or kill her? Or abduct her to torture then kill?</p><p>No, no, he couldn\u2019t hurt her; Lanthe was his fated mate. Hurting her would hurt him.</p> <p>The tunnel quaked again. In the distance, Ruby called, \u201cCrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave Ruby!\u201d Lanthe cried. Smoke thickened, rubble building around them.</p><p>Carrow shook her head, digging in determinedly. \u201cI\u2019ll save you both.\u201d</p><p>In a deafening rush, rocks began to tumble down from the ceiling, filling the space between Carrow and Ruby.</p><p>Ruby screamed, \u201cCrow! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Carrow screamed back, \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your girl!\u201d Lanthe yanked her hand free, allowing Thronos to haul her away. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay!\u201d</p><p>Carrow\u2019s stricken face disappeared as he dragged Lanthe into the smoke.</p><p>After three weeks of imprisonment at the hands of vile humans, Lanthe had been caught again\u2014by something she hated even more than mortals who enjoyed vivisecting their captives. \u201cLet me go, Thronos!\u201d Her body lurched with each of his limping steps.</p><p>Almost at once, he veered into a smaller off-shoot tunnel that she hadn\u2019t seen when speeding past it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going the wrong way!\u201d She dug her metal claws in, raking furrows into the ground. When a cloud of gravel erupted in front of her face, she coughed up grit. \u201cDamn it, Thronos, turn back!\u201d Blood continued to pour from his wing, leaving a trail beside Lanthe\u2019s furrows. \u201cWe were almost at an exit before!\u201d</p><p>She and Carrow had been hoping to reach the shore. Now he seemed to be ascending. Leave it to a Vrekener to make for the high ground.</p><p>\u201cCenturies I\u2019ve waited for this,\u201d he grated, never loosening his viselike grip around her ankle.</p><p>Another quake rocked the tunnel. When a boulder crashed down beside her, she stopped clawing with her gauntlets, instead crying, \u201cFaster, idiot!\u201d</p><p>As if she weighed nothing, he yanked her up from the ground and into his arms in one fluid move. He\u2019d grown taller than any Vrekener she\u2019d ever seen. He must be nearing seven feet in height, looming over her five and a half feet. With his gaze boring into hers, he squeezed her against his chest.</p><p>His hair\u2014too light to be black, too dark to be brown\u2014was streaked with ash, the matte gray matching his eyes. But as he beheld her, his irises turned to that brilliant silver\u2014like lightning. Like his ghostly wings.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d she yelled, slashing at him with her claws.</p><p>He dropped her to her feet\u2014just to shove her against the wall. With his rigid body pressed against her, he leaned in, tilting his head creepily.</p><p>Was he going to kiss her? \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d She moved to strike him again, but he pinned her wrists above her head.</p><p>A heartbeat later, he took her mouth, dumbfounding her. He slanted his lips more aggressively, burning away her shock.</p><p>She bit his bottom lip. He kept going. She bit harder.</p><p>He squeezed her wrists until she thought he would snap her bones. She released him, and he finally drew back, smirking with bloody fangs.</p><p>\u201cNow it begins.\u201d With his free hand, he swiped his fingers over his bloody mouth, then reached to smear her lips with crimson.</p><p>She jerked her head away. Dear gods, he\u2019s been maddened.</p><p>Another quake; more rocks joined that huge boulder, blocking the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cJust brilliant!\u201d She was trapped with Thronos, her survival tied to his. She gazed back at those rocks. Had her friends made it out alive?</p><p>Reading her worry, he sneered, \u201cI\u2019d be more concerned about your fate.\u201d She faced her enemy with dread. \u201cWhich has at last been sealed. . . .\u201d</p><p>TWO</p><p>I have her. Thronos just stopped himself from roaring with triumph. I bloody have her.</p><p>With her wrists still pinned, he ripped her mask away, his gaze taking in her face. Her wide blue eyes were stark against her soot-marked skin. Dust coated the wild, raven braids that tangled about her cheeks and neck. His blood painted her plump lips. Even in this state, she was still the most alluring creature he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>And the most treacherous.</p><p>He tore his gaze away, focusing on their survival. This ungodsly tunnel would fail soon. Out in the night, dangers would lurk in every shadow. Most species on this island hated his kind.</p><p>He released Melanthe\u2019s hands, just to yank her back into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>Earlier, Thronos had scented saltwater and rain-steeped air\u2014must be an exit from this maze. With her trembling body squeezed against his chest, he began running/limping in that direction, blocking out the grueling pain in his lower right leg.</p><p>Pain from just one of the injuries she\u2019d given him.</p><p>Get her to safety; refrain from murdering her.</p><p>In a short while, the smoke started to thin. Fewer rocks fell.</p><p>Melanthe peered around her. \u201cIt\u2019s clearing! Faster, Thronos!\u201d</p><p>Instead he stopped dead in his tracks, kicking up gravel. He\u2019d caught a scent. Can\u2019t be right.</p><p>When he set her to her feet, she demanded, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? The way back is blocked; we\u2019re almost out!\u201d</p><p>But the threat was already in.</p><p>\u201cIs something coming? Tell me!\u201d Her sense of smell wasn\u2019t nearly as keen as his.</p><p>An eerie howl echoed down the tunnel. Others joined it.</p><p>\u201cAre those ghouls?\u201d she asked, a quaver in her voice.</p><p>Even immortals beware their bite. The mindless beasts grew their numbers by contagion. A single bite or scratch . . .</p><p>The ground vibrated from their approaching footfalls. Must be hundreds of them.</p><p>He would have to fight a swarm of ghouls\u2014underground. Did Lanthe comprehend the danger they faced? Had he captured his prize only to lose it?</p><p>Never. He shoved her behind him, flaring his wings.</p><p>\u201cYou brought me this way! You\u2019ve doomed us.\u201d Oh, yes, she understood the danger. To herself, she muttered, \u201cI was so close to escape. As usual, Thronos ruins my plans. My life.\u201d She snapped at him, \u201cMy EVERYTHING!\u201d</p><p>He swung his head around, baring his fangs. \u201cSilence, creature!\u201d His old familiar wrath blistered him inside\u2014the wrath that sometimes made him wonder if he mightn\u2019t just kill her and spare himself this misery.</p><p>Melanthe is misery. He knew this well.</p><p>\u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve just wanted to be left alone,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut you keep hunting me . . .\u201d She trailed off when an eerie green light began to illuminate the shaft. The glow of the ghouls\u2019 skin as they neared.</p><p>From behind him, she said, \u201cI wish to the gods that I\u2019d never met you.\u201d</p><p>With all his heart, he told her, \u201cMutual.\u201d</p><p>There was no way she and Thronos could get past this throng without a single contagious injury.</p><p>Though he was now a battle-tested warlord, attacking hotbeds of Pravus in between his searches for her, he was weaponless, about to fight in his least advantageous surroundings. Lanthe\u2019s powers were neutralized; she didn\u2019t even have her sword. She splayed her fingers out of habit\u2014to wield sorcery she couldn\u2019t tap\u2014and awaited an unstoppable attack.</p><p>In these seconds, she swept her gaze over Thronos, as she hadn\u2019t been able to do for years.</p><p>He had on dark boots and broken-in black leather pants that molded to his muscular legs. His white linen shirt had cutouts in the back\u2014they buttoned above and below the roots of his wings. The humans must have taken his customary trench coat.</p><p>She glanced up at his silvery horns. Though many demons had two, Vrekeners usually sported four. But two of Thronos\u2019s had been removed\u2014probably because of how damaged they\u2019d been in his \u201cfall.\u201d The remaining pair were larger than normal, curving around the sides of his head like those of a Volar demon.</p><p>He lowered his hands, his black claws curling past his fingertips. As all the muscles in his body tensed for combat, he brought his wings close to his sides. The top joints were so gnarled, she could almost hear their movements catching and grinding.</p><p>When he was young, he\u2019d been able to pin his wings down along his back, until they were undetectable under a coat. Now, because of his injuries, those flares jutted by his sides.</p><p>His formerly black wing talons had been \u201csilvered\u201d once he\u2019d become a knight\u2014honed, smoothed, and sharpened until they\u2019d turned color.</p><p>Few of her kind ever got close enough to a Vrekener to know what those wings truly looked like; well, at least not the Sorceri who\u2019d lived to tell about it. She remembered how startled she\u2019d been to discover what covered the backs\u2014</p><p>One bloodcurdling howl sounded from ahead. A ghoul battle charge?</p><p>A tidal wave of contagious, vicious killers flooded toward them, their watery yellow eyes burning with rage. They climbed the walls, scrabbling over each other to reach their prey.</p><p>The ghouls were fifty feet away. Forty.</p><p>Thronos\u2019s wings rippled, as if with eagerness. Lanthe\u2019s last sight on earth might be a Vrekener\u2019s wings. Not a big surprise.</p><p>Thirty feet away. Twenty . . . then . . . striking distance.</p><p>One of his wings flashed out, then the other.</p><p>Beheaded ghouls dropped in place. More than a dozen gaping necks pumped their blood, a syrupy green goo.</p><p>Her lips parted. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d The silver talons of Thronos\u2019s wings dripped green; they\u2019d sliced through throats like a razor blade.</p><p>Like his father\u2019s fire scythe.</p><p>Eyes wide, she sidled along the wall to get a better look at him. She hadn\u2019t known Thronos was that fast\u2014or that his wings were so deadly.</p><p>The scent of ghoul blood fouled the air and made the next line of them hesitate. Never ceasing their wails, they stared down at the twitching bodies of their kind, then up at Thronos, confusion on their faces.</p><p>When another wave decided to shoot forward, he used his wings again. Goo splashed the walls, striping the fallen bodies. A pool of green seeped toward her and Thronos.</p><p>His wings moved so fast she could barely see them, could only feel their backdrafts over her face. Headless bodies piled up, and Lanthe felt . . . hope.</p><p>Back when she\u2019d allied with the Pravus Army, Lanthe had observed soldiers sparring\u2014vampires, centaurs, fire demons, and more. They\u2019d always grunted and yelled when they struck. Thronos was eerily silent. One male against a horde of baying monsters.</p><p>Gods, he was strong.</p><p>Technically he was a demon angel\u2014though Vrekeners vehemently denied any demon blood in their line. Right now, he looked seriously demonic. Watching him like this, she realized that in their confrontations over the last few centuries, Thronos had been pulling his punches.</p><p>He might not have wanted to kill his mate, but he could\u2019ve taken out Lanthe\u2019s protector, her sister Sabine. Yet he hadn\u2019t. Earlier, Thronos could\u2019ve killed Carrow without a thought. Instead, he\u2019d spared her life. Why?</p><p>As the bodies accumulated and poisonous blood crept toward her boots, Lanthe grew queasy. A quake sent her stumbling against the rock wall. The force shuffled the mound of ghouls, sifting corpses. The sheer number of slain was mind-boggling.</p><p>When his next strike felled yet another line of them, no more advanced around the corner. They sounded as if they lay in wait outside the tunnel.</p><p>Thronos turned to her, broad chest heaving, his grave face covered in grit and sweat. His collar-length hair was damp, whipping over his cheeks.</p><p>She grudgingly admitted that he looked . . . magnificent. For so long, she\u2019d focused on his scars, his weaknesses. She\u2019d underestimated this male. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grated one word: \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>One of Lanthe\u2019s favorite mottos was the simplest\u2014when in trouble, leave.</p><p>Seeing no other choice, she crossed to him. He lifted her into his arms, one looping around her waist, the other coiling around her neck.</p> <p>Unbidden, memories of her childhood arose, when his expressions had been open, his words kind to her. When he\u2019d nicknamed her and taught her to swim.</p><p>He\u2019d been a fascinating mix of cocky and vulnerable; one minute he\u2019d be flashing a teasing grin, the next his cheeks would heat with a blush. . . .</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>She could only nod and comply.</p><p>He booted bodies away, then took off in a limping sprint. She knew what he planned. To evade the ghouls just outside the mine, Thronos would run to the very edge, then leap into flight.</p> <p>He\u2019d taken her into the sky before\u2014when she\u2019d been a girl who\u2019d trusted him utterly. Years later, she\u2019d witnessed a Vrekener fly Sabine to a great height, just for the pleasure of dropping her to a cobblestone street below.</p><p>Sabine\u2019s head had cracked open like an egg, but somehow Lanthe\u2019s sorcery had wrenched her from the jaws of death.</p><p>Ever since then, Lanthe had had nightmares about flying.</p><p>Could Thronos even carry her? According to rumor, he suffered inconceivable pain whenever he flew, his twisted wings not working right on the best of days; surely they were exhausted from beheading scores of foes. The left one still bled from Carrow\u2019s sword.</p><p>Tightening her arms around him, her metal claws digging into his skin, Lanthe squeezed her eyes shut\u2014which only increased her awareness of him.</p><p>His heartbeat thundering as he ran.</p> <p>The rippling of his surprisingly large muscles.</p><p>His breaths in her ear as he clutched her close, like a coveted treasure.</p><p>She had no warning before he shoved his legs down, swooping his great wings. Her stomach dropped when they shot into the sky.</p><p>As raindrops hit her uncovered skin like bullets, she peeked down; ghouls leapt for them, but Thronos had flown too high to be reached.</p><p>So high. The ground grew smaller . . . smaller . . .</p><p>\u201cAh, gods.\u201d I\u2019m going to vomit.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Free of the tunnel!</p> <p>Thronos sucked in breaths of fresh air as he ascended. At last, they\u2019d emerged from smoke and offal to clean rain and gusting ocean breezes.</p><p>Struggling to ignore the agony flying always brought him, he outlined his plan. Focus: survival, escape, then revenge.</p><p>On the other side of the island, he had the means to leave this place, but reaching that distant coast wouldn\u2019t be easy, not with so many bloodthirsty foes in play.</p><p>There were winged Volar demons who would attack in the air as a pack. Sorceri could wield their powers from the ground. Even in this rain, fire demons could launch their flames, grenades that seared flesh away like acid. The mortals of the Order would likely send ground reinforcements\u2014or air strikes.</p><p>Now Thronos would have to elude any threat, yet already his wings screamed with pain\u2014both old and new. His bones grated on each other like cogs with no notches, the muscles knotted around the joints. He avoided flying whenever possible, but saw no way around it; the ground was a free-for-all.</p><p>All across the landscape, Vertas allies lay beheaded or wounded. Cerunnos slithered after fey; vampires took down members of the good demonarchies. The Pravus were wiping them all out.</p><p>Just as they had the mortals.</p><p>For all his life, Thronos had been a sword for right. But not tonight. No matter how badly he craved to fight alongside his allies, he wouldn\u2019t jeopardize his catch.</p><p>It struck him again: By the gods, I have her.</p><p>He adjusted his grip, inhaling sharply from the feel of her against him. He hadn\u2019t held her since they\u2019d been innocent children. Despite his excruciating pain, his thoughts were anything but innocent.</p><p>Most of her curvaceous figure was on display in her shameless Sorceri garb. Aside from her gauntlets, she wore only a metal breastplate and a minuscule skirt configured of mesh and strips of leather. When he\u2019d dragged her through the tunnel, it\u2019d ridden up to reveal a shockingly small black thong and the flawless curves of her ass. . . .</p><p>Now the molded cups of her breastplate pressed against him. Her waist and hips were so damned womanly, eliciting lust.</p><p>This was the body he should have been enjoying for the last five hundred years. The body that should have given him offspring ten times over. Wrath welling.</p><p>\u201cTake me down!\u201d she suddenly screeched.</p><p>\u201cYou want down? I should open my arms\u2014let you feel what it\u2019s like to plummet!\u201d As I learned from you.</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t drop me!\u201d She was shaking against him. Her claws dug in deeper, tiny hooks in his flesh. More pain to put with the rest of it. \u201cIs that your plan? To torture me before you kill me?\u201d</p><p>Kill her? \u201cIf I wanted you dead, you would be so.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head from his chest. Her rain-dampened face was drawn, her plump bottom lip quivering. Amidst her panic, she seemed to be taking his measure, determining whether he was telling the truth. \u201cBut torture\u2019s still on the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>When he sensed an air current and abruptly dipped to catch it, she cried, \u201cTake me to the ground, or I\u2019ll vomit!\u201d</p><p>Thronos knew she would stop at nothing to get free. But to act as if she would be sick? She used to love it when he took her into the air, would laugh with delight. He\u2019d flown with her often, back when he\u2019d been addicted to the sound of her laughter.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this height, Thronos! I swear to gold.\u201d</p><p>They were only a few hundred feet in the air. Yet her vow to gold gave him pause. She would consider it as sacred as a vow made to the Lore.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods.\u201d A second later, she heaved, throwing up a concoction of gruel, water, and dirt on his shirt.</p><p>A growl sounded from his chest; hers heaved once more.</p><p>If his arms hadn\u2019t been full, Thronos would have pinched his brow in disbelief. Not only did his fated, eternal mate have no wings, she now suffered from a fear of heights.</p><p>Yet another way the wicked sorceress was all wrong for him. In addition to the fact that she despised him as much as he despised her, Melanthe was a light-skirted liar and thief who\u2019d proved malicious to the bone.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t always been that way. He remembered her as a sensitive girl\u2014though already mischievous.</p><p>He spotted a grassy plateau, high above the ocean. No creatures in sight. He descended, landing without particular care.</p><p>When he released Melanthe, her right leg stepped left, then her left leg stepped right. He predicted her fall and readily allowed it. When she landed on her knees, she heaved again.</p><p>Exhaling with impatience, he used the time to wipe away her sick from his shirt and check himself for ghoul wounds.</p><p>No marks.</p><p>From her spot on the ground, Melanthe said, \u201cI thought Vrekeners were supposed to keep the Lore hush-hush from humans. If so, bang-up job you\u2019re doing!\u201d</p><p>Since memory, Vrekeners had been tasked with stamping out evil in the Lore\u2014and with hiding its existence, punishing anyone who threatened the immortals\u2019 secret.</p><p>Yet all the while, this human enclave had kept its acquisitive gaze on Loreans.</p><p>Getting captured by them had been as easy as Thronos had expected.</p><p>Melanthe eyed him. \u201cIf all the good immortals still have their collars, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe better question: How could you possibly have retained yours?\u201d</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Lanthe swiped the back of her forearm over her mouth. \u201cI wondered that myself.\u201d</p><p>Earlier, Lanthe, Carrow, Ruby, and two other Sorceri had been whiling away time in their cell, awaiting their turn at vivisection, when suddenly they\u2019d felt a presence; a sorceress of colossal power had descended on this island, La Dorada the Queen of Evil.</p><p>That female had liberated all the evil beings, popping their collars off\u2014members of the Pravus like Lanthe\u2019s cellmate, Portia the Queen of Stone.</p><p>Portia had used her goddesslike control over rock of any kind to raise mountains up through the center of the prison. The force had crushed the thick metal cell walls like tin cans.</p><p>Her accomplice, Emberine the Queen of Flames, had lit the place up like an inferno. Immortals had flooded out, overpowering the Order\u2019s various defenses.</p><p>Then . . . pande-fucking-monium.</p><p>Humans\u2014and collared Loreans\u2014had been gutted, drained of blood, infected by ghouls or Wendigos, raped to death by succubae, or eaten by any number of creatures.</p><p>The Queen of Evil, a freaking fellow Sorceri, had left Lanthe helpless in the midst of that chaos. Real solidarity there, Dorada. And yet she\u2019d freed Thronos, a Vrekener? He was a \u201cknight of reckoning,\u201d the equivalent of a Lore sheriff.</p><p>Lanthe raised her face to the rain, collecting a mouthful to rinse. Then she turned to him. \u201cMaybe you lost your collar because you\u2019ve become evil over all these centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe my mind was filled with evil imaginings.\u201d Another flash of his fangs. \u201cYou have that effect on me.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe worked her way to her feet, swaying dizzily. He\u2019d dropped them onto a sliver of land, hundreds of feet above the ground. From this unsettling vantage, she scanned the night. Though a Sorceri\u2019s night vision wasn\u2019t as acute as most immortals\u2019, she could see a good deal of the island, even in the darkness.</p><p>Skirmishes were breaking out all over, and the Pravus were dominating. The island teemed with them. She didn\u2019t remember this many Pravus in the cells. She\u2019d bet that alliance was teleporting reinforcements here to pick off the helpless, collared Vertas.</p><p>Like me. A year ago, she and Sabine had switched sides, helping King Rydstrom the Good reclaim his kingdom of Rothkalina.</p><p>Prior to that, the sisters had been all Pravus, all the time. Once Lanthe got free of Thronos, maybe she could try to slide back to her former alliance, at least until Sabine came and saved her.</p><p>Her big sister must be worried sick over her weeks-long disappearance. Before leaving their home to hunt for a new boyfriend, Lanthe had left her a note that merely read: Out getting some strange, XOXO.</p><p>In fact, Lanthe was surprised Sabine hadn\u2019t found her by now. She always had in the past. They\u2019d never been separated for this long\u2014</p><p>Her eyes widened. From this height, she\u2019d spied Carrow, Ruby, and Carrow\u2019s new vemon husband, Malkom Slaine. Though that vampire/demon was one of the deadliest, most fearsome beings in the Lore, he appeared to be shepherding them to safety.</p><p>Guess he decided against killing Carrow.</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s heart leapt to see them safe, and she drew a breath to call for them, but Thronos slapped his calloused hand over her mouth.</p><p>She kicked back with her boots, struggling against him; he held her with minimal effort. He waited until Carrow was out of earshot before releasing Lanthe.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to worry about me!\u201d She strained to keep them in sight.</p><p>\u201cGood. If the witch is foolish enough to care about someone like you, she deserves woe.\u201d</p><p>Someone like me. \u201cSpeaking from experience?\u201d She whirled around on him, eye level with his chest. The wet linen of his shirt clung to his muscles, draping over his pecs, showing hints of the scars beneath.</p><p>Why haven\u2019t I ever noticed his muscles are so defined? Probably because each time she\u2019d seen him, she\u2019d been running for her life.</p><p>She craned her head up to peer at his face, at the raised scars there. All caused by me. A deep one twisted along his chiseled jawline, while four shorter ones slashed diagonally down his cheeks, like Celtic war paint.</p><p>Once a body became immortal, it was unchangeable for the most part. Though a Lorean like him could buy a glamour from the witches to camouflage those marks, he would always have them.</p><p>Despite his scars, females would still find him handsome. Very much so.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d he snapped, seeming disturbed by the perusal. But then, he seemed disturbed in general.</p><p>\u201cMy lifetime enemy.\u201d She\u2019d spent that long constantly fleeing Vrekeners. Now she was trapped with the object of her fears. Not exactly helping her Vrekener PTSD.</p><p>But she\u2019d escape sooner or later; she always did.</p><p>And then he\u2019d just come after her again, as he always did. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got me, Thronos. Now what happens?\u201d</p><p>She thought she saw a flicker of shock in his eyes, as if he could barely accept his success after so long.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m going to get us off this island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? It\u2019s thousands of miles from land, surrounded by shark-infested waters.\u201d The humans had been prepared to prevent escape. Well, prepared for everything except a really piqued La Dorada. \u201cYou can\u2019t fly that distance.\u201d</p><p>Though he\u2019d tried to hide it, she\u2019d seen his pain from just a short jaunt\u2014his face had grown drawn and waxen, his lips a thin line.</p><p>Considering that others of his kind could fly hundreds, if not thousands, of miles at a time, she wondered what his limit was. \u201cEspecially not with me in tow.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he was biting down rage\u2014as if just the sound of her voice was setting him off. \u201cI have other means of escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Listen, there\u2019s a key to my torque down there.\u201d Of sorts.</p><p>Each collar was locked and unlocked with the thumbprint of the warden, a troll named Fegley (not literally a troll). When Lanthe and company had stumbled across the trapped warden, Lanthe had cut off his hand for ease of use. But before Lanthe could free herself, Emberine had stolen the grubby thing and incinerated the rest of Fegley!</p><p>Which had forced Lanthe and her friends to hit the tunnels. . . .</p><p>\u201cIf you help me get this collar off,\u201d she told Thronos, \u201cI could create a portal to wherever you want.\u201d Or she could command him to repeatedly stab himself in the dick. Then she\u2019d run away as fast as she could manage\u2014seeing as she would be laughing really hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was assuming her sporadic persuasion worked, but she was hopeful; after all, she\u2019d been storing up a lot of it over the last three weeks.</p><p>Thronos pinned her gaze with his own frenzied one. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear that collar for the rest of your immortal life. That you retain it is a stroke of fortune.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was serious. Which meant she had to get away from him and find that hand. \u201cYou always wanted me biddable, didn\u2019t you? Like Vrekener females?\u201d Lanthe had heard they never laughed, drank, danced, or sang, and always wore drab, full-coverage clothing.</p> <p>A world away from merry, hedonistic Sorceri females with their racy metal garments, brightly colored masks, and bold makeup.</p><p>And, horror of horrors\u2014Vrekeners disdained the wearing of gold. For a gold-worshipping sorceress like Lanthe, this was blasphemy. \u201cYou always wished I\u2019d been born meek and powerless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well have been powerless. Over these centuries, you could hardly use your abilities\u2014even without the collar.\u201d</p><p>Burn. Worse, he was right. Though persuasion was her root power\u2014the one she\u2019d been born with, akin to her soul\u2014she\u2019d almost extinguished it by healing her sister from repeated Vrekener attacks.</p><p>Each time the winged menace found them, Sabine would charge into danger. Each time, Lanthe would clean up the damage, commanding Sabine\u2019s body to mend itself.</p> <p>Lanthe\u2019s ruined power was well-known. While Sorceri had stolen other abilities from her, there\u2019d been no takers on her defective soul.</p><p>\u201cLook at your glittering eyes. Sensitive about this, creature?\u201d</p><p>She reminded herself that she had managed a few spurts of persuasion in emergency situations. On one night, the stars had aligned, and she\u2019d rendered Omort\u2014a nearly omnipotent sorcerer\u2014temporarily powerless.</p><p>Long enough for the demon King Rydstrom the Good to fight and kill him. Without Lanthe\u2019s help, Rydstrom never could have freed all the rage demons of Rothkalina from Omort\u2019s oppression.</p><p>How badly she wished for everyone in the Lore to know about that! Then they\u2019d respect her.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, recalling another time she\u2019d conjured persuasion. \u201cI used my sorcery on you the last time we met.\u201d</p> <p>Thronos clearly didn\u2019t like to be reminded of that. A year ago, he\u2019d set a trap around one of her portals, lying in wait for her to return. When she\u2019d come upon him and his knights, she\u2019d eked out some sorcery\u2014enough for her to get through the portal.</p><p>\u201cIf you recall, I resisted your commands!\u201d</p><p>Just as she\u2019d been sealing it, he\u2019d managed to shove his boot through the door. Alas, the portal closure had severed his foot.</p><p>Because of him she\u2019d failed to rescue her sister from a perilous situation, so naturally Lanthe had kicked his foot around her room, screaming at it.</p><p>She slitted her eyes up at him. \u201cI vow to you I\u2019ll get this collar off me, and when I do, I\u2019ll demonstrate how powerful I\u2019ve gotten!\u201d The rain continued to pour; ghouls howled below. But Lanthe was too pissed to pay them any mind; she had eons of pain to vent. \u201cI\u2019ll command you to forget I ever lived!\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his clenched jaw, and those slashing scars on his cheeks whitened. \u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, demon? Every day I wish I\u2019d never been in that meadow when you flew over.\u201d</p><p>He unfurled his wings to their terrifying full length, a span of over fifteen feet. \u201cI\u2019m no demon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d You keep telling yourself that. He looked to say more, so she cut him off. \u201cEven if you manage to get me off this island, you can\u2019t just keep me. I have friends who will come for me.\u201d King Rydstrom\u2014now Lanthe\u2019s brother-in-law\u2014was ferocious about Sabine\u2019s and Lanthe\u2019s protection, vowing to slay anyone who thought to harm either sister.</p><p>He understood that without Lanthe, his beloved wife Sabine wouldn\u2019t have survived all those years, and he felt indebted to her. But Rydstrom and Sabine didn\u2019t know the truth: Lanthe had caused the Vrekeners to descend on them in the first place\u2014because she\u2019d stupidly befriended Thronos, a fact that she\u2019d never revealed to her sister.</p><p>\u201cAnd what friends would those be?\u201d Thronos grated.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of my brother-in-law Rydstrom, the ruler of Rothkalina, master of Castle Tornin?\u201d</p><p>Rydstrom had alerted the king of the Air Territories\u2014Thronos\u2019s brother\u2014of his protection. Any plot to harm either of the sisters would be considered an act of war against all rage demons. \u201cRydstrom is my protector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no fear of him. Just as I had no fear of your previous protector. Omort the Deathless.\u201d</p><p>She could only imagine what Thronos had heard about Omort. Once he\u2019d stolen Rydstrom\u2019s crown, Omort had instituted a reign of terror in Rothkalina. Though she and Sabine had resided with their brother\u2014half brother\u2014in the seized Castle Tornin, that didn\u2019t mean they\u2019d shared Omort\u2019s sickening behavior.</p><p>They would\u2019ve escaped, but he\u2019d had lethal controls in place, forever forcing them to return to him.</p><p>She remembered telling Sabine, \u201cI\u2019ll scream if he beheads another oracle.\u201d He\u2019d butchered hundreds of them, peeling their heads from their necks with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Sabine had said, sounding as blas\u00e9 as ever. \u201cTake it up with management?\u201d</p><p>Anyone who contradicted Omort was slaughtered. Or worse.</p><p>Lanthe had a brief impulse to explain to Thronos what things had really been like with Omort. To explain that she\u2019d lived in Castle Tornin under two kings\u2014and now thanked gold for her new life under Rydstrom\u2019s reign. But then she recalled that she wouldn\u2019t be around Thronos long enough to waste the effort. Not that the Vrekener would believe her anyway.</p><p>So she returned to intimidation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fear Rydstrom, then maybe you\u2019ll fear N\u00efx the Ever-Knowing.\u201d The three-thousand-year-old Valkyrie was a soothsayer, rumored to be on her way toward full-blown goddesshood. Though N\u00efx was insane\u2014seeing the future and past more clearly than the present\u2014she was steering the entire freaking Accession, that great immortal killing time.</p><p>\u201cN\u00efx, then?\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>Okay, so maybe she and Lanthe weren\u2019t tight, per se (they\u2019d scarcely spoken). But N\u00efx had been in on the plot to kill Omort, had aided Sabine, Lanthe, and Rydstrom. Rydstrom considered her a good friend. \u201cYes, the Valkyrie is one of my best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith so much practice, sorceress, I thought you\u2019d be more skilled at deception.\u201d He drew his lips back from his fangs. \u201cWho do you think told me how to find you?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe rocked on her feet\u2014either from shock or because the ground was moving again. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Lanthe should\u2019ve known better than to trust a Valkyrie!</p><p>\u201cShe would and she did. Along with some advice concerning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>His answer: a smirk.</p><p>\u201cThen you did let yourself get caught by the Order?\u201d He had to have\u2014how else could mortals have captured a male who could fly?</p><p>But then, how the hell had they taken half of these beings? She\u2019d probably been their easiest catch. When Lanthe had left Tornin, heading to the mortal realm to find a lover after her long sex drought, a woman on the street had offered her discount gold; Lanthe had followed like a slavering dog\u2014right into a trap.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big risk, based on a mad Valkyrie\u2019s word,\u201d Lanthe said.</p><p>He raked his gaze over her. \u201cMy reward is commensurate. As will be my revenge.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing her temples, Lanthe began to pace the small expanse of land, steering clear of the edges, while keeping away from Thronos\u2019s imposing presence. She\u2019d spent ages bolting at the sight of him; now this proximity was messing with her mind.</p><p>Unrelenting Vrekener attacks had affected Lanthe and Sabine in different ways. While Sabine had been left deadened to fear, Lanthe had grown chronically nervous, always expecting another surprise strike. Now her every instinct for survival was on high alert just from his nearness\u2014</p><p>The plateau suddenly split open like halves of a log chopped in two. She screamed as a gorge yawned between her and Thronos.</p><p>When the motion stilled and she could clear her vision, she saw they were on opposite sides of a brand-new chasm.</p><p>Those rising mountains were making all the earth around them shed away, like chunks from glaciers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get me killed up here!\u201d she yelled, but Thronos was already in flight.</p><p>The ground disappeared beneath her feet; before she could fall, he snatched her close as he took to the air once more.</p><p>\u201cAh, gods. This is happening. This is actually happening.\u201d She buried her face against his chest. I hate this, I hate this. . . .</p><p>\u201cYour fear of flying inconveniences me. When did this develop, sorceress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen one of your knights took Sabine high into the air\u2014then dropped her. She was fourteen.\u201d At the memory of Sabine\u2019s head exploding, Lanthe heaved again.</p><p>\u201cWhat lies are you telling now? No Vrekeners attacked your sister.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent. Was he lying? Or did he truly not know his knights had hunted her and Sabine? As prince of the Air Territories, Thronos was the Lord General of Knights, in command of their staunchest warriors.</p><p>Did some of those men have their own secret agenda?</p><p>If Thronos forced her back to his home of Skye Hall, then what was to stop those knights from pitching her over the side?</p><p>When he slowed, she cried against his shirt, \u201cYes, not so fast!\u201d</p><p>He turned in place, inhaling sharply.</p><p>Curiosity demanded that Lanthe raise her head. \u201cOh, my gold.\u201d</p><p>That new mountain jutted from the center of the prison, sloughing off the structures. Each chunk of concrete that fell was swept up to circle the peak like a tornado. Portia\u2019s work. How much she must be enjoying this!</p><p>Ember\u2019s towering flames wreathed the entire thing. The sorceress\u2019s fires burned so strong, they grew in the rain, heating the drops to steam.</p><p>They were two of the most powerful Sorceri ever born. Their abilities were in a league even with Sabine\u2019s illusions.</p><p>Part of Lanthe couldn\u2019t help but marvel, as she might at a work of art.</p><p>\u201cOffendments,\u201d Thronos hissed near her ear. The Vrekener word for wrongdoing. \u201cThis is the work of your people. Your . . . ilk. And you wonder why Vrekeners were entrusted to battle the Sorceri?\u201d</p><p>The mortals\u2019 former prison was now a picture of hell.</p><p>Thronos didn\u2019t regret the defeat of the Order\u2014he\u2019d found these humans contemptible\u2014but now a greater evil reigned. As he watched the flames climb higher, the show of Sorceri might called to him.</p><p>To vanquish it.</p><p>For now, their actions would serve as a timely reminder of what he was dealing with. Melanthe\u2019s sorcery wasn\u2019t awing, but hers was more insidious. Everything about her was. Already she was trying to sow dissension, lying about Vrekener attacks.</p><p>He turned away from the spectacle and swept forward, gritting his teeth against the pain.</p><p>\u201cI hate this, I hate this, I hate this,\u201d she chanted, her face tucked back against his chest.</p><p>He hated it too. The only Vrekener in history who despised flying\u2014and it was because of his own mate.</p><p>During those four childhood months he\u2019d spent with Melanthe, he\u2019d once encountered a crazed sorceress who\u2019d told him, \u201cMelanthe will never be what you need her to be.\u201d</p><p>At the time, Thronos had thought that he and Melanthe would prove her and everyone else wrong.</p><p>How na\u00efve he\u2019d been.</p><p>His mate couldn\u2019t be more unsuitable for him. In addition to all their history\u2014and all her offendments\u2014Melanthe was a Sorceri, a species that confounded him with their counterintuitive ways.</p><p>They covered up their faces with masks, calling it ornamentation\u2014instead of concealment. They didn\u2019t trust their own kind, had no unity. They loved to revel with other Loreans, but if they possessed something of value, they would hole up in faraway keeps like hibernating dragons. They could be brave when facing a violent enemy, yet debilitated by their fear of losing one of their precious powers.</p><p>Though Melanthe\u2019s sinister persuasion wasn\u2019t lost, it was contained\u2014a step in the right direction.</p><p>She wanted that torque off? It would ring her neck for eternity!</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going now?\u201d She was no longer shaking. Her body shuddered in his arms.</p><p>He forecasted more sorceress vomit directly. \u201cI told you. I have means to leave the island.\u201d</p><p>Thronos had information others didn\u2019t. His cell in the prison had been near a guard station, and he\u2019d heard them talking about the Order\u2019s escape plans in case of an emergency.</p><p>There were rumors of a ship on the far side of the island.</p><p>All the members of the Order were dead. No mortal would\u2019ve lived to take Thronos\u2019s ship. And even if other Loreans happened to hear of it, they wouldn\u2019t be able to cross the mountainous terrain of the inner island before he could.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect the berth to be visible from the air\u2014the Order had been clever with cloaking their structures\u2014but Thronos would be able to scent the craft\u2019s engines. Once the rain stopped pouring.</p><p>He would use the vessel to get himself and Melanthe close enough for him to fly back to the Skye. There, when he was thinking more clearly, he would decide her fate.</p><p>She\u2019d asked if he planned to kill her. Never. But that didn\u2019t mean he should honor her by making her his wife and princess.</p><p>Maybe if he could eventually teach her right from wrong, he would use her\u2014his mate and therefore his sole option\u2014to continue his line. He felt a duty to reproduce since his family had been winnowed down. Even now, he was his brother King Aristo\u2019s heir. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that would mean Thronos would have to marry Melanthe first. He couldn\u2019t even explore her body until then. The mere kiss he\u2019d taken from her was an offendment.</p><p>He peered down at her in his arms. How could he wed her after everything he\u2019d heard about her? When he didn\u2019t know the extent of her involvement in the atrocities under Omort\u2019s reign?</p><p>He remembered Aristo telling him centuries ago, \u201cYour mate and her sister have allied with their brother Omort the Deathless, leader of the Pravus. Reports filter out from their hold. Thronos, what their family is doing . . . it\u2019s beyond appalling.\u201d</p> <p>Incest, blood orgies, child sacrifices.</p><p>Melanthe\u2014the sister of Omort and possibly his concubine\u2014mother to my offspring?</p><p>WRATH. He felt like he was drowning in it. Engulfed in it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me!\u201d</p><p>He found his claws digging into her. He didn\u2019t loosen his grip.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking of to make you so enraged?\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw, unable even to speak. He listened to her heartbeat, focusing on it. Get control, Talos. Early in his life he\u2019d seen the tragedies even a brief loss of control could wreak.</p><p>Glass shards like fangs flaying my skin. He gave his head a hard shake, increasing his speed.</p><p>In a softer voice, Melanthe said, \u201cN\u00efx wouldn\u2019t have sold me out if she\u2019d known you were going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Debatable. He\u2019d met the Valkyrie a year ago in the mortal city of New Orleans, when he was still regenerating the foot he\u2019d lost because of Melanthe. N\u00efx hadn\u2019t seemed to be tracking reality when she\u2019d told Thronos where to be to get captured\u2014and when to be there, just a week ago. All those months spent waiting since then had been punishing.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that Valkyrie tell you about me?\u201d Melanthe asked. \u201cWhat was her advice?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019d been one cryptic sentence: Before Melanthe became this, she was that. . . .</p><p>The female would say nothing more, no matter how much he\u2019d pressed. \u201cShe mentioned nothing about my treatment of you,\u201d he grated as the pain in his wings intensified steadily.</p><p>With the pain came equal parts wrath.</p><p>Because of the creature in his arms, he\u2019d had lifetimes of both.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Numbed to the drizzle and cold, Lanthe was lulled into a kind of exhausted stupor as the flight went on and on and on. When they\u2019d crossed over an expansive forest, the noises of the battles grew dimmer.</p><p>She dared a glance back, could still see bursts of spectral light. Soon that melee would spread outward all over the entire island. Thronos had to know that.</p><p>His face was tensely set\u2014as if he were concentrating on blocking out his pain. There\u2019d be no talking. Think about something else, Lanthe. Anything else.</p> <p>Yet now that she was his captive (temporarily), she found her mind mired in thoughts of him. A memory arose of their first day together, when he\u2019d tried to feed her\u2014his idea of courting.</p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t known she was a vegetarian.</p><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d Thronos proudly dropped a carcass of bloody meat at her feet.</p><p>She burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you cry?\u201d Despite all his confidence, he looked confounded\u2014and pained, as if her tears tormented him. \u201cYou don\u2019t like my gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-that was my bunny!\u201d One of the woodland creatures that she called friend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s decent meat. And you\u2019re starving.\u201d</p><p>Her face heated. \u201cI am not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too. You were scrounging for twigs, lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re b-berries! I like to eat berries.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, when curiosity had driven her back to the meadow, she\u2019d found it littered with piles of berries. Thronos had been standing among them, with his fingers stained, his chin up, and that cocky look back on his face. Delighted, she\u2019d leaned up and pecked his lips. His wings had snapped open, a reaction that had seemed to embarrass him.</p><p>After that rocky start, they\u2019d grown to be best friends, just as he\u2019d promised.</p><p>Later on, he\u2019d asked her why her parents didn\u2019t buy food. She couldn\u2019t make him understand that her mother and father worshipped gold more than anything it could purchase. Not to mention that they\u2019d deemed Lanthe old enough to begin stealing her own way through life\u2014</p><p>Thronos\u2019s grip was loosening in midair! \u201cWait!\u201d she cried.</p><p>But he\u2019d only repositioned her in the cradle of his arms. Apparently he was adjusting her for the duration\u2014and wasn\u2019t about to dump her like an armful of firewood. After a moment she relaxed slightly.</p><p>Though she had recurring nightmares about Vrekeners sweeping down on her, she was now trapped directly under a pair of wings. Talk about immersion therapy.</p><p>She stared up at them, spread in flight, wind whistling through his healing sword wound. As a girl, she\u2019d been obsessed with his wings, touching them all the time.</p><p>She\u2019d been fascinated to discover the backs were covered with scales like those of a dragon. As if in a mosaic, Thronos\u2019s black and silver scales had made slashing designs that resembled sharp feathers.</p><p>During the day, the undersides were dark gray. At night, they turned black, stark against the electrical pathways that forked out along the bones. Each of those pulselines shone as bright as phosphorescence.</p><p>One night when they\u2019d secretly met, he\u2019d spread his wings, showing her how the pulselines moved. It\u2019d looked like he\u2019d been surrounded by lightning wings. He\u2019d demonstrated how he could use tricks of light to camouflage his wings so they\u2019d be invisible in the dark.</p><p>When he\u2019d grown embarrassed by her wide-eyed stare, those pulselines had quickened, like a blush.</p><p>\u201cI never knew these were scales instead of feathers,\u201d she told him. \u201cI guess none of my kind have gotten a good look at the backs of Vrekener wings.\u201d</p><p>He appeared troubled. \u201cThat\u2019s because no Vrekeners ever retreat from Sorceri.\u201d</p><p>Now Thronos\u2019s wings were contorted in places. She\u2019d always imagined the bones had been set badly, but up close, she could see that they\u2019d mended true, in strong straight lines. Maybe the muscles had bunched, growing off-kilter?</p><p>Biting her bottom lip, she dared to reach up and touch a pulseline. Its beat accelerated, and his grip tightened on her.</p><p>The first time she\u2019d ever voluntarily touched him as an adult.</p><p>When he cast her a killing glance, he again resembled a reaper, every inch a \u201crighteous reckoning.\u201d His silvered talons glinted, as ominous as a sword blade. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou used to like me to touch them.\u201d</p><p>Voice brusque, he said, \u201cYou assume I remember that far back?\u201d</p><p>What if he didn\u2019t? His mind might have been injured. For some reason, the idea of that made her chest ache. She remembered every second of those four months. Regardless of their history, she found herself thinking of them\u2014of him\u2014far too often.</p><p>As they gained altitude to crest another mountain, her ears popped. Rain fell even harder, drops pelting her, winds buffeting them. She heard crashing waves. They\u2019d reached the far coastline? She blinked against the rain, saw he was following the shore north. Or south. Who knew with her wretched directional skills?</p><p>He looked as if he were trying to scent something. He flew them to a point, hovered, then returned down the coast, flying farther in the opposite direction. Again he repeated his pattern, clearly growing more frustrated.</p><p>\u201cEven if your senses are as keen as a Lykae\u2019s, you can\u2019t scent through pouring rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d He dove to circle a tree at the very edge of the storm-tossed peak.</p><p>The tree swayed in the winds, the top like the deck of a pitching ship. Yet the bastard tossed her onto a thrashing limb! She clawed her gauntlets across the wood, scrabbling for a hold.</p><p>If she fell, she\u2019d tumble down the mountain, her body dashed to pieces. Apparently he\u2019d forgotten how susceptible to injury Sorceri were!</p><p>Or maybe he hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>Once she\u2019d steadied herself, she eased around to crawl along the limb, the wood slick beneath her hands and knees. Kneeling before the trunk, she stabbed her gauntlet claws into it, then peered up, blinking against the downpour. No leaves screened her from the gale. Above, bare limbs spread out like veins, as if they were stretching for the sky\u2019s arteries of lightning.</p><p>Thronos stood at the very top, easily balanced, rising to his full height to ride the movement. A hand shielded his gaze from the horizontal rain.</p><p>As she put out a prayer to the gods that he got struck up there, her teeth began chattering. She soon shook until her head bobbed, and not just because of her fear of heights. She hadn\u2019t had more than an hour or two of sleep at a time for three weeks, and had rarely eaten the gruel they\u2019d been served.</p><p>Right now, she should be tucked in bed in her warm tower at Tornin, watching DVDs on her solar-powered TV and enjoying sumptuous foods and sweet Sorceri wine\u2014while waited on hand and foot. Instead, she was trapped with her worst nightmare, strangling with the need to kill him.</p><p>A burst of hysterical laughter left her lips. Lanthe and Thronos, sitting in a tree, k-i-l-l-i-n-g. . . .</p><p>Damn it, why the hell hadn\u2019t Sabine found her? Maybe the double-dealing N\u00efx had steered her wrong\u2014while giving Thronos detailed directions to find Lanthe.</p><p>If Sabine found out he had her sister, she would unleash hell.</p><p>That night so long ago, when Thronos had led others to the abbey, Sabine had noted the way he\u2019d stared at Lanthe: \u201cThe young Vrekener looked at you with absolute yearning. His people must have somehow discovered you are his fated mate. They attacked our family to secure you for the hawkling\u2019s future, to groom you. To break you. As they do with so many other Sorceri children.\u201d</p><p>Which Lanthe had supposed was true. But she\u2019d remained silent, and to this day, Sabine had no idea of her sister\u2019s connection to Thronos.</p><p>What was he planning for Lanthe once he\u2019d gotten her off the island? Did he expect to have sex with her? She recalled the way he\u2019d kissed her in the mine.</p><p>Oh, yeah. He expected it.</p><p>She heard a swoop of wings as he returned to stand behind her. She chanced a look over her shoulder, hating how he was totally in his element. As the tempest raged all around them, flashes of lightning illuminated his horns, wings, and fangs.</p><p>A true demon.</p><p>She remembered calling him one when they were young. He\u2019d been horror-struck, hadn\u2019t come back to the meadow for three days. Later she\u2019d realized he\u2019d flown home with the question: \u201cMom, Dad, am I a demon?\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d finally returned to Lanthe, he\u2019d been quick to present all the information he\u2019d gathered about how Vrekeners were completely, utterly, without a doubt different from savage demons.</p><p>Vrekeners couldn\u2019t teleport like demons, their eyes didn\u2019t grow black with emotion, and males didn\u2019t mark their females upon claiming. While demon horns had a function in that species\u2019 mating rituals (Thronos had blushed at that), Vrekener horns were only for menacing show, to terrify wrongdoers. Their wings were for swift capture of prey, to stamp out evil as quickly as possible\u2014because evil could spread.</p><p>She\u2019d rested her chin in her hand and asked in a saucy tone, \u201cAnd your fangs? Do they stamp out evil too?\u201d He\u2019d looked troubled for the rest of the day. . . .</p><p>Seeing him in this lightning, his species was plain to her\u2014just as it was to many others in the Lore. When Loreans called Vrekeners demonic angels, it wasn\u2019t because they resembled demons.</p><p>She recalled Sabine and Rydstrom debating Vrekener origins. Rydstrom had said, \u201cThey are sanctimonious, maniacal, and deluded. My kind claims no affinity with theirs.\u201d</p><p>Now Lanthe blinked, and Thronos was gone. As thunder rocked the night, he moved from limb to limb, an eerie predator. He alighted on one above her. From there he could have spread his wings, blocking the worst of the storm for her, but he was content to watch her suffer.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d felt this helpless, this powerless. The key to her collar was on the other side of the island. Thronos had separated her from her only shot at getting this thing off her neck. Not that she could simply walk up to Emberine and Portia and ask for it back. But Lanthe could\u2019ve planned a sneak attack, anything.</p><p>Her portal power sure would come in handy right now.</p><p>He moved to a nearby limb, hanging from his arms to bring their faces inches apart. \u201cI told you that I\u2019d have you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also told me you knew a way off this island. But you can\u2019t find it, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll reach it in the morn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Bully for us. When she turned away, he vaulted to the other side, leaning in once more.</p><p>\u201cIn the tunnel, you let go of the witch\u2019s hand so she could protect her young. Why would someone like you be moved to help her?\u201d</p><p>Again with the someone like you? \u201cWhy should I tell you anything? You won\u2019t believe a word I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies do spill so readily from those red lips. But I learn much from the very untruths you speak.\u201d</p><p>She dared to loosen one gauntlet to give him a vulgar hand gesture. \u201cLearn this, demon.\u201d</p><p>Between gritted teeth, he said, \u201cCall me that again, harlot.\u201d</p><p>She detested that word! With all the countless immortal and mortal languages, why was there no male equivalent?</p><p>A gust of wind drilled rain against her, sending her into a fit of coughing.</p><p>His voice a harsh grate, he said, \u201cA male shouldn\u2019t be heartened to see his mate\u2019s misery. But this pleases me well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate? I\u2019ll die first.\u201d</p><p>He brought one of his wings closer to her, easing that talon to her face.

But few things irritated her more than disbelief when she was actually telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou foul Sorceri pride yourselves on falsehoods!\u201d</p><p>Foul Sorceri . . . Someone like you. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of you! You\u2019d think after five hundred years that you could take a hint. I will never want you like you want me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWANT?\u201d His claw-tipped hand slashed the tree, his fury bubbling over\u2014as if she\u2019d hit an exposed nerve. \u201cDo not ever mistake my interest in you! Fate has saddled me with you, cursing me with a female I find lacking in all ways!\u201d His voice continued rising with every word. \u201cInstinct compels me to pursue you, to protect you. Otherwise I\u2019d take your head myself! I want you like a man with a badly set limb wants his bone rebroken. It\u2019s a bitter necessity. You are the bitterest necessity.\u201d</p><p>His words didn\u2019t hurt Lanthe. She\u2019d been scorned by men before. Why would she care what a scarred, maddened Vrekener thought of her?</p> <p>She didn\u2019t care at all. He mattered not at all.</p><p>When she just blinked up at him, he seemed to rein in his fury. \u201cWhat either of us wants is immaterial. I\u2019ve taken you because that\u2019s what fate decreed. You\u2019re mine by the laws of the Lore, the laws I uphold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always follow the laws? You act like Vrekeners are so righteous? I\u2019ve seen more evil in your kind than in most Sorceri I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know you lie! You resided with Omort!\u201d</p><p>With each Accession, a warrior for ultimate good, or ultimate evil, was born. Lanthe\u2019s half brother had been that warrior a few Accessions ago, bringing evil to the Lore for centuries. After her mother, Elisabet, had given birth to him, she\u2019d been cast out in shame by the noble family of Deie Sorceri. By the time Lanthe and Sabine\u2019s father had come into the picture, Elisabet had been . . . troubled.</p><p>This Accession, twin girls had been born for ultimate good, daughters of Rydstrom\u2019s brother, Cadeon, and Cadeon\u2019s Valkyrie wife, Holly. Lanthe was a doting auntie to them.</p> <p>\u201cYou remained with Omort,\u201d Thronos grated, \u201cduring his reign of child sacrifices, orgies, and incest.\u201d</p><p>Omort had hosted orgies and made a willing concubine of his half sister Hettiah, who\u2019d died the same day he had. Toward the end of his reign, when Omort had demanded sacrifices, he\u2019d yelled, \u201cSomething young!\u201d</p><p>Until that one fantastical day when Lanthe had challenged Omort, she\u2019d been helpless to stop him. She would be haunted forever by the things she\u2019d seen him do. Take it up with management.</p><p>\u201cI did remain with him,\u201d Lanthe admitted. \u201cFor ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what evils do you think Vrekeners have perpetrated to measure up to that fiend\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture, murder, thievery. Even you know your kind steals Sorceri powers.\u201d The fire scythe his father had wielded wasn\u2019t good only for parent beheadings; it also drained powers from its victims, a process Sorceri derisively termed neutering.</p><p>It was rumored that some \u201cbenevolent\u201d Vrekener had ordered the knights to siphon sorcery, instead of taking lives. Yet in the last century, the knights had begun doing both\u2014so that those abilities could never be reincarnated. . . .</p><p>\u201cWe harvest and store them, preventing them from being used for evil.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo us, a root power is like a soul. You\u2019re stealing souls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorceri steal each other\u2019s powers, like cannibals feeding! How many have you stolen?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, was guilty as charged. She\u2019d had no choice, since hers kept getting poached by smooth-talking Sorceri males. How many times had she fallen for one\u2019s seduction, only to discover he\u2019d used sex to lower her guard?</p><p>But she never stole from decent-minded Sorceri, the ones who only wanted to be left alone to drink, fornicate, gamble, and worship any gold they\u2019d swindled, swiped, or conjured.</p><p>\u201cYet you had to steal, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Thronos bit out. Fat drops of rain pummeled them, batting against his wings. \u201cSince yours were continually robbed?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known he was aware of that. No one would want her worst enemy to know she\u2019d been a dupe.</p><p>\u201cWas that how you got caught by the mortals?\u201d He canted his head in that foreboding way. \u201cWere you away from Rothkalina seeking another power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you really want to know the answer to that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, or I\u2019ll toss you down the mountain myself.\u201d He reached forward, his fingers making a cage over her throat, his expression promising pain.</p><p>He was a monster, a world away from the boy he\u2019d been when he fed her and held her\u2014and she\u2019d sighed words she could never take back.</p><p>Oh, well, he\u2019d asked for it. \u201cI was seeking something else entirely. After losing a wager with my sister, I had to go without sex for a year. I was on the hunt for a new lover when I got nabbed.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt yell, lifting her by her jaw. She dug her gauntlets into his forearms, but he didn\u2019t seem to feel them. \u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>In the bobbing tree, he held her body aloft, so her gaze was level with his.</p><p>Mother of gold, he was going to toss her! She couldn\u2019t stifle a whimper of fear.</p><p>His head rushed toward her body. She braced for a vicious strike of his horns. Instead of hitting her, he rubbed the base of one over her shoulder and neck, marking her with his scent.</p><p>As if by doing so, he could pry her out of some faceless male\u2019s arms.</p><p>The behavior was blatantly demonic.</p><p>When he finally pulled back, his eyes gleamed with rage. \u201cYou crippled me. For centuries, you cuckolded me over and over again. The pain you gave me in the past wasn\u2019t enough for you? You wish to deliver more?\u201d</p><p>Right now? Desperately! She wanted to claw his eyes out, to rake her gauntlets down his scarred face! \u201cBecause you deserve it!\u201d</p><p>He flung her back down to the limb. \u201cLook what you wrought, Melanthe!\u201d</p><p>As she scrambled toward the trunk, he ripped open the front of his shirt, revealing scars she hadn\u2019t seen before, marks jagging along his rigid torso. He pounded a fist over the center of his chest, over the raised scar there. \u201cDoes this one look like it was deep? Half an inch closer, and it would have pierced my heart!\u201d</p><p>She blinked against the rain, against tears that seemed determined to fall. But not out of pity, out of impotent fury.</p><p>\u201cEvery second I fly is hellish! Because of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it all over again!\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and gave a roar up to the lightning-strewn sky. When he leveled his gaze on her, she shrank under the savagery she saw there. \u201cGods damn you, sorceress! You have no reason to hate me as I do you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason?\u201d she sputtered. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to feel panic whenever a cloud passes over the sun? To hunch down, gasping for breath, pulse racing? You and your scarred face are the star of every nightmare I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d</p><p>Melanthe\u2019s eyes blazed with hostility. He stared into them as lightning reflected across those blue depths.</p><p>He was his mate\u2019s bogeyman? Fitting.</p><p>She was his bane.</p><p>Melanthe is misery. He shook his head hard, ignoring the weird ache in his horns, preventing himself from rubbing them over her again. He could barely reason, his thoughts a snarl in his mind.</p><p>Control. If he couldn\u2019t maintain it, then she would wind up dead. Which would end his plans for continuing his line.</p><p>Without that, and without the chase, what reason would he have to live?</p><p>Lose control, lose your mate.</p><p>Yet keeping her alive didn\u2019t mean he had to prevent her suffering. So why had he experienced the impulse to shelter her with his body? He needed to remind himself of all he\u2019d lost. Of all his agony.</p><p>He\u2019d implied to her that he didn\u2019t remember their childhood time together. In fact, he recalled every moment with a blistering, crystal clarity. Earlier, when she\u2019d stroked his wing with her eyes full of wonder, it\u2019d brought him right back to the first time she\u2019d touched him. . . .</p><p>Biting her bottom lip, she tentatively reached in, tracing a pulseline. His wings had flared uncontrollably, embarrassing him, making the back of his neck heat.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she murmured with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re not so scary, then. What\u2019s it like to fly?\u201d</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cI could show you.\u201d</p><p>And Thronos remembered those agonizing days after his fall, when he\u2019d fought not to succumb to his injuries. He\u2019d heard his mother\u2019s voice saying, \u201cDon\u2019t you understand what she\u2019s done to you?\u201d He must have been calling for Melanthe. \u201cWhat her kind have taken from us? Your father is gone.\u201d Then, lower: \u201cAnd so too will I be.\u201d</p><p>He remembered attempting to fly once more; his atrophied wings had been unable to support him. The humiliation had burned worse than the unbearable pain. He\u2019d ignored the whispers when his people had dubbed him their \u201ctragic prince,\u201d forever cursed to desire the wicked sorceress who\u2019d nearly murdered him.</p><p>He\u2019d told himself it would all be worth it\u2014once he had Melanthe again.</p><p>Bile rose in his throat as he remembered seeing her as a woman for the first time. He shook away the memory\u2014lest I murder her.</p><p>For centuries, he\u2019d vowed she would be worth all his pain. He craned his head up at the trunk of this tree.</p><p>Never forget. . . .</p><p>SIX</p><p>Lanthe woke to the feel of her stomach lurching as her body tumbled from the tree.</p><p>She unleashed a scream, fumbling to latch onto a limb; her arms wouldn\u2019t respond, filled with pins and needles. Falling! The drizzly fog was so dense she couldn\u2019t see what was below her\u2014</p><p>She landed with an oomph.</p><p>Thronos had caught her in his arms. Breathless, she stared up at him as his wings held them aloft.</p><p>After the freezing night she\u2019d just spent in the tree, his body was a hot haven. Warmth from his damp chest seeped into her, dulling some of her alarm.</p><p>Yesterday she would\u2019ve sworn she could never sleep with a Vrekener nearby. But apparently, she\u2019d been out.</p><p>As rain softly fell, his gaze roamed over her, and when his eyes began to glow with something other than rage, she swallowed. Though she was loath to admit it, chemistry sparked between them.</p><p>She might be the bitterest necessity, but his instincts were doubtless screaming inside him, commanding him on a loop: MATE FEMALE!</p><p>Which was never going to happen. A: She didn\u2019t do males she hated. Just a rule she had. And B? She was in the fertile time of her infrequent Sorceri cycle, could all but look at seed and get knocked up.</p><p>She had to trust that he wouldn\u2019t force her. She wished she could probe his thoughts, reading his mind, but her collar prevented it. He\u2019d probably developed mental blocks anyway. . . .</p><p>Her gaze was drawn behind him, and her lips parted.</p><p>While she\u2019d dozed, he\u2019d clawed slashes into the tree. The marks were all around the same size, lined up and patterned along the trunk.</p><p>She\u2019d bet there were roughly five hundred slashes, one for every year he\u2019d gone without his mate. \u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d been around enough crazed males to last an immortal lifetime. She gazed up at this one with wary eyes.</p><p>She recalled the things she\u2019d told him last night\u2014I\u2019d do it again! Maybe she oughtn\u2019t to poke the bear so much.</p><p>Yet even as he drew his lips back from his fangs, he seemed less frenzied today; still simmering, but perhaps the night had been cathartic for him. \u201cYou\u2019re one to speak of insanity, when your line is tainted with it.\u201d</p><p>Had he found out about her mother, Elisabet? Or just assumed this because Omort came from Lanthe\u2019s family? She averted her gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntruth,\u201d he grated. \u201cTell me another, and I\u2019ll throttle you.\u201d He shot into the sky.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>He headed north away from the coast back toward the island\u2019s interior. Or maybe he headed south. East?</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her question, asking one of his own: \u201cIf you believed yourself to be targeted by Vrekeners, why not communicate with me in our few encounters?\u201d He sounded almost normal.</p><p>\u201cYou always looked murderous. I couldn\u2019t be sure that you weren\u2019t on board with their plan to out and out kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn board to murder my fated mate?\u201d he said, as if she\u2019d spoken nonsense.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you had no idea that we were targeted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do, and your divisive tactics won\u2019t work. I sought\u2014and received\u2014the sacred word of Vrekener knights that they would visit no harm upon you or your sister. I will always believe that over the accusations of someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made them vow that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew well that Sabine\u2019s death would destroy you. I wanted revenge against you, not against a broken shell of a mate.\u201d</p><p>Though this was surprising to Lanthe, it didn\u2019t change their situation today. \u201cIt happened, Thronos. Whether you want to believe me or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you believe what you\u2019re saying. No doubt, typical Sorceri paranoia. Your kind are notorious for it. You probably mistook a Volar demon for a Vrekener.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other reason I never tried to communicate with you\u2014I knew you\u2019d never believe me.\u201d</p><p>On edge, Thronos didn\u2019t reply. He just scented other immortals. They must have overrun even this farthest edge of the island.</p><p>Earlier, when he\u2019d finally picked up the vessel\u2019s scent, he\u2019d begun cutting across a forest to reach it, which was proving to be more of a risk than he\u2019d expected.</p> <p>He needed to concentrate on their escape, but now that he was thinking more clearly, he couldn\u2019t stop replaying Melanthe\u2019s words from the night before. Why would he be her nightmare all these years? Why would she fear when a cloud crossed the sun?</p><p>Unless she\u2019d actually been attacked.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say that about my line?\u201d she asked. \u201cBeing tainted?\u201d</p><p>Melanthe didn\u2019t know this, but Thronos had briefly met her mother when he was eleven. And it had scared the hell out of him. \u201cI\u2019ll answer as soon as you admit it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bite, instead saying, \u201cSpeaking of communication, did you ever think about contacting me when I was in Rothkalina?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know that demon realm is out of my reach. The portals have been guarded by armies for the last two reigns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve sent a message to a letter station at one of the portal gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I have written? Dear Harlot, rumor has it that you are very happy with your new life in Rothkalina with your beloved brother Omort. I hear that you have all the gold you could ever want, and I know how much you always enjoyed a good blood orgy. Well done, Melanthe! By the way, would you like to meet for a rational discussion about our future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I did have a lot of gold.\u201d</p><p>Do not strangle her!</p><p>In a matter-of-fact tone, she said, \u201cI\u2019m just pointing out the sole true detail about your pretend letter. Oh, and you should know . . . if you keep calling me harlot, sooner or later I\u2019m going to have a rage blackout, and then I\u2019ll wake up to find you\u2014awfully sadly\u2014dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou threaten me? A powerless, physically weak sorceress?\u201d he sneered. \u201cI must amend my treatment of you forthwith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve turned into a sarcastic, unbalanced, judgmental dick.\u201d To herself, she muttered, \u201cMan, can I pick \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you take issue with the term harlot, then perhaps you shouldn\u2019t have slept with half the Lore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf?\u201d she scoffed. \u201cThree-quarters for the win!\u201d</p><p>How could she sound so bloody uncaring, when he was insulting her character?</p><p>\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t take issue with the term as much as the fact that you feel you can judge me. I despise judgmental people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do most creatures who deserve to be judged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me. I\u2019m a ho fo sho.\u201d</p> <p>What did that mean? \u201cYou speak like a human.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, as if that hadn\u2019t been an insult as well. \u201cI watch a lot of TV.\u201d</p><p>Yet another thing they didn\u2019t have in common. \u201cNaturally, you choose pointless pastimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did so much reading in my first couple of centuries\u2014when I was in hiding from Vrekeners\u2014that I figure I can skate a little now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI marvel that you had time for anything other than your conquests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a TV-watching harlot who deserves to be judged?\u201d She gave a disheartened sigh. \u201cThronos, you have to know that I\u2019ll never be what you need me to be.\u201d</p><p>He scanned the ground for movement within the stands of trees. \u201cI was told this long ago. I also heard that I\u2019d never survive the injuries I sustained. Then they said I\u2019d never fly again. Yet I did, and I do. Once I get you to my home, you will become what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like myself!\u201d she cried. \u201cDid you never consider becoming what I need, Thronos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused about your preferences. Should I emulate a drunken fey? Or a slick-tongued sorcerer who beds anything that moves?\u201d Or maybe she preferred them like her first: a leech.</p><p>Don\u2019t think of that memory. . . . \u201cIn the Skye, I will make you understand the value of loyalty, honesty, and fidelity to a single male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just confirmed what we\u2019ve always heard: that Vrekeners kidnap and brainwash bold, independent Sorceri females, turning them into blank-eyed slaves to their men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that! Sorceri young are happy among us, accepted as our own.\u201d As soon as they were disempowered.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said. He was beginning to recognize that was her way of indicating untruth. \u201cThey\u2019re trapped in a dismal floating realm filled with grim, self-righteous killjoys. They are in our version of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ll soon see the truth of my words for yourself, there\u2019s no sense in arguing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re taking me to Skye Hell? You think I\u2019ll be happy among you? Accepted as your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said other Sorceri were,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cNot you. You don\u2019t deserve happiness. You deserve the full force of my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge? After that night in the abbey, I never tried to hurt you, Thronos. I\u2019ve just lived my life. I wish to all the gods that you could learn to live yours without your bitterest necessity.\u201d</p><p>His rage had been so intense the night before, he only vaguely remembered calling her that. But he couldn\u2019t regret it. Considering his still-seething wrath, his words could have come out much worse. His actions as well.</p><p>As he soared over one mountain peak, heading for another, his gaze shot downward.</p><p>Fire demons had gathered in wait. For him, their enemy. Their hands were aglow, filled with flames.</p><p>They attacked, streams of fire burning through the fog and rain. Thronos\u2019s wings had been swooping, gaining altitude; at once he brought them closer, arcing his body down, gathering speed to elude their strike.</p><p>Against his chest, she cried, \u201cDon\u2019t drop me, Vrekener!\u201d</p><p>If he could dive down behind the mountain ahead . . . He picked up speed. Almost there\u2014</p><p>A trap. They\u2019d driven him into a broadside from another waiting group. Fire began to crisscross in all directions, flames zooming through the air toward them. A kill zone.</p><p>There was nowhere to fly, trails of fire showering all around him.</p><p>Impact. A sphere of flames, large as a cannonball, struck him in the wing. Like a hammer of the gods, it sent him reeling into another group\u2019s volley.</p><p>His wings were fireproof, but the flames clung to his scales, as if he\u2019d been doused with oil.</p><p>\u201cThronos!\u201d Melanthe screamed in pain. The fire was wrapping around him to lap at her. \u201cMy legs!\u201d</p><p>When he smelled her seared skin, he had no choice but to separate her from the fire. He did all he could; he wrapped his wings around her body, covering her as he dove evasively. The speed might help him shed the flames.</p><p>No way to stop his descent. The base of a mountain rushed closer, fringed with jagged boulders. His mate screamed again, this time in terror.</p><p>Had the fire subsided? At the last second, he opened his wings, sculling them forward like oars in thick water. \u201cAhh!\u201d he yelled against the pain as he scooped air, slowing their descent into the boulders.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another fire grenade blasted him square in the back, exploding flames all over them, accelerating his velocity even more.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, knowing he had only one chance of keeping Melanthe unharmed: fold her within his wings and take the impact on his back.</p><p>He turned in the air, praying to every deity in the heavens. . . .</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Lanthe hadn\u2019t stopped screaming. Heat had scorched her until Thronos blanketed her body, but then they\u2019d dropped.</p><p>Her stomach plunged as they fell, yet she could see nothing from the cocoon of his wings.</p><p>All she knew was that they were going to crash\u2014hard. When even he tucked his head at the last instant, fear robbed her of breath.</p><p>They hit, the craggy ground punching them like a giant fist. The force of impact sent them bounding into the air once more, a flaming skipping stone.</p><p>Vertigo overtook her, confusion. She heard bones snap! Not hers?</p><p>They crashed down again and again. Then something pierced the cocoon directly by her face; a jut of rock tore through the skin of his wing, the momentum ripping flesh away.</p><p>They came to an abrupt stop, like the finale of a fatal car pileup.</p><p>Thronos made no sound. Unconscious?</p><p>Dizzy and panicked, Lanthe scrambled away from him. She shoved against his imprisoning wings, making him groan in pain.</p><p>Freed, she stumbled to her feet, staggering on the stony terrain. She shook off her dizziness, taking stock of her own injuries. Burns only.</p><p>Thronos had taken the full brunt. Flames still flickered on his back, hissing in the light rain. He\u2019d broken bones, and that one wing lay wasted.</p><p>Which she didn\u2019t care about. Because he\u2019d put her in that situation in the first place. It was his duty to mitigate the fuckup!</p><p>She gazed around warily. Why had those fire demons targeted one Vrekener? Yes, Thronos was a Pravus enemy, but fire demons often acted as lackeys, hired guns.</p><p>They\u2019d be coming for him, and she needed to be gone when they did. She spied a natural path through the field of boulders, had just taken her first step when she heard another groan.</p><p>In a pained rasp, Thronos called her name.</p><p>Don\u2019t look back at him, don\u2019t look back. The last time she had, she\u2019d been tormented by what she\u2019d seen for all her days.</p><p>Against her will, she found herself turning.</p><p>His matte gray eyes were awash in misery as he grated, \u201cDo not run . . . from me.\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to shrink down, morning turning to midnight in her head. All at once she was back in the mountainside abbey, on the night her parents had been slain, the night Lanthe had first used her powers to save Sabine\u2019s life. . . .</p><p>\u201cWake, Lanthe.\u201d Sabine clutched her hand, wresting her from her bed. \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ai-bee?\u201d Lanthe whispered sleepily.</p><p>\u201cJust hurry.\u201d As if to herself, she said, \u201cI warned Mother and Father to move us from here, but they refused to listen.\u201d</p><p>Sabine hated their troubled mother and distant father. She blamed the pair for everything: not providing food or shoes or new dresses. She railed against them for their constant sorcery outlays that put the entire family at risk: If even Lanthe insists that you\u2019re using too much . . .</p><p>Lanthe knew the two weren\u2019t as good as other parents seemed to be, but her heart was filled with love\u2014why not give it to them?</p><p>\u201cAnd now Vrekeners are in the abbey,\u201d Sabine murmured.</p><p>Here? \u201cMayhap they aren\u2019t here to fight.\u201d Thronos was her secret best friend; he would never let his kind attack her family!</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here to kill our parents and abduct us. As they always do with Sorceri.\u201d They\u2019d heard the tales. Sorceri who broke the laws of the Lore were executed, while their children were fostered in stern Vrekener families.</p><p>Even with Sabine by her side, Lanthe was terrified as they stole through the abbey, lightning striking all around the mountain.</p><p>They stumbled into their parents\u2019 room. Mother and Father were curled together in sleep. Towering stained-glass windows allowed in the glow of lightning, distorting it. She blinked. For a second, she\u2019d thought her parents appeared . . . headless.</p><p>When the scent of blood hit Lanthe, her legs buckled.</p><p>Their bodies were decapitated; the heads lay at unnatural angles, inches from their necks.</p><p>Sabine threw up; Lanthe collapsed with a scream, her vision going dark as she hovered on the verge of unconsciousness.</p><p>Mother and Father were dead. Never to return.</p><p>Mother with her gaze frenzied as she beheld her precious gold. Father with his lost look whenever he beheld his crazed wife. Both dead . . .</p><p>Lanthe dimly comprehended that the room had filled with Vrekeners, their wings flickering in the lightning-filled night. The leader held a fire scythe with a blade of black flames.</p><p>Then she saw Thronos. His eyes were wide, and he was trying to reach her, but one of the men held him back.</p><p>How could Thronos have led these killers here? After all the time they\u2019d shared?</p><p>After my confession just this morning . . . ?</p><p>To Sabine, the leader intoned, \u201cCome peaceably, young sorceress. We do not wish to hurt you. We wish to put you on the path of goodness.\u201d</p><p>Sabine, the Queen of Illusions, gave a chilling laugh as she called up her power. Her amber eyes started to glimmer like shining metal, stark against her fire-red hair. \u201cWe know what you do to Sorceri girls. You plan to turn us into biddable, grave crones like your sour-faced women. We\u2019d rather fight to the death!\u201d She began creating her illusions; at once, the soldiers hunched down, as if they believed the ceiling was pressing down on them.</p><p>Even betrayed like this, Lanthe wanted to ask Sabine to spare Thronos, but her lips moved soundlessly. Mother and Father are dead.</p><p>Had her parents ever even awakened tonight?</p><p>Sabine raised her palms toward the leader, using her sorcery to make him see his worst nightmares. He fell to his knees, dropping his scythe to claw at his eyes.</p><p>With a smile, Sabine snatched up his weapon. She swung for his neck, was still smiling when blood spurted across her beautiful, ruthless face.</p><p>Thronos gave a grief-stricken yell as the Vrekener\u2019s head rolled to Sabine\u2019s feet.</p><p>Was the leader Thronos\u2019s father?</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s sight was dim, but she thought Sabine\u2019s illusions were . . . fading? Her sister would be facing these foes alone, all bent on avenging their leader.</p><p>Lanthe found her voice just as a Vrekener sidled up behind Sabine.</p><p>\u201cAi-bee, behind you!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too late. The male had already struck. He slit Sabine\u2019s throat, blood painting the walls as her small body fell.</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s daze burned away. She scrambled to her feet, shrieking, \u201cAi-bee?\u201d She ran for her sister, kneeling beside her. \u201cNo, no, no, Ai-bee, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die!\u201d Lanthe\u2019s own sorcery was manifesting itself. The air grew warm, as electric as the lightning surrounding them.</p><p>Sabine is leaving me. Because of Thronos and these men. My entire family taken from me in one night. A clarity such as she\u2019d never known swept over her.</p> <p>My family dies; the Vrekeners pay.</p><p>No longer would she hesitate to use her power. No mercy\u2014for any of them.</p><p>She commanded the soldiers, \u201cDo not move! You stab yourself! Fight each other\u2014to the death!\u201d</p><p>The room was thick with whorls of sorcery, and the abbey quaked all around them, the ancient rock walls groaning. A fracture forked along one of the stained-glass windows. In an earsplitting rush, it shattered.</p><p>She turned to her betrayer, the boy she\u2019d thought she loved. The boy who\u2019d led these fiends straight to her home.</p> <p>He was wending his way around bodies to reach her, now that the adult who\u2019d guarded him was dead.</p><p>Voice breaking, she sobbed, \u201cI trusted you. Sabine was everything to me.\u201d Then, louder, she commanded him: \u201cJump through the window\u201d\u2014the one hundreds of feet above the valley floor\u2014\u201cand do not use your wings on the way down!\u201d</p><p>His silver eyes pleaded for her not to do this thing, so she turned back to her sister\u2019s body, refusing to watch.</p><p>He never made a sound all the way down.</p><p>\u201cLive, Ai-bee!\u201d Lanthe screamed, but Sabine\u2019s glassy gaze was sightless, her chest still of breath. \u201cHEAL!\u201d she commanded, using all the power she possessed. The room quaked harder, jostling furniture. Mother\u2019s head hit the floor and rolled, Father\u2019s right behind hers. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me! LIVE!\u201d</p><p>More sorcery, more, more, MORE . . .</p> <p>Sabine\u2019s eyes fluttered open\u2014they were bright, lucid. \u201cWh-what happened?\u201d</p><p>While Lanthe was utterly emptied of sorcery, Sabine bounded to her feet, appearing rested.</p><p>I brought her back. She\u2019s all I have now.</p><p>They fled from the abbey into the night. Yet in the valley, Lanthe trailed behind Sabine. She looked back over her shoulder, saw Thronos on the ground, clinging to life.</p><p>His body lay broken, limbs and wings twisted, skin flayed.</p><p>Somehow he raised his hand off the ground to reach for her with yearning in his eyes. . . .</p><p>Now, hundreds of years later, Thronos raised his hand off the ground to reach for her once more.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d done that night, Lanthe turned from him and ran.</p> <p>EIGHT</p><p>Hoping to find Carrow and her crew, Lanthe headed for low ground. In the steady rain, she sprinted over uneven terrain. Though her lungs began to burn, she kept up a punishing pace, slowing only to hide when she sensed other immortals.</p><p>All the while, she tried not to think about Thronos. So why did she keep seeing his scars, his misery?</p><p>She refused to feel guilt about leaving him behind earlier, much less for making him jump as a boy.</p><p>If Thronos hadn\u2019t betrayed her, then that Vrekener leader\u2014who was his father, the king\u2014wouldn\u2019t have murdered her parents. Over the years, Sabine wouldn\u2019t have needed so much of Lanthe\u2019s sorcery to repeatedly cheat death.</p><p>Lanthe could be one of the most feared Sorceri alive\u2014instead of a power-on-the-fritz punch line. Hell, even Thronos had ridiculed her!</p><p>To be the Queen of Persuasion was to be the queen of nothing.</p><p>And in the Lore, perceived weakness was considered an invitation for enemy species to attack.</p><p>Sabine had recently voiced a new theory about Lanthe\u2019s persuasion: since Vrekeners tracked Sorceri by their power outlays, perhaps she feared drawing them down on her, and her fear was causing performance issues. Maybe her ability was intact, but her anxiety over the winged menace undermined it\u2014even in Rothkalina, where they were sure no Vrekeners would ever come.</p><p>Lanthe didn\u2019t figure her Vrekener PTSD was helping things.</p><p>At least her portal ability still worked. If she could lose this collar, she could walk straight into Castle Tornin\u2019s court.</p><p>The only problem? If conditions weren\u2019t ideal\u2014such as not having adequate time to concentrate\u2014she had little control over where her threshold opened. And most other planes were not quite so welcoming as this one. Worse, she could only create a portal every five or six days. So if she screwed up with a destination, she couldn\u2019t do a quick fix.</p><p>A huge risk. Yet so was staying on this island.</p><p>Damn it, what had Thronos been thinking to try to capture her? If he\u2019d succeeded, Rydstrom would have traced an army of rage demons to the Air Territories. Well, Rydstrom would if someone could finally find that domain in the heavens, one that was mystically concealed and moved throughout the year.</p><p>The only reason the Sorceri had never struck back against Vrekener aggression was because they couldn\u2019t find the Skye, or capture any of its inhabitants.</p><p>Maybe that was what made Thronos so daring\u2014he knew there\u2019d never be recourse against his kind.</p><p>Lanthe was so caught up with thoughts of him, she heard the log whooshing toward her face too late.</p><p>Her last thought before she blacked out: One more thing to blame him for. . . .</p><p>Lanthe dreamed of a voice. Only a voice. It belonged to a female, pleasantly cadenced.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll move through worlds,\u201d the female murmured, as if imparting a secret to Lanthe. \u201cIn one realm, hurt. In one realm, leave. In one realm, cleave. In one realm, shine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Lanthe said in her dream. The voice sounded familiar, but after an immortal\u2019s lifetime of acquaintances, she couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>\u201cJust think of your upcoming journey as the Four Realms of Samhain Past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d Lanthe\u2019s frustration level was rising. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhisper, whisper, whisper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! Now you\u2019re just whispering whisper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my spark,\u201d the voice said, \u201cand send worlds aflame. Now, wake, before it\u2019s too late. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw, OWWWW.\u201d Lanthe came to by degrees, groaning from the pain in her face. \u201cWho the hell hit me?\u201d she croaked, wondering how long she\u2019d been out.</p><p>And where was the woman? Had that truly been a dream? It\u2019d seemed so real!</p><p>As Lanthe sat up, blinking around her, she pinched her broken nose. With a wince, she tweaked it back in place. Overcast daylight crept through spindly conifer needles, disorienting her. When her vision cleared, her face fell.</p><p>Pravus. In number. Oh, shit.</p><p>There were all kinds surrounding her: vampires, centaurs, demons, Invidia\u2014demigods of discord\u2014and Libitinae, winged castrators. They\u2019d gathered in a clearing in the forest, within an encampment of rock\u2014enormous square slabs had been stacked upright like Stonehenge, part deux. Only one person could effect that.</p><p>Lanthe craned her head around. Sure enough, Portia sat upon a stone throne, gazing at Lanthe on the ground. The sorceress\u2019s eyes were bright behind her jade-green mask, the spikes of her pale yellow hair jutting as boldly as the mountains she\u2019d created.</p><p>Beside her, the smoldering Emberine, Queen of Flames, had draped herself over the rock throne\u2019s armrest, as a consort would. Apparently they were presiding over their new capital of This-Is-So-Fucked Island.</p><p>Some said Portia and Ember were sisters, while others said lovers. After spending a week in the same cell with them, Lanthe was leaning toward lovers.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to get closer to the key, but not like this. She gazed past them toward the outer edge of the clearing. More stones formed floating cells, caging a wood nymph, a fox shifter, an animus demon.</p><p>Thronos.</p><p>His capture didn\u2019t surprise her, considering the sheer number of the fire demons. Plus he\u2019d been injured. She could almost pity him\u2014a prince of Vrekeners imprisoned by Sorceri.</p><p>They would torture him to learn the location of his home. Afterward, they would . . . keep him\u2014as a plaything, ensorcelled to do their every bidding.</p><p>She knew well the kinds of acts they\u2019d force him to do. What they\u2019d force him to be.</p><p>Why did that make her bristle?</p><p>His gaze was focused on Lanthe, and he looked frenzied to reach her. One of his wings was back to nearly normal, still gnarled. The one that\u2019d been shredded had bits of flesh trying to grow.</p><p>\u201cIt took you long enough to wake,\u201d Portia told her. \u201cExactly how weak are you?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe made it to her feet, brushing leaves off herself. Why would the great Portia care? Lanthe had a sinking suspicion: maybe the fire demons hadn\u2019t been targeting Thronos at all.</p><p>Despite her power, Portia never would\u2019ve captured her in the past. Sabine\u2019s reprisal was too feared. Now? Just because the sisters had helped assassinate Omort, the Pravus leader, Lanthe was fair game for Sorceri?</p><p>Still, she regretted nothing. Her brother had had it coming. \u201cDid you have to attack me, Portia? You know I would\u2019ve come willingly.\u201d I never would\u2019ve come willingly.</p><p>\u201cWe fortuitously found you on the ground, unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Then who hit me?</p><p>Ember added, \u201cAs if someone had left you on our doorstep, like a cat with a savaged mouse.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe cast a worried look at Ember. Both females were diabolical. But while Portia at least listened to reason, Ember was akin to the flames she wielded\u2014volatile.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d a male voice asked.</p><p>Lanthe turned to see a sorcerer in full gold regalia striding into the clearing, a man she\u2019d hoped never to see again.</p><p>\u201cHas my Melanthe arisen?\u201d Felix the Duplicitor asked, his striking face lit with a smile, his gold gleaming seductively. His Sorceri ability enabled him to make anyone believe any lie he told. She would know.</p><p>Her face heated as she remembered his fervent vows to her. When he\u2019d promised her a future together\u2014with gold, his protection, gold, children, and more gold\u2014light-skirted Lanthe had been a lock.</p><p>In the throes, she\u2019d ceded her clairsentience and battle sorcery. She hadn\u2019t possessed her portal power yet, and he hadn\u2019t wanted her tainted soul.</p><p>Portia turned to him. \u201cYour pet\u2019s only just woken.\u201d</p><p>His pet? Lanthe ground her teeth.</p><p>He turned the full wattage of his smile on Lanthe. \u201cIt\u2019s been an age, Mel.\u201d</p><p>After sex, when Lanthe had asked him about a wedding date, he\u2019d released her from his spell, chucking her chin, and remarked, \u201cThough you tempt me sorely, there\u2019ll be no wedding for us, dear. But wasn\u2019t the sex enough of a reward?\u201d</p><p>No, Felix. No, it was not. She\u2019d slunk away, burning with humiliation, dreading how to tell Sabine that she\u2019d lost even more powers. I\u2019m such an idiot, she\u2019d railed at herself, such a dupe!</p><p>\u201cYou look as ravishing as ever,\u201d he said now, but he hadn\u2019t used his power, so she was free to disbelieve him.</p><p>Ravishing? Her recently broken nose was swollen like a balloon, and she probably had two glaring black eyes. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the same duplicitous male you always were, Felix.\u201d Sorceri weren\u2019t a forthright species to begin with; needless to say, Felix was a favorite among them. \u201cLooking no worse for wear from your prison stay.\u201d That gold armor really was to die for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only recently arrived. Had a vampire friend trace me to this island for the \u2018sport.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Just as Lanthe had suspected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d found it yawn-worthy\u2014until I heard about your capture.\u201d</p><p>His interest put her even more on edge.</p><p>Portia said, \u201cYou have something we want, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>Why now? They\u2019d had her, Carrow, and Ruby in their sights earlier when they were all escaping the prison. Yet they\u2019d spared the trio, merely stealing the hand that Lanthe had harvested from Fegley\u2014the grubby one that now hung from Portia\u2019s gold belt.</p><p>The key to Lanthe\u2019s freedom. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith so many helpless Vertas trapped here, we\u2019ve decided to eradicate them, bringing more Pravus to the island. To get a jump on the Accession.\u201d</p><p>Every few centuries the Accession rolled around, a supernatural force that fueled conflicts between factions, drawing them into battles, culling immortal numbers. Accessions could last decades or longer. Some said this one had already started with the renewed vampire clashes a few years ago.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had our allies teleport more soldiers here,\u201d Portia continued, \u201cbut what we need is an army of reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe could read the writing on the wall. \u201cYou want me to create a threshold.\u201d Ensuring the doom of all the Vertas here?</p><p>Like Carrow and Ruby.</p><p>Think fast, Lanthe. Portia would have to remove her collar. If Lanthe could manage persuasion, she could command them to release her.</p><p>\u201cBravo, Melanthe,\u201d Portia said. \u201cWe want a door to the centauri lands so thousands of them can march directly here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey already have a portal.\u201d Most dimensions had at least one\u2014but the quality varied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being utilized for a new top-secret offensive,\u201d Portia said, eyes flickering at the thought of carnage.</p><p>Who were the centaurs targeting? \u201cWell, Portia, I can\u2019t do anything with my current accessory.\u201d She yanked on her torque. \u201cSo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t trust you.\u201d Ember flipped her long red and black locks over her shoulder. \u201cNot after your actions in Rothkalina last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, did you really behead Hettiah?\u201d Felix\u2019s tone was admiring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hettiah had been Omort\u2019s half sister and consort\u2014a pale, evil imitation of his unrequited desire: Sabine. Lanthe had battled Hettiah and narrowly prevailed.</p><p>In answer, she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d He looked overjoyed. \u201cThen the other rumor must be true. You ensorcelled Omort!\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d wanted everyone to know about the part she\u2019d played and respect her. Now she wished her involvement had been kept secret.</p><p>Because Felix appeared to be on another power hunt.</p><p>For her very soul.</p><p>He could tell her she\u2019d always loved him, that he\u2019d given her all he\u2019d promised over these years\u2014and she would believe him. . . .</p><p>NINE</p> <p>Captive of the Sorceri.</p><p>This would have galled Thronos had he not been confident of his impending freedom. He\u2019d seize it soon enough.</p><p>No, he was more enraged that Melanthe had fled him\u2014though he hadn\u2019t expected anything different. Long ago, when he\u2019d seen her turn away and run, he\u2019d thought his world had ended. He\u2019d thought he had no reason to live.</p><p>Now? He lived for vengeance. He would attack these foes\u2014punishing whoever had battered her face\u2014then recapture his mate.</p><p>He swung his gaze around toward the sorcerer, adding another target for punishment: Felix, the male who\u2019d spoken to Melanthe.</p><p>An ex-lover, no doubt. How many of them populated this island?</p> <p>The blond male wasn\u2019t nearly as tall or muscular as Thronos and wore ostentatious gold armor. His manners were practiced, his skin unscarred. So that was the type of male his mate preferred.</p><p>The opposite of me.</p><p>At the thought, fury surged through Thronos. He shoved against the slabs holding him, but there was no budging them. Portia, that sorceress of stone, was too powerful, and he was weakened from regeneration. His bones had mended, but he\u2019d only reformed the barest covering across his right wing.</p><p>He\u2019d been no match for the twenty fire demons who\u2019d descended upon him.</p><p>Once healed, he\u2019d strike. For now, he kept his mouth shut and listened, trying to glean information\u2014such as why Melanthe would have ensorcelled Omort. Probably a rank power grab. Sometimes, Omort, Sorceri paranoia is warranted.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t trust me,\u201d Melanthe told Portia, \u201cthen what do you propose?\u201d</p><p>The sorceress of fire, Emberine, tittered. \u201cWe\u2019ve been deprived of color for so long\u2014let\u2019s do something bright.\u201d</p><p>What did that mean?</p> <p>\u201cBe done with this, ladies,\u201d Felix said. When a fleeting ray of sunlight reflected off his gilded armor, every Sorceri gaze was magnetically drawn to it, including Melanthe\u2019s.</p><p>Most Vrekeners believed the Sorceri\u2019s claims of gold worship were just a disguise for rampant greed\u2014as if the Sorceri would care how others viewed them. But Thronos knew they genuinely revered all metals, especially gold. The element was talismanic to them. Even at nine, Melanthe had been obsessed with it. Her mother as well . . .</p><p>Portia said, \u201cYou rush our fun, Felix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keen to renew my attentions to the Queen of Persuasion.\u201d</p><p>The hell that would be happening. Surprisingly, Melanthe\u2019s expression matched Thronos\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>Emberine gave an exaggerated frown. \u201cI\u2019m afraid our friend Lanthe is already smitten\u2014with the demon angel.\u201d</p><p>Smitten?</p><p>Melanthe\u2019s blackened eyes widened. \u201cHe and his knights have hunted my sister and me, killing Sabine over and over, forcing me to burn through my persuasion to save her life.\u201d</p><p>Again, she repeated her claims? Though he\u2019d told her about his knights\u2019 vows?</p><p>Emberine tsked at Thronos. \u201cNaughty knights oughtn\u2019t to have brained Sabine in front of young Lanthe.\u201d</p><p>Melanthe turned to him, her face tight with rage. \u201cYet that one doesn\u2019t believe me!\u201d</p><p>This one . . . is starting to. At least about attacks actually happening. Maybe some kind of offshoot group had targeted the sisters.</p><p>In a contemplative tone, Portia asked, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible that our handsome prince doesn\u2019t know what his kinsmen do to our kind when they\u2019re drunken and frustrated?\u201d</p><p>Vrekeners never imbibe, he thought automatically, though he knew that wasn\u2019t true. He had but once in his life, yet his brother secretly carried a golden flask, one stolen from a sorcerer he\u2019d defeated.</p><p>Aristo loved few things better than warring with Sorceri. Just as their father had. It was a source of contention between the brothers.</p><p>Portia faced Melanthe once more. \u201cSuch an infamously hostile past between you and the Vrekener. Your sister beheaded his father, and you personally crippled him, even though you\u2019re his mate.\u201d How indifferently the sorceress spoke of tragedies! \u201cThen Vrekeners hunted you. Which was why your reactions over the last week perplexed us.\u201d</p><p>Melanthe\u2019s head swung up, confusion in her eyes. Instead of demanding to know what that sorceress was talking about, she snapped, \u201cLet\u2019s just get to this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we tell you, Felix?\u201d Emberine asked coyly. \u201cEvery time the Vrekener was even mentioned, Lanthe\u2019s cheeks would heat, her eyes turning metallic.\u201d</p><p>Thronos stilled. Could it be true?</p><p>\u201cThat emotion was hate,\u201d Melanthe spat, but he got the impression that her feelings were far more complicated than that.</p><p>He had no delusions about his own feelings. Like a stream carving a groove through rock, her actions had forever transformed him. He would always despise her.</p><p>Portia said, \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind if we skin him? Crush him under the weight of a mountain?\u201d</p><p>Melanthe gave a snort of disbelief. \u201cBe\u2014my\u2014guest. And do save me a seat.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps she hated as deeply as he did.</p><p>Emberine stroked the backs of her metal claws across Portia\u2019s bared thigh as she addressed Melanthe: \u201cYou gave him his wounds before he could regenerate. Did he find you as a boy then?\u201d</p><p>Of not even twelve.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s known that a Vrekener will never stray from a mate.\u201d Emberine laughed as she said, \u201cTell us, Lanthe, is the mighty warlord a virgin? Is the angel pure as driven snow? Or was the demon in him an early starter?\u201d</p><p>Thronos set his jaw. Not\u2014a\u2014demon.</p><p>Melanthe didn\u2019t answer. At least she refused to join in their ridicule.</p><p>Emberine\u2019s gaze roved over him, desire plain on her face. \u201cI must initiate him!\u201d</p><p>He could remain silent no longer. \u201cTry it, slattern. Free me, and try it.\u201d</p><p>They tittered at that. \u201cOh, Portia, I know I could get him to stray!\u201d</p><p>Best of luck. You think I haven\u2019t endeavored to? He glanced in Melanthe\u2019s direction. How would she feel about him being with another?</p><p>Though her face was blank, her eyes shimmered.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t waste time on that, Ember.\u201d Portia seemed . . . jealous? \u201cWe move on with our plans.\u201d</p><p>With another laugh, Emberine sprinted to Melanthe, faster than Thronos\u2019s eyes could follow. In a heartbeat\u2019s time, she\u2019d crossed the clearing, stopping behind Melanthe to position a blade at her slender throat, hovering above that collar.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Thronos bellowed, his instinct screaming for him to protect his mate.</p><p>The metal was simmering red from Emberine\u2019s hold. It would slice through Melanthe\u2019s flesh. She swallowed, wincing from the heat.</p><p>Portia rose, riding a cloud of pebbles toward the two females, readying a severed hand for the torque removal.</p><p>Felix\u2014the as-good-as-dead sorcerer\u2014followed, seeming amused by the proceedings.</p><p>Emberine told Melanthe, \u201cYou\u2019re about to do precisely as we say, or you\u2019ll die. But before Portia releases your powers, we\u2019re going to ensure that you can\u2019t call out any persuasive commands.\u201d She gripped Melanthe\u2019s cheeks. \u201cNow, stick out your tongue like a good little queen.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s thoughts were in turmoil.</p><p>Encountering Felix again after all these years was throwing her. Not to mention seeing Ember\u2019s lust for Thronos. The fire queen\u2019s need to seduce him had affected Lanthe in surprising ways, ways she\u2019d have to think about later.</p><p>For now, she was a mite busy preparing for an amputation. Sweat dripped down her forehead and neck, pooling against her damned collar.</p><p>\u201cLose your tongue, and gain your freedom,\u201d Ember sneered.</p><p>Thronos bellowed at that, his wings flaring inside his cage. As if he cared about Lanthe. He acted this way because of uncontrollable instincts\u2014despite hating everything about her.</p><p>Was Thronos that much different from Felix? Two males wanted something from her; yet neither cared about her. They only saw what she could give them, how they could use her.</p><p>\u201cBe quick about it,\u201d Felix said, earning a scathing look from Lanthe. \u201cThe sooner Mel\u2019s tongue goes, the sooner it regenerates.\u201d Flashing white teeth, he quipped, \u201cI know just how she\u2019s going to want to break in her new one.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe shuddered. He could make her believe she loved every minute of her violation.</p><p>\u201cOpen wide!\u201d Ember cried. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014the blade\u2019s not quite hot enough to cauterize.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe swallowed again. All the Pravus allies closed in on the scene, the promise of gore exciting them. Seeing them like this, she could almost understand why one species would feel the need to police them.</p><p>Unless someone swoops in to save the day, I\u2019m about to lose my tongue. Though it\u2019d grow back, tongues were supersensitive; mother of gold, this was going to hurt.</p><p>A toll I\u2019ll pay to get free.</p><p>She glanced over at Thronos. He was thrashing against the immovable stone. When she stuck out her tongue and Ember pinched the tip with her gauntlet claws, he grew crazed, ramming his horns into the rock until blood dripped down his face.</p><p>She tensed, readying for the pain.</p><p>Felix murmured, \u201cBe over in a minute, Mel.\u201d Soothing words, even as he avidly watched\u2014</p><p>Slice.</p><p>She screamed, blood spewing. Cheers and laughter broke out.</p><p>Agony assailed her; black dots swarmed her vision as she choked on blood. When her legs grew weak, Ember held her up by the collar. With her other hand, she raised Lanthe\u2019s severed tongue for all to see. Then she tossed it into the crowd.</p><p>Stay conscious, stay conscious.</p><p>Portia ran Fegley\u2019s hand over Lanthe\u2019s face before she used the thumb to remove the torque.</p><p>Freed, Lanthe dropped to her knees, digging into the ground. She spat up mouthful after mouthful of blood, crimson streams splattering over her gauntleted hands.</p><p>Colorful enough, you bitches?!</p><p>\u201cThe threshold, Lanthe,\u201d Portia said in a casual tone. \u201cDirectly to the centauri capital, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe gave them a shaky nod, as if she was about to get right on this. She began manifesting her sorcery, and the pleasure of it counteracted her pain. After her enforced hiatus, she was brimming with power!</p><p>When she caught Thronos\u2019s gaze once more, she smirked around pouring blood. Like him, these Sorceri continued to underestimate her.</p><p>She had a secret ability, one she\u2019d been sure not to reveal in their cell. Because at heart, she was a sneaky, suspicious sorceress.</p><p>Even her new friend Carrow hadn\u2019t known Lanthe could communicate telepathically, a power stolen more than a century ago.</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s persuasive commands didn\u2019t have to be uttered by her; they merely had to be heard by her victims.</p><p>She raised her bloody gauntlets, iridescent blue light and heat blurring the air all around her. They\u2019d think it was for the portal.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>She would utilize the command that came in so handy whenever Auntie Lanthe babysat Cadeon and Holly\u2019s twins. She mentally ordered: \u2014Pravus, SLEEP.\u2014 She watched as their legs grew unsteady, lids heavy, expressions baffled. \u2014SLEEP. And forget I was ever here.\u2014 Bodies collapsed one by one. Portia and her platform of pebbles dropped to the ground, motionless.</p><p>Ember yelled, \u201cPortia!\u201d</p><p>\u2014You are exhausted, must sleep NOW.\u2014</p><p>Ember fell unconscious beside her lover\u2019s slumbering form.</p><p>All the Pravus were out.</p><p>The sorcery expenditure and continued blood loss had debilitated Lanthe, but she was in no way safe. Because for some inexplicable reason, she\u2019d excluded Thronos from her commands.</p><p>Without Portia\u2019s force against the stone cage, he was able to lift the top slab. His scars and limp had always made Lanthe discount his strength. When he tossed the slab away like a piece of tile, she promised herself she never would again.</p><p>If he captured her once more, she\u2019d be right back where she started from, minus a tongue. Just because she hadn\u2019t necessarily wanted him to be a Sorceri plaything didn\u2019t mean she wanted to be his!</p><p>So dizzy. Need a portal. She could crawl through it\u2014away from him, from this treacherous island. She had a moment\u2019s worry for Carrow and Ruby, but they had been in the care of that lethal vemon. Surely, he\u2019d protect them.</p><p>Lanthe spat more blood. Did she have the power to open a rift? She had just used her persuasion, and so many things could go wrong with a portal opening.</p><p>The last one she\u2019d created had been to Oblivion, one of the demon hell planes. But she\u2019d only had to reopen a portal that was already in place.</p><p>Easy as easy pie.</p><p>Now, in her exhaustion and haste, she might point a door back there. Or what if she portaled herself to somewhere even deadlier? Like a plane with mustard gas instead of oxygen, or a completely aquatic bubble realm?</p><p>Even worse than instant death, some planes could change a person forever.</p><p>Thronos limped toward her, his gray eyes intent, his expression determined. Behind him more centaurs galloped into the clearing, taking in their fallen comrades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Double threat\u2014no choice but to portal! Swallowing back blood, she began to open a rift, a small scalpel cut in this reality. She tried to concentrate on her home of Rothkalina, yet fears of all that could go wrong tangled in her thoughts.</p><p>Opening, opening. With a yell, Thronos started sprinting, snagging a sword from a sleeping demon on his way.</p><p>Opening . . .</p><p>When the centaurs charged behind him, Lanthe scuttled backward toward the threshold.</p> <p>As he ran, Thronos kept his gaze locked on her, even as he made a sweeping downward cut with that sword. Why would he . . . ?</p><p>The blade came back bloody; Felix\u2019s head was rolling from his body.</p><p>Her jaw slackened, blood pouring from her mouth. The Vrekener\u2019s crazed. She twisted over to her hands and knees, now scrambling through the portal.</p><p>Night. Fog and murk. Definitely not Rothkalina.</p><p>The overcast day of the prison island flickered into this rainy world like a flashlight\u2019s beam. Before her eyes could adjust, she heard Thronos bellowing for her.</p> <p>She commanded the portal to seal itself. Just as the seams were about to meet, he dove through them, crashing beside her.</p><p>As soon as the rift was no more, territorial growls and hisses sounded from all around them.</p><p>In the gloomy dark, Thronos grated, \u201cHave you taken us to hell, sorceress?\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Thronos struggled to get his bearings\u2014while biting back his rage over what he\u2019d just seen.</p><p>His female, maimed. By her own kind. He wished he\u2019d had time to liberate all of their heads from their bodies.</p> <p>Focus, Talos. He scented the air, surveying his new surroundings. They were on a small island of rock encircled by water that looked like mercury. Mist cloaked the night. Some kind of preternatural swamp?</p><p>Though he\u2019d traveled to foreign planes in pursuit of his mate, he didn\u2019t recognize this one. She could\u2019ve taken them anywhere. Thronos despised her portals; every time he\u2019d seen one in the past had meant he was about to lose her yet again.</p><p>A massive red sea serpent crested above the water to their right, a razor-sharp fin slicing through waves. \u201cYes. We\u2019ve gone to hell,\u201d he said, just as a green serpent surfaced to the left.</p><p>Melanthe would be creating another portal directly. But not to the Skye\u2014he would never give her the directions to his hidden home, in case she somehow escaped him and decided to portal an enemy army there.</p><p>\u201cMake another threshold back to the mortal realm,\u201d he ordered her. \u201cSomewhere in Europe.\u201d He knew she couldn\u2019t talk\u2014blood still spilled from her lips. Yet all she had to do was nod, then get to work.</p><p>Once they were away from here, he would question her.</p><p>How did you make the Pravus sleep, and why not me? For what purpose would you ensorcel Omort? Do you grieve that sorcerer I beheaded?</p><p>\u201cBe about it,\u201d he snapped, unused to repeating his orders. When Thronos led troops of his knights on Pravus raids, no one dared disobey him.</p> <p>She shook her head, her braids bouncing over her slim shoulders.</p><p>Denying him? He crouched in front of her, baring his fangs. \u201cDo\u2014it\u2014now.\u201d</p><p>\u2014It\u2019ll take me five or six days to renew my threshold ability. I\u2019m in a lag till then.\u2014</p><p>He jerked away, grimacing from the feel of her words laid directly into his mind. So that was how she\u2019d commanded them to sleep! Telepathy.</p><p>Now that he thought back, he could tell she\u2019d had to feign hesitation under the threat of that blade. She\u2019d had a plan, and she\u2019d been desperate to get that torque removed.</p><p>He hated telepathy\u2014a glaring reminder of what she was. But at least she could communicate with him until she regenerated. He knew he could reply the same way, thinking his words rather than uttering them, and she could pick them up with her mind-reading ability. But he refused to allow her entry into his thoughts, had developed mental shields specifically to block her. \u201cHow many other abilities do you possess?\u201d</p><p>\u2014Alas, only three.\u2014 Was she lying?</p><p>\u201cIf you have power enough for telepathy, then why can\u2019t you open a portal?\u201d</p><p>\u2014Just because I\u2019ve walked for miles doesn\u2019t mean one of my eyelids is fatigued.\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour powers empty and regenerate independently?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u2014Telepathy is second nature. Cutting a rift into reality . . . not so much.\u2014</p><p>She\u2019d said nothing about her most devastating ability. \u201cAnd your persuasion?\u201d Could she use it only every few days as well? Once she was strong enough for a threshold, she might be able to command him. A double-edged sword. He was in the same position as those Sorceri, could trust her just as little.</p><p>The loss of her collar was a grave one.</p><p>\u2014Persuasion is unpredictable.\u2014 In the rain, she rubbed her chin over one pale shoulder, smearing blood there. Crimson ran down her arm, dripping from her elbow into a rivulet of runoff. \u2014It tends to come online when I\u2019m in jeopardy, so you probably shouldn\u2019t frighten me again.\u2014</p><p>He shuddered to think of all the things she could persuade him to do. Could she truly make him forget her? Even as his rational mind thought, Maybe that\u2019s exactly what should happen, his instincts rebelled.</p><p>His body rebelled. Would it remember that Thronos was never to take another?</p><p>\u201cThere must be some way for you to shave days off your . . . lag.\u201d They couldn\u2019t be trapped here. Something about this realm put him even more on edge. Of course he perceived danger all around, yet his main sense was of expectancy.</p><p>Because he was with her?</p><p>\u2014I have to wait several days, for me to create myself a threshold for me to use. You\u2019re s.o.l.\u2014</p><p>So, unless they could find another portal or a Lorean who could teleport, they were stranded. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u2014 When the rain intensified, she started shaking even harder. With the amount of blood she\u2019d lost she must be freezing in this weather. And regeneration was punishing on the body.</p><p>The wind picked up, bringing traces of scents. His muscles tensed when he smelled lava, corpse rot, and Lorean blood. Copious amounts of it. \u201cOf all the realms, why did you pick this accursed land?\u201d</p><p>She slitted her eyes at him, her own blood streaming from the corner of her lips. \u2014No one forced you to come with me! And hitchhikers don\u2019t get to complain about the destination!\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>\u2014Sometimes I can\u2019t control what door I open! Especially not under pressure.\u2014</p><p>He exhaled a breath. He\u2019d best figure out how to keep them alive in this place. He squinted through the mist, spying what might be a pair of mountains in the far distance. He thought a high plateau stretched between them.</p><p>There were two other small islands between here and that coast, but each one was miles away, too far for even an immortal to leap. Without both of his wings, he had scant hope of crossing that span.</p><p>Another serpent swam by. Were they getting more numerous? This one flicked its forked tongue in the air directly beside their island. The tongue was as long as Thronos\u2019s leg. Rows of razor-sharp teeth glinted in the night.</p><p>When the skies opened up and rain thundered down, Melanthe shuddered beside him. The paler her skin grew, the more those bruises on her finely-boned face stood out.</p><p>Without thought, he started moving his good wing over her\u2014but stopped himself, stifling any unwanted sympathy for her. \u201cIt seems you would want to work together with me, sorceress. You can\u2019t fly, so how will you escape this predicament? Or were you planning to remain here with the serpents for the better part of a week?\u201d</p><p>She gave a marked glare at his injured wing.</p><p>\u201cIt will heal in hours.\u201d And then he\u2019d find a secure shelter for them.</p><p>\u2014You\u2019re acting like we\u2019re in a partnership, like I\u2019m not your prisoner. We are NOT a team. I hate you! I plan to ESCAPE you, dumbass.\u2014</p><p>\u201cI expect nothing less. But until your next futile attempt, you\u2019re going to answer some questions for me. Who was that sorcerer to you?\u201d</p><p>\u2014An ex. Congratulations, you decapitated an old ex.\u2014</p><p>\u201cDo you grieve him?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u2014I grieve that you didn\u2019t snatch his gold armor on the way out. He was no friend or ally of mine.\u2014</p><p>\u201cThen why would you have slept with him?\u201d Her sexual habits confounded him!</p><p>\u2014Why not?\u2014</p><p>Lose control, lose your mate. Biting back fury, he said, \u201cWhy did you ensorcel Omort?\u201d</p><p>She jutted her chin mulishly.</p><p>\u201cAnswer or swim.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted as a purple fin sliced the water nearby. \u2014I commanded him to use no sorcery in the fight with Rydstrom.\u2014</p><p>Everyone in the Lore knew that Rydstrom the Good had slain Omort the Deathless, reclaiming his kingdom of Rothkalina; but Thronos had wondered how the rage demon king had circumvented Omort\u2019s vast powers. \u201cWhy would you favor Rydstrom, betraying your own brother and . . . lover?\u201d he grated, scarcely able to utter the word.</p><p>Her face screwed up with revulsion. \u2014Lover??? He was everything vile! Not to mention that he was my BROTHER. Oh, that\u2019s just not\u2014 The thought ended abruptly; she turned to throw up again, heaving, but only blood came out. \u2014I\u2019d rather die!\u2014</p><p>Did he dare to believe her? Surely disgust that violent couldn\u2019t be contrived.</p><p>She swung a glare at Thronos, eyes sparking with rage. \u2014I will kill you in your sleep for saying things like that to me!\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy should I, or anyone else, believe you weren\u2019t his concubine? It\u2019s common knowledge that Omort liked to mate his sisters, and you lived under his protection for centuries!\u201d</p><p>\u2014You want to know the truth about what life was like under his protection? Horrifying. We lived with his insanity, saw it made manifest every day! He routinely threatened to kill me, came close so many times.\u2014</p><p>\u201cAgain, you lie. If you hated what was happening, then why wouldn\u2019t you abandon him? I know that you and Sabine were free to come and go. And why would he want his own sister dead?\u201d</p><p>She turned away, her gauntlets balled into fists. \u2014Go to hell.\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already taken me here. Now answer me!\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He grabbed her shoulders. \u201cFeel the serpent\u2019s breath?\u201d</p><p>She struggled in his arms, weak as a babe. \u2014He poisoned Sabine and me with the morsus.\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat is that? I\u2019m not as versed in cowardly poisons as you Sorceri are.\u201d They loved deploying their poisons as much as they loved drinking and gambling, deeming themselves \u201ctoxinians.\u201d</p><p>\u2014The morsus kills from withdrawal. If we left him for more than a few weeks, we\u2019d die of pain. He had the only antidote, doling it out at intervals, so long as we didn\u2019t displease him.\u2014</p><p>It sounded too strange to be true, which had Thronos leaning toward belief. Only a sorcerer would do that to his own family. \u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u2014A) I don\u2019t care if you believe me or not because you don\u2019t matter. B) Your friend N\u00efx will verify everything I\u2019ve told you.\u2014</p><p>He . . . believed Melanthe. Which meant Thronos\u2019s old friend wrath was placated a degree. The sorceress hadn\u2019t been a delighted participant in those atrocities.</p><p>Though she was lacking in so many other ways, Thronos decided then that she would suffice as a wife. \u201cI do believe you in this, which means I will be marrying you. You\u2019ll be pleased to know that torture is now off the table.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flickered. \u2014As if I\u2019d ever accept you as my husband! You have no right to abduct me! You\u2019re no different from Omort. Taking away my choice, my life. And we killed Omort at the first opportunity.\u2014</p><p>\u201cThreatening me again?\u201d</p><p>\u2014The only reason we went with him in the first place was that he promised to protect us from Vrekeners!\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot from me. I\u2019ve seen you only a handful of times over these years. I dogged your heels, but always when I closed in, you escaped through sorcery. If there was a splinter group who targeted you, I had no knowledge of it.\u201d</p><p>\u2014How could you not know what your own men were doing?\u2014</p><p>He felt her probing his thoughts, trying to read his mind. He put up his shields within an instant, but apparently that was all she\u2019d needed; she gasped.</p><p>\u2014You truly didn\u2019t know! Allow me to fill you in. Not two years after the abbey, your knights of good flew Sabine to a height and dropped her for fun. I saw her head crack open on the cobblestones. I barely pulled her back from the dead.\u2014</p><p>Vrekeners were the curse of evildoers; they did not commit evil.</p><p>She read his expression. \u2014Don\u2019t believe me? Why do you think I grew to be so afraid of heights? Because I\u2019ve seen what happens to a body when it lands! And then, not a year later, your kind were upon us again.\u2014</p><p>Her gaze went distant. \u2014We hid in a hayloft. But these huge winged males swept up after us, your knights. Laughing, the leader picked up a pitchfork and stabbed the hay.\u2014 She flexed her right hand. \u2014Sabine jumped from the loft, running to distract them from me. They chased her into a river. She couldn\u2019t swim and drowned!\u2014 Melanthe faced him once more, leaning in aggressively. \u2014I found her on a bank three towns away, and debilitated my power to bring her back.\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that my own men tried to gore my mate to death when she was a helpless little girl? Ah, but it gets better. Only Sabine\u2019s selflessness saved you? How false that rings!\u201d Melanthe was lying. She had to be.</p><p>Because Vrekeners didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2014I don\u2019t expect you to believe that. Just like I don\u2019t expect you to believe that we weren\u2019t isolated cases. That your knights brutalized other Sorceri even worse.\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe enchantress spins her tales.\u201d</p><p>\u2014The enchantress is DONE with Vrekener bullshit!\u2014 She spat blood in his face.</p><p>Thronos shot to his feet, lifting her with him. \u201cYou provoke me?\u201d</p> <p>\u2014I wish I\u2019d put you to sleep with the rest of those dicks!\u2014</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She averted her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Melanthe?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at something past him. He glanced over his shoulder, saw several serpents, in a prism\u2019s worth of colors. How many were there?</p> <p>That was when he noticed that the shape of their little island had changed.</p><p>He bit out, \u201cThe water\u2019s rising,\u201d just as she said: \u2014I think they like my blood.\u2014</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Naturally, Lanthe had spat in the face of the one person who could save her from being serpent chow. The rain was still washing red streams off his chiseled cheeks.</p><p>Of all her fears, being food was up there, just under Vrekener attack. Time to make nice with her hated tormentor.</p><p>Choking back the pain in her mouth, she faked a flirtatious demeanor. \u2014I seem to have gotten my blood on your face. Bad Lanthe! Hey, I have an idea. Let\u2019s team up!\u2014</p> <p>He scowled at her as he tested his wings, the lines of his face growing tight with pain. The damaged wing was nowhere near ready to fly. He was like a plane that had lost one engine. When the water lapped at their feet, he said, \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be enough to get us to the coast I spied.\u201d</p><p>She turned, seeing nothing through the gloom. But the mercury water and rainbow serpents were giving her an idea of where they might be. If she was correct, then danger loomed everywhere. If they encountered rivers of fire and a perpetual demonic war, she\u2019d know. . . .</p><p>Lanthe needed the Vrekener\u2019s help to survive this place\u2014and she needed him bullish, convinced he could save her! How to get his adrenaline pumping?</p><p>She gazed at his chest. His shirt hung wide, revealing his scarred skin. His muscles were hard and generous. Attractive. No wonder Ember had desired him.</p><p>Reaching forward, Lanthe laid a shaking palm over his heart. He tensed, and at once its beat began to thunder. The second time she\u2019d voluntarily touched him as an adult. She cleared her throat, then remembered she couldn\u2019t talk. \u2014Thronos, if you can get us out of this situation . . . \u2014</p><p>The water swept closer, the serpents growing bolder.</p><p>\u2014I\u2019ll let you touch me.\u2014</p><p>He narrowed his eyes down at her. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t understand is that I\u2019ll be doing whatever I please to you.\u201d</p> <p>Well. When had he gotten so cocky? Then she recalled that he had been as a boy as well.</p><p>He yanked her up into his brawny arms, against that unyielding chest. \u201cYou belong to me. By right of pain, I\u2019ve earned you!\u201d Lightning struck, punctuating his statement.</p><p>Like she\u2019d belonged to Omort? She\u2019d just been freed of that freak a year ago!</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t surprise me that you\u2019d bargain your body for safety,\u201d Thronos added. \u201cNow, shut up, and put your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>When in trouble, leave. Seeing no other option, she did as he told her. With her short skirt riding up, he cupped her bare ass, holding her body high on his torso. His hands were rough and hot, like five-fingered brands on her damp skin. Electricity seemed to pass between them.</p><p>By the look on his face, she wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d felt it.</p><p>How in the hell was he supposed to concentrate on getting her to safety when his palms were molded to her lush curves?</p><p>His only hope of protecting her was using the islands to reach the coast. He\u2019d just been focusing his mind on the herculean task ahead when the sorceress started talking about him touching her!</p><p>He\u2019d shot hard for her, diverting blood from his healing wing and, more importantly, his brain. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to know how easily she affected him, so he\u2019d furtively adjusted his aching shaft.</p><p>How many other males had fallen for this enticing creature? For her lies? His old friend wrath erupted inside him. He would use it to fuel his escape from this swamp. \u201cI suggest you hold on.\u201d</p><p>She laid her face against his chest, clutching him tighter.</p><p>With a yell, he leapt for the nearest island, working his good wing for loft as much as he could. He fell short, landing in the water up to his knees. He lunged to the center of the island just as teeth snapped closed behind them. When an angry hiss sounded, he felt the fetid air from the beast\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u2014Too close, Thronos!\u2014</p><p>He focused his gaze on the next island, one even farther away than this one had been. He had his mate at last; all he had to do was keep her safe from dozens of giant swamp serpents.</p><p>Setting his jaw, he tensed, then lunged. Midleap he knew they would fall short of the island. A serpent surfaced beneath him; at the last instant, he alighted on its back, using it to vault to his target. They landed safely.</p><p>\u2014Serpents are not stepping stones!\u2014</p><p>He could do without her critiques. \u201cYou have no tongue, yet you won\u2019t shut up.\u201d He locked his gaze on his destination. As he\u2019d spied before, there were two mountains bordering a plateau atop an enormous shelf of land. It ended in a sheer cliff face, as if a giant had cleaved its edges, halving the mountains in the process. Lava oozed down their sides, like glowing orange waterfalls.</p><p>The plateau was hundreds of feet above the swamp. If he missed, there\u2019d be nothing to stop them from plunging into serpent-infested waters.</p><p>The storm was worsening. Wind gusted with the pounding rain. But this pile of rock had a little more room, so he could at least get a running start. Though the winds carried ill-omened scents from that plateau, he had no choice but to continue.</p><p>A horn rang out, echoing from one mountain to the other.</p><p>A battle call?</p><p>Bloodthirsty yells sounded, metal clanging against metal. Moments later, the night sky lit up, Lorean powers blasting.</p><p>He saw fire grenades, ice bombs, and swirling battle magics. Had to be demons. But how many factions of them could there be? \u201cWell done, Melanthe. You took us from one war to another.\u201d</p><p>\u2014I think I know where we are. Supposed to be a myth. The source of all demons.\u2014</p><p>The source? Realization. \u201cYou brought us to bloody Pandemonia?\u201d Plural of pandemonium. Because it was the fabled home plane of hundreds of demon species.</p><p>Another hiss sounded behind him. The water continued rising at an alarming rate. No other option but forward. He had to hope that they could skirt the edges of the conflict.</p><p>As he backed to the far end of the island, she wrapped her arms tighter around him, digging her gauntlets into his skin.</p><p>He took off in a sprint, waiting till the last second . . .</p><p>With a bellow, he lunged for his target. Airborne. Three heartbeats later, he knew he wouldn\u2019t make it in this headwind.</p><p>Too short, too short.</p><p>\u2014We\u2019re going into the drink, Vrekener!\u2014</p><p>When the green serpent crested, Thronos worked his wing as hard as he could to reach its back. Ha! Heading for a perfect serpent touchdown; he was getting handy at this.</p><p>He landed just as the beast thrashed. The momentum sent them hurtling toward one of those mountains as if they\u2019d hit a thirty-ton springboard.</p><p>Thronos heaved his wing, fighting to right himself. The mountainside loomed, rushing at them.</p><p>He thought he spied a small cave opening between two lava flows. Could he hit that tiny target? Such a risk! He steered with his wing, down and left.</p><p>Down and left, down and left . . .</p><p>Left, left!</p><p>They bulleted through the opening. He dropped his legs, reversing his wing, touching his feet down.</p><p>The momentum had him barreling toward the back wall; he twisted to his side, leaning away, feet sliding sideways in the dust.</p><p>They stopped inches from the wall.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Lanthe had been certain of death, convinced their momentum would slam them into the side of a mountain, crushing them or giving them a lava bath.</p><p>Instead, Thronos had hit the bull\u2019s-eye, then slid home. She drew back to face him. \u2014Okay. That was a pretty cool move. Way to thread the needle.\u2014</p><p>She thought it took him a second longer than usual to scowl down at her. He set her to her feet, steadying her with a big palm over her shoulder.</p><p>\u2014Thanks.\u2014</p><p>He jerked his hand away, looking angry with himself. Then he turned to survey the area.</p><p>Thanks to the glow of the lava flows just beyond the cave mouth, there was enough ambient light for even Lanthe to see clearly. Each of the cave walls had been hewn smooth, as if to create a canvas for a multitude of etched hieroglyphs. There were pillars to support the ceiling, a raised rock shelf along the back wall, and layers of dust.</p><p>She\u2019d been to ancient ruins before. This place seemed so old it made those other ones appear techno.</p><p>Thronos cased the perimeter, pausing at intervals to scent the air. What she wouldn\u2019t give for his heightened senses. And his strength, she added when he moved a fallen pillar out of his way, plucking it up as if it were a matchstick.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea why we arrived here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head, trailing after him. In the back left corner of the cave, she perceived something that made the tiny hairs on her nape stand up. There was only one way her senses could trump Thronos\u2019s: recognizing the call of gold.</p><p>Yet the wall appeared solid. Looking for a door, she examined some glyphs, brushing away dust. She gave the marks a few pokes with a gauntlet claw, but found nothing.</p><p>Even as she walked away, she glanced over her shoulder longingly. Maybe there was a mother lode locked in the mountain, never to be discovered in this hell plane.</p><p>The idea left her deflated. Now that the adrenaline of their escape had waned, she was growing dizzy with fatigue and blood loss. Her regenerating tongue was sending waves of pain throughout her mouth and head.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize these markings, sorceress?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been learning Demonish in Rothkalina, was conversant at least, but she didn\u2019t recognize this. \u2014Proto-Pandemonian, maybe? Or some kind of primitive Demonish?\u2014</p><p>Thronos looked even more unsettled than before, shoving his fingers through his thick hair. Something about this cave was affecting him. \u201cYou expect me to believe your door to Pandemonia was random?\u201d</p><p>\u2014We could have gone anywhere, anyplace in existence. Believe me, it could\u2019ve been worse.\u2014</p><p>\u201cWorse than Pandemonia?\u201d</p><p>\u2014Absolutely.\u2014 Foreign realms were often lethal to some degree, so dangerous that only an immortal could survive there.</p><p>Though many in the Lore believed immortals were quasi-deities, others thought they\u2019d been forced to evolve in those foreign dimensions, to become ever more hardy, until one eon they became . . . undying. Then they\u2019d traveled across realities to inhabit the mortal world, attracted to the relative ease of that plane.</p><p>So basically, Sorceri had evolved with senses only a little better than a human\u2019s, bodies that were weak compared to other Lore species, and life spans that could end from far more than just a beheading or mystical fire.</p><p>Her species sucked at evolution.</p><p>\u201cWhat realm trumps this one, Melanthe?\u201d</p><p>\u2014At least there\u2019s rain here.\u2014 She started wringing out her hair. \u2014We could have gone to Oblivion, forced to fight other demons for water.\u2014</p><p>His wings twitched with irritation. \u201cOther demons?\u201d</p><p>\u2014Would you rather we\u2019d landed in Feveris?\u2014 Anyone who entered that plane was bespelled with unending, uncontrollable desire.</p><p>\u201cFeveris, then?\u201d Had his voice grown huskier? \u201cThe Land of Lusts?\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d had more blood left in her body, she might have blushed at his tone.</p><p>\u201cHave you been there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She had, just to dip a toe, to see if the rumors were true. Her servants had tied a rope around her waist to drag her back if she got bespelled, a precaution they\u2019d been forced to use. Within minutes, Lanthe had begun stripping for a gnome.</p><p>\u2014Maybe.\u2014 She\u2019d never forget that perpetually sunny, coastal plane, redolent with the scent of Hawaiian Tropic, island flowers, and sex. Or its twinkling rays of sun . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you felt right at home there,\u201d he grated.</p><p>She was still smarting from his harlot comment on the prison island. \u2014Maybe YOU influenced me to open this door to Pandemonia, demon! All last night I was captive of a demon, so naturally I opened a threshold to YOUR home world.\u2014</p><p>He stalked up to her, yelling, \u201cDo not call me demon!\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to hold her ground, then repeated his earlier words: \u2014Sensitive about this, creature?\u2014</p><p>\u201cDemons are savage. Vrekeners have grace and a sacred purpose. We are descended from gods!\u201d</p><p>\u2014How do you know this?\u2014</p><p>\u201cFrom the Tales of Troth\u2014sanctified knowledge passed on from one Vrekener generation to the next for millennia.\u201d</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m going to have to stop you, because you\u2019ve already bored me. In any case, my brother-in-law Rydstrom is no savage. He\u2019s one of the best males I know.\u2014</p><p>\u201cEnough of Rydstrom! You sound infatuated with him.\u201d</p><p>\u2014He is hot.\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you like? Ever superficial, sorceress.\u201d</p><p>\u2014And you are ever pathologically jealous.\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much deeper than jealousy. The males you bedded stole from me. You stole from me.\u201d</p><p>\u2014What did I steal?\u2014</p><p>\u201cYears and children. I would have killed any other for such a grievous loss.\u201d</p><p>\u2014That\u2019s what you\u2019ve wanted from me all this time? Years and children? Even if those years would have been miserable?\u2014</p><p>\u201cI accept that our existence together will be bleak. The most I hope for is that we can raise our offspring without killing each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lanthe\u2019s biological clock\u2014which had no idea Thronos was a kidnapping, judgmental prick\u2014quickened at the words our offspring.</p><p>Being a doting auntie to the twins had jump-started Lanthe\u2019s clock. Caring for little Ruby in the prison had put it into overdrive.</p><p>That she was at the tail end of her fertile time probably wasn\u2019t helping matters.</p> <p>But children with Thronos? Never. It would be bad enough if Lanthe was trapped in Skye Hell, being brainwashed; she\u2019d be damned if her children shunned laughter, for gold\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem averse to the idea of young in general,\u201d he observed.</p><p>Not at all. And it wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t been looking for a partner all these years.</p><p>Too bad each of her forays had ended poorly. She would either gain a creepy new admirer, have her powers stolen, or get the dreaded brush-off: males wincing at their watches, claiming, \u201cGot a really early morning tomorrow, sweet.\u201d Then they\u2019d blaze.</p><p>Hit it and quit it. Nail and bail. Yet never a conceive and leave, because she\u2019d taken precautions whenever she\u2019d been in season.</p> <p>\u201cHow could you not have had children?\u201d Thronos demanded. \u201cYour opportunities for impregnation must have been legion.\u201d</p><p>She was making a note of all these slut-shaming comments, vowing to throw his demonic origins in his face at every opportunity. \u2014Each day, I\u2019m going to give you two harlot cards to play. If you play more than your two, then I\u2019m going to retaliate, and you won\u2019t enjoy it.\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u2014My wanting children is a recent development, one that has come to a screeching halt now that I\u2019m your captive. Once I get free, I might investigate the possibility further.\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be free of me.\u201d The words sounded like a sentencing. Meeting her gaze, he said, \u201cEvery second we\u2019re together, I get under your skin as deeply as you\u2019ve scarred mine.\u201d</p><p>This was like arguing with a wall. A demonic, flying wall. \u2014What\u2019s your plan now?\u2014</p> <p>\u201cAvoid the war on the plateau below.\u201d The sound of it filtered upward so unceasingly that already it had become a kind of white noise. \u201cWhich means we\u2019ll be staying in this cave until you can create a portal to the mortal realm. From there, I\u2019ll take you to the Skye.\u201d</p><p>\u2014You\u2019re not hearing me. Thronos, if you didn\u2019t know about the attacks, then your knights were acting outside your orders. What\u2019s to stop them from pitching me over the side up there?\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy knights would not have dared harm you.\u201d Had he sounded a touch less smug about that? Less confident?</p><p>She had to keep chipping away at his stubborn beliefs. \u2014This sorceress is predicting some big adjustments in your future. You\u2019re going to have to accept that Vrekeners break their word, and that your chivalrous and valiant knights laughed as they dropped a terrified girl to her death. You\u2019re going to have to accept that your men sought to murder your eleven-year-old mate with a pitchfork while she fought not to scream!\u2014</p><p>For a moment, Thronos looked almost spooked. As of today, she knew what it was like to have one\u2019s lifelong beliefs called into question. It felt a lot like Portia moving a mountain\u2014in your brain. If Lanthe hadn\u2019t known him so well, she could almost have pitied him.</p><p>But she did know him well.</p><p>\u2014As I said, you can verify everything with N\u00efx. For now, your bitterest necessity is too tired to keep arguing. You don\u2019t rate high enough anyway.\u2014 She turned from him, looking for a place to curl up for an hour or two. Right now the raised rock shelf in the back looked like the best bed ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t rate?\u201d he asked. When she didn\u2019t answer, he started talking about that sanctified knowledge again, about being a \u201csword for right,\u201d so she tuned him out, heading toward the back.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you tell me I\u2019m not hearing you?\u201d he said from behind her.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t like to be ignored. Good to know. Ignoring him, she swept her arm over the surface. Though the air was warm inside this cave, the slab was freezing cold. Beggars, choosers, blah. She curled up, closing her eyes.</p><p>Was it only a day ago that she\u2019d been coughing up grit in the tunnel? Since then, she\u2019d suffered a fiery Vrekener crash, a log to the face, and tongue amputation.</p><p>And that was after weeks of captivity.</p><p>I\u2019m not doing too good here. On top of all that, she was trapped in a cave with gold nearby, which left her antsy. She could feel it, could all but smell it, yet she couldn\u2019t reach it, to touch, to worship. Like an itch she couldn\u2019t scratch. No, worse than that\u2014like a blade in the back she couldn\u2019t reach.</p><p>Think of something else. Shivering and miserable, she envisioned her lavish suite in Castle Tornin. Tonight, she\u2019d be in her warm bed, watching movies\u2014rom-coms and epic love stories. Or maybe she\u2019d read a new self-help book.</p><p>Funny\u2014before all this, she\u2019d been chafing at Tornin. She often felt like a third wheel with Rydstrom and Sabine. Things improved when Rydstrom\u2019s sisters visited or when Cadeon and Holly brought the girls, but their visits weren\u2019t frequent enough to satisfy Lanthe.</p><p>Sharing a castle with Sabine and Rydstrom could be trying. Though Lanthe had her own tower in Tornin, she\u2019d still see him kissing Sabine down in the courtyard, or holding her hand just to walk to dinner. Their obvious adoration for each other made Lanthe . . . jealous.</p><p>Not that her sister didn\u2019t deserve every happiness, but Sabine had never even wanted love for herself. Lanthe had dreamed of it for centuries, leaving no stone unturned to find it; yet she was the one alone, with no prospect of it.</p><p>The closest she could get to a lasting relationship was with a murderous Vrekener. Ugh!</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d had even a passing thought that Thronos\u2019s physique was attractive! Damn her Sorceri hormones.</p><p>If she could get back to Rothkalina, she vowed on all the gold in her private vault that she would never chafe again.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes more tightly closed. She was acting as if she\u2019d see home again. If the male pacing this cave had anything to do with it, she\u2019d live out her days in a floating hell.</p><p>Until she jumped.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>At least one of us can sleep. After about half an hour, the sorceress had passed out\u2014while he sat back against a wall of hieroglyphs, watching her.</p><p>She seemed to have blocked him out, ignoring him so totally that he might as well not be here. In a way, ignoring him was precisely what she\u2019d been doing for the last several centuries.</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t rate. To her, he mattered not at all.</p><p>Positioned as she was, her ridiculous excuse for a skirt was riding up. Any higher and he\u2019d be able to see the cleft of her ass. Recalling the feel of those shapely curves in his palms made his shaft stiffen with a swift heat.</p><p>Though he hadn\u2019t slept in weeks, he wouldn\u2019t with Melanthe near, for fear of what he might do to her. Over his adult life, every single one of his dreams had featured her\u2014him doing things to her.</p><p>Sometimes he\u2019d wake to find himself thrusting against the sheets, the pillow, his fist\u2014anything to ease the pressure his body continued to struggle with.</p><p>Culminating like that was considered a disgrace for a mated male. Releasing anywhere outside his mate\u2019s sex was taboo, a waste of a precious resource.</p><p>Soon he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about such things. Once he wed her, he\u2019d wake to find himself thrusting between her thighs.</p><p>In mere days, they\u2019d be back in the Skye. Within his home, he\u2019d take her to his bed\u2014a Bed of Troth.</p><p>Craftsmen had begun carving it for him on the day of his birth, a practice that wasn\u2019t unusual among the more stable Lorean species. For Vrekeners, this lifelong bed was considered hallowed. By law, it was the one place he could claim her.</p><p>Just that act would marry him and Melanthe. They\u2019d be officially bound, and\u2014with the gods\u2019 favor\u2014expecting.</p><p>But now he had another urgent reason to return to his home. If what she said was true and his knights had acted outside his specific orders not to hurt either sister, Thronos was going to rain down punishment.</p><p>Melanthe had once sent Thronos crashing to his doom. Years later, had they done the same to Sabine?</p><p>Not for justice. But for vengeance. The master I now serve.</p><p>Sabine had killed the sovereign of their species, his own father; Thronos could almost accept the idea of assassinating her, their vow notwithstanding.</p><p>But to target Melanthe?</p><p>It made no sense. In one thing she was correct: if he accepted Melanthe\u2019s version of events, then his beliefs would be turned inside out.</p><p>He would investigate thoroughly, keeping her under close guard. For her safety. And ours.</p><p>How was he going to control her powers without that collar . . . ?</p><p>Thronos rolled his head on his neck to loosen the knotted muscles there. Though he should be exhausted, he was wired. Yes, he was alert to danger, feeling less than secure in this place, but it was more.</p><p>That weird feeling of expectancy hit him then, along with an easing within him. Even as constant desire for Melanthe racked him, he was feeling more nonchalant about consequences. He found himself less concerned about missteps and offendments.</p><p>Which could prove ruinous with the temptation sleeping not ten feet from him.</p><p>Were these changes because of her or this place? Both?</p><p>So what would happen to him after six more days here with Melanthe? Perhaps he should head out tomorrow and scout for an alternative portal.</p><p>He heard her sigh in sleep. Without waking, she turned on her side to face him, displaying ample cleavage.</p><p>When he could drag his gaze from her breasts, his eyes followed the seam of her lithe thighs all the way up to the shadow beneath her skirt. He shifted uncomfortably as his length grew even harder.</p><p>Conclusion: the decision to wed her is sound.</p><p>He recalled that Feveris comment she\u2019d made earlier. Thronos had been startled by his reaction. He\u2019d imagined them bespelled with lust, and he\u2019d longed for it.</p><p>In Feveris, he would be incapable of denying her, unable to follow the Vrekener law of marriage before touching, kissing, or claiming. They\u2019d have no urge to leave that place, content just to mate . . . and mate . . . and mate . . .</p><p>He barely stopped himself from stroking his aching member. He knew better than to entertain these imaginings\u2014because Vrekener law left him no recourse for his condition.</p><p>Not yet allowed to touch her body, or ever to pleasure his own.</p><p>Despite this, he wondered what would happen if he woke her with another forbidden kiss.</p><p>At the thought of her opening up to him\u2014her red lips and smooth thighs parting\u2014his shaft began to throb for relief.</p><p>Though inexperienced, he believed he could move her past any hesitations\u2014because so many males had done so before him. And more, she\u2019d admitted to a year of celibacy. For the duration of her imprisonment, he doubted she\u2019d enjoyed any release whatsoever, just as he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She\u2019d likely melt for him.</p><p>Plus, if he wasn\u2019t mistaken, his mate was in season. At his earlier mention of children, he thought her eyes had briefly softened. Might his mate truly yearn for her own brood?</p><p>And thus his seed?</p><p>The idea of planting himself deep inside her sheath and breaking his seal put him into a lather. Especially now when she was fertile and needing. He had to bite back a groan.</p><p>Must get her to a Bed of Troth.</p><p>He turned from her to ram his horns against the wall. He grunted in pain; when had they become so sensitive? His vision briefly blurred, and he could swear he\u2019d read words among the incomprehensible glyphs:</p><p>SACRIFICE THE PURE, WORSHIP THE MIGHTY, BEHOLD A TEMPLE UNEQUALED.</p><p>He jerked back. No, that wasn\u2019t possible. Though Thronos knew several languages, Demonish\u2014especially primitive Demonish\u2014was not among them.</p><p>There must be something in the air, making his vision play tricks on him. This place is getting to me. Even now the reasons he couldn\u2019t touch his mate grew dimmer.</p><p>He shook his head hard, attention easily returning to her. Her eyes darted behind her lids, her shoulders twitching. Was she always this fitful a sleeper? His first impulse was to take her into his wings. His second impulse was to take her into his arms, into his hands.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t. Though he now believed she was innocent of the worst of the crimes at Castle Tornin, she was still a liar and a thief who\u2019d bedded scores of men. Already she had him doubting his own knights, who were epitomes of honor and forthrightness.</p><p>How could Thronos desire someone he\u2019d long detested? He\u2019d be damned if he valued her when she didn\u2019t value herself. He knew one thing that would cool his need like an ice storm, a memory that made his hatred seethe.</p><p>He\u2019d been eighteen, closer to finding her than he\u2019d been since the fall. Accompanied by his brother, Aristo, the new king of the Territories, Thronos had followed her sorcery to a hamlet, one sitting low between mountains, nearly hidden from the skies.</p><p>Though that night was centuries distant, he remembered each detail as if they\u2019d been branded into his mind.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Lanthe woke, going from deep sleep to instant awareness.</p><p>How long had she been out? She tested her tongue . . . almost healed.</p><p>Even as weary as she\u2019d been, she was surprised she\u2019d slept. The siren call of gold still plagued her. Not to mention that a Vrekener hovered nearby.</p><p>He was presently limping/pacing. Had he rested at all?</p><p>Feigning sleep, she cracked her lids like the sneaky sorceress that she was.</p><p>His gaze was distant, eyes flickering silver. What was he thinking about? Perhaps he had lowered some of his blocks, and she could probe his thoughts.</p><p>Delving, delving\u2014</p><p>In. His blocks were down!</p><p>Thronos was recollecting some distant memory from when he was a teenager. He\u2019d been walking with another Vrekener, one around the same age who resembled him somewhat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, yes, she\u2019d seen that male before, had a long and storied history with him.</p><p>She swallowed, spying as Thronos\u2019s memory played on. . . .</p><p>Anticipation burned inside him. After years of searching, he\u2019d scented his mate the minute he and Aristo had arrived in this valley. Hastening down a winding lane, he glanced up at every window.</p> <p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand your eagerness to reunite with her,\u201d Aristo said, following him. \u201cEvery limping step I took and every league flown in agony would fill me with rage. How can you forgive her?\u201d</p><p>Because Thronos had put himself in her shoes to understand that night. \u201cShe was only a little girl. Her parents had just been decapitated, her beloved sister killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs they should have been. The parents threatened Lore secrecy with their palpable sorcery outlays, and the sister murdered our father the king!\u201d</p><p>Aristo thinks exactly like him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you believe your mate will forgive you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I tell her how Father truly found out about the abbey, she\u2019ll know I was blameless.\u201d When they passed a tavern with a large window, Thronos spied his reflection, scowling at the scars.</p><p>Aristo caught his reaction. \u201cShe\u2019d promised to be a little beauty, hadn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So?\u201d Thronos knew she would be the most comely female he\u2019d ever seen. She had already been. He\u2019d spent endless hours imagining what she would look like now.</p><p>\u201cSorceri are fickle creatures, brother. In addition to all the pain between you, it might be that she forsakes you for your looks. Have you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>Of course. Every time he saw his reflection. \u201cShe\u2019s my mate; we\u2019re fated, and she felt it too.\u201d That last day, when she\u2019d turned to him so sweetly and sighed\u2014</p><p>\u201cMayhap you merely need to copulate?\u201d</p> <p>He did. With Melanthe. Gods, how he did! But Thronos had waited this long; somehow he\u2019d wait the two more years until she turned eighteen and could be claimed. Twenty-four more months by Vrekener law. It seemed like an eternity, especially with the way his curiosity and lusts had been building.</p><p>He wondered if any other eighteen-year-old male could possibly think about intercourse as much as he did.</p><p>\u201cI fear you set yourself up for disappointment,\u201d Aristo said.</p><p>\u201cSo you think I should give her up, without even trying? Just forget it. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>His brother hadn\u2019t found his mate, and likely wouldn\u2019t for decades, if not centuries. Thronos had been an anomaly to find his so young.</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanthe is\u201d\u2014everything missing from my life\u2014\u201cmy ideal female.\u201d She wasn\u2019t thus because she was faultless, but because he adored even her faults. He didn\u2019t just want her; he needed her. They were each halves of a greater whole.</p><p>Why was that so difficult for others to understand? \u201cShe\u2019s mine,\u201d he said simply.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at war with them,\u201d Aristo couldn\u2019t resist pointing out.</p><p>\u201cThen mayhap we shouldn\u2019t be. . . .\u201d He trailed off, homing in on her. \u201cThe building at the end of the lane,\u201d he said over his shoulder, already hurrying forward. \u201cThere\u2019s a dwelling above.\u201d</p><p>Heartbeat pounding, he alighted on the windowsill. Melanthe! She was in a bed asleep. Holding his breath, he crept inside.</p><p>A sharp exhalation left him. Melanthe was a woman now.</p><p>He greedily took in every new detail. He\u2019d known she would grow to be lovely, but she was beyond his wildest fantasies. Her lashes were thick against her pale face, her black hair a silken cloud around her head. The sheet gathered at her waist, allowing him to see the swells of her breasts beneath her filmy nightgown.</p><p>The generous swells.</p><p>Her nipples strained against the thin material.</p><p>To see her like this made his heart twist in his chest\u2014and blood pool in his groin. He no longer felt his old injuries.</p><p>To see her like this, he could forgive her anything.</p><p>How am I to wait two years?</p><p>He\u2019d had no idea what to say or do once he finally found her. Now the answer was startlingly clear: sit beside her on the bed, wake her with a caress, and explain the truth of that night to her.</p><p>He hated the pain he was about to bring her, knew she would feel guilt for her actions. But he had to clear the air between them\u2014</p><p>An older vampire traced into the room, carrying bottles of wine. Thronos tensed to attack, to protect his mate.</p><p>\u201cLanthe, I\u2019m back,\u201d the male said, unaware of him, gone motionless in the shadows.</p><p>She sat up, rubbing her eyes with a smile. \u201cMarco.\u201d</p><p>The vampire Marco smelled of her. And she . . . of him.</p><p>Thronos was frozen, unable to comprehend what he was seeing. Melanthe was too young to be bedding anyone!</p><p>His senses were mistaken.</p><p>The vampire caught sight of him then, eyes going wide. Both males leapt for her, but the leech traced, reaching her first. He teleported Melanthe across the room.</p><p>She blinked in astonishment. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is this?\u201d the vampire demanded.</p><p>Thronos found his voice. \u201cMelanthe, I need to speak\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an enemy,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cOne I\u2019d hoped never to see again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, sweet.\u201d The vampire traced them away.</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d Thronos bellowed.</p><p>To be this close! Frenzied, he scanned the room for some clue to where she might have been taken. He would find her again!</p><p>He frowned at the bed\u2014at the blood on the sheets.</p><p>Her virgin\u2019s blood? The room seemed to spin. Can\u2019t . . . this cannot be . . .</p><p>But it was. She\u2019d given that male her virtue on this very night. Despite belonging to me!</p><p>Clawing at his chest, he threw back his head and roared like an animal. All the physical pain in his body flared, nearly putting him to his knees.</p><p>Aristo yelled for him, arriving seconds later. His narrowed gaze took in the scene. \u201cAnother male?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound surprised.</p><p>The vampire\u2019s skin had been unmarked and smooth.</p><p>Blood on the sheets. He claimed my Melanthe. Thronos turned away and vomited.</p><p>Aristo snapped, \u201cWill you forgive her now?\u201d</p><p>Dazed, he let his brother lead him away. Before long, he was swilling the spirits Aristo offered. Not long after that, Aristo suggested they enter a forbidden house of flesh. Thronos deemed this an excellent idea.</p><p>Offendments be damned; he was determined to drink his sorrows away\u2014and to bury himself in another woman.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. Any other female\u2019s scent was repellent to him. He knew of no Vrekener who could stray from a mate.</p><p>Thronos would claim Melanthe. Or none at all.</p><p>As the months passed, he\u2019d convinced himself that she had to have been pressured by the older vampire to surrender her virtue. Once he found her again, Thronos would take her away, tearing her from the male\u2019s influence.</p><p>He\u2019d been convinced\u2014until he\u2019d seen her the next year with a tall fey male. Laughing, the two had run through a portal rift. When the pair had kissed as they\u2019d crossed, Melanthe had wounded Thronos far more than her command to jump ever had. . . .</p><p>Lanthe struggled to regulate her breathing after what she\u2019d just witnessed: his memory of their first meeting after his fall.</p><p>She\u2019d felt his devastation at finding her in Marco\u2019s bed. She\u2019d experienced firsthand the sickness that had taken hold in him, the disbelief. She\u2019d been scalded by his violent jealousy and rocked from the agony of his injuries.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought he could wait two years to claim her; he\u2019d waited centuries.</p><p>Somehow she kept her lids half-closed, her breaths deep and even. The identity of his companion had shocked her as much as anything else she\u2019d learned.</p><p>The male with the pitchfork, the one who\u2019d dropped her sister upon cobblestones was . . . Aristo.</p><p>King of the Vrekeners. Thronos\u2019s older brother.</p><p>Obviously, Aristo hadn\u2019t given a damn that Lanthe was Thronos\u2019s mate. The king had wanted her and Sabine dead. If Thronos forced Lanthe to Skye Hall, would Aristo finish her once and for all? How the hell was she going to convince Thronos of this?</p><p>Well, Vrekener, I was scratching around inside your brain, and oops, I witnessed a memory that you would be humiliated for me to see. I realized the sadistic thug who reveled in my pain is your brother! Oh, and your king! He prolly helped raise you after my sis beheaded your dad.</p><p>She now understood why Thronos hadn\u2019t known about the attacks. Who would rat out their leader?</p><p>Looking as sick as he\u2019d been that night, Thronos sank back against a column, then slipped to the ground to sit with bent knees. He tipped his head back, staring at the ceiling, his striking eyes lost. He was wondering if he\u2019d ever be free of her hold. Maybe in death, he thought.</p><p>She stared at his face, then the skin of his chest, both scarred because of her. How fiercely he hated those marks!</p><p>And she\u2019d mauled his mind even worse.</p><p>She\u2019d known his seeing her with another would have to hurt, but she hadn\u2019t even plumbed the depths. Despite all the anguish she\u2019d suffered at the hands of his kind, she ached for the young man he\u2019d been.</p><p>At that age, he\u2019d thought she was ideal. He\u2019d planned to forgive her for his injuries.</p><p>Until she\u2019d inadvertently dealt him a wound he\u2019d never recovered from.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t wrap her head around all she\u2019d learned. Had someone else told his father about the abbey? And what was the \u201ctruth of that night\u201d? Thronos had been so certain she would forgive him.</p><p>It frightened her how badly she wanted him to be blameless, even as the truth struck her: if he was, then he hadn\u2019t deserved any of the suffering she\u2019d\u2014purposely or unwittingly\u2014caused.</p><p>I broke a little boy\u2019s body.</p><p>And a young man\u2019s heart.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>When Lanthe woke again, night still clung to the realm, the battle ongoing. Perhaps both were endless here.</p><p>Thronos was gone, probably out sourcing food. Since she didn\u2019t eat meat, she had scant hope for her own breakfast. Would he remember the time he\u2019d tried to hunt for her?</p><p>She was surprised he\u2019d left her alone, not that she could escape. She rose, testing her tongue\u2014all healed!\u2014and stretched her stiff muscles. If she felt this rough sleeping on the cold stone, she could only imagine how he\u2019d felt. If he\u2019d slept.</p><p>Eager to wash the grit from her skin and hair, she crossed to the cave opening, removing her gauntlets and boots along the way. Rain poured, spattering the lava on either side of the entrance, producing steam tendrils. Sidling near the very edge, she commanded herself not to look down as she reached for warm rainwater.</p><p>Most Lore species were fastidious. Yet she hadn\u2019t had a shower in weeks, had been forced to bathe with freezing water from a sink.</p><p>She drank from her cupped hands, rinsing her mouth of residual blood, then removed her underwear and breastplate to clean them and as much of her body as she could. While she washed, she reflected on all she\u2019d learned in the last two days and came to a startling realization: I have nothing to hate Thronos for.</p><p>At least from the past. He was innocent of the crimes she\u2019d pegged him for. He hadn\u2019t had a direct hand in Sabine\u2019s deaths, had even taken pains to prevent them. She now believed he\u2019d kept secret the location of the abbey.</p><p>Did she wish he\u2019d given her a heads-up that his father was going to attack that night? Absolutely. And she wished Thronos had kept a better leash on his men\u2014on his brother\u2014but she couldn\u2019t have expected him to. In no universe would he not have trusted the word of another Vrekener.</p><p>After last night, her chronic anxiety over surprise attacks had begun to fade at last. She now knew who her enemy was: Aristo. And where their next encounter would be: Skye Hell, if Thronos got his way.</p><p>If Lanthe could be freed of that overriding anxiety, would her powers bloom?</p><p>After unbraiding her hair, she smoothed water over it. Once she\u2019d rinsed it clean, she painstakingly plaited it into braids around her face. The rest she left to curl down her back.</p><p>She was glad of this time alone to digest everything that had happened\u2014and to consider her burgeoning interest in Thronos. After she\u2019d fallen back asleep, still heartsick at his memory, she\u2019d had vivid dreams of him.</p><p>In one, he\u2019d kissed her in the rain. He\u2019d grasped her face between his palms, brushing his thumbs along her cheekbones; then he\u2019d set in, his pained groans rumbling along her lips as he\u2019d taken her mouth with furious need\u2014until they were sharing breaths, until he\u2019d stoked her own desperation.</p><p>Lanthe had never been kissed like that. Like the male would die if she didn\u2019t part her lips and return it.</p><p>In another, she\u2019d traced her fingertips over every scar on his naked body, then followed her touches with her lips and tongue. He\u2019d shuddered with sensitivity\u2014but he\u2019d bowed his rugged chest for more. . . .</p><p>She exhaled a breath, determined not to think about him like that\u2014or to even acknowledge that her nipples were stiffening in the sultry air. She arched her back, letting rain patter over her, cooling her breasts. She wished she could say these were the first sensual dreams she\u2019d had of him. They weren\u2019t, and over the year since their last encounter, these reveries had grown more numerous.</p><p>She gazed out into the night. Surely Thronos would return soon. She dressed again, was reaching for her gauntlets\u2014</p><p>A sound behind her. She whirled around.</p><p>The back wall of the cave was opening, directly where she\u2019d sensed the gold. Thronos strode out, looking bored, while behind him was . . .</p><p>Heaven.</p><p>His mate had caught sight of the golden temple he\u2019d found, and now looked like her legs were about to buckle. \u201cDid I see correctly?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ah, her tongue was working again. Soon he\u2019d be treated to more of her lies. But she wasn\u2019t a master deceiver, not like he\u2019d expected. She had tells, and he was learning them.</p><p>In his absence, she\u2019d cleaned herself. Her skin was scrubbed, looking rosier, highlighting the blue of her eyes. Her raven hair was drying into glossy braids and big curls.</p><p>He craved threading his fingers through that length.</p> <p>To see it streaming over his chest as he held her close. . . .</p><p>Inward shake. Without those gauntlets, she appeared more delicate. Smaller somehow. He assessed the rest of her \u201cgarments\u201d with a disapproving eye. When he got her to the Skye, he\u2019d see to it that she dressed appropriately.</p><p>\u201cThronos, is there gold behind that stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A temple of it, built with gold bricks from floor to soaring ceiling. Even I found it wondrous to behold.\u201d</p><p>She sounded like she\u2019d muffled a whimper.</p> <p>When the heavy door began easing closed, she sprinted for it. The stone sealed shut before she could reach it. \u201cOpen this again!\u201d Her tone was frantic. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, dismissively striding to the cliff edge of the cave. Behind him, he could hear her digging around for an entry she\u2019d never find.</p><p>For once, he would ignore her. He stared out at the horizon, taking in the storms over the swamplands\u2014the slow fade of lightning strikes backlighting purple clouds. So different from his home in the heavens.</p><p>The Air Territories were a collection of floating islands, massive monoliths that hovered above the clouds. His realm was crowned forever by seamless skies\u2014unbroken blue or star-filled black.</p><p>Skye Hall was the royal seat, but every island had its own city, each laid out with precision. All the buildings were angular and uniform, with sun-bleached walls. His home was a testament to order, an anchor for steadfast Vrekeners.</p><p>Unlike this plane.</p> <p>The scene before Thronos was chaotic. Yet he found it surprisingly . . . arresting. Was there some kind of appeal to this entire domain?</p><p>His restlessness increased, that damned expectancy redoubling. He needed to get back to his anchor as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cHow did you open this, Thronos?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d read the instructions. Over this interminable night, Thronos had come to a conclusion: not reading the glyphs was cowardly; he was no coward.</p><p>This language might not even be demonic in nature. It could be some kind of mystical tongue that only certain Loreans could read. Perhaps only the worthy.</p><p>Like himself.</p><p>And, he\u2019d reasoned, reading would help him learn about this plane. So he\u2019d started at the outer cave wall, making his way in. Some sections had degraded with age, but he\u2019d been able to glean that this cave was the entry to an ancient temple for dragon worship\u2014and ritual sacrifice.</p><p>This hadn\u2019t alarmed him. Dragons weren\u2019t likely to roam war-torn Pandemonia; they\u2019d gone extinct in most dimensions.</p> <p>Then he\u2019d come upon instructions to enter the temple, and had easily opened the door. He\u2019d found a scene that would prove to be his mate\u2019s most fevered fantasy.</p><p>Everyone knew Sorceri loved gold. Thronos had firsthand knowledge of just how much.</p><p>He remembered a day when Melanthe hadn\u2019t come to the meadow. She hadn\u2019t felt well the day before, and he\u2019d been worried. He\u2019d flown to her home, stealing across the roof, trying to scent her room amidst the sorcery. He\u2019d scrabbled down the side of the abbey to a window, peeking inside. . . .</p><p>A black-haired woman with an immense gold headpiece and crazed blue eyes was rubbing coins against her masked face, murmuring, \u201cGold is life! It is perfection!\u201d She began to speak to each piece, as if she\u2019d met it at the market to gossip.</p><p>Chills raced over him. He\u2019d never seen a madwoman before, and he believed she was Melanthe\u2019s own mother.</p><p>Sorcery steeped the room as she chanted about gold: \u201cBand it in armor over thy heart, and never will thy life\u2019s blood part. Gild your hair and face and skin, and no man breathes that you can\u2019t win. Never too much can a sorceress steal, those who defend she duly kills\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her eyes suddenly met his. He jolted back, but she cried, \u201cI seeeee you. Come, hawkling. Visit a sorceress in her lair.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, then eased over to crouch on the sill, ready for flight. Behind her were piles of gold coins and bars, more than anyone could spend in a lifetime. Melanthe\u2019s family had wealth; why would they let her go hungry?</p><p>\u201cSo you are the one who gives my Melanthe her new smiles,\u201d the woman said. \u201cShe raises her gaze forever to the sky and floats when she walks\u2014as if she\u2019s still flying with you.\u201d</p><p>He was forever gazing earthward, as if he could watch over her.</p><p>\u201cEarthward, then, Thronos Talos of Skye Hall?\u201d</p><p>The sorceress was reading his mind!</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t last. Melanthe will never be what you need her to be. You can\u2019t break my daughter, and that\u2019s the only way she\u2019d love you . . . .\u201d</p><p>Thronos didn\u2019t want Melanthe\u2019s love, had no desire for it. He would break her\u2014but only to make her become what he needed. And he\u2019d start by using this temple against her, getting answers out of her.</p><p>From behind him, she cried, \u201cWhy would you keep me from such a place?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. The distress on her face was priceless. She was practically vibrating with eagerness. He repeated her words: \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Must get in! Behind this door was more gold than Lanthe had ever witnessed in one place. Even the great Morgana, queen of the Sorceri, didn\u2019t have that much in her possession.</p><p>How could Thronos deny her?</p><p>Lanthe had already been on edge from his memory, then from her own dreams. She turned back to the stone, resting her body against it, raising her arms over her head\u2014for more of her skin to touch the door that separated her from heaven. She remained like this, as if she could melt through.</p><p>He might as well be here blocking her way, her body pressed against his. He was the key! She had to convince him. Think, Lanthe! What did he want from her?</p><p>She faced him again. \u201cPlease, you can\u2019t keep me from it!\u201d</p><p>He sat on the ground, one knee bent, a casual arm resting over it. \u201cI found it. I claimed it. My temple, my gold\u2014I make the rules.\u201d</p><p>There was something about his domineering tone that was weirdly arousing. Even though she was filled with turmoil, her nipples tightened again. She bit her bottom lip, wondering how far she\u2019d go to sway him.</p><p>If she could just touch the gold, take its song into her . . .</p><p>She hastened over to kneel between his legs. He looked startled, but that didn\u2019t stop him from widening his legs to accommodate her\u2014so she moved in closer.</p><p>That electricity sparking between them made her hyper-aware of his body, of his heat. His shirt was hanging on only by a low button, revealing his chest, which rose and fell with his shallowed breaths.</p><p>When his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed, she peeked down and found his shaft growing. It was only semihard, but already . . . generous. Demons were notorious for their size. I hope this one\u2019s a show-er and not a grower, or I\u2019m a dead woman.</p><p>No, no! There would be no intercourse with a Vrekener! So stop staring at his cock, Lanthe. Dragging her gaze up, she cleared her throat. \u201cThronos, beyond that wall is nothing less than heaven for me. Why would you keep me from it?\u201d she asked, noticing that he had gold dust on one side of his neck. Did the temple rain gold? The thought made her pant.</p><p>He frowned at her reaction. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you from it because\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was cut short when she grabbed one of his horns and pulled his head to the side. \u201cGold dust,\u201d she murmured, unable to help herself. \u201cGive me this first.\u201d His skin smelled as sublime as the gold. With a moan, she leaned in to rub her face against it, to get his gold on her. She rubbed her other cheek, then drew back.</p><p>A smattering remained right over his pulse point\u2014which was palpitating along with his thundering heart.</p><p>Too much temptation! She dipped down to press her open mouth over his neck, feeling his pulse beneath her tongue, taking in the cool gold mixed with his own delectable taste. She shivered with delight. Once she\u2019d licked him, she leaned in beside his ear to whisper, \u201cI never knew you\u2019d taste so good.\u201d</p><p>His big body shuddered, bringing her back to reality. Oh, gods, was she actually gripping his horn? Releasing him, she drew back to face him.</p><p>His expression was . . . dazed, his pupils blown, his eyes glazed with lust. He shifted where he sat, no doubt because his erection was paining him. His claws dug into his palms as he fought not to touch her.</p><p>In that moment an epiphany struck her, as bright and shining as the temple of gold just one door away from her.</p><p>She could enchant this male.</p><p>In their history, she\u2019d befriended him, run from him, fought him, and spurned him. But she\u2019d never tried to tempt him. She was descended from the enchantment caste of the mystical immortal species. She wasn\u2019t without innate skills.</p><p>Plus, she had centuries of sexual experience over this hard-up virgin novice. Though she\u2019d never take it too far, she could tempt him up to a point. She\u2019d run circles around him, wrapping him around her little finger.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t want him to take her to the Skye, then all she had to do was ask him very, very nicely.</p><p>When she slowly grinned, his gaze dipped to her lips, so she licked them. His brows drew together, and he swallowed thickly.</p><p>Your ass is mine, Vrekener.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Please take me back there, love.\u201d Melanthe\u2019s eyes were shimmering blue, her cheeks sparkling with gold.</p><p>Never in Thronos\u2019s imaginings had he thought, She might lick my neck.</p><p>The decision to wed this creature is very sound.</p><p>She kept touching him\u2014with her hands, with her mouth\u2014and each contact made pleasure explode through him. She might not like his appearance, but she\u2019d liked his taste. All his earlier plans seemed to evaporate, his mind shuttling to fantasies best left buried.</p><p>I could coax her to taste other parts of me. Feeding his shaft between her red lips . . .</p><p>Or he could taste her, wringing a climax from her with his tongue. At the thought of licking between her thighs, he was seized by the urge to toss her to the ground and feast.</p><p>His claws dug into his palms, the bite of pain helping him focus. Somewhat. \u201cWhy should I take you back there? Why should I make any concession for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your mate needs to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so now you say you\u2019re my mate.\u201d</p><p>When she slinked even closer, her scent\u2014a mix of home, sky, and woman\u2014boggled his mind. \u201cIf that entitles me to fifty percent of your gold, then yes, I\u2019m your mate.\u201d</p><p>Where was her hostility? He could handle himself when she was a typical hateful sorceress, but this was throwing him. \u201cIf you see it, you\u2019ll desire it. Then what? It\u2019s not as if we can take it with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be enough just to touch it, to answer its call.\u201d</p><p>Like touching a talisman.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say to convince you? Thronos, you can\u2019t understand what the element is to me.\u201d</p><p>He spoke before he considered his words: \u201cIt\u2019s life to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she nodded. \u201cYes! Gold is life. It\u2019s as beautiful as love, as divine as laughter.\u201d She took his hand, raising it. When she made him trail the backs of his fingers over the soft skin above her breastplate, he just stifled a growl.</p><p>\u201cGold is this\u201d\u2014she pressed his palm flat over her chest\u2014\u201cnext\u201d\u2014he dipped a thumb into her cleavage\u2014\u201cheartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing; his must have stopped. Don\u2019t squeeze her plump flesh, don\u2019t squeeze. . . .</p><p>She laid her own hands on his thighs, shifting her weight to her straightened arms, which pushed his thumb deeper between her creamy breasts. \u201cYou want to show me your gold. You want my fingers wrapped around your gold, stroking it.\u201d</p><p>Trying to command him? With a scowl, he dragged his hand away. \u201cYour power isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t persuading you.\u201d She inched her hands higher, nearly to his groin. \u201cI was seeing if I could get you to substitute a certain noun for the word gold.\u201d She pressed her thumbs in, indicating what she meant.</p><p>You want to show me your shaft. You want my fingers wrapped around your shaft, stroking it. When she gazed down at his erection, he almost rocked his hips. Yes, he did want to show it to her. So she could touch him, suck him. . . .</p><p>He hissed in a breath between his teeth. How much more of this could he be expected to resist? He needed to get space between them. \u201cI have conditions before I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something that will ease my wrath a degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She gazed up at the ceiling for a moment before facing him again. \u201cI had sensual dreams about you earlier.\u201d</p><p>If true, this was at once encouraging and infuriating to him. \u201cOnce? I\u2019ve had them of you every time I\u2019ve slept!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was the first time we\u2019ve been wicked together. In my dreams.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted. What wicked things did she dream of him doing to her?</p><p>\u201cClearly that eased your wrath a jot. Now, what\u2019s your next condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m to show you my treasures\u2014you\u2019re to show me yours,\u201d he said, shocked by his own words. He\u2019d planned to get answers out of her; all of a sudden, he\u2019d begun angling to see her unclothed!</p><p>Nudity in his culture was taboo. Even husbands and wives were expected to be clothed around each other at all times. When he took Melanthe in a Bed of Troth, there\u2019d be a claiming sheet between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want me to strip for you?\u201d she asked in a demure tone.</p><p>He\u2019d started down this road. . . . Voice gone hoarse, he said, \u201cYes, if you enter that temple, you\u2019ll bare yourself inside it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d In a blur, she\u2019d risen and was already at the door.</p> <p>She\u2019d acquiesced? Despite her Sorceri blood, he\u2019d thought she would put up at least a show of resistance, and that they would negotiate: perhaps she\u2019d only agree to revealing her breasts, et cetera.</p><p>Instead, the shameless sorceress had agreed to all. He felt like he was in a battle that had just gone sideways, like he should be jerking his head back and forth to understand his new position.</p><p>As he rose to join her, he wondered, What else will she agree to? And his mouth went dry.</p><p>She smiled up at him, her lips curling proudly. She was aware of her power over males, had lorded it over so many. She took his arm between both of hers, standing unaccountably close to him.</p><p>So the temptress was using her wiles on him? The thought should fill him with anger. Not excitement.</p> <p>He must remember that this creature was descended from the greatest enchantresses ever to live. He had to be mindful of all her conquests, the ones who\u2019d fallen before him.</p><p>\u201cIs there a hidden lever, then? A combination to open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A combination.\u201d As per the instructions, he\u2019d pressed in one hieroglyph, spun another, then ratcheted down a third. \u201cTurn around while I open it.\u201d</p><p>Again, she went against his expectations by complying. \u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t difficult,\u201d he said, unwilling to tell her, knowing she would attribute his comprehension to his alleged demon blood.</p><p>Press, spin, ratchet. The door opened once more.</p> <p>She barreled past him, as if she feared he\u2019d change his mind. Just inside, she drew up short. As her slim shoulders began to tremble, he tried to see the area through her eyes.</p><p>The temple was round, constructed of solid gold slabs and bricks that seemed to catch and magnify the weak light filtering in. A dais stood in the center, with gold benches fanning out from it, like arena seating.</p><p>The golden ceiling was divided into five wedges, each with different glyphs, like those in the cave. More had been carved into the floor-to-ceiling gold walls.</p><p>Still reeling from her assault on his senses, he decided to put space between him and temptation. Twenty feet above them was a shining shelf. He leapt up to it, crouching on one knee to watch his mate\u2019s love affair begin.</p><p>Slowly, she reached out her hand to one of the walls. . . .</p><p>Contact. She visibly shuddered, as if she\u2019d touched a live wire. Would she react so sensually during intercourse?</p><p>With a look of wonder, she ran her fingers over a row of gold bricks, her eyes glimmering.</p><p>She was experiencing joy. The last time he\u2019d experienced that for himself had been on their final day in the meadow. Rain had fallen, and he\u2019d taken her under his wings. . . .</p> <p>Now she hastened to the dais, spinning in place atop it, laughing with delight. When they\u2019d been young, the sound of her laughter had made his heart swell. Now that sound affected a different part of his anatomy.</p><p>Perhaps he would approach joy once more when he saw his mate\u2019s body for the first time.</p><p>Lanthe hadn\u2019t caught her breath since she\u2019d entered, her captivated gaze taking in every detail.</p><p>Happiness coursed through her veins. How had clever Thronos found this place?</p><p>Though she was in a room full of gold, her attention veered to him, crouched on that shelf. The muscles of his torso flexed with his movements. His stern, intense expression and that gargoyle-like position made him look very demonic.</p><p>She\u2019d never bedded a demon before. Huh.</p><p>Yet as she strolled the temple, his constant scowl eased. Without that scowl, he was . . . gorgeous.</p><p>There was no more denying it\u2014or her attraction to him.</p><p>Some females might consider his scars unsightly. Lanthe thought they made him look tough and warlord-y. Besides, who could care about them when those silver eyes were so compelling? When his warrior\u2019s body seemed to have been sculpted from granite?</p><p>He\u2019d once believed that she was \u201ceverything missing\u201d from his life. Could he still feel that way? And why was she contemplating these things\u2014instead of how to transpo this gold to Rothkalina or calculating karats?</p><p>Why did she have the urge to peer up at him with equal captivation? She surrendered to her impulse, turning to him. He seemed surprised by her perusal but held her gaze.</p><p>They were\u2014dare she say it?\u2014having a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou face me when surrounded by gold? Perhaps I rate after all?\u201d The scowl returned, as if he was hardening himself. She wanted to cry, No, no, no, just a few more minutes!</p><p>\u201cWe had a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI grow impatient.\u201d</p><p>She could imagine\u2014he\u2019d waited so long to see her. And now she knew he\u2019d already been struggling with his lust and curiosity when he\u2019d been a young man.</p><p>A deal was a deal. She would take the sight of this gold into her, a memory to last forever. Unless I can return. . . .</p><p>\u201cBe about it, sorceress.\u201d</p><p>Since she\u2019d planned to enthrall him, this would be a good start, but the way he was crouching forward, as if on the verge of pouncing, made her hesitate. \u201cIf I do this, how do I know you won\u2019t try to touch me? You\u2019re not supposed to, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only intend to look,\u201d he said, though she could sense his aggression mounting.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, then.\u201d When she still hesitated, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t feign shyness\u2014I know you\u2019ve done this with a horde of males before me.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, her interest was checked. Though she was neither ashamed nor proud of the number of men she\u2019d been with, his cruel jabs wounded her.</p><p>At least now she better understood his resentment. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to put myself in a sexual situation with you.\u201d</p><p>He growled at that. \u201cAfter your purported year of celibacy, I would expect you to be climbing the walls for any male\u2019s attentions. And if I\u2019m not mistaken, you\u2019re in season.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, lips thinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard tales of females like you.\u201d At her raised brows, he enunciated the words, \u201cEasy quarry.\u201d</p><p>How could a maddened Vrekener hurt her so much?</p><p>Because he once looked at you with perfect acceptance, Lanthe. And she feared she\u2019d been searching for that look ever since she\u2019d lost it.</p><p>In order for her to be interested in a male, he needed to make her feel special\u2014even if she knew it was a ruse. Despite Thronos\u2019s mind-blowing body and heartbreaking past, he stood no chance. \u201cEven we \u2018easy quarry\u2019 girls have standards. And you, Thronos Talos, are leaving me cold.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cI could seduce you with ease. You\u2019ve welcomed scores before me with only minuscule effort on their part. But I\u2019ve no intention of taking you, nor even of touching you. Both are offendments. I only want to see my female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can resist seeing your mate naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t?\u201d A cunning light shone in his gaze. \u201cYou Sorceri like to gamble? To make bets? Then I\u2019ll enter into a wager with you\u2014my first.\u201d</p><p>Dudley Do-Right makes a bet.</p><p>\u201cIf your body tempts me to touch it, then I\u2019ll tell you how I found this temple and opened the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t tempt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blow to your enchantress pride would be reward enough.\u201d</p><p>That is it! Now it was imperative to wipe that smirk off his face. \u201cI\u2019ll take your bet.\u201d She thought she spied a flash of surprise in his expression. \u201cNo sex, though.\u201d</p><p>He glowered, as if she\u2019d suggested something ludicrous. \u201cI\u2019ll breed no bastards! Already my offspring will be half Sorceri. Do you think I\u2019d allow the first to be illegitimate on top of that?\u201d</p><p>Asshole! Only Thronos could ruin this: her, in a temple full of gold with a physically attractive male. He was like the anti-Sorceri\u2014created to repel her.</p><p>Forget enchanting him! He didn\u2019t deserve her beguilement. \u201cI\u2019ll remember this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you kill joy wherever you find it.\u201d She gave him her back as she unfastened the first of three clips on the side of her breastplate.</p><p>Had his breaths quickened?</p><p>She gazed over her shoulder, saw his claws digging into the gold shelf, his throat working. His voice dropped an octave when he commanded, \u201cOff with it.\u201d</p><p>She unfastened the second clip.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he murmured, his words dripping with pent-up lust.</p><p>As she was undoing the last clip, she heard something from beyond the main cave, and paused. The sound came again, growing in volume\u2014movement down the mountainside. Something big was approaching. \u201cThronos, what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard nothing. Continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, demon!\u201d She began fastening the clips again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear out there!\u201d</p><p>When the entire temple rocked, she snapped, \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>He made a coarse sound of frustration; then she heard the swoop of his wings. She whirled around to find him charging toward her, that determined look on his grave face.</p><p>His eyes appeared to have darkened, and she could swear his horns were straightening\u2014just like a demon\u2019s would when he became aroused.</p><p>In other words, Thronos doesn\u2019t live here anymore.</p><p>Reaching for her, he bit out, \u201cTo tide me over.\u201d</p><p>Till when?!</p><p>A roar sounded in the cave. Seeming to wake out of a daze, Thronos dropped his hands. And she could have sworn upstanding Dudley Do-Right grated, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Thronos lunged for her, shoving her behind the stone door that led to the main cave. He pulled her close, then wrapped a protective wing around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI smell a creature, but scarcely trust my senses. I thought they were going extinct across all worlds.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be talking about a dragon? When she heard some great beast breathing at the outer cave entrance, she shuddered. Two bright lights blazed inside like a car\u2019s high beams.</p><p>Thronos craned his head around the door to catch a glimpse. His heart pounded at whatever he\u2019d seen.</p><p>She delved into his thoughts . . . then sucked in a breath.</p><p>A dragon had its head in the cave opening, its brilliant yellow eyes glowing. Heated air blurred around its nose. Its scales were onyx and silver, glinting like metal.</p><p>She switched to telepathy. \u2014This place, the benches . . . \u2014</p><p>As if reciting something, he muttered, \u201cSacrifice the pure, worship the mighty, behold a temple unequaled.\u201d</p><p>So this place was dedicated to virgin sacrifice for mighty dragons? She wasn\u2019t surprised. Many demon cultures worshipped dragons. Rydstrom had the image of one tattooed on his side.</p><p>In Rothkalina\u2019s Grave Realm, the badlands of the kingdom, basilisks roamed wild. Lanthe had gone to visit them with Sabine a few times. Her sister had the power to communicate with animals, and had gotten to know one or two well.</p><p>But Lanthe wasn\u2019t Sabine. And this dragon looked hungry for a sacrifice.</p><p>If she weren\u2019t petrified, she might have laughed. Lanthe was no cherry-holder of yore; the dragon would probably spit her out like a pit.</p><p>The headlights shining into the cave shuttered off and on. Oh, gods, the dragon had blinked. Then the entire mountain rocked and claws skittered into the cave. Had the beast shoved its lethal paw inside?</p><p>The dragon sounded like it was blindly patting around the cave, reaching all the way to this door. It must have locked in on them!</p><p>Pat . . . pat . . . pat . . . pat.</p><p>Oh, yeah, the dragon knew they were in here, and it wanted its treat.</p><p>Thronos whispered, \u201cEasy, Melanthe. Stay quiet.\u201d</p><p>Quiet? Did he think she\u2019d cry out in hysterics? Galling!</p><p>\u2014Quiet, yourself! I have some experience with such situations. For instance, in that haystack, I never made a sound, even when pitchfork tines stabbed me.\u2014 She held up her hand, showing him the two puncture scars on the back. Granted, you had to really look for them, and she usually wore gauntlets. . . .</p><p>He clasped her hand in his, turning it this way and that. She sensed his anger and confusion, but he made no comment.</p><p>When the dragon snorted with impatience, Thronos drew her hand to his side and wrapped his wing tighter. She frowned down at it.</p><p>Metallic onyx and silver scales. Just like this dragon had. In Rothkalina, the basilisks\u2019 scales were red-toned.</p><p>Curiosity made her brave, and she darted a glance around the door, before Thronos dragged her back. This dragon differed from its cousins in Rothkalina in one other way.</p><p>It had four horns instead of two. Just as Vrekeners had four instead of a customary pair.</p><p>As if with annoyance, the dragon pummeled its wings against the mountainside, causing a shower of grit and dust even deeper within the cave. Finally it gave a blood-curdling roar, then flew away.</p><p>\u201cThronos,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyou come from this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mad? I do not come from this place,\u201d Thronos snapped the moment they were in the clear, releasing her from his wing. \u201cOne more time, sorceress: I am not a demon! Vrekeners are descended from gods. We have purpose.\u201d His tone was harsher than he\u2019d intended, because . . . because he had felt an affinity for the beast.</p><p>There was no mistaking the similarity of their scales, their horns. Some said demons sprang from the same tainted well as dragons, that they lived and evolved on the same types of hell planes.</p><p>Such as Pandemonia.</p><p>\u201cI thought Vrekener horns were only for show,\u201d Melanthe said with obvious glee. \u201cYours straightened when I began to undress.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m to take your word on that?\u201d But how they\u2019d ached!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you have a demon seal. You won\u2019t release seed until you\u2019re inside your mate.\u201d</p><p>Only this sorceress could make that sound like a huge failing. A Vrekener male could orgasm, but could never ejaculate until he first claimed his female. Thronos racked his brain for another species besides demons that shared this singular trait.</p> <p>\u201cSo I have a couple of things in common with demons.\u201d He ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cI also have fangs\u2014does that make me a vampire? My eyes turn silver, so I must be a Valkyrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeny, deny, deny. Look at you, struggling to keep your head above water with this. Returning to this realm is crumbling your stuffy Vrekener fa\u00e7ade, exposing your true demon nature.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d viewed Melanthe\u2019s scars\u2014puncture wounds that had pierced her hand clean through\u2014his eyes had felt like they were on fire. When he\u2019d imagined the pain she would\u2019ve felt, his fangs had elongated to rip out someone\u2019s throat.</p><p>As a demon\u2019s might.</p><p>No, he was not a bloody demon!</p> <p>So why had he behaved like one earlier? He\u2019d told himself he would only look at his mate. But when he\u2019d realized she was actually going to bare her body, he\u2019d known he would be helpless not to touch it.</p><p>He\u2019d imagined kneading her breasts, suckling them, licking her nipples until she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. By the time she\u2019d started to remove her top, he was already envisioning even more forbidden taboos.</p><p>Placing her hand into the heat of his pants and guiding her to fondle his length. Reaching beneath her skirt and exploring her sex with seeking fingers.</p><p>Claiming her. Breaking his seal and spending his seed at long last.</p><p>The dragon was gone; what was to stop Thronos now? He raked his gaze over her, his thoughts darkening once more.</p><p>\u201cThronos, it\u2019s not bad to be a demon,\u201d she said, her tone softening a touch. \u201cSome things just are, okay?\u201d</p> <p>At her words, he lifted his eyes to hers, felt like he couldn\u2019t get enough air. He\u2019d been about to start the madness all over!</p><p>Must leave this place. He needed to get back to the Skye. To sanity and reason and order.</p><p>She was making him doubt everything\u2014just as she had when they were children! \u201cIf you can create portals, can you sense other ones? Feel their energy?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe could find Pandemonia\u2019s portal.\u201d Thresholds like that were valuable\u2014and vulnerable. They were often hidden. \u201cYou\u2019ll direct me, and I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I will never leave a place like this to slog through a war-torn demon plane. You can close the stone door against the dragon, and we\u2019ll wait out our time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I could skirt the fray.\u201d Her speed was considerable, a fact that he used to curse. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cNot even going to discuss this. I\u2019m going to stay in my gold house and sleep on my gold bed and ski down my piles of gold like Scrooge McDuck.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever that meant. Another TV reference? \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. Sooner or later that beast will get frustrated enough to dig through stone.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cOut there, we\u2019ll face nothing but danger, even more than the homicidal demon armies. This place is rumored to be littered with traps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of traps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how the humans have certain ideas of hell? Well, all those ideas are supposed to be based on the realities of Pandemonia. Torments of fire. Hell beasts of legend. Unearthly pleasures followed by punishments. The condemned cursed to repeat labors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Sisyphus having to roll a stone up a hill for eternity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d</p><p>Thronos was undaunted. \u201cThen we\u2019d best find that portal as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You will never convince me to leave this temple\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whirring gears sounded from above. The circular ceiling started to rotate. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Thronos?\u201d</p><p>Gold dust rained down as the ceiling shifted to reveal a pie-shaped opening.</p><p>A meaty, scaled arm shot through it, black dragon claws grappling over the floor beside them.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>Thronos snatched her hand, sprinting for the main cave\u2014then skidded to a stop just beyond the door. The outside opening was blocked by another dragon, apparently the same one from earlier! Had it returned with reinforcements?</p><p>Back to the temple. \u201cThey\u2019re getting angrier,\u201d she cried. \u201cFire comes next!\u201d</p><p>The dragon perched at the ceiling opening sucked in such a deep breath that Lanthe\u2019s braids rose. She heard a hiss like a punctured oxygen tank. That sound must be its fuel.</p><p>Just as fire erupted, Thronos hunched over her against the wall, covering her with his wings, two mighty shields. The force of the flames was like a boot kick to his back; he lurched forward against Lanthe.</p><p>\u201cAh, gods, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He bit out, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Had he just made a joke? Now?</p><p>\u201cReady to leave?\u201d Sweat beaded his strained face.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d She could swear she scented . . . melting gold. Was the dragon fire burning it to liquid?</p><p>When the flames receded, Thronos lowered his wing, glancing out. \u201cThe temple has another secret doorway.\u201d</p><p>She peeked out through two folds of his wings. \u201cBut the dragon\u2019s still above.\u201d She spotted something that couldn\u2019t be right. Amid a piping hot puddle of molten gold was a red medallion on a matching chain.</p><p>Red gold. It had to be silisk gold\u2014a.k.a. dragon\u2019s gold.</p><p>\u201cDown!\u201d Thronos covered her again, and once more a blast of flames battered them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run when he draws his next breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I need to collect something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour gauntlets? You don\u2019t need those!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, yes, I do. Second, I\u2019m talking about a medallion, behind you. Three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>He glanced in that direction. \u201cForget it, sorceress.\u201d Gritting his teeth, he said, \u201cPast the benches is a second door. We run as soon as these flames end. Now.\u201d He shoved her in front of him, wings cloaking her as they rushed to the wall across the temple.</p><p>When Thronos\u2019s eyes darted over the markings, hers went wide. \u201cYou\u2019re reading them! That\u2019s how you found this place!\u201d</p><p>He started manipulating sections of gold. \u201cWhat of it!\u201d</p><p>Just as the gold door began to inch open, the dragon drew another breath. She heard that hissing sound.</p><p>The door was too slow . . . too slow! Through the opening crack, she spied a shadowy corridor with stone steps leading down.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Thronos propelled her inside.</p><p>She was several flights down before he closed in behind her. Flames followed them.</p><p>He blocked them with his wings. Once they were out of range of the fire, he said, \u201cGet behind me! We\u2019ve no idea what we\u2019re heading into.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, shifting aside to let him lead as they raced farther down. A narrow passageway like this would prevent him from using his wings to strike. Now that she was working with him\u2014somewhat\u2014his vulnerabilities were hers as well. If they\u2019d encountered those ghouls in this tight an area, she and Thronos would be dead, or worse.</p><p>The air grew hazy. Steam and smoke choked the corridor. Ahead, a rectangular opening seemed to glow. An exit! She stumbled. He glanced back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><p>He sped through the exit onto a pathway\u2014</p><p>A pathway that was bordered by a sheer cliff dropping into a river of lava. He was pinwheeling at the edge! She didn\u2019t think; her hand shot out, grasping the back of his breeches to reel him back in.</p><p>He gave her an irritated look over his shoulder. \u201cI can fly, you know.\u201d Lava erupted from below in a geyser inches from his face. \u201cRun!\u201d As they sprinted down the winding path, he positioned his wings over them.</p><p>They barely evaded the deluge of lava. Glancing back, she said, \u201cIf you\u2019d fallen and tried to fly, that lava would have engulfed you.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cI think the words you\u2019re searching for are \u2018Thank you, oh great and wonderful sorceress.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou saved me from falling now. If only you\u2019d shown me the same consideration when I was a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only you\u2019d warned my family that yours was coming over for tea and decapitation! What else have you got? I can do this all day!\u201d She heard rock crunching behind them. The dragons were scaling the mountainside in pursuit!</p><p>Four lights blazed on the other side of the peak\u2014from the dragons\u2019 eyes. Like movie-premiere spotlights directed straight up into the sky, they cut through the steam and murk.</p><p>\u201cWhen they crest, we\u2019ll have to hide,\u201d Thronos said. \u201cFor now, get as far down the path as you can.\u201d</p><p>As she ran, she could see that the mountains on each side of the plateau below were actually the beginnings of two jagged ranges. More peaks lined the ongoing plateau and distant valleys\u2014like teeth.</p><p>Farther down, she came upon a wooden handrail. She reached for it, nearly stumbling when it disintegrated into ash.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Melanthe!\u201d</p><p>Like a domino chain, the rail began collapsing into ash, foot by foot for what looked like leagues. \u201cI\u2019m sick of heights!\u201d</p><p>As they raced forward, Thronos kept her between him and the mountain. The lower they got on the path, the more lava spurted in their way, forcing them to leap and dodge.</p><p>Molten silver ore spilled from the charred mountainside, flashing in the firelight\u2014distracting her.</p><p>\u201cEyes forward, sorceress!\u201d</p><p>When they had to vault over a burned-out section of the ledge and she nearly fell short, he snapped, \u201cCome to me.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, she turned to hop into his arms, locking her legs around his waist, her arms around his neck. When he squeezed her against him, she said, \u201cI\u2019m getting used to jumping you.\u201d</p><p>He did a double take as he set off once more. \u201cAre you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, tiger. I meant that we keep having to run for our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust watch our back.\u201d As he lunged across another gulley, he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have warned you about my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea of his plans until after he and his men had left. I dove for the abbey, but by the time I got there, he\u2019d already killed your parents.\u201d</p><p>The truth of that night. \u201cHow\u2019d he find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tutor saw me sneaking out and followed me.\u201d Thronos slowed to meet her eyes. \u201cI never betrayed you, Melanthe. I\u2019d been tempted to tell my parents about you\u2014I knew the Hall would move soon\u2014but I would\u2019ve talked to you about it first.\u201d</p><p>To his clear surprise, she said, \u201cI believe you.\u201d Then her gaze drifted past him. \u201cThey\u2019re cresting! We have to hide.\u201d Thronos\u2019s wings would perfectly match this blackened rock face and the silver ore that drizzled from the stone. \u201cGood thing you blend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not blend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFace it, demon, you blend like a native of hell. Luckily for us, the fire-breathing dragon breeds don\u2019t scent so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hung out with a pack of them in Rothkalina. My sister can talk to them. They\u2019re really nice once you get to know them, only attacking trespassers and such. . . .\u201d She trailed off when Thronos froze in place, craning his head up. She followed his gaze.</p><p>At least a dozen dragons swarmed the side of the mountain like bats coating a cave ceiling.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>We are trespassers.\u201d Thronos crouched down, pressing her back against the mountain. He spread his wings, enclosing them completely, and\u2014damn her\u2014blending.</p><p>When Melanthe shook against him, he muttered, \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen us. We\u2019re hidden here. Just think of something else.\u201d</p><p>For long moments, the sounds of their heartbeats were loud drums in the insulated hush beneath his wings.</p><p>\u201cYou used to enclose us like this when we were young,\u201d she finally said in a low voice. \u201cI always felt I should whisper, as if we were under a sheet, staying up too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe told each other secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do recall our months together?\u201d she asked, looking pleased by this.</p><p>Some minutes less than others. He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think we\u2019ll have to wait here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stay for as long as we need to.\u201d He\u2019d no sooner said the words than he sensed a section of path disintegrating to his left. The dragons above roared in reaction. Then another section to his right collapsed, leaving him and Melanthe on a precarious island of rock.</p><p>\u201cMore heights.\u201d She bit her bottom lip until he thought she would split it.</p><p>He wanted to talk to her, distracting her mind from their situation. What to say?</p><p>She took care of the problem. \u201cIf we live through this, I\u2019m going back for the medallion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are.\u201d Besides, she wouldn\u2019t find it if she returned.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t regular gold. It\u2019s red silisk gold, also known as dragon\u2019s gold, the rarest and most valuable in all the known realms. I must have it, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour timing is poor. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still thinking about it, considering our current circumstances.\u201d He was one to talk. He\u2019d just glanced down, glimpsing Lanthe\u2019s thighs spread around his waist, her skirt worked up perilously high\u2014and his thoughts had boomeranged back to the temple, to the treasures he\u2019d almost seen. Even in this situation, his shaft hardened for his mate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if that weren\u2019t uncomfortable enough, the temperature continued to escalate. Like metal, his wings were still emanating heat from those direct flame hits. The river of lava below didn\u2019t help matters.</p><p>While Melanthe\u2019s skin grew flushed, he began to sweat. A drop slipped from his forehead onto her leg, high on her inner thigh. His eyes locked on the drop as it clung to her pale flesh, poised . . . before it slid down like a lazy touch.</p><p>He wanted to follow that trail with his tongue\u2014then tug her little panties aside and discover what made her moan. . . .</p> <p>\u201cUm, Thronos, maybe we should change positions?\u201d When her thighs flexed around his waist, he jerked his gaze up.</p><p>There was an unexpected metallic gleam in her blue eyes. Was that interest?</p><p>The urge to investigate this, to test boundaries, was overwhelming. Wrong place, wrong time, Talos. \u201cGood idea. Yes.\u201d They shifted limbs, until she was seated with her legs together, perched across his own.</p><p>\u201cInteresting that you can read those glyphs,\u201d she remarked casually.</p><p>\u201cThe language might not be demonic in nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Her way of saying untruth.</p><p>No one got his wings up like this sorceress! \u201cYou have much invested in convincing me I\u2019m a demon. You want this to be true, solely to make you feel better about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing, and you know it. You lied earlier when you said you heard nothing, even though a dragon was approaching. You told an untruth to get what you wanted: a look at my body. But a Vrekener never lies, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know if I\u2019ve acted demonic? How many of their kind have fallen prey to your charms?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, she said, \u201cForget it. If we\u2019re about to die, I don\u2019t want to fight with you.\u201d She wiped moisture from her own forehead. \u201cThis is like a sauna in here.\u201d Her gaze dipped to his chest, to the scars visible between the sides of what remained of his shirt.</p><p>Now it was her turn to follow drops trailing along his body. She watched them as they meandered over the rises and falls of his scars.</p> <p>She\u2019d mentioned them more than once yesterday. How foul did she think them?</p><p>He should be used to his appearance after so long; instead he was often dumbstruck by his reflection, hating each slashing scar, each raised welt. He would absently trace them when lying in bed.</p><p>Did she feel any guilt for them? Was she even capable of it? \u201cGo on, then.\u201d He grasped her wrist, forcing her hand to his chest to explore the damage she\u2019d done. \u201cFeel the marks you gave me.\u201d He peered down at her, assessing her reaction.</p><p>To his surprise, she slowly ran the pad of her forefinger over one, a line below his collarbone. She continued on to another one, her expression contemplative.</p><p>Though he\u2019d wanted Melanthe to acknowledge his pain\u2014to comprehend it\u2014he grew uncomfortable with her appraisal. He was about to stop her when she traced the worst one, the one that had nearly taken his life.</p><p>That shard of glass had pierced him deepest. He had hazy memories of each heartbeat causing him agony. And of his mother, reeling from her mate\u2019s death, sobbing over Thronos\u2019s hand, begging all the gods to spare her youngest son.</p><p>Wrath. He grasped Melanthe\u2019s wrists.</p><p>She blinked up at him, as if waking from a trance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you ever regret what you did to me?\u201d He released her.</p><p>She leaned away, until her back was against his wing. \u201cSorceri disdain regret. We consider it the equivalent of an offendment. So no, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was learning her tells. Whenever she lied, something in the timbre of her voice made his wings twitch. Plus, she always leaned back from him, as if she wanted to put distance between them, and she blinked for much longer. \u201cUntruth, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a Vrekener way of saying bullshit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do feel guilt.\u201d She was capable of it. \u201cYou must have heard I feel pain when I fly. It seems everyone in the Lore has. I always wondered if you were gladdened.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cDo Vrekeners not have healers for their young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we do! My bones were set true, and healed strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pushed the torn muscles before they were ready, continually reinjuring my wings and leg.\u201d As well as my back and my other leg. My neck and shoulders. \u201cI did this up to the point when I froze into my immortality\u2014never stopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to know the pain you were courting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think would make me do that, Melanthe? I was on your trail before I was thirteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you overused your wings, and I overused my power because of your knights, and now we\u2019re both screwed. Blame me, and I\u2019ll blame you. Again, I can do this all day, demon.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. For all these years, he\u2019d never imagined that she might have a legitimate cause to hate him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I would feel guilt if you stopped treating me like a slave and insulting me at every turn.\u201d She leaned forward aggressively. \u201cAnd for gold\u2019s sake, enough with trying to shame me about my sexual past\u2014just because you\u2019ve never been with anyone.\u201d</p><p>As much as he hated that fact, it couldn\u2019t be changed.</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t been,\u201d she said in a quieter tone.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t read her expression, and that frustrated the hell out of him. Probably inwardly mocking him! \u201cUnlike your kind, Vrekeners mate for life. So, no, I haven\u2019t enjoyed a horde of other lovers, as you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Another flashing blue glare.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed you were with every male but the one fate intended for you. From me, you ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect me to do whenever I saw you? Skip into your arms and hope you weren\u2019t bearing a pitchfork? I didn\u2019t have any reason whatsoever not to run from you.\u201d</p><p>He had no answer for that. He wasn\u2019t her mate. She\u2019d told him that she had just lived her life.</p><p>Without me. As if he\u2019d never existed for her.</p><p>Maybe that was what angered him the most\u2014how easily she\u2019d forgotten him, when his every waking moment was filled with thoughts of her.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Lanthe actually did feel the seeds of guilt.</p><p>Seeing that memory of his had softened her toward him. And now that she\u2019d acquitted him of all the things she\u2019d once blamed him for, she found it difficult to hold on to the worst of her hatred.</p><p>In fact, she could almost see herself and Thronos coming to an understanding, except for four things.</p><p>He now hated her for his injuries. He hated her for the loss of \u201cyears and children.\u201d He treated her like a war prize. And he had a pathological level of jealousy and distrust.</p><p>She would never convince him that his own brother had tried to kill her as a girl. She\u2019d never convince him that she was more than a light-skirt, and she had zero tolerance for his slut-shaming.</p><p>Yes, she understood his jealousy and anger better; didn\u2019t mean she could accept his disgust.</p><p>So why was she feeling an intense attraction to Thronos? Like right now, with his face set with determination, his wings enclosing her, and his scarred skin sheening with sweat.</p><p>Those scars made him look hardened, as dangerous as he\u2019d become. Which she found . . . sexy.</p><p>And when she\u2019d explored the marks, she\u2019d noticed things about his body she hadn\u2019t before.</p><p>How smooth the unmarked areas of his tanned skin were. How sensitive his flesh was to her touch. How his muscles leapt to her fingers.</p><p>His breeches had ridden low on his hips, and she\u2019d realized he didn\u2019t have a tan line. She\u2019d always heard that Vrekeners frowned on nudity in any circumstances. Yet sometime when he\u2019d been transitioning to immortality, he must have lazed naked in the sun.</p><p>How intriguing.</p><p>He\u2019d said he\u2019d had dreams about her every night. Had he thought of her as the sun kissed his rugged body? Her breaths shallowed as she imagined Thronos touching himself to fantasies of her.</p><p>When she adjusted her position on his legs, he grated, \u201cMelanthe, we need to make haste to find a portal.\u201d He looked like he was struggling not to stare at her damp cleavage\u2014and failing.</p><p>She glanced down, saw him stiffening. If she scooched a couple of inches closer, she\u2019d be able to feel his swelling erection against her hip. \u201cI\u2019m on board with the idea now.\u201d Because the only thing she feared more than dragons and demonic hordes was getting pregnant by a Vrekener. Thronos was clever and unexpectedly sexy. If he ever managed to cut the insults . . .</p><p>She couldn\u2019t give this male several days to figure out her weaknesses.</p><p>So she attempted to concentrate, to sense a portal amidst all this confusion on the mountain. Hunger and thirst made it even more difficult to focus. Plus her gold senses were pinging like crazy. She swiped her palm over her cheeks, but the gold dust was gone. Could she still be sensing that temple?</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>She did feel the tiniest vibration of portal power, like an echo. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry\u2014harder.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cBack\u2014off,\u201d she snapped, then regretted it immediately. Why was she being so adversarial with him? She wasn\u2019t the type of female who always kept her cool, but she also didn\u2019t go around provoking male anger, not with her history with men.</p><p>So what if Thronos continued being a dick? It wasn\u2019t like she was going to keep him; they didn\u2019t need to hash out their problems and come to a grand understanding. She just needed to beguile him so she could get back to Rothkalina. If she beguiled him hard enough, he\u2019d take her directly there!</p><p>Back to enchanting. She leaned into him, inching closer to his erection. \u201cTell me a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019ve enclosed me like this, I\u2019ve received a secret from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . . why are you acting differently?\u201d he asked, voice hoarse.</p><p>Uncomfortable, Thronos? \u201cYou haven\u2019t been around many females, have you?\u201d He would have no clue how to find his footing with her\u2014making her plan all the easier.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even fair. Which was okay, since Sorceri only cared about fair play when it benefited them. Otherwise, they were not fans.</p><p>\u201cFemales don\u2019t belong on a battlefront, and I spend most of my time there, so no.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t belong? She and Sabine had been in the Pravus front line against an army of rebel vampires. Bite your new tongue, Lanthe, bite it! \u201cBut you\u2019re with a female now, and she\u2019s instituting a new rule. Under these wings, you have to tell me your secrets,\u201d she said softly. \u201cConsider this our confessional, the wing sauna of truth.\u201d</p><p>A raised brow. \u201cWing sauna of truth? Peculiar sorceress. You always did have a fertile imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know something you could tell me.\u201d She trailed her finger down the slickened skin of his chest, dipping it just inside the waist of his breeches.</p><p>He released a sharp breath. Puh.</p><p>\u201cWhy does an angel like you have no tan line?\u201d</p><p>He coughed into a fist. \u201cWe don\u2019t have roofs in the Air Territories, have no need of them because we\u2019re above the clouds. As I told you, in the months of my transition, I was searching for you. Often I\u2019d come home, shower, then pass out in bed before dressing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have liked to see that,\u201d she said in all honesty.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, Melanthe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is me realizing we could die at any moment. It\u2019s my responsibility as a sorceress to play out my best hand all the way up to the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what I am to you? Another hand of cards you\u2019ve been dealt?\u201d</p><p>Well, yes. \u201cYou know what I think? I think you\u2019re surly because you didn\u2019t get your peek earlier. Get me to safety, and I\u2019ll show you anything you want to see.\u201d She eased her thighs open a touch.</p><p>He sounded like he\u2019d bitten back a groan. He shifted his position again, probably because his breeches were cutting off his circulation down there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a private question for me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you had sensual dreams about me when you slept.\u201d He narrowed his eyes. \u201cTell me, sorceress, was I scarred in those dreams?\u201d</p><p>He was reaching for his anger because it was familiar to him. Hating me is what he knows best.</p><p>She\u2019d chip away at that as well. \u201cYes, you were scarred. And I was kissing every one of them from top to bottom. You were so sensitive, but you craved more, your big body shuddering.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not . . . you\u2019re not lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>In a gruff tone, he said, \u201cI would\u2019ve thought a fickle Sorceri would find the marks distasteful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThronos, we have problems between us\u2014gods, I know that\u2014but lack of physical attraction is not one of them.\u201d A regrettable truth.</p><p>The hope in his eyes almost made Lanthe lose her nerve with her plan.</p><p>\u201cYou must have noticed our crackling sexual chemistry?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was just the way one felt around a mate,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYet you feel it for me as well.\u201d His brows drew together. \u201cSo why did you tell me I left you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I felt physical attraction. But I find it difficult to desire a male who insults and hurts me.\u201d</p><p>Instead of addressing this, he said, \u201cHow many have you felt this chemistry with?\u201d</p><p>And here we go.</p><p>\u201cHow many males have there been, Melanthe?\u201d he asked in a quiet voice, as if he were bracing for her answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get a number out of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen it must be huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than just a number,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not only the number that\u2019s bothering you; it\u2019s the fact that I was with others after we\u2019d met, and you couldn\u2019t bed just as many.\u201d Bite your tongue!</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have settled down with one? I know that some Sorceri wed for life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you have preferred to find me in love with another male, happy, with ten children? Why, that would make me a virtuous woman! Would you kidnap a virtuous female for your own selfish needs? Would you separate her from her beloved husband and children?\u201d</p><p>He bit out a sound of frustration.</p><p>\u201cIf our sexes were reversed, everyone would\u2019ve expected me to take lovers. I would have been applauded for it. You would have been revered for your purity. And if I were a demon male like you, I would have bedded thousands, searching for my mate. You know\u201d\u2014she made air quotes\u2014\u201cattempting.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what demons called it when they had sex just to see if a female would break their demon seal. Though a demon could usually scent a female and know she was his mate, the only way to be a hundred percent sure was through intercourse.</p><p>Baring his fangs, Thronos grated, \u201cHave you been attempted by many demons, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with one.\u201d He parted his lips, no doubt to call \u201cuntruth,\u201d so she explained, \u201cLike Vrekeners, the Sorceri stupidly think demons are savage. I didn\u2019t know better until Sabine fell for Rydstrom. By the time I realized demons could be wildly attractive, I was locked into celibacy for a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find demons wildly attractive? I thought you were drawn to the more polished, slick liar sort.\u201d</p><p>Right now she was drawn to seven-foot-tall males who simmered with pent-up lust and untapped carnality. \u201cHmm. Physically, I like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraddle me,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Her brows shot up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to need my hands.\u201d</p> <p>Without question, she wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck yet again. He\u2019d just latched onto the side of the mountain when the path disintegrated beneath them, rousing the dragons once more.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Behind the crumbled stone was . . . an opening. A tunnel no more than five feet in height had been revealed.</p><p>Despite his claustrophobia, Thronos clutched Melanthe with one arm, then swung his legs in, scrambling to get as far inside as possible. His horns hit the low ceiling, the jagged rock abrading the tops of his wings.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing with this tight spot?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot my favorite environment.\u201d</p><p>He thought she muttered, \u201cI figured swaying trees were.\u201d Meaning that night on the Order\u2019s island.</p><p>He winced to recall his behavior. But he\u2019d believed she was different then\u2014</p> <p>A dragon shoved its snout into the opening, its breath stirring up grit, making it difficult to see. Effectively trapping them.</p><p>No other choice but forward! Red light spilled from some opening farther in; he made for it with haste, fearing the beast would fire on them.</p><p>It reached in, pawing, disturbing rocks. Thronos covered Melanthe with his wings as the ceiling began to rain stone and sand. Piles of it heaped around Thronos\u2019s legs as if from an upended hourglass.</p><p>Panic threatened to take hold, but he fought it. They had to get out before the tunnel was choked, burying them alive. As Thronos slogged onward, his throat felt just as choked.</p><p>The farther inside, the hotter the air was. That red glare grew as they neared. When he reached it at last and paused in the arched opening, he saw a larger cavern, filled with bubbling lava. A sole raised path bisected it, one that appeared to lead straight into hell.</p><p>Kicking free of the piles of stone weighted around his legs, he launched himself off the edge. He glided down to the path, then set Melanthe on her feet.</p><p>As he shook sand from his hair, he gazed back at the tunnel.</p><p>Completely caved. Only one way to go.</p><p>He turned back to the path. Ahead, more streams of lava wound along it. A metal bridge in the distance glowed red hot. \u201cI think we\u2019re in one of the armies\u2019 lairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we need to find a way out, before anyone sees us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scent food cooking from one direction,\u201d he said, \u201cand corpse rot from the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a camp and a burial area? Let\u2019s head toward the latter. It\u2019d be less populated, less guarded.\u201d</p><p>As they walked in silence, he kept his hand on her arm, in case he needed to shield her in a hurry. With each step away from that cave-in, his unease faded.</p><p>\u201cWhen you find yourself going through hell, keep going, right?\u201d she asked, casting him a look from under her lashes. Again, he didn\u2019t recognize the look, but he thought it was . . . flirtatious.</p><p>He tried to focus, lest he get them captured or killed, but he couldn\u2019t stop replaying their interaction under his wings\u2014and how she\u2019d run her finger down to his breeches. He\u2019d been a heartbeat away from taking her hand and making her feel what she was doing to him. He\u2019d imagined how he would groan her name as she outlined his shaft through the leather. He\u2019d barely defeated the urge to lick sweat from her neck.</p><p>Finding this realm\u2019s portal had become even more important, because his sense of right and wrong seemed to be eroding. He could no longer trust himself to heed the laws of his people.</p><p>He was the prince of the Vrekeners, a general of knights. Yet how easily she had him falling under her spell! He\u2019d known she was using her wiles on him, but that hadn\u2019t lessened the effect of her charms.</p><p>Until he could return home, he needed to steel himself against her, a task that would be even more difficult after his discovery today.</p><p>Sexual chemistry is addictive.</p><p>Whenever he\u2019d felt that electricity sparking between them, the pain from his old injuries had ebbed under the heat of excitement. . . .</p><p>She cast him a quizzical look. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChemistry,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Her lips curled, and she left him to his thoughts.</p><p>All his life, he\u2019d speculated how she would react to his scars. He\u2019d been astonished to learn that she had no issues with him physically\u2014merely issues with, well, everything else.</p><p>Even she admitted that their chemistry crackled.</p><p>From thousands of lofty perches, he\u2019d gazed down upon Lorean wickedness. Watching an offendment was almost as bad as committing one, so he\u2019d always turned away, but those glimpses had taught him much. He\u2019d seen immortals addicted to intoxispells, begging to do anything for more.</p><p>Thronos had never understood addiction before. Now he wondered what he wouldn\u2019t do for more of this sizzling interplay with his mate.</p><p>Might he stop insulting her?</p><p>Perhaps he should go even further and court her. As a boy, he\u2019d done so and found success. She\u2019d liked to be given presents. Good thing he\u2019d snagged that medallion from the temple.</p><p>When they\u2019d run from the dragon, Thronos had stretched out his talon for it. Now he had it hidden in his pocket.</p><p>A stray thought flitted through his brain. How many gifts of jewelry have other males given her? To reward her for sex? His grip tightened around her arm, his horns aching to mark her again.</p><p>Just because he had a goal of treating her better didn\u2019t mean he could achieve it. Wrath still lived within him. . . .</p><p>\u201cStrange that we haven\u2019t seen a soul,\u201d she said, frowning at his grip.</p><p>He eventually eased it. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing of value to guard. Plus, they\u2019re probably still on the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>After what felt like leagues, the trail forked, the two branches heading in opposite directions.</p><p>\u201cWhich way to the corpse rot?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He waved to the right, and they kept moving.</p><p>As they neared the burial area, the stench became overwhelming. Another cavern opened up, larger than the initial one. It\u2019d likely been chosen for its size because it was filled to the ceiling with a mountain of bones, decapitated bodies, and horned skulls.</p><p>The mound had a creeping, rippling coat of rats. The skittering mass darted in and out of the remains, as if along paths.</p><p>When Melanthe\u2019s eyes went wide at the gruesome sight, he tugged her back. \u201cThere\u2019s no exit. Let\u2019s head the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to protect my innocent eyes?\u201d This seemed to amuse her. \u201cI was just nine when my parents\u2019 heads dropped off their bed and rolled toward me like wayward toys. When I was eleven, I used a shard of my sister\u2019s skull to scoop up her brain matter and put her back together again. I haven\u2019t been innocent since my life became entangled with Vrekeners.\u201d</p><p>If his knights truly had hunted the two Sorceri girls, the attacks would have been unending. A living hell.</p><p>Vrekeners never abandon their hunt.</p><p>\u201cNot to mention Omort\u2019s court,\u201d she said. \u201cI can never unsee the things I witnessed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish that I could have spared you that,\u201d he said honestly.</p><p>\u201cYou could have spared me some. Last year when you set that trap for me, I\u2019d been in Louisiana to retrieve my sister, so she could take her dose of morsus. She was dying. Because of you, I had to flee, getting completely turned around in a strange city. I was lost and frantic. Because of you, I couldn\u2019t rescue Sabine. When the portal door shut on your leg, I\u2019m sure you were suitably pissed on your side. On my side, I kicked your leg around, cursing it. Until I heard Omort from the shadows\u2014in my room\u2014grating, \u2018And you dare return without her.\u2019 \u201d She visibly shuddered. \u201cI\u2019ve never been closer to death than I was then. Never. So thanks, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have known that.\u201d One year ago, she\u2019d almost been murdered by her brother. The idea of Melanthe dying while Thronos was helpless to protect her . . .</p><p>Would he have sensed the loss, even across worlds?</p><p>She regarded his face. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to live my life. And you jeopardized it. It\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019ve survived this long. Speaking of which . . .\u201d She crossed to the burial mound, reaching for something. She hauled a battered sword out from the bottom. A few bones and skulls tumbled down like a mini rock slide.</p><p>She laid the sword flat over one of her shoulders. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and they set out once more, his thoughts in turmoil. Never been closer to death.</p><p>Because of him. No, he couldn\u2019t have predicted what his actions might bring about\u2014because it\u2019d never occurred to him that Melanthe was a prisoner of Omort.</p><p>Had he assumed the worst about her in every instance?</p><p>Back at the fork, they chose the other direction. The path began dividing regularly, some routes leading down, some up, connecting to landings or more caverns. Along the landings were recesses of differing sizes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in a subterranean demon den,\u201d she murmured. She didn\u2019t sound unnerved by this, more intrigued\u2014as if the two of them were on a hell safari.</p><p>His instinct continually urged him to take the higher path, but he didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be an entry point at the top of this lair, so he tried to keep them on one level.</p><p>The noise and scents grew into a tumult as they neared the demon encampment, situated in one of those larger caverns. Cautiously they found a vantage on a raised landing, where he and Melanthe could take stock of most of the camp. It was occupied by dozens of different types of demons: fire, ice, pus, storm, shadow, pathos, and more. All appeared to be returning from that battle.</p><p>Thronos found it strange that members of such varied demonarchies were working together. Was the other army as diverse?</p><p>Here, warriors regenerated from injuries, some regrowing flesh, some entire limbs. Others ate, drank, or whored. Thirty or so harried demonesses serviced the males, with lines forming.</p><p>And my mate thinks me related to these brutes? He ground his teeth at the thought, turning away from the iniquitous scenes.</p><p>Melanthe, however, appeared quite comfortable with what she was witnessing. And she seemed to be listening for something.</p><p>\u201cCome, sorceress,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI scent an exit nearby.\u201d At last, a way out of this literal hellhole.</p><p>She didn\u2019t follow him. \u201cJust a minute. I\u2019ve been reading their minds, getting the lay of the land.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis war has been going on since before even the oldest demons were born, so thousands of years. Each night, the armies march out to do battle. They break each morning because the dragons fly from their hive to come scavenge the plateau. If the demons are returning now, I guess dawn happened while we were down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have. Those dragons on the mount were probably waiting to feed on the fallen.\u201d As if they\u2019d been trained. Crafty beasts. It was a wonder there were any bodies in that burial mound at all.</p><p>\u201cThe dragons have been abnormally hostile of late,\u201d Melanthe continued. \u201cThe demons fear the last female has died, leaving a pack of aggressive killer males. It\u2019s only a matter of time before they attack the demons. Oh, oh, this just in . . . We\u2019re in a lair called Inferno. It\u2019s protected by that moat of lava outside and is home to the Infernals. They fight the Deep Place warriors, also known as the Abysmals. Deep Place is equally difficult to breach. There\u2019s only one entrance, and you have to navigate a maze of ruins to reach it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they fighting over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortals. The Infernals have the First Gate of Hell and the Second Key. But the Abysmals have the Second Gate and the First Key. In other words, they each have a gate of hell and a key that doesn\u2019t work on their own portal. Each side fights to protect its portal and to seize the other\u2019s key. Both armies are desperate to leave, but none can teleport here. They have no idea how the keys and portals got mixed up. Some believe the eternal war is a punishment for something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA portal is within this lair? With your power, could you use it without a key?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIf it\u2019s locked, it\u2019s been barred for a reason. Against anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we could take a key from here to use with the Abysmals\u2019 portal?\u201d And if they managed to make it out of Inferno alive, would he drag her into Deep Place as well?</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know enough about the dangers in Pandemonia to leave Melanthe in hiding, which meant she would have to accompany him to yet another demon lair\u2014without any advance scouting. Who knew what he could be leading her into?</p><p>The only other option would be to spend several more days in hell. Away from his home, his anchor. Will I even recognize myself?</p><p>Not to mention that he could never wait that long to claim Melanthe. \u201cWe search for the key, then. We\u2019ll find it. I\u2019ll kill any demon that gets in our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on there, tiger. When was the last time you ate? Or slept? We\u2019re coming off a prison stay, remember. We should at least find food and water. Maybe spend the day recuperating. We can return when they go back to the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t argue with her logic. \u201cVery well.\u201d He steered her toward the exit he\u2019d scented.</p> <p>Across a narrow rock bridge, he spied the opening. Murky rays of sunlight wavered through it.</p><p>They were just about to traverse the bridge when a Volar demon swooped into the area directly below, beginning to remove pieces of his armor. Thronos and Melanthe flattened themselves against the wall of an alcove.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the exit without being seen by that Volar. Thronos could take him, but not before the male raised the alarm.</p><p>\u2014Look, Thronos, your long-lost brother.\u2014</p><p>More telepathy? Yet she\u2019d sounded almost impish, so he could forgive the intrusion, as well as the slight.</p><p>When she found a flat length of stone in the dim alcove and took a seat, he cautiously joined her. From the shadows, he surveyed the Volar. Its kind had features in common with Vrekeners, he supposed. Their wings were similarly shaped with glowing pulselines, and their claws were the same. But the Volar only had two horns, and its wings were all black.</p> <p>The demon paced the area, seeming to await someone. Moments later, a small demoness of indeterminate subspecies rushed in. They ran to each other and began kissing.</p><p>Thronos turned his head away, but Melanthe leaned forward with eagerness. \u2014An assignation! Oh, darn, Thronos. We\u2019re stuck here until they get finished.\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t about to . . . here?\u201d</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>\u201cTurn from them, Melanthe.\u201d Watching an offendment . . .</p><p>\u2014You\u2019ve never watched?\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t done!\u201d</p><p>At Thronos\u2019s low words, the Volar turned sharply, scanning the shadows. Thronos held his breath until the Volar\u2019s mate drew the male\u2019s attention back to her.</p> <p>\u2014I might as well read his mind too.\u2014</p><p>Thronos wanted to tell her to ignore them, to think of something else, but he couldn\u2019t risk the sound.</p><p>\u2014This Volar is the leader of the Infernals and is fresh from the battlefield. He thanks the gods for his mate, stolen during a raid on the Abysmals. If not for her, he\u2019d meet a dragon\u2019s fire.\u2014</p><p>Though that was all well and good, Thronos needed pertinent information. He couldn\u2019t believe he was about to do this, but . . . he lowered his shields against Melanthe, which drew her attention. Then he thought the words: \u2014Can you hear me?\u2014</p><p>She smiled softly. \u2014I like talking to you this way.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Can you find out from him where the key is?\u2014</p><p>\u2014That\u2019s pretty much the last thing he\u2019s thinking about right now!\u2014 She fanned herself.</p><p>The Volar and the demoness began to kiss even more passionately, making Melanthe sigh. When the male murmured in Demonish, she translated. \u2014He told her that he loves her, and he couldn\u2019t withstand this hell without her. And she says she feels the same way! They\u2019re desperate for each other.\u2014</p><p>\u2014She\u2019s no warrior. She must have been a camp follower.\u2014 A prostitute.</p><p>\u2014So? She\u2019s with him now.\u2014</p><p>\u2014But he knows many others have seen his mate. They\u2019ve touched her and pleasured her.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Do you think that matters to him?\u2014</p><p>Thronos knew this was dangerous ground, but answered honestly. \u2014I can\u2019t see how it wouldn\u2019t.\u2014</p><p>\u2014It wouldn\u2019t because he obviously knows a very real truth. The honor doesn\u2019t go to the first male she bedded; it goes to the last male, the one she\u2019ll spend eternity with. Him. He probably walks around this place feeling ten feet tall, superior to all.\u2014</p><p>Thronos had never thought of it that way. \u2014I\u2019ll be the last male you ever bed.\u2014</p><p>\u2014That remains to be seen.\u2014 She turned to him with a frown. \u2014You know, up in heaven, I\u2019m sure things make sense and everyone acts as they\u2019re expected to and surprises are few. But outside of heaven, life can be confusing and heartbreaking and dire. So most of us take pleasure where we can find it.\u2014 She pinned him with her gaze. \u2014And we don\u2019t judge anyone who does the same.\u2014</p><p>Could Thronos ever take pleasure where he found it? For a moment, he considered how easy life would be if he were a mere demon. That Volar could mate his female whenever he felt the urge for release. He didn\u2019t have to worry about laws or expectations or the Tales of Troth.</p><p>As a demon, Thronos would be able to forgive Melanthe her profligacy, because he would be in no position to judge. As soon as he led her from Inferno, he could find a place to take his demon\u2019s due. The idea of claiming her this very day, without repercussions, was so seductive that he nearly groaned with want.</p><p>His shaft ached for her, his horns as well. Part of him wondered, Why fight something I need so badly? His mate was in need too. Her season was upon her, and he had a driving instinct to pleasure her.</p><p>A groan drew her attention back to the pair. He kept his eyes on her.</p><p>\u2014They\u2019re so in love.\u2014 Yearning emanated from her.</p><p>She\u2019d said gold was \u201cas beautiful as love.\u201d Did she want love for herself?</p><p>His mate was such a contradiction. She was hardened to violence and death. But he\u2019d also seen her joy in the temple and now her longing.</p><p>As a girl, she\u2019d been thoughtful and gentle. Her eyes had usually been lit with merriment, especially when she\u2019d teased him, making him laugh despite himself. Each day, he\u2019d gone from the dour Skye to that meadow, to levity and play. They\u2019d settled in so easily together.</p><p>Merry, gentle, thoughtful. Could she possibly have retained those traits after all she\u2019d been through?</p><p>Before he considered his words, he asked: \u2014Have you been in love?\u2014</p><p>\u2014I\u2019ve never known romantic love.\u2014</p><p>This surprised him. With not a single one of the males she\u2019d been with? \u2014Why?\u2014</p><p>With a raised brow, she replied: \u2014I haven\u2019t found my future husband yet.\u2014</p><p>\u2014You do not know how wrong you are about that.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Hmm.\u2014</p><p>What kind of answer was that? Vexing female!</p><p>The two below began making unrestrained sounds of passion. This too struck him as odd since Vrekeners were . . . discreet when mating.</p><p>As Melanthe watched, her lids grew heavier. What was affecting her like this? Cursing his weakness, he stole a glance.</p><p>The demoness had her legs and arms wrapped around the Volar, while he kneaded her ass beneath her long skirts. This was the same position Thronos and Melanthe had repeatedly taken! Was she imagining Thronos cupping and kneading her?</p><p>The Volar took his female\u2019s lips with a deep kiss, then eased them to the ground so that she was astride him. As Lanthe had been astride me, her sleek thighs flexing around my waist. The Volar fumbled with something beneath the demoness\u2019s skirt, then with his own breeches. Lifting the female up, he slowly lowered her, growling with pleasure.</p><p>At that, Melanthe inched forward even more, placing her hand flat on the bench of rock. It was small-boned and pale. Not the one that bore scars.</p><p>He moved his own hand closer. \u2014Tell me how many you\u2019ve done this with.\u2014 Ever since she\u2019d refused to say a number earlier, his imagination had gone wild.</p><p>\u2014This? They\u2019re making love, so my answer is never.\u2014 Before he could argue, she said: \u2014There\u2019s a difference between sex and making love.\u2014</p><p>He\u2019d heard this said, of course. But he had experience with neither. Though he was desperately curious as to what she considered the difference to be, he didn\u2019t want to highlight his own ignorance of such matters.</p><p>When the Volar spoke, Melanthe translated again. \u2014He said he\u2019s been thinking about her all night, wanting only to return to her.\u2014 With a grin, she added: \u2014He said he\u2019ll be tender with her for as long as he can.\u2014</p><p>And then what? Thronos refused to ask her, just said: \u2014Females like tender.\u2014 Not an embarrassing question; merely an observation.</p><p>\u2014Hmm. Sometimes.\u2014</p><p>Enigmatic sorceress!</p><p>She arched her brows at him. \u2014I would let my partner know exactly what I desired every step of the way. He\u2019d never have to worry on that score.\u2014</p><p>Did she mean him or males in general? One of the reasons he hated her past was that he had no experience of his own. If she compared him to other lovers, how could he acquit himself well?</p><p>Yet if she told him exactly what she wanted . . . \u2014When you tell me what you desire, I\u2019ll give it to you. Anything.\u2014</p><p>Had she inched her hand closer to his? \u2014What about offendments? Some of the acts I might crave have nothing to do with procreation.\u2014</p><p>With comments like this, she set his mind afire! \u2014I will hear of these acts now.\u2014</p><p>She slid him a mysterious smile that put him into a lather as much as her words had.</p><p>Since Thronos had captured her, Lanthe had seen entirely new facets of him\u2014and each one confused her more.</p><p>The warlord in pain, roaring in a lightning storm.</p><p>The domineering demon in the temple.</p><p>The protector who\u2019d saved her from dragons.</p><p>Now she could sense the conflict within him. His sexual curiosity and long-denied urges goaded him to learn about her own desires\u2014and to watch others\u2019, though he believed it forbidden.</p><p>How shocking these sights must be to him! \u2014I think my angel\u2019s a budding voyeur.\u2014</p><p>\u2014You lead me down a dark path, sorceress.\u2014 Thronos looked astounded that he was actually watching, but helplessly intrigued.</p><p>\u2014You\u2019ve really never seen others in the throes?\u2014 Their hands on the bench were inching closer together.</p><p>\u2014Never. I\u2019ve turned away every time.\u2014 His little finger brushed hers, and even that small contact shot currents into her skin.</p><p>\u2014Then why look now?\u2014</p><p>\u2014Because I see myself as him and you as her. Because I ache for what I almost took in that temple.\u2014</p><p>The demoness moaned loudly. The Volar\u2019s claws dug into the rocky ground.</p><p>Lanthe swallowed. \u2014What had you planned to do to me?\u2014</p><p>\u2014For the first time in my adult life, there was no plan, only impulses.\u2014 Thronos\u2019s hand suddenly covered hers. His was hot, rough with callouses.</p><p>She glanced up at him. Thick dark hair tumbled over his forehead, almost reaching his vivid eyes. Their color was the same as the ore that had spilled from the mountain.</p><p>Molten silver lit by fire.</p><p>His shirt clung to his broad shoulders and brawny chest. His normally clenched jaw was relaxed, the grim line of his lips softened, allowing her a glimpse of his true mien: masculine, compelling, sigh-worthy.</p><p>Her heart thudded. Irresistible warlord.</p><p>His face was flushed with excitement, as if he\u2019d just discovered flirting.</p><p>Oh, wait. He probably had.</p><p>\u2014What would you have allowed me in the temple, Melanthe?\u2014</p><p>She felt like she was punch-drunk, losing any inhibitions she might have had with this male. By the way he stared at her eyes, she knew they were metallic, colored with her desire. \u2014I honestly don\u2019t know.\u2014</p><p>He scowled when she pulled her hand away.</p><p>\u2014If I based my decision on physical attraction alone, then . . . \u2014 She turned her hand palm up and parted her fingers for his.</p><p>A breath left him. His hand shot to hers, fingers entwining.</p><p>They fit . . . perfectly.</p><p>\u2014You would have received me? Parted your thighs for me?\u2014 He pressed the heel of his palm into hers, tightening his grip so sensually.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip. \u2014It\u2019s not based just on physical attraction, is it?\u2014 How could the mere contact of their hands make her this aroused? Her nipples stiffened, her sex growing wet.</p><p>Averting her gaze from his, she turned toward the couple. The Volar cast his demoness a look of open adoration. Gripping her breasts, he bucked his hips, bouncing the thrilled female.</p><p>Did Thronos realize he\u2019d begun rubbing the palm of his hand against Lanthe\u2019s in time with the Volar\u2019s thrusts? Their palms were hot with friction, and Thronos\u2019s every movement sent pleasure rippling through her body.</p><p>She exhaled a tremulous breath. Could he make her come like this? A completely new meaning for the term hand job. . . .</p><p>She would catch him staring at her as she watched; then she\u2019d gaze up at him as his flickering eyes took in the scene. Since they were communicating telepathically, it was easy to slip into his thoughts.</p><p>He was reluctantly enjoying this spying because she obviously did, but also because it was a wicked secret between them\u2014something they were doing together. He wanted more secrets between them. She hid a grin when she caught another of his thoughts. He was wondering how much more his swollen shaft could pain him: There has to be a limit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, there was! Would they discover it together?</p><p>When the demoness took the Volar\u2019s horns in hand, Thronos sounded like he\u2019d stifled a groan. \u2014You did that to me earlier.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Would you like me to do it again?\u2014</p> <p>Hesitation. Then: \u2014I can\u2019t lie. I\u2019d want that very much. Your soft palms on me, handling me.\u2014</p><p>Even out of the corner of her eye, she saw his engorged member pulse in his breeches. Her sex clenched in reaction.</p><p>When the Volar ripped down the demoness\u2019s peasant blouse to suckle a breast, Lanthe\u2019s lids went heavy, her own breasts swelling in the molded cups of her top.</p><p>Thronos moved his hand on hers faster. \u2014I would do that to you at every opportunity. I\u2019d kill to do it now.\u2014</p><p>She turned to him, found his spellbinding eyes filled with promise. Somehow he was beguiling her. The virgin was seducing the seductress!</p> <p>If he had this power over her and made a move to claim her, how could she resist him? During this time, that could spell disaster!</p><p>Pregnant with Thronos Talos\u2019s babe? The idea was too insane even to contemplate.</p><p>When the demoness cried out, she and Thronos both turned to the couple.</p><p>The Volar had positioned his female on her hands and knees, lifting her skirts. He\u2019d taken her tenderly for as long as he\u2019d been able to, but now his demon nature was clearly at the fore. With one animalistic shove, he entered her from behind, eliciting a lusty moan. After each thrust, he used his wings to draw his body back so he could plunge forward again. And again.</p><p>\u2014I could take you thus.\u2014</p><p>She barely bit back a whimper. \u2014If you ever looked at me like he looks at her, I\u2019d consider it.\u2014</p> <p>Though the two below were groaning and moaning in abandon, their pace hitting its crescendo, Lanthe faced Thronos.</p><p>She felt light-headed with arousal, desiring him more than she\u2019d ever thought possible.</p><p>\u2014I\u2019ve got to kiss you, Melanthe.\u2014</p><p>Irresistible. Was she nodding?</p><p>At least here, they couldn\u2019t do anything more than kiss. Things couldn\u2019t get out of hand.</p><p>Our first real kiss. His lips were inches from hers. . . .</p><p>A yell in Demonish sounded. She gasped. A pair of armored sentries had spotted them.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p> <p>Come on!\u201d Thronos snatched Melanthe into his arms, charging toward the rock bridge and the exit he\u2019d scented.</p><p>\u201cMy sword!\u201d She was reaching back for it.</p><p>\u201cNo time,\u201d he snapped as he ran, bursting outside. Was this a continuation of the same mountainside path they\u2019d hidden upon earlier? With more scavenging dragons? Can\u2019t take to the air till I\u2019m sure.</p><p>A bower of black and silver foliage grew over the trail here, providing cover from above, from the hazy sun that had finally risen.</p><p>As he sprinted headlong down the mountain, Melanthe peeked over his shoulder. \u201cMore are coming!\u201d</p><p>He glanced back. Two had become half a dozen. They were burly pathos demons, a vicious breed. Their armor could deflect his talons.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>The trail led toward a wooded valley between those two jagged ranges. \u201cThat\u2019s a forest down there. We could lose them among the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re heading toward a Pandemonian forest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a better idea?\u201d The lower they got, the closer they were to the river of lava. Sweat poured from him, ash drying out his mouth. The demons stayed right on his heels.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m cooking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d The path finally veered away from the lava, leading straight to the forest.</p><p>As he and Melanthe neared the edge of it, she said, \u201cThey\u2019re too close! We can\u2019t lose them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I fight.\u201d He set her down, readying to combat the sentries. \u201cStay behind me. But remain close.\u201d He faced off against the pursuing warriors, positioning his wings to strike.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he spied two marble markers flanking the path. But he couldn\u2019t divert his focus to read the glyphs.</p><p>Swords drawn, the sentries charged as one\u2014</p><p>They stopped before him, just out of range. Right at the line of those markers.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then!\u201d He flared his wings, antagonizing them. \u201cFight me!\u201d But they wouldn\u2019t cross that line, shifting and muttering.</p><p>So there was something in these woods that even a cadre of demons feared?</p><p>A heartbeat later, he heard an earsplitting buzzing sound above them\u2014hair-raising in its intensity! Melanthe shrieked. Was she running from him?</p><p>He whirled around, saw a black swarm oozing through the tree canopy as if it\u2019d been poured.</p><p>\u201cWait, Lanthe!\u201d he yelled as he sped for her deeper into the brush. The swarm was already between them, a multitude of solid black wasps with dripping stingers.</p><p>Their buzzing seemed to make the entire world vibrate, like his brain would be jostled to mush.</p><p>BUZZZZZZZZZZ</p><p>Melanthe had clapped her hands over her ears, still careening along that path. \u201cI can\u2019t take that sound!\u201d</p><p>BUZZZZZZZZZZ</p><p>Using his wings to fan and bat the wasps, he fought through the cloud to reach her, biting back yells with each sting\u2014like icepicks stabbing his skin!</p><p>And that sound was about to drive him insane.</p><p>Closing in on her, he nearly tripped over one of another pair of engraved marble markers along the path. They read:</p><p>The pest that WAS . . .</p><p>What did that mean? Confusing bloody place! He lunged for Melanthe, enclosing her in his wings as they hit the ground.</p><p>BUZZZZZZZZZZ</p><p>Even with his wings shielding them, the sound was deafening.</p><p>\u201cThronos, I-I can\u2019t! It\u2019s too loud. My head!\u201d</p><p>BUZZZZZZZZZZ</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her trembling body. \u201cShh, shh, I know . . .\u201d How the hell was he going to get her away? When he could barely think past that sound?</p><p>Yet then it . . . dimmed.</p><p>Were they no longer swarmed? He poked his head up to glance out.</p><p>The towering black mass had stopped before those stones, hovering in the air\u2014as if there was an imaginary line that couldn\u2019t be crossed.</p><p>Then they began dissipating, their buzz receding.</p><p>He squinted at the stones. On this side, both read:</p><p>The pest that IS . . .</p><p>He rose above her. \u201cMelanthe? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Between breaths, she said, \u201cMy head still feels like a jackhammer was in it.\u201d</p><p>He levered himself to his feet, helping her stand. \u201cWere you stung?\u201d As he looked her over, he rasped his palms over his skin, scraping stingers away.</p><p>\u201cOnly a few times before you covered me.\u201d She plucked stingers from her arms, leaving angry red welts. \u201cWhy\u2019d they stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you were right about there being traps all over this realm. I\u2019m beginning to believe there\u2019s a patchwork of danger zones, and we reached the edge of one.\u201d What he wouldn\u2019t give for a map!</p><p>\u201cWhat do those markers say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the other side, they read: The pest that was. On this side: The pest that is.\u201d</p><p>She brushed hair from her eyes. \u201cThey sound like demonic road signs. Like if we were heading back into the swarm zone, the signs would be saying: Entering hazardous area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes The pest that was mean we left the hazardous area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to enter another one?\u201d she asked, her face wan.</p><p>He noticed she wasn\u2019t sweating. In this heat? Not good. Wasn\u2019t that a symptom of heat stroke?</p><p>He scented water, but it was far in the distance, several leagues away. Though most immortals could go without water for days, she wasn\u2019t like most immortals. Reminded of how fragile a creature she was, he reached for her. \u201cCome here, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her protests, he took her in his arms and cradled her slight weight. He started along the trail, working to minimize the jostle of his limp. With each step, she relaxed a degree more in his arms. Every now and then, she\u2019d grumble about walking on her own.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest? We\u2019ve got a long way between us and water.\u201d Maybe there\u2019d even be fruit growing nearby that the little sorceress would actually eat. She\u2019d thrown up her last meal.</p><p>Had that been two nights ago?</p><p>In that short time, she\u2019d gotten to him\u2014until his thoughts and emotions were in chaos. \u201cTry to sleep, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you carry me? When we\u2019re in a place chock-full of swamp serpents, demons, dragons, and pests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Never\u2019ll happen . . .\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, she was out, her head turned toward his chest, her hands curled against him. She\u2019d fallen asleep in his arms\u2014and it felt like one of his greatest accomplishments.</p><p>Surely this meant she trusted him? He squared his shoulders. She believed he would keep her safe against all the dangers they kept encountering.</p><p>He frowned. Or else she had heat exhaustion.</p><p>Inwardly waving away that thought, he regarded her relaxed face, her lips parted in slumber. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d held her sleeping. When they\u2019d been young, they would lie in the meadow together, peering up at clouds to identify shapes. Sometimes, she would doze in his arms as he lifted her raven locks to the sun, just to watch them shine.</p><p>Their cloud pastime always made him grin because she thought every single one resembled some small befurred creature or another. \u201cThat one looks like a tree,\u201d he\u2019d say. She\u2019d answer, \u201cOr a squirrel on its hind legs with a mouthful of acorns.\u201d He\u2019d offer, \u201cThat one\u2019s like a cottage with a chimney.\u201d She\u2019d sigh, \u201cOr a very fat rabbit. With short ears.\u201d</p><p>One time she\u2019d woken from a nap, lifting her head from his chest to sleepily ask him, \u201cWhen we\u2019re apart, do you ever gaze down at clouds as I gaze up? Do you ever miss me as I miss you?\u201d</p><p>More, Melanthe. So much more.</p><p>And that left him conflicted. Thronos had heard of the mate effect, that the mere presence of one\u2019s mate would be a balm on all woes. His mate was as soothing as a cyclone.</p><p>After Inferno, his customary sexual frustration had been ratcheted up to a painful degree. But he was also experiencing this new . . . fascination for the female in his arms. She was a woman with her own desires. He wanted to learn them\u2014so he could tease her and make her crazed for him.</p><p>He\u2019d been committing offendments left and right, but he couldn\u2019t muster much regret. Holding her hand like that had been the most sensual act he\u2019d ever enjoyed.</p><p>He still burned for the kiss he\u2019d almost taken. At the time, he\u2019d thought she\u2019d wanted it just as dearly.</p><p>And after that kiss? Even more delights awaited him! If you ever looked at me like he looks at her, I\u2019d consider it.</p><p>Thronos had predicted a bleak future for them. But what if they could share pleasure, building on that?</p><p>Melanthe is misery. Had he really thought that only yesterday? Now he realized, Melanthe is doubt.</p><p>She\u2019d always made him doubt his beliefs. He remembered a time when he\u2019d tried to explain what she was to him. She\u2019d been only nine, yet she\u2019d questioned something he\u2019d thought was absolute.</p><p>\u201cLanthe, when we get older, you\u2019re going to be mine.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him from a garland she\u2019d been braiding. \u201cHow can I be yours when I\u2019m my own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my mate. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorceri don\u2019t have mates,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt . . . doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just stay best friends. That sounds fairer.\u201d</p><p>Now they\u2019d been together for less than three days, and she\u2019d already made him doubt the word of Vrekeners. He . . . believed her about the attacks.</p><p>He gazed down at her pale hand, curled so delicately on her torso. Those faint scars still filled him with rage. She\u2019d said she had to bite back her screams. He didn\u2019t understand how she could have at her young age. Was it because she\u2019d already grown so used to pain? Or because she\u2019d been that terrified of being discovered?</p><p>For centuries, he\u2019d believed her existence had been filled with wanton revelry, a sorceress\u2019s dream. He now knew those years with Omort and his poisons had been hellish for her. Running from Vrekener attacks? Hellish.</p><p>As a girl, Melanthe had wept over the death of a single rabbit.</p><p>Yet she\u2019d had to scoop up her sister\u2019s brain.</p><p>Perhaps Thronos should consider himself fortunate that she hadn\u2019t grown to be evil like every other Sorceri he\u2019d met outside of the Territories.</p><p>But evil or not, once she regained her persuasion, she would use it against him. Every day, every hour, her sorcery was replenishing itself, and he was defenseless against it.</p><p>If he could get her to the Skye before then, he could harvest the ability with one of his people\u2019s four fire scythes.</p><p>She would have even more reason to hate him\u2014but he would never lose her again.</p><p>As soon as the thought arose, so did his guilt. Though Vrekeners didn\u2019t believe a power could be a soul, Melanthe did. He could never do that to her. Which made him the biggest hypocrite. He was the one who\u2019d pressed for his kind to collect sorcery, in order to spare lives.</p><p>Short of separating her from her persuasion, his only hope of keeping her was to convince her not to use it on him. He exhaled. In other words, she\u2019d be gone at her first opportunity.</p><p>How to get her to go with him to his home, and stay there?</p><p>His heart stuttered when he realized the answer: she would bond to the father of her offspring.</p><p>She was in season\u2014now. Who knew for how much longer? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes, impregnating her would be a grave offendment, but desperate times . . .</p><p>Even if she managed to escape to Rothkalina, Thronos still had more hope of seeing her. Though Rydstrom the Good was a demon, even he would never bar the doors of his kingdom to a father seeking contact with his child.</p><p>Thronos could be inside Melanthe. Tonight. The portal key could wait\u2014until he\u2019d made her his.</p> <p>Was he succumbing to this reasoning because it was sound? Or because he wanted her so badly he\u2019d commit any wrong to have her?</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Lanthe cracked open her lids to find Thronos staring down at her, a curious expression on his face. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d passed out. The rhythm of his breaths had lulled her, just as flying with him on the island had done.</p><p>\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d Though still thirsty and hungry, she felt rested.</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d Her welts had faded to nothing. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>With clear reluctance, he set her on her feet, steadying her with his big hand covering her shoulder. She glanced around. They were in a dense forest, surrounded by trees so massive, they made redwoods look like saplings. They had to be moonrakers, a type often found on demon planes.</p><p>Not only was the stone of this realm black, most of the foliage was onyx and silver. Even the smooth bark of the moonrakers was black.</p><p>Though there was little sunlight\u2014just a few rays stole through the canopy\u2014enormous flowers grew in profusion, subtly scenting the air.</p><p>She inspected one bloom. Its large dark petals were shiny and open. In the center was a silver pistil the size of a baseball bat. Its pollen sparkled like white-gold dust.</p><p>Other weeping-willow-type plants swayed above them, their silver leaves glinting in the scattered spears of sun, like Thronos\u2019s wing mosaics did. As a sorceress obsessed with metal, Lanthe found all these sights mesmerizing, yet her attention couldn\u2019t stray from him for long.</p> <p>As in the temple, she turned from infinite wonders to face him, a towering Vrekener warlord\u2014who couldn\u2019t intrigue her more. \u201cSo, any new threats I should be concerned about?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhen was the last time you slept for more than an hour or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I was captured three weeks ago. You?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWeeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been following this overgrown path deeper into the woods, toward the scent of water,\u201d he told her. \u201cThere\u2019s prey all around us. I could catch something, but I doubt you\u2019d eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the first time you tried to provide for me?\u201d</p><p>All these years later, he deadpanned, \u201cThe rabbit had it coming.\u201d</p> <p>A burst of laughter escaped her lips so quickly, so unexpectedly, she almost slapped her hands over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cToo soon?\u201d</p><p>Another joke! And more . . . \u201cYou do remember!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d He reached forward, tucking one of her braids behind her ear.</p><p>Why was he being so nice to her? Had she beguiled him so swiftly? She\u2019d been unconscious for part of the time!</p><p>He canted his head at her, then continued walking, seeming deep in thought.</p><p>Her brows drew together when her gold senses pinged again. They had outside of Inferno, but she\u2019d thought the temple\u2019s proximity had continued to set them off. Now she glanced all around for the source. Her gaze kept returning to Thronos.</p><p>She\u2019d bet her best headpiece that this Vrekener had gold on him. But how?</p><p>Her eyes went wide. Could he have collected that medallion? If so, and if he gave it to her tonight . . .</p><p>The Vrekener would get laid.</p><p>No, no! No sex with Thronos. Bad Lanthe! Clearing her throat, she said, \u201cKarat for your thoughts.\u201d When he hesitated, she asked, \u201cAre you beating yourself up for what we saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestion: Are people like you and me called offendmenters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave your fun, sorceress,\u201d he said without heat.</p><p>\u201cAlways. So tonight, we steal a key and use a portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019d discussed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t angelic Thronos balk at thievery?\u201d she asked in a playful tone. \u201cI remember when I once asked you to steal for me. You were embarrassed for me, putting up your nose as you said, \u2018I will never take what doesn\u2019t belong to me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to empty the coffers of Skye Hall!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to explain, then must\u2019ve realized she was kidding.</p><p>Sort of. \u201cIf we unlock a portal, how can you trust me not to direct it to Rothkalina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried for Rothkalina last time and brought us to Pandemonia. I believe you\u2019ll aim for the mortal plane. It\u2019s a vastly bigger target. From there I can fly to the Skye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill bent on getting me to heaven? Look, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d never go to your home. Of course, I\u2019m not not saying that either.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows. \u201cWe can wed only there. I must claim you in a Bed of Troth, my lifelong bed.\u201d</p><p>She knew of some factions that had the same tradition\u2014basically the ones that weren\u2019t forever scrambling for their very survival. When a male was born, a bed would be created that he would sleep in his entire life, eventually bringing his mate to it. \u201cWhat does the bed have to do with marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how Vrekeners marry. When I claim you in a Bed of Troth, we\u2019ll be bound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ceremony with tons of people? No fabulous dress and gifts of gold? No celebrating with far too much sweet wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve no need for ceremony. In any case, my home is the only place where I know I can keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Har. \u201cWhat would someone like me eat up there?\u201d Vrekeners were omnivores, but they preferred meat.</p><p>\u201cWe have an entire island dedicated to growing crops. It\u2019s the sole one that hovers below the clouds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s austere up there. In Castle Tornin, I live in utter luxury, with all the mod-cons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what a mod-con is, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Of course he didn\u2019t. \u201cThey\u2019re things I couldn\u2019t live without.\u201d Lanthe and Sabine had endured some lean early years and felt like they deserved to be spoiled. Now that Lanthe had gone from her castle tower, to Order prison, to roughing it\u2014in hell\u2014the greedy sorceress in her demanded a return to pampering. \u201cIf your realm is above the clouds, wouldn\u2019t that put it higher than the tallest mortal mountain? Vrekeners might be used to altitude and temperature changes, but I would suffer. Other Sorceri must suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. The same forces and wards that conceal the Territories and bind the islands together provide breathable air and warmth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForces and wards? Sounds like sorcery to me. I\u2019ll bet sometime in your history, a Vrekener was chummy with one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he conceded. \u201cWe have machines in place to move and shape the islands, and engineers to run the machines, but we don\u2019t know what the source of the power is.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. She pictured sorcery-fueled steampunk contraptions. In another lifetime, she might have liked to see such a sight. But in this lifetime . . . \u201cJust because I don\u2019t want to go to the Skye doesn\u2019t mean we couldn\u2019t date each other. If you accompany me to Rothkalina, I could introduce you to nice dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I even consider it, then I\u2019ll know you\u2019re enchanting me,\u201d he said. \u201cYour sister would plot to murder me the second I stepped into that kingdom. You forget I\u2019ve witnessed the manifestation of her powers.\u201d</p><p>When Sabine had forced Thronos\u2019s father to see his worst nightmare. Whatever she\u2019d shown him had made the male claw at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour sister doesn\u2019t seem to bear ill effects from her . . . deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprisingly, they left her deadened, blas\u00e9 about tragedy.\u201d</p><p>When Lanthe had accused her of not caring about anything, Sabine had replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I care about nothing very much.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe added, \u201cAt least, she was blas\u00e9 before Rydstrom came along. But she weaves illusions over her face, so you rarely know what she\u2019s feeling anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times has she died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a dozen. Not all by Vrekeners.\u201d When he raised his brows, she admitted, \u201cSorceri plotted against her. Humans executed her for being a witch. And so on.\u201d She paused a moment, then said, \u201cWhat about your own sibling? Will your brother not plot to murder me?\u201d Might as well dip a toe.</p><p>\u201cAristo? I grant that he hates Sorceri. It\u2019s the cause of much strife between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s like your father, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But if Aristo harmed you, his brother\u2019s sole fated female, it would be like harming me. It would be like killing my future offspring.\u201d He held her gaze. \u201cWe hold mates sacred.\u201d</p><p>Thronos will never believe me. Lanthe remembered Sabine lamenting that she couldn\u2019t get Vertas warrior Rydstrom to trust her\u2014just because she\u2019d been a Pravus player who\u2019d lied to him and tricked him into a dungeon imprisonment. Sabine had sighed, \u201cHow was I supposed to know to act like my word was good?\u201d I hear you, sister.</p><p>\u201cWould Uncle Aristo accept those future offspring of yours?\u201d Lanthe asked. \u201cYou made it clear that Sorceri blood would be a detriment to any child we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was angry when I said that. I would not love a halfling any less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut others might look down on them.\u201d</p><p>Thronos\u2019s face turned cold and intent. \u201cI will not tolerate the slightest disrespect to our children.\u201d</p><p>Our children. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about the insanity tainting my line?\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed his hand over his face. \u201cAgain, I was angry when I mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was true. My mother wasn\u2019t well. With me, you risk having crazed offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>He told her of a brief encounter, when he\u2019d seen Mother worshipping her gold. She\u2019d called him hawkling.</p><p>\u201cWait, Elisabet had known I was seeing you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYour mother was harmless, Melanthe. Yet my father murdered the parents of my mate.\u201d Thronos\u2019s eyes grew matte gray. \u201cI looked up at him that night in the abbey and saw a stranger. I grieved his death, but gods I blamed him. I lost you because of him.\u201d He glanced up sharply, as if he hadn\u2019t meant to say that much.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about my mother?\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat, he said, \u201cI wanted to. Never seemed like a good time.\u201d</p><p>She could scarcely believe her mother had known that secret. Why hadn\u2019t Elisabet feared an attack? Lanthe would have to get Sabine\u2019s take on that.</p><p>\u201cDo halfling Sorceri have powers?\u201d Thronos asked.</p><p>\u201cUsually, but Vrekeners have stolen so many powers that they\u2019re not being reincarnated. Children are born without souls.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned, but the wheels were obviously turning. \u201cHow old were you when you discovered your persuasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally young. I told Sabine to close her mouth. She couldn\u2019t open it for a week, not even to eat. She was starving but no one could figure out what had happened to her. You should know, these kinds of things happen with Sorceri kids.\u201d</p><p>Instead of appearing horrified by the prospect, he confidently said, \u201cWe can handle it.\u201d</p><p>It was then that she noticed how much steadier and calmer he\u2019d grown since the island. She would bet steady was his default setting\u2014unless he suspected that his mate had slept with her brother among her string of other men.</p><p>Didn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t call him on his bullshit. \u201cOh, come on, Thronos. What would you do with Sorceri young? If we had a teenage daughter and her skirt was short, I\u2019d think it\u2019d be even cuter if shorter. How would you react to that? And if she hadn\u2019t stolen gold by the time she was twelve, I\u2019d put her in counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. We\u2019d have you not knowing up from down.\u201d But this didn\u2019t even bear discussion, because if she and Thronos ever did end up together and she got pregnant, the reality would prove far different: She\u2019d happily go to tell him the good news, all fa la la. He\u2019d ask her if he was the father. She\u2019d behead him in a maniacal rage. . . .</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject, Vrekener, would you expect me to dress differently up there?\u201d</p><p>He raked his gaze over her. \u201cNot behind closed doors.\u201d He must have realized how objectionable she found his words, because he added, \u201cI\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t want to stand out as the least dressed female in the Territories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just given me a title to aspire to. And besides, behind closed doors, I wouldn\u2019t dress at all.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up.</p><p>She tapped her chin. \u201cUnless I was in the mood for leather or lace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeather.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cOr lace.\u201d</p><p>Then she frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s this talk about having no roofs?\u201d</p><p>Seeming occupied with his own imaginings, he took a moment to answer. \u201cWe feel more comfortable with nothing except sky above us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but can\u2019t you hear couples having sex all the time?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck, as if the skin there had just heated. \u201cWe are quiet in matters like that.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in her tracks. \u201cWhat does that mean? Sometimes it can\u2019t be controlled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVrekeners take pains not to get . . . overly excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What about horny young newlyweds? And what about you, Thronos? I\u2019ve discovered you hardly have ice in your veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvoiding the truly licentious acts is supposed to help.\u201d Gazing to one side of her, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen males with bite marks on their arms, from where they\u2019d muffled their reactions. That\u2019s a common enough practice.\u201d</p> <p>She knew she looked gobsmacked, but this was just too wrong. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point if you\u2019re not getting overly excited? I guess you\u2019ve never heard the phrase \u2018bellow to the rafters\u2019?\u201d Especially since they didn\u2019t have rafters.</p><p>At his blank look, she said, \u201cWhen you throw back your head and roar with pleasure? Come on, roaring isn\u2019t just for battle.\u201d Or for unleashing fury in a tempest.</p><p>\u201cIn a sexual situation, that would indicate . . . a significant loss of control.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d begun to recognize the expression he wore now, the one that said, This goes against everything I know. But, gods, tell me more.</p><p>\u201cIf we had sex, \u2018overly excited\u2019 would only be the beginning,\u201d she explained. \u201cNext would come the point of no turning back, when we\u2019re angry at our clothes for getting in the way and our hips move on their own and we can\u2019t seem to kiss deeply enough and your fingers grip the curves of my ass and my nails dig into the muscles of yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cThen comes the really fun part of the program.\u201d She was getting caught up in this, savoring her virginal Vrekener\u2019s reaction: utter enthrallment. \u201cThe panting, licking, rutting, keening, sucking, mindless, animalistic, about to explode/erupt/die with ecstasy part.\u201d</p><p>A sharp breath escaped his lips. She loved the puh sound he made. \u201cNext?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last part\u2019s difficult to put into words. Better explained by example. Let\u2019s just say that we would be anything but quiet.\u201d</p><p>When he tried to speak, his roughened voice dropped an octave. He coughed into his fist, then finally managed: \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>She expected him to make some comment about her sexual past, something along the lines of \u201cHow many men have you been rutting with? Did they all make you erupt with pleasure?\u201d But he didn\u2019t, so she asked, \u201cWhat about flyovers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh? Oh. It\u2019s bad etiquette to fly over another\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that all the buildings look the same and all the walls are white, with no color to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s not a drop of wine in your realm? No gambling or carousing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d He was describing a floating, whitewashed, sterilized, stifled, mirthless hell.</p><p>She was surprised he\u2019d acknowledged these things about his home, even as he knew how much she would dislike it. \u201cWhat would you expect me to do all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps selfless acts, helping others. Or even studious contemplation.\u201d He seemed to have found his footing again. \u201cYou could read about our culture, studying Vrekener history.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d used to enjoy reading about history, but only if it wasn\u2019t lame.</p> <p>\u201cWould those pursuits be so bad?\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Which begged the question: How exactly did he plan to get her to stay there? Once her power was replenished, no one could hold her.</p><p>She skated away from that subject. \u201cThronos, if there\u2019s a splinter group up there with its own agenda, then what\u2019s to prevent someone\u201d\u2014your brother\u2014\u201cfrom attacking me now?\u201d She expected him to deny, to bluster.</p><p>Instead, he said, \u201cIf someone disobeyed my order and tried to hurt you, or your sister, he will pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone? Absolutely anyone?\u201d</p><p>Curt nod. \u201cI give you my vow,\u201d he said, having no idea of the bind he\u2019d just gotten himself into.</p><p>And this was why Lanthe rarely kept her promises. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned your tells. I know when you speak untruthfully.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted. That could prove disastrous! Damn it, what were her tells?</p><p>If he noticed her distress, he let it go. \u201cThere\u2019s water ahead. But I also scent resin pits.\u201d Seconds later, he pointed out a shallow depression filled with some kind of amber-colored gel. \u201cResin will trap you like an immortal-strength tar. Step where I step.\u201d</p><p>In a pit farther ahead was a dead animal, an unidentifiable reptilian beast that had gotten its legs caught. Predators had eaten its guts.</p><p>Lanthe shivered. What if an immortal like her got trapped? Those predators would chomp on her, but she might live through the ordeal\u2014only to regenerate for subsequent feedings.</p><p>Potentially for eternity.</p><p>Being an immortal had its downsides.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pondering something,\u201d Thronos said. \u201cHow did Rydstrom forgive Sabine?\u201d</p><p>Ah, so the Vrekener was moving his mind toward a pardon for Lanthe? With his new tenuous trust of her, he was starting to look for more between them. He probably figured he could shed some of his anger if he absolved her.</p><p>One problem: Lanthe didn\u2019t see her sexual history as something that needed absolution.</p><p>Especially not from him.</p><p>Did she wish Thronos hadn\u2019t found her with Marco? Sure. Did she want Thronos\u2019s forgiveness for sleeping with that vampire?</p><p>Hell. No. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor holds that Sabine trapped him to use as a sex slave, tormenting him until he agreed to wed her. Then he made a slave of her.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cLike those are bad things?\u201d At his look of astonishment, she said, \u201cThey enjoyed tons of bondage, some master/sub stuff, a real-live dungeon with shackles, role and cosplay. Spankings and repeated orgasm denial. You know, typical BDSM. But don\u2019t worry, they were doing it before it became cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBD what?\u201d Thronos\u2019s expression was priceless\u2014part confusion over the lingo, part horror, part helpless fascination. She\u2019d bet this angel had an untapped wicked streak.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not for us to understand. It worked for them.\u201d The whole truth was much more involved. Sabine had wanted to overthrow Omort, seizing the kingdom for her and Lanthe to rule, while gaining control of the mysterious, demonic Well of Souls in Castle Tornin. No one had ever expected Sabine to fall for Rydstrom\u2014least of all Sabine.</p><p>Thronos helped Lanthe over a resin pit. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Rydstrom was able to forgive her because he got a like revenge. Everything she did to him, he did to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parallel would be for me to bed scores of other women. Which is impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen lucky for me I\u2019m not looking for your forgiveness. I\u2019m happy to have experience and to know my own mind.\u201d</p><p>He appeared to be grinding his molars to dust, but he didn\u2019t make any slut-shaming comments.</p><p>\u201cLook, my sister went to Rydstrom a virgin. In a hundred years or so, do you think she\u2019ll imagine what it\u2019s like to know another male? Maybe she will, maybe she won\u2019t. But do you think Rydstrom will worry that she\u2019s imagining it?\u201d She continued, \u201cAll those virgin females out there will always have to wonder. I won\u2019t. I am informed. I\u2019ve done my due diligence, and now I\u2019m ready to settle in for the long haul of eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is something to consider, I suppose.\u201d Then his brows drew together. \u201cBy that logic, in a hundred years you\u2019ll wonder if I\u2019m thinking about other females.\u201d</p><p>In a throaty voice, she said, \u201cThronos, understand me: if I ever decided to bed you, there would be no doubt. You\u2019d be completely undone, absolutely taken, forever mine. If you were ever inside me, you would be broken down at a molecular level\u2014altered irretrievably.\u201d</p><p>His expression told her he very much wanted to be altered irretrievably. \u201cYou guarantee this because of your . . . experience?\u201d</p><p>When she merely shrugged, she expected him to launch into a tirade about her past. Again, he held off.</p><p>Yet she didn\u2019t think this was because he\u2019d had a change of heart. He might not be calling her a harlot, but he still had to think of her as one.</p><p>Lanthe had a theory about his turnaround. Before, he\u2019d seen her as a sexual object for other males; after Inferno, he now viewed her as a sexual object for himself to enjoy\u2014and, sadly, she believed he\u2019d learned his first lesson as a potential sexual partner: Act like an asshole and you won\u2019t get any.</p><p>Which meant he was biding his time and biting his tongue until he could get what he wanted.</p><p>Just like every other male she\u2019d been with.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Oh, look! Pitha fruit.\u201d Melanthe stretched for a black gourd above her, just out of her reach. She scratched at the bottom of it like a little kitten.</p><p>He pulled the fruit down for her, scenting it. \u201cThis could be poisonous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt grows in Rothkalina.\u201d</p><p>He cracked open the gourd for her. The inside was succulent and smelled sweet.</p><p>When he handed the halves to her, she scooped some into her mouth, then rolled her eyes with delight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain of that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThough Sorceri are vulnerable to poisons?\u201d</p><p>She was already finished with one half. \u201cPoisons and venoms.\u201d Between chews, she said, \u201cBut I\u2019m sure of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get cured of that morsus anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Omort died, his poisoner\u2014a fey female dubbed the Hag in the Basement\u2014delivered the antidotes to us. Otherwise we would\u2019ve died.\u201d</p><p>Yet another time Melanthe might\u2019ve perished when she\u2019d been outside his protection. \u201cThis hag did so despite the fact that you called her that?\u201d</p><p>Melanthe shrugged, taking another bite, chewing happily.</p><p>Dragging his gaze from her, Thronos surveyed their surroundings. Though he\u2019d scented water nearby, he still hadn\u2019t found the source, and it was growing darker. Dusk was abnormally long here\u2014and as the sun had begun its lazy descent, the dragons had retreated from the field, their enormous shadows wavering over the treetops.</p><p>He and Melanthe had decided to return to the demon valley tonight, but they remained without water. And he hadn\u2019t recuperated whatsoever.</p><p>Plus, he had plans for them. . . .</p><p>When a breeze blew, rustling all the flowers, she set down her finished fruit. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here.\u201d</p><p>Her black, black hair matched the petals of those flowers. Gaze still on her, he muttered, \u201cYes. Beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Since Melanthe had described what copulation between them would be like, he\u2019d found it difficult to look at anything except her. When he took her home to his Bed of Troth, would he not want to hear her keen with ecstasy? Would Thronos not want to empty his lungs as he emptied his seed inside her?</p><p>He\u2019d been vacillating over his decision to claim her tonight\u2014up until the time she\u2019d said those blood-heating words to him. After that, he knew nothing could stop him. All he needed was a secure place to commence his plans.</p><p>But how to get her naked and in his arms? His skin flushed when he realized that would mean he too would have to be unclothed.</p><p>Naked. In front of her.</p><p>He\u2019d figure it out.</p><p>Finding another pitha, he used his claw to stab a hole in the bottom to drink from. Its juice was sugary, but welcome. He handed her another pierced gourd to drink.</p><p>When some juice ran down her chin, she grinned mischievously\u2014as she used to do when a girl.</p><p>That grin affected him differently, yet just as strongly. He wanted the kiss he\u2019d almost taken.</p><p>Whatever she saw in his expression made her murmur, \u201cThronos?\u201d</p><p>Before he could stop himself, he took her face in both of his hands, leaning in closer to her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, tiger!\u201d She pushed against him. \u201cYou promised me water. Even I can smell some nearby.\u201d</p><p>He surprised himself by letting her go. As he bit back his disappointment, he caught movement out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>A bubble filled with water was floating through the air between them. He and Melanthe silently watched it bobbing along. Without a word, they both hastened in the direction it\u2019d come from.</p><p>He lunged in front of her. \u201cI lead the way.\u201d He pushed past some brush into a clearing, bordered by moonraker trees. The massive roots encircled the area like walls, while tightly woven branches made a ceiling above them. Countless water-filled bubbles floated up like helium balloons, bursting against the impenetrable canopy.</p><p>Drops fell over this glade like a cool summer rain, then rose up to coalesce again.</p><p>Not a peek of sky could be seen, making this literal rain forest feel like a pocket of muted light and sound.</p><p>With his and Melanthe\u2019s every step, more drops pattered up from a mat of silver grass. Bubbles were even released by flowers fringing the tree roots.</p><p>\u201cThis is wild!\u201d Melanthe cried. \u201cLike a fairy ring, or an enchanted glade. Let\u2019s name this place . . . Zero-G Glade!\u201d She popped a bubble into her cupped hand to drink.</p><p>\u201cLet me test the water first.\u201d When she offered her hand, he leaned down to scent and taste it. \u201cClean.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d both had their fill, he pierced a large bubble over his head. Water poured as if a bucket had been tipped over him, a cool splash over his ash-covered skin. He tossed his sopping shirt onto a root, then scrubbed at his face and hair, his chest and arms.</p><p>Another bubble burst over Melanthe\u2019s shoulder, making her shiver. Thronos watched, riveted, as each drop slowly trailed down her body\u2014only to be sucked back up to fuse again.</p><p>When she let loose a peal of laughter, he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt tickles!\u201d</p><p>Earlier, she\u2019d laughed in the temple. Then he\u2019d made her laugh on their march. The only thing that could make that sensual sound better? Being the cause of it.</p><p>His brows drew together when he realized she\u2019d already laughed more today than he and all his grim knights had in centuries.</p> <p>\u201cAh! Drops are going up my skirt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky drops.\u201d Had he said that aloud?</p><p>Yes, because she faced him with an inquisitive look, as if she were taking his measure. Or making a decision.</p><p>Go to her, kiss her.</p><p>Yet when he heard bugle calls in the distance, he was reminded of all the perils of this realm. This strange glade might be the only source of water around, which made it a target.</p> <p>Thronos leapt to a moonraker tree to keep watch.</p><p>Cold water seeped along Lanthe\u2019s back, wetting her hair and cooling her heated skin.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen a place like this glade and was determined to relish it\u2014even if Thronos had deserted her.</p><p>After drinking her fill, she sat on the silver grass, removing her boots. \u201cJust because you don\u2019t have a skirt doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>He crouched on a limb, scanning the woods, looking both sexy\u2014and demonic.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how he could continue to deny his demon blood when evidence kept mounting. Aside from his similarities to those dragons and his seamless adaptation to this place, he could read the demonic writing!</p> <p>Maybe that was due to a genetic memory, passed down through the blood\u2014a memory formed here.</p><p>By his ancestors.</p><p>Now that Thronos had returned to his \u201crealm of origin,\u201d his very behavior was changing. There\u2019d been an overall mellowing of rage, and he\u2019d actually cracked jokes. In the last twenty-four hours, he\u2019d probably committed more offendments than in his entire lifetime. She could take some of the blame for those, but not for other changes.</p><p>His voice, already a baritone rumble, had grown even deeper, raspier. And his language was deteriorating rapidly. Over the day, he\u2019d begun carrying his seven-foot-tall frame differently, with not quite so much tension in his shoulders, not so much stiffness in the spine. Even his horns seemed prouder somehow.</p><p>He not only sounded like a demon, he looked like one. Which she was discovering she might have a weakness for.</p><p>Sabine adored having a demon lover. Would Lanthe?</p><p>Maybe the realm of Feveris was precisely where she and Thronos needed to go. In the Land of Lusts, she\u2019d feel no guilt for bedding an enemy Vrekener. No fear of the future.</p><p>Wait. What was she thinking? She was a daughter of the Sorceri, a born hedonist. She\u2019d take pleasure where she found it, and laugh in the face of guilt.</p> <p>Well, as long as she didn\u2019t get knocked up.</p><p>Thronos could be an endless source of pleasure. She\u2019d enjoyed teasing him earlier, wanted to some more. \u201cCome back down here\u201d\u2014she crooked her finger at him\u2014\u201cwith all the other offendmenters.\u201d</p><p>Though he looked like he wanted nothing more than to join her, he remained where he was. \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch. It\u2019s my job to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Because his instinct told him so. She sighed. She appreciated the protection, but she wished he was doing it because he wanted to, not because he was compelled to.</p><p>For once, she\u2019d love to hear a male say, \u201cI\u2019m going to do you a solid\u2014not because of what you can do for me in return or what you can give me\u2014but simply because I like you.\u201d</p><p>Was Thronos so different from Felix? Thronos wanted offspring. Felix had hungered for power.</p><p>Both of them sought something from her; yet neither truly cared about her. They only saw what she could give them, how they could use her.</p><p>Which she didn\u2019t care about, because she had a plan to get her back to Rothkalina: beguile Vrekener. Afterward, she\u2019d never have to see Thronos again. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be a killjoy. You\u2019ll scent anything that comes near.\u201d When he made no move, she said, \u201cI think you don\u2019t know how to have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be versed in something I haven\u2019t experienced since our last day together?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at that. How . . . sad.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t dwell on it when fun was here to be had now. \u201cThronos, we might not make it out of Pandemonia alive. We should have died multiple times over the last few days. These things remind me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bound by your sacred duties\u2014and I\u2019m bound by mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis I must hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bound to show gratitude for every second of life I\u2019m given by enjoying it to the fullest. Why should the gods\u2014or fate or whatever\u2014grant you more of these precious seconds if you waste the ones they\u2019ve already provided? It\u2019s exactly like\u2014are you ready for this?\u2014GOLD. There\u2019s only so much of it to be had. Sorceri believe The End of the Ore will come one day. But life can be shiny and savored and glorious until then.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows. \u201cShiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou squander the coins you\u2019ve been given. In my eyes, you\u2019re more of an offendmenter than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I squander them, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mind is always in the past.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re as mired in the past as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I usually recall good memories. Like how much fun we used to have playing in that meadow together.\u201d</p><p>Thronos rose to pace that limb. What was he contemplating?</p><p>She probed, but found his shields up. Fine. She turned from him, determined to enjoy Zero-G, and its upskirt rain, all by herself.</p><p>She spied a leafy branch that arched down beside a smooth trunk, heavier streams of water following it, making a shower head of sorts. She wished she could shuck off all of her clothes and finally take the shower she\u2019d been longing for\u2014</p><p>A bubble burst against the back of her head.</p><p>With a gasp, she whirled around\u2014and caught another bubble against her arm.</p><p>\u201cThronos!\u201d</p><p>He was using a wing to wave them over to her, because he was playing with her, having fun.</p><p>She gave a cry when another hit her chest, cool water trickling behind her breastplate. And once those delicious drops trickled down, they traveled right back up her body.</p><p>She opened her arms wide. \u201cGive it your best shot. I\u2019ll bet you can\u2019t hit me\u201d\u2014she pointed to her navel\u2014\u201chere. Oh, wait, I forgot, Vrekeners don\u2019t gamble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll enter into another wager with you. If I hit your target, then you have to remove your breastplate.\u201d</p><p>He was certainly getting the hang of flirting. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to remove your breastplate.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have to teach you the finer points of wagers, demon.\u201d For once, the word didn\u2019t seem to bother him; of course, she\u2019d all but purred it. \u201cHonestly, I would love to take it off, would kill to bathe under that tree limb\u2019s cascade.\u201d She hiked a thumb in that direction. \u201cBut we\u2019re back in the same boat as before. How can I be sure you won\u2019t lose control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanthe, you want to be naked for me.\u201d</p><p>This authoritative side of him was kind of hot. \u201cDo I?\u201d She sounded completely unsure, even to her own ears. Maybe they could just play tonight\u2014taking the edge off their need. They didn\u2019t have to go further.</p><p>Surely premarital sex was an offendment Thronos would never commit, no matter how worked up they got. I\u2019ll breed no bastards.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that if I got you to safety, you would show me anything I wanted to see,\u201d he said. \u201cI got you to safety, and I want to see everything.\u201d</p><p>She arched her brows. Sexy Thronos. And a promise was a promise, right?</p><p>Lanthe shouldn\u2019t want to take off her clothes for him, but he was right; she did. She wanted him to see her and desire her. She wanted to experience his reaction as he beheld his mate for the first time.</p><p>If simply holding hands with this male had nearly brought her to the edge . . .</p><p>At that thought, she reached for her breastplate, eager to have it gone. As she had in the temple, she gave him her back while she unbuckled the piece. Tugging it off, she tossed it away, then started on her skirt, unfastening the hidden hooks. With a swish of her hips, the garment dropped, pooling at her feet.</p><p>Leaving her in a black thong.</p><p>She grinned when she heard his wings shoot open with a snap.</p><p>Draping an arm across her breasts, she craned her head around to find him crouched, body tensed. His horns had straightened. There was no mistaking it.</p><p>Just as unmistakable? Her response. As her gaze followed those proud lengths, her nipples hardened and the folds of her sex grew slick.</p><p>\u201cYour panties too,\u201d he rasped. The pulselines on his wings were glowing brighter and moving faster than she\u2019d ever seen them.</p><p>Keeping her back to him, she hooked her thumbs around the frayed lace, pulling them down her legs. As she kicked the thong away, she thought she heard him swallow thickly.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d The word was a harsh grate.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanthe,\u201d he growled in warning.</p><p>She dropped her arm and turned with her shoulders back. She caught one of his thoughts, and it sent a ripple of satisfaction through her.</p><p>\u2014Mother. Of. Gods.\u2014</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>Thronos had barely recovered from the vision of her flawless ass when she turned to him, unleashing the full force of her beauty. At the sight, three things happened:</p><p>He almost fell out of the tree.</p><p>His shaft shot so hard so fast that he grew dizzy.</p><p>And he decided he\u2019d deal with any danger as it came along.</p><p>He\u2019d known her breasts were generous. Now he saw they were perfection. Milk-white, a touch fuller at the bottom, topped with cherry-red nipples.</p><p>If he were a fanciful male, he\u2019d swear those peaks were stiffening under his avid gaze. His member began to throb.</p><p>Her narrow waist flared to shapely hips. The black thatch of hair on her mons was a small, trimmed V. Her legs were long and lithe. He imagined them bent beside his hips as she rode his shaft\u2014or kneeling over his head as she straddled his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just wash off, then,\u201d she said in a casual tone. Seeming unaware of her earth-shattering effect on him, she stepped under the cascade, tipping her face to the water, and started to bathe.</p><p>She must be confident that he could control himself; she was mistaken.</p><p>But considering the way his erection ached, intercourse would be short-lived. He decided to get his first release behind him, then seduce her slowly.</p><p>He had a last brief thought about dangers and being alert, but then she rubbed water over her breasts\u2014the most breathtaking sight he\u2019d ever witnessed.</p><p>Conclusion: the plan to mate her as soon as possible is sound.</p><p>Never taking his eyes off her, he was only dimly aware that his shaking hands had begun removing his boots.</p><p>As she rinsed her hair, she noticed him removing his second boot. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about your getting naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Wouldn\u2019t that be an offendment?\u201d</p><p>He nodded ominously.</p><p>\u201cDo I have any say in this?\u201d She drew her hair behind her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that if I saved you from the swamp serpents, you would let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That. I didn\u2019t say you could while I was naked.\u201d</p><p>In answer, he dropped to the ground, striding toward her.</p><p>Lanthe was in a precarious position. She desired Thronos. If she was honest with herself, she\u2019d admit that her attraction to him was already greater than to any other male.</p><p>But touching led to claiming.</p><p>She was going to have to trust Thronos not to follow his most primal instincts. In general, males had never given her much reason to trust them. And this one was already rock hard, his cock straining against the leather of his breeches.</p><p>Thronos started on his pants as he closed in, his scarred fingers unlacing them, his stomach muscles flexing. Once the fly gaped, she followed his dark goody trail from his navel\u2014</p><p>Down went his pants. Her jaw dropped in time. Well. Thronos is all growed up.</p><p>He planned to claim her. With that?</p><p>She could tell he was uncomfortable, obviously unused to being naked around another. But apparently his need was burning away his instilled modesty.</p><p>When he pressed closer, she stepped back against the smooth tree trunk, putting the curtain of water between them. With a second\u2019s reprieve, she resolved again to go only up to a point with him. She could control herself, despite her hormones, despite the body he\u2019d just revealed!</p><p>He continued forward, letting the water run over his back and wings. He shook his dark hair out, wet locks whipping over his broad cheekbones. Between his narrow hips, his erection jutted hungrily.</p><p>She waved to it. \u201cYou still deny your demon blood? Exhibit A. Case dismissed.\u201d</p><p>Aside from his nearly dismaying size, his cock was gorgeous. The shaft was straight and thick, with a dominant vein visibly pulsing. The crown bulged so much that the slit was almost hidden. His testicles were large, and looked in need of cupping and kissing.</p><p>When she could drag her gaze up, she was treated to his entire body in all its naked glory. His rugged muscles were ideally proportioned for his seven feet of height. The width of his shoulders only highlighted the leanness of his hips.</p><p>Above the sculpted planes of his torso, his pecs were rigid slabs of masculinity. Were those flat, dusky nipples of his sensitive? The thought had her twirling her tongue in her mouth.</p><p>Scars crisscrossed his chest, one curling around his hip, another deep one slashing up his left thigh. But they didn\u2019t blunt her attraction whatsoever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was indeed tan all over. The sun had kissed him from the top of his head to that mouthwatering shaft to his feet. One of his lower legs looked swollen, as if the tendons were knotted there, and his foot curved inward. The cause of his limp. She thought he was fighting to keep his foot straight for this perusal.</p><p>She wished he wouldn\u2019t bother, but males were funny like that. Show no weakness, grrr.</p><p>He\u2019d seen all of her; she wanted a similar viewing of him, so she emerged from the water, sauntering around him. When he realized what she was doing, he lifted his chin, as if steeling himself against her reaction. But he didn\u2019t move out from under the cascade.</p> <p>Revealed between two glimmering wing tapers, his ass was a purr-inducing work of art. Streams coursed over the smooth skin there, over the tight muscles framed by shaded hollows. The cleft of his ass was so taut, she wondered if she could even nip it with her teeth.</p><p>As she continued around, he remained still, allowing her to ogle him. Now that she knew how he felt about his looks, she found this tremendously brave.</p><p>Sometimes Lanthe wasn\u2019t as brave as she could be\u2014certainly not like everyone else who lived in or even visited Tornin\u2014so she applauded anyone who demonstrated the trait.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t Thronos\u2019s bravery be rewarded?</p><p>When she stood before him once more, he scanned her face. Searching for some hint of her thoughts?</p> <p>\u201cThronos, if I honestly tell you what I think of your body, will you tell me what you think of mine?\u201d He hadn\u2019t said anything aloud.</p><p>\u201cPeculiar sorceress. Yes, I will.\u201d And then he held his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so big. And hard. When I look at your body . . . I get wet for it.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted around an exhalation. Puh.</p><p>Thronos was still reeling from her words. His body aroused hers? Only fair since she made him hard as stone.</p><p>Yet then her gaze dipped to his chest. To his scars. He stood unclothed before her, and she focused on the most hated parts of his body.</p> <p>She leaned forward. She kissed a scar.</p><p>His head fell back. Was this her way of apologizing? Of showing her regret? Another feather-light graze of her lips followed.</p><p>If this was the way she expressed remorse, he might be helpless not to forgive her!</p><p>\u201cAnd now, what do you think of mine?\u201d she asked against his skin.</p><p>I almost come just from looking at you. I need to lick every inch of your flesh. I want to pin you down and suckle you\u2014for hours. \u201cYou\u2019re exquisite,\u201d he finally bit out, laying his palms against the tree trunk above her head. His wings closed in on her. Trapping her.</p><p>Her gaze darted from one to the other, but she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cImpossibly exquisite.\u201d He leaned his head down to her neck, drawing deep of her scent, letting her feel his exhalations. Gods, she smelled so inconceivably right to him. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from nuzzling her neck. It made her shiver, so he did it again. Then he ran his lips beside her ear, rasping, \u201cI\u2019ll likely wake to discover this isn\u2019t real\u2014just another dream of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when you have those dreams? I\u2019m sure you have a law against masturbation.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, then confessed, \u201cI wake up thrashing, thrusting at anything, already culminating.\u201d</p><p>She released a shaky breath of her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fantasized about you, about all the forbidden things I want to do to you, for hundreds of thousands of nights. And now you\u2019re here with me,\u201d he said, voice laden with disbelief. \u201cIf just one of my dreams would come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to happen?\u201d</p><p>Need to be buried inside you! But . . . \u201cMelanthe, let\u2019s begin with a kiss.\u201d In Inferno, he\u2019d decided that their first real kiss would be vastly different from the frenzied taking when he\u2019d first captured her. He could be tender.</p><p>When he curled his finger under her chin, tilting her head up, she asked, \u201cHave you ever done this before?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when you taught me to swim?\u201d</p><p>In the lake by their meadow. \u201cI remember.\u201d She\u2019d been terrified at first, clinging to him, but by the end of that afternoon, she\u2019d taken to the water like a selkie pup.</p><p>\u201cYou taught me the basics, and then instinct took over. Maybe I could teach you the basics of kissing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could brush your lips against mine a couple of times, to get used to the feeling. Then when you\u2019re ready you could slip your tongue in to find mine.\u201d</p><p>He raised his knee beside her, boxing her in, as if he subconsciously feared she\u2019d escape him yet again. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d slowly and sensuously lick the tip of my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His swollen length shot even harder.</p><p>\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll drive each other crazy. When that happens you can take my mouth deeper. Just do what feels good for you, and it\u2019ll likely feel good for me.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he leaned down to graze his lips over hers and back. Again. Hers were so plump, giving. When her breaths shallowed, he slanted his mouth to deepen the kiss.</p><p>As he slowly dipped between her sweet lips, she clung to his shoulders, gripping his muscles when the tip of his tongue found hers. The contact was electric! He groaned into her mouth, wondering if he would instantaneously spend.</p><p>Considering the pressure in his shaft, this seemed probable.</p><p>Though he\u2019d wanted to get his first release out of the way, now he realized that would be squandering the experience.</p><p>Thronos would endeavor to last\u2014</p><p>She began licking back, with light laps of her tongue that made his head swim. Still, he kept the pace slow, lazily teasing her, as if he had all the time in the world. He was rewarded with her seductive moan.</p><p>When he grew more aggressive, she murmured against his lips, \u201cYes, yes.\u201d She laid one palm on his chest, turning it until her fingers were pointed down. Inch by inch, she lowered her hand.</p><p>Between the kiss and her touch, he was awash in stimulation. Too much! His member jerked as if to meet her halfway. By the time she reached it, he would release in her palm.</p><p>Breaking from the kiss, he collected her wrists, pinning them above her head. Her eyes were glittering, her body trembling\u2014because of him. Him.</p><p>In a breathy voice, she said, \u201cWell. You certainly have the hang of it. But don\u2019t you want us to touch each other?\u201d</p><p>He bit out an anguished sound. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d He recalled how that Volar had used his wings to stroke the demoness. Gaze locked on Melanthe\u2019s, Thronos began tracing his talon over her collarbone.</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cOh! You\u2019re touching me with your wings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I put my hands on you . . .\u201d</p><p>She seemed to realize his quandary.</p><p>\u201cTrust me not to hurt you, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>Gradually, he felt her body relaxing under his exploration.</p><p>As he trailed the talon between her breasts, his need to cup them was overwhelming. He made fists, claws digging into the palms of his hands until blood dripped.</p><p>His talon smoothed along the undersides of her breasts, those perfect, pale globes. They would be a heaven of softness beneath his rough palms.</p><p>As he finally skimmed toward one of her nipples, she shook, arching to him.</p><p>Then he scented her arousal. Dear gods. The luscious scent of her sex readying for his length . . .</p><p>Nearly put him to his knees.</p><p>How much more could he withstand?</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>Oh, my gold. Just as she\u2019d feared, Thronos had turned irresistible.</p><p>His kiss had made her toes curl. He was a natural, which made her wonder what else he\u2019d be a natural at.</p><p>Even his exploration of her\u2014weird as it was\u2014was turning her on. The idea of that lethal talon caressing her so gently messed with her mind.</p><p>His wings had once been a symbol of her fear. How perverse was she if she got off on this? Maybe she liked perverse?</p><p>Her nipples were pouting for attention\u2014which he seemed determined not to give. Was he never going to put his hands on her? She understood his predicament; he feared coming too quickly. After such a long wait, who could blame him?</p><p>Eyes ablaze with lust\u2014and intent\u2014he lowered his wing, circling her navel.</p><p>Surely he wouldn\u2019t go lower. \u201cThronos, wait.\u201d He couldn\u2019t. And, gods, she couldn\u2019t desire him to. . . .</p><p>The smooth curve of his talon dipped between her legs.</p><p>She might\u2019ve tried to get away, but he had her wrists trapped, her body boxed in.</p><p>He began stroking her sex, and it was . . . pleasurable. The talon was firm against her as he eased it back and forth over her needy clitoris.</p><p>Back. And forth.</p><p>This is so weird. And pervy. And I like it so much!</p><p>She squeezed her eyes closed, disturbed that she wasn\u2019t more disturbed by this. She had a sinking suspicion: Thronos could do just about anything to her and she\u2019d like it.</p><p>Because he was her mate? Was she fighting fate?</p><p>Sorceri don\u2019t believe in fate!</p><p>Seeming to lose his inner battle, he gave a groan of frustration, releasing her wrists.</p><p>Her eyes flashed open when his palms landed on her shoulders. He was bleeding\u2014from digging his claws into his hands? Hot crimson mixed with the cool water in streams.</p><p>If she\u2019d thought something was wrong with her before, now she was convinced, because she found his searing blood on her skin arousing\u2014as if he was marking her, like he\u2019d done in that tunnel when he\u2019d painted her lips.</p><p>And though his blood was washing away, she could swear she\u2019d perceived the heat of it streaking across her aching breasts and over her stiffened nipples. Over her hips and ass. Between his blood and the weird talon caresses, she was shaking with need.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, holding herself motionless as his hands roamed, starting to descend. And all the while his talon petted her clitoris.</p><p>His transfixed gaze followed his hands. \u201cNone lovelier.\u201d His tone was awed.</p><p>Why did it feel so unbelievably good with him? He seemed just as lost, overwhelmed by this pleasure, starved for it.</p><p>Because he had been. So how would he react the first time they had sex? If they did. How would that magnificent cock feel plunging inside her? Imagining it made her moan.</p><p>To her surprise, she felt a glimmer of welling power, then another. Sorcery began whirling within her, as if she\u2019d been an empty vessel waiting to be filled. Her lips curled with delight.</p><p>Wait . . . had his hands just bypassed her chest? He molded them over her waist, then rested them on her hips. He drew his wing back from her sex, leaving her yearning for release. Pervy, girl.</p><p>Without warning, he pressed a muscled thigh between her legs. She couldn\u2019t stifle a cry. Positioned like this, his rampant cock prodded against her, the bulbous head rubbing along her damp torso.</p><p>Taunting her.</p><p>She craved that thick length, craved all of his throbbing heat filling her. Of their own accord, her hips rocked in invitation as she slowly rode his leg.</p><p>\u201cI feel your arousal, your wetness. I scent it.\u201d Against her neck, he murmured, \u201cBefore this night is out, I want to know your taste, take it into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Ohhh. We can definitely work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your male to kiss you there. Though forbidden, I\u2019d do it to you.\u201d What wasn\u2019t forbidden in his mind? \u201cI\u2019d do it till you came for me.\u201d</p><p>I have to ask for it? With a mental shrug, she parted her lips . . . only to close them as doubts arose. What must he think of me now? As easy as he\u2019d predicted?</p><p>Yet when he moved his thigh against her sex, those qualms faded into the ether.</p><p>At last, he covered her breasts with his rough palms! He shuddered to feel her. She gave a low cry as her head lolled.</p><p>He took several breaths, nostrils flaring, as if he were just preventing himself from coming. With a growling sound, he began to knead her. \u201cTantalizing female.\u201d Holding one breast poised\u2014to receive his mouth?\u2014he dipped his head. \u201cNeed to suckle you.\u201d</p><p>She cried, \u201cBy all means!\u201d</p><p>Lower, lower. She watched him lash a wet lick over one of her pebbled nipples. \u201cYes, Thronos!\u201d Dimly she realized, His tongue is pointed.</p><p>Wicked demon.</p><p>Groaning, he wrapped his lips around her nipple, sucking it with greedy pulls.</p><p>She started panting. \u201cYou\u2019re making me feel so good.\u201d Tunneling her fingers through his hair, she held him close.</p><p>Against her breast, he rasped, \u201cYour nipples are so sweet. As sweet as your lips. How I\u2019ve hungered for this! Hungered for you.\u201d</p><p>The disbelief and awe in his voice made her melt for him. His unshielded thoughts too: \u2014This is real, Talos. You are with her. This is happening. Had no idea what pleasure was. . . . \u2014</p><p>Thronos was never supposed to be like this.</p><p>She would\u2019ve hungered for him too\u2014if she\u2019d known this was in store.</p><p>Giving the peak a loud suck, he moved to her other nipple, growling around it. His thigh kept rocking, his cock sliding up and down her belly. His pointed tongue was making her forget why she would ever resist him. She was in a heaven of sensation. Add to that his masculine scent and barely harnessed lust . . .</p><p>When he took his kisses away to stand fully, she gave a frustrated cry.</p><p>\u201cHave to get closer to you.\u201d</p><p>Closer?</p><p>One of his arms coiled around her shoulders, his other around her neck. As he continued to thrust, he wrapped her tighter in his wings, tighter still\u2014until their slippery bodies were mashed together, his cock trapped between them.</p><p>Was this a Vrekener thing?</p><p>With each of his ragged breaths, his chest heaved against her breasts, against her achy nipples. She could feel his heart thundering.</p><p>Her arms were pinned by her sides; she should be panicked. He was a Vrekener\u2014but she\u2019d never felt this safe. Their bodies were so close, she couldn\u2019t tell where he ended and she began. And at that moment, she didn\u2019t want to be anywhere else in any world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Would he enfold her like this for sex? Pervy Lanthe is on board.</p><p>She\u2019d planned to wrap him around her little finger; instead, he\u2019d wrapped his wings around her! He\u2019d made her nearly mindless with desire. Hot, slick, swollen desire.</p><p>With each degree he constricted those wings, his groans deepened. He was going to come like this.</p> <p>She would too, right upon his muscular thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited so long for you.\u201d Pressing openmouthed kisses to her neck, he pumped his hips faster, rutting against her body. Her nipples raked his chest with each of his jostling movements.</p><p>When she undulated against his leg to grind her clitoris, he gave a brutal growl. \u201cYou like my wings around you? Trapping you to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I never let you go, sorceress?\u201d</p> <p>She moaned in reply. The pressure kept mounting, until she was on the verge of coming. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Thronos!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure . . .\u201d he bit out in a tone of wonder as he rocked her. \u201cIt\u2019s almost agony.\u201d His biceps bulged as he squeezed her. \u201cI grow nigh!\u201d</p><p>Her head shot forward, her mouth on his neck. She was losing control, as she hadn\u2019t in memory. Tongue flicking, she sucked on his skin as wanton urges suffused her.</p><p>Snaring his thick cock and working it inside me. Or tonguing his throbbing, veined length.</p><p>What would he think of her if she dropped to her knees before him\u2014with her lips parted to be fed . . . ?</p><p>\u201cAh, gods, woman!\u201d His shaft jerked in the tight sleeve they\u2019d created as he rocked faster and harder. \u201cNever knew . . .\u201d Faster. Harder\u2014</p> <p>Massive body quaking, he threw his head back, tendons taut as bowstrings. Then he roared.</p><p>Just as he wasn\u2019t supposed to do.</p><p>Through her lips, she felt the reverberations in his throat. She was about to go over the edge with him, moaning with abandon.</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t feel seed, his wings rippled around her each time his mighty shaft pulsated. Another bellow shook the night. And another, over . . . and over . . . and over . . .</p><p>How badly he must have needed that!</p><p>As those dry spasms finally eased, he gave one last shudder, leaving her right on the brink.</p><p>\u201cYou came?\u201d she murmured. No seed means demon.</p><p>Catching his breath, he rested his forehead against hers. \u201cHarder than I could ever have imagined. You made me bellow to the rafters.\u201d Unguarded, he rasped, \u201cAnd now I feel no pain in my body.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his face, meeting her eyes. His pupils were blown from his recent pleasure, his irises . . . darker?</p><p>What was he thinking about his first orgasm with another? And just like that, those damned doubts returned. What is he thinking about me?</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d He released some of the constriction around her. When he trailed the backs of his fingers across one of her breasts, then lower, her lids grew heavy. \u201cHow does my mate like to be petted?\u201d He sifted his fingers through the curls on her sex.</p><p>If he touched her clitoris, she was going to lose it. And if she totally let go, she\u2019d be confirming everything he\u2019d said about her. \u201cWait.\u201d This very day he\u2019d called her \u201ceasy quarry,\u201d and she was proving him right! At the thought, she tensed, her impending orgasm dissipating. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweet, you don\u2019t want to stop. I scent how badly you need release.\u201d</p><p>Desperately!</p><p>The sorceress in her was clamoring, Pleasure\u2019s there for the taking!</p><p>The vulnerable woman within murmured, If he shames you after this, it will hurt forever.</p><p>\u201cLet me tend to you, Melanthe. You must be aching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . can\u2019t.\u201d She turned her head away.</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>She\u2019d let other males pleasure her\u2014just not him!</p><p>Thronos punched the tree, cracking the trunk, but Melanthe never faced him.</p><p>Before he said something he regretted, he drew back his wings, striding away from her. He found his breeches, nearly ripping them apart in frustration.</p><p>Touching her had surpassed all of his fantasies. He\u2019d never known a female could be so soft, so sensual. But she\u2019d denied him. He\u2019d failed to overcome her resistance\u2014he\u2019d . . . failed.</p><p>And he\u2019d been unable to hold out against the feel of her. His legs were still unsteady from that mind-blowing release. His shaft had liked its culmination so well, it\u2019d been primed for the next one immediately.</p><p>He would never get enough of her! Yanking his breeches up his damp legs, he fastened them over his still raging member, then collected his shirt. By the time he was dressed, she\u2019d donned her skirt and was fastening her breastplate.</p><p>Yet again things had gone sideways. Yet again Thronos didn\u2019t understand his current position. She\u2019d described Pandemonia\u2019s traps; was this an unearthly pleasure followed by punishment?</p><p>Or merely a foiled plan to get her pregnant? \u201cWhy would you let other males give you pleasure but not me?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cBecause none of them would ridicule me if I let go. And none of them deemed me a harlot. There were things I wanted to do to you, with you, but I heard your voice in my head, sneering that I was easy quarry.\u201d</p><p>He wanted them to get past this, to start over. So he could touch her again, wrap her close to him. Gods, how erotic it had been, with the skin of his wings molding over the curves of her womanly little body. Enfolding her had fulfilled some primal need in him, had made him feel like he was taking her into him. \u201cI won\u2019t insult you like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll just think it. Thronos, I want to be with a male who likes me. Not one who hates me but is forced by his instinct to be with me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree nights ago, you compared me to a broken bone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were different then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, you assumed that I was sleeping with my brother. Yet after we resolved that little misunderstanding, you\u2019ve been trying to shame me. You expect me to lose control with you\u2014when you scorn that very behavior? How can I just snap my fingers and get over that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did these thoughts arise in the middle of what we were doing? If I could temporarily clear my mind of all the males who\u2019d come before me\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>He rubbed his hand over his face. \u201cThat came out worse than I intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd proved my point utterly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough I\u2019d once wanted to hurt you, I no longer do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy this turnaround?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was cruel before because I thought you were evil. For centuries, I believed that. This anger inside me grew and grew. It\u2019s been seething there so long, and I felt like I\u2019d explode if I didn\u2019t vent it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThronos, you haven\u2019t been venting it\u2014you\u2019ve been giving it to me to keep. You might have eased your ill will, but you\u2019ve kindled mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to just forget how many males have bedded you? Every time you and your sister left Rothkalina, I knew it was because you were on the hunt for a power. I knew you\u2019d bedded yet another sorcerer who\u2019d stolen one of your abilities.\u201d He paced, his leg beginning to ache once more, a stark contrast to those moments when all he\u2019d felt was her lush body against him and the residual heat of pleasure. The pain was all the worse after its temporary absence. \u201cI was left so damned conflicted. Even as I was enraged because someone hurt my mate, I\u2019d be racked with jealousy. Whenever you let another take you . . .\u201d He stopped to face her. \u201cMelanthe, there is no word to describe that pain.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cI can\u2019t change my past. I wouldn\u2019t even if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I suppose those lovers were so amazing that you couldn\u2019t stand to miss a single one?\u201d And yet his first sexual encounter with Melanthe had resulted in no orgasm for her, and him releasing against her belly.</p><p>How excellent, Talos.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take back my past, because then I wouldn\u2019t be me. I\u2019ve done these things, and I\u2019ve had these experiences. Which means I\u2019ll only fall for someone who can accept me\u2014as is. There\u2019s nothing worse than when a male looks at a female and thinks, \u2018She would be perfect, if only . . .\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe I think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do! Melanthe would be perfect if only she were a convent-raised virgin, innocent in the ways of men. If only she could fly, tell the truth, and go without stealing/drinking/gambling. If only she were a Vrekener.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny these things. \u201cAnd have you reasoned so about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only you laughed. If only you valued gold\u2014and each minute alive. If only you could comprehend that I\u2019m more than a number.\u201d</p><p>He bit out a sound of frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think of you like this! But it guts me to know you\u2019ve been with others, and I can\u2019t stop imagining you with them! Jealousy claws at me from the inside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know: Can you ever get over my past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not hurt you again, not as I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked. Can you get over it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to lie to her, but he didn\u2019t see how he could ignore what she\u2019d been doing for five centuries. \u201cYou have to give me time to wrap my head around all this. For very, very many years, my life was simple. I had one job to do, one thing on which to focus. Now? I\u2019m always conflicted. I just need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time were you planning to give me to get used to life at Skye Hall? To dress differently, to act differently. Even to make love differently. How much time would I be allotted to become someone other than myself?\u201d</p><p>He stabbed his hands through his hair. \u201cThen tell me something to change my mind. You\u2019ve always made me rethink things. Do it now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014not when you boil my past down to an imaginary number of males. Know that you\u2019re about to join their ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you, they all failed to win me. When I finally find the one I\u2019m supposed to be with, I\u2019ll give him something no other has claimed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>She pinned his gaze with her own. \u201cMy heart.\u201d</p><p>Something of hers he could possess that no other had before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no different from Felix. Both of you wanting something from me. But neither of you ever liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am nothing like that sorcerer! I\u2019d give my life for yours. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your instinct. Remember when you yelled at me, railing that it compelled you to pursue me\u2014otherwise you would have taken my head yourself? If instinct is what\u2019s driving you to be with me, then you might as well be ensorcelled against your will.\u201d</p><p>Guilt flared\u2014he had even fought his instinct when it urged him to bestow a kindness on her. He\u2019d had numerous opportunities to limit her suffering, and each time he\u2019d opted for her misery.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves, Thronos. With our history, these last three days have just been a recap. The damage has long since been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s trying to get me to forget the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to forget it! To see it differently.\u201d She pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cWhy am I even trying? It\u2019s like arguing with a flying, demonic wall. I just can\u2019t do this with you!\u201d She sat to put on her boots, refusing to look at him.</p><p>Ignoring me once again. Keeping her within his sight, he paced the glade.</p><p>Yet as his ire cooled, he began to feel like the worst hypocrite. Who was he to judge her? He\u2019d planned to commit an offendment to impregnate her, to trap her, though they weren\u2019t wed.</p><p>I dare to judge?</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he get over the past? He was going to destroy her before it was all over.</p><p>She\u2019d been hunted, attacked, and poisoned most of her life. It was a wonder she had any goodness in her at all! She could have done truly unforgivable deeds. Instead, she\u2019d lived her life.</p><p>Without him.</p><p>And that\u2019s really what you can\u2019t forgive.</p><p>For ages, he\u2019d told himself that her actions had forever changed him\u2014a stream carving a groove through rock\u2014ensuring he would always despise her.</p><p>But deep down, hadn\u2019t he feared the opposite was true? That no force in the universe could change his feelings for her?</p><p>He recalled his conversation with N\u00efx, when she\u2019d told him how to find Melanthe. He\u2019d been choking back frustration that he would have to wait an entire year to capture his mate, predicting he\u2019d go mad in the interim, when the Valkyrie had said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a piece of advice, Thronos Talos. Before Melanthe became this, she was that. . . .\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known what the Valkyrie was talking about. Now, as he gazed over at his mate, the answer came to him.</p><p>Before Melanthe became my enemy, she was my best friend.</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>When Lanthe stood, dressed once more, she realized she was overflowing with power.</p><p>Which meant she was done beguiling Thronos. She turned a mean smile in his direction. I\u2019ll go wherever my happy ass feels like.</p><p>He stopped his pacing. \u201cMelanthe, we don\u2019t have to figure this out all at once. We can\u2019t expect to wade through everything so soon. It will take time, which we will have once we get home.\u201d</p><p>For a crazy moment, she thought, Maybe I should just go with him. It was rumored that the Vrekeners stored all the sorcery they harvested in a vault in Skye Hall; Thronos was planning to take her straight there.</p><p>As charged up as she felt right now, she could command Aristo to kiss Sorceri ass and order him to release all the abilities his kind had stolen (maybe taking one or two or ten for herself and Sabine). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lanthe would be a Sorceri superstar, no longer preyed upon by the likes of Portia and Ember!</p><p>Wait a minute. Surely Thronos had to worry about the havoc she could wreak up there? \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Thronos. How do you think you\u2019re going to keep me captive? You don\u2019t have a collar, and my persuasion is recharging with a vengeance. . . .\u201d She trailed off, comprehension dawning. \u201cOh, dear gods. Y-you planned to take my power.\u201d</p><p>For the briefest instant, had he winced?</p> <p>She fought for breath, feeling like he\u2019d punched her in the chest. His face blurred as her eyes watered. \u201cYou\u2019d steal my soul? Turn me into a mindless breeder for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not do that to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wonder why I don\u2019t want to have children with you! Would you take their souls, too?\u201d She made a fist above her heart. \u201cPress a fire scythe to their chests?\u201d As she began backing away from him, sorcery whorled around her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He looked like the idea appalled him. \u201cI did consider doing that to you, but immediately decided against it.\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook with fury when she said, \u201cI\u2019m done with this. With you. Done.\u201d</p> <p>When he strode toward her, she commanded him, \u201cFreeze in place.\u201d She was astonished at how easily she wielded her persuasion, her sorcery flowing unhampered. Maybe her nervousness had affected it.</p><p>After all, every time she\u2019d used it in the past, she might have been calling Vrekeners down upon herself and Sabine. No chance of that now.</p><p>Though Thronos fought the command, he was forced to obey it. \u201cGods damn it, Melanthe, don\u2019t use your sorcery on me! You can\u2019t comprehend what it\u2019s like for me to lose control of my body and mind.\u201d When she merely raised her brows, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t do this now. We\u2019ve been moving in the right direction. You can\u2019t deny the change between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know what you were plotting! I command you to remain in this glade for twenty-four hours. That ought to give you some time for contemplation.\u201d</p><p>Incredulous, he bit out, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve done enough of that? And where will you go? To steal a key by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d If she reached both demon lairs before dawn, the armies would still be locked in conflict. Not only could she follow the sounds of their skirmishes, she would encounter few demons within their respective dens.</p> <p>Of course, with her sense of direction, she should be lost directly.</p><p>Even if she somehow made it to the Abysmals\u2019 stronghold, it was fronted by a maze of ruins. Yet she expected to find her way into and out of them? She couldn\u2019t find her way out of a human mini-mart.</p><p>As if he read her mind, Thronos said, \u201cHow will you know where to go? If you follow that path back toward Inferno, you\u2019ll have to cross the pest zone.\u201d</p><p>Or she could follow the path away from Inferno for a time, then cut north (or south, or whatever) to reach the plateau. Inferno would be on one side, Deep Place on the other.</p><p>She\u2019d thread the needle, get the lay of the land, and decide her strategy. \u201cI have a plan.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head hard. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve managed all these years without you.\u201d Of course, she\u2019d always had Sabine to protect her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve managed, but you\u2019ve never been in hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDebatable.\u201d Perhaps Lanthe could finally protect herself, take off the training wheels to become a badass like her sister.</p><p>Lanthe remembered a time centuries ago, when she\u2019d asked Sabine, \u201cWhy are you so much bolder and braver than I am?\u201d</p><p>Sabine had told her, \u201cIllusion is reality, Lanthe. If you look or act all-powerful for long enough, guess what you\u2019ll become.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe squared her shoulders. \u201cOne last thing. I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this\u2014actually, I\u2019m not sorry at all\u2014but your brother is the one who stabbed me with a pitchfork and brained Sabine. He and his men are the ones who hunted us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAristo? What are you talking about? You\u2019ve never encountered my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI peeked into your head and saw your recollection of our first meeting after your fall. I saw your brother\u2019s face, but it certainly wasn\u2019t the first time.\u201d</p><p>While Thronos gaped at her words, she said, \u201cNow, hand over that medallion.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been so wrapped up in him that she\u2019d all but forgotten about it.</p><p>He reluctantly removed the piece from his pocket, handing it over as ordered. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t sense this gold?\u201d She ran the pads of her fingers over the gleaming smoothness. Red gold. In her hands.</p><p>It was the size of a pocket watch, with the finest engravings across the surface, depicting . . . flames. Seeing it reminded her of her dream on the island, of a woman saying, Set worlds aflame.</p><p>Lanthe looped the chain around her neck, telling Thronos, \u201cI kept waiting for you to make a gift of this. Now I realize you probably meant to use it against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t true. I did intend to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think my reaction would\u2019ve been like? How might I have expressed my gratitude? Maybe you\u2019ve learned a Sorceri lesson: never put off till tomorrow what you can revel in today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you leave me here like this, I won\u2019t be able to protect myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I command you to remain in this glade for twenty-four hours unless there is a threat to your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Melanthe! Can you not imagine what this is like for me, to feel the force of your sorcery again? It makes my skin crawl!\u201d His muscles swelled as he strained against her commands. \u201cThere is no more horrific feeling. When I jumped through that window . . . and I couldn\u2019t fly . . .\u201d His voice grew hoarse. \u201cTo see the ground rushing closer, and I couldn\u2019t move my wings. I just wanted . . . to move my wings. Look into my thoughts right now\u2014see that memory!\u201d</p><p>To do so would be like looking back over her shoulder\u2014when she should be running away. She\u2019d done that twice with him, and rued both times.</p><p>With an inward curse, she gave a light probe into his mind.</p><p>She saw the ground rushing closer. She heard his instinct screaming inside him to save himself. She felt his roiling emotions when his body refused to obey\u2014when he realized he was about to die.</p><p>A stranglehold of shock. Raw terror.</p><p>In such a young boy.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I never yelled on the way down?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cBecause fear had robbed me of breath.\u201d</p><p>She withdrew from his thoughts as swiftly as she\u2019d entered them. Tears pricked her eyes, but she willed herself not to cry.</p><p>\u201cNow you understand what it feels like, to act in opposition to instinct\u2014to the very will to survive! But I\u2019d relive that night again if it would make you stay here with me.\u201d</p><p>She reminded herself that he still planned to kidnap her. He\u2019d considered stealing her soul! He was going to serve her up on a platter to his brother. She replayed how he\u2019d tossed her into that tree and lifted her by her jaw. And his comments.</p><p>Someone like you. I\u2019d take your head myself. I should drop you.</p><p>If she allowed him to treat her this shittily, then she was no better than he was. When in trouble . . . She turned from him and walked away.</p><p>\u201cMelanthe leaving me\u2014not exactly new! I\u2019m sick of pursuing you! All my life you\u2019ve turned from me again and again. Begone, then. Good riddance!\u201d</p><p>As she strode off, she heard him cursing her, but hardened herself against him. The sooner she got to the lairs, the sooner she could be back in Rothkalina. She might make it to the castle in time for dinner!</p><p>She found the overgrown path they\u2019d traveled upon, then headed away from Inferno. In theory.</p><p>For the next hour, she followed the trail, the forest brush growing sparser. Each time thoughts of Thronos flickered into her mind, she told herself: Don\u2019t think about his fall, Lanthe.</p><p>She came upon a fork in the trail, with another inscribed rock marker that she couldn\u2019t read. She could go straight or turn left. Imagining the marker read Go left to thread the needle, she turned in that direction, readying for danger.</p><p>When nothing happened, she trudged on.</p><p>And on and on\u2014for what felt like eternity. Surely day would soon break. She was beginning to think time moved differently on this plane\u2014not uncommon for demon realms. At last, the skirmishes grew louder.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about his fall.</p><p>Oh, who was she kidding? Thronos hadn\u2019t fallen. She\u2019d lashed out and hurt the one innocent Vrekener among that group. Yes, she\u2019d been a traumatized girl, but he hadn\u2019t deserved the horror she\u2019d meted out.</p><p>She\u2019d just admitted to herself that she\u2019d been . . . wrong, when she emerged into a large field, the underbrush giving way to craggy terrain.</p><p>For a moment she thought the sun was rising, then realized she was seeing displays of demon power over the plateau. Fire missiles soared. Ice splintered from frozen bombs, hail arcing across the night. Battle magics cascaded like Disney fireworks.</p><p>She\u2019d threaded the needle! On one side of her were rivers of lava. Miles across from them were ruins. Both lairs had sentries fronting them, or as Lanthe liked to call them guides.</p><p>So which should she enter first? Eeny, meeny, miny . . . She headed toward Inferno.</p><p>Sabine would never believe her little sister had found her way here\u2014well, anywhere. Lanthe couldn\u2019t wait to tell her, to talk to her about all the things she\u2019d learned and felt.</p><p>She\u2019d also have to come clean about how close she and Thronos had been.</p><p>Thronos. With his heartbreaking eyes and tragic memories. With his determined expression.</p><p>With his toe-curling kiss and stubborn jealousy.</p><p>None of which she cared about because she was going home. No more dwelling on Thronos\u2014just because she\u2019d hurt him didn\u2019t give him the right to damn her to the Skye!</p><p>By the time she felt the heat of the lava, her guilt had waned under the weight of resentment. Sorcery began sparking from her skin. Thronos had abducted her, expecting her to give up her entire life for his. She was done being captured, done enduring mistreatment, done muzzling her sexuality.</p><p>Melanthe of the Deie Sorceri was an empowered sorceress on the prowl. Even hell should tremble!</p><p>When those sentries approached with swords drawn, she smiled. \u201cWell, hello, boys.\u201d With a wave of her hand, she mesmerized the pair, commanding them to lead her into the cavern, protect her with their lives, and tell others that she was their leader\u2019s female.</p><p>Then she bade them to take her to the key.</p><p>Easy as easy pie.</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>For most of the night, Thronos had grappled against her sorcery.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what shocked him more: the revelation about his brother, or that Melanthe had bespelled him\u2014without hesitation.</p><p>But her persuasion would be useless against demons, or the pest! If she perished, he would . . .</p><p>He would what? Vrekeners simply didn\u2019t go on without their mates.</p><p>Ages ago, after he\u2019d healed from the worst of his injuries, his own mother had found solace in suicide, unable to live without his father.</p><p>Thronos\u2019s brows drew tight. By that reasoning, so long as Melanthe\u2019s life was in danger, then so too was his.</p><p>At once, he felt her command fading. In minutes, he\u2019d freed himself from her invisible bonds.</p><p>His head swung upward. If he took to the air, he couldn\u2019t see markers warning of danger zones. Chance I\u2019ll have to take. He swooped his wings, shooting into the sky with his usual grinding pain. He hovered over the canopy, tracking her by her sorcery and her entrancing scent.</p><p>While he trailed her, he replayed all the things she\u2019d told him about Aristo. Over the centuries, Thronos and Aristo had grown apart, seeing little eye to eye. There wasn\u2019t a Vrekener alive who reviled Sorceri more than Aristo. His brother\u2019s voice echoed in his head: \u201cThey murdered my father and crippled my younger brother. Death to every last one of them!\u201d Aristo had even threatened the Sorceri wards within the Air Territories, until he\u2019d seen how unpopular a move that would be.</p><p>Melanthe\u2019s accusation was possible, logistically speaking. It\u2019d taken Thronos years to heal, to learn how to walk and fly again. He\u2019d been in his teens before he\u2019d been able to travel long distances. Consumed with locating her, he\u2019d had no interest in politics.</p><p>Had he suspected things were amiss? In the last century or so, worrying accounts had made their way to him, but his mind had remained focused on the search, and he\u2019d easily discounted them.</p><p>Because they\u2019d all concerned the King of the Skye.</p><p>And now his mate had added her own account. Yes, Thronos had learned her tells. When she\u2019d told him about Aristo, she\u2019d been leaning forward aggressively, eyes wide. His wings hadn\u2019t twitched.</p><p>No wonder she was desperate to avoid his home. He had to convince her that he could keep her safe. He had no doubt of it; a Vrekener protecting his mate was stronger than any others of his kind.</p><p>And no male would fight more savagely for his female.</p><p>But once Thronos caught up to her tonight, what would stop her from commanding him again? What if she ordered him to forget her, as she\u2019d threatened on the island? Before, he\u2019d questioned if that mightn\u2019t be a boon.</p><p>Now the idea made his heart pound with dread, sweat beading on his forehead.</p><p>The closer he got to the demon strongholds, the louder the skirmishes grew. In the sky over the plateau, Thronos saw more Volar demons locked in combat. So members of the same demonarchy had become enemies?</p><p>If what Melanthe said was true, then those creatures were his demon brothers. Of course, if what she said was true, then the Volars would be preferable to Aristo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thronos breathed deeply for her scent, seeking her sorcery. Her trail was confusing, seeming to lead to both encampments.</p><p>The freshest was to Deep Place. With its maze.</p><p>Thronos could fly over it, but would those Volars spot him? And if the maze was meant to keep out enemies, there would likely be air mines planted above it.</p> <p>He descended, hastening by foot to the labyrinth. The ruins were a riot of shapes\u2014pillars, disks, remnants of arches and walls\u2014creating misleading plays of light and an infinite number of hiding places.</p><p>Threats could be anywhere. Everywhere. Would he find her mauled body in these ruins? Hear her screams as she was attacked by demons?</p><p>His lungs burned; he increased his pace even more.</p><p>At the entrance to the maze was a sign inscribed with those foreign glyphs. The markings seemed to vibrate, before growing legible to him.</p><p>Behold Deep Place, lair of the Abysmals, possessors of the First Key, guardians of the Second Gate of Hell. Woe to all who enter the bowels of this realm.</p> <p>Exactly how deep was this den? Vrekeners hated all things deep. He charged forward anyway\u2014</p><p>His eyes widened. Melanthe!</p><p>Apparently, she was just leaving, looking bored as she strolled from the labyrinth.</p><p>Great. Killjoy had freed himself. He was dripping sweat, looking like he\u2019d run or flown marathons to get to her.</p><p>The unbidden thrill she felt to see him only worsened her already bad mood.</p><p>He hurried toward her, but she kept walking, her portal plans on hold for tonight. Escaping hell wouldn\u2019t be as simple as she\u2019d envisioned.</p> <p>\u201cMelanthe, wait!\u201d</p><p>Sadly, she wouldn\u2019t be able to command him so easily after her sorcery outlays. She\u2019d drained much of her power, though she hoped not in vain.</p><p>Thronos caught up to her and reached for her arm, but her withering look made him drop his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you safe?\u201d he asked between breaths.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get free? Did something attack you?\u201d She was already looking past him, debating her next move.</p><p>\u201cNot in the strictest sense. What were you doing in there? Have you lost your mind, going into that lair alone?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou just walked in?\u201d He frowned. \u201cWait. You\u2019ve got two keys. My gods, you\u2019ve been to Deep Place and Inferno!\u201d</p> <p>Around her neck, on either side of her priceless medallion, she\u2019d strung two ancient-looking keys to a gate of hell\u2014because she\u2019d already stolen both treasures.</p><p>Nearly identical, each key was the length of her little finger. At one end was a filigree bow; the other end was flat, notched, and engraved. Overall, they were as dainty and elegant as Pandemonia wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Bonus: they too were made of dragon gold. She now wore three pieces of priceless silisk gold.</p><p>Lifting the keys had been the easy part. Hidden within each stronghold was its portal. Beside it? A key. She\u2019d thought she would have to go all Italian Job for her mission, but the only security had been manual: hulking guards.</p><p>Hulking guards who were now sleeping like little babies.</p><p>With her talents, the keys might as well have been under the front doormat. \u201cI stole these with ease,\u201d she told Thronos. \u201cYour \u2018lacking\u2019 mate is still a thieving sorceress, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all these brutal demons have been locked in endless warfare, and you managed to do what armies couldn\u2019t over an eternity?\u201d He looked a little . . . awestruck.</p><p>She brushed off one shoulder, then the other. \u201cJust let me do like I do.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, the portals had turned out to be trickier than she\u2019d suspected. Each one was ensconced in stone, with etchings all around the opening. In Deep Place, clouds and vines were depicted, indicating a heaven plane. The one in Inferno was surrounded by dripping fangs, as if the opening were a ravenous mouth.</p><p>Should be a no-brainer\u2014I\u2019ll take the heaven plane, Alex\u2014but then, this was Pandemonia. Could be a trick or a test.</p><p>Worse, they were old-school portals, basically huge vacuums, which meant she couldn\u2019t dip a toe and then return.</p><p>Worse still, she couldn\u2019t steer them. Even though she had the keys, those portals were permanently pointed in one direction like subway tubes\u2014and she had no idea where they led.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve seized these.\u201d Thronos reached for her chain, raising the keys. He inspected the engraved ends, one depicting dripping fangs and one those vines. \u201cWhy do you remain here? Were you . . . had you been coming back for me?\u201d The hopefulness in his tone tugged at something inside her.</p><p>She snatched her keys back. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Scowl. \u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the portals are more complicated than I expected.\u201d Not because she hesitated to abandon Thronos on a hell plane.</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to rush anything.\u201d She might be better off in the Zero-G Glade for another day. She might be better off waiting to create her own portal.</p><p>She gazed past him. Dawn was finally breaking. Her crime-playtime was over for the day. In any case, before she made another foray into either camp, she should probably recharge. Remarkably, she hadn\u2019t tapped out her persuasion, but a top-off wouldn\u2019t go amiss.</p><p>Without a word, she headed back toward the glade.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked as they neared the brush.</p><p>We? Optimist. \u201cI just burgled the two most valuable possessions in this realm.\u201d She cast a wary glance over her shoulder. \u201cEventually those demons are going to want them back. I\u2019m returning to the glade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d fly you there, but the dragons will be out foraging soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll guide you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly, I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d No sooner had she said that than they reached a junction where the path forked out three ways, engraved stones marking each. She didn\u2019t remember this from before.</p><p>Mental shrug. Eeny, meeny, miny . . . She turned toward the one all the way to the right.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that one.\u201d</p><p>She faced him with pursed lips. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marker reads: The Long Way. Which doesn\u2019t sound very promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne reads: To the Frozen Lake. The other: Hell Beast Trail.\u201d</p><p>She headed toward the frozen lake, intending to step off the path as soon as things got close to chilly.</p><p>He remained by her side. \u201cMelanthe, I need to talk to you about what you told me. About my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out the truth for yourself soon enough. Everything I\u2019ve told you can be verified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were young, and it was so long ago. Perhaps you mistook him? Aristo\u2019s talons are silvered\u2014his wings would be like any other knight\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used to swig from a golden flask.\u201d When Thronos paled, she said, \u201cOh, so you remember it? Even if I could forget his face, I\u2019d never forget his gold.\u201d</p><p>Thronos swallowed. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t mean to hurt you in that haystack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my hand got stabbed, the next pitchfork jab nicked my ear. Before another one could land, Sabine ran to distract them. If not for her, your brother would have gored me to death. Look, I don\u2019t care if you believe me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d In spite of how gut-wrenching that must be. \u201cThen do something about it. You should go to the Skye\u2014and clean house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to. I will make my brother see reason when we return.\u201d</p><p>She stutter-stepped. She didn\u2019t know which part of his statement mystified her more\u2014the fact that he still intended her to go with him, or that he planned to rehab Aristo. \u201cI hate to tell you this, but your brother is evil. EVIL. The kind you can\u2019t rehabilitate. Face it, Thronos\u2014in the brother department, we both lost out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you expect me to kill Aristo without trying to reach him? I also thought you were evil, but decided not to harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to turn out like me. You\u2019re setting yourself up for disappointment. Which is your business. I just want to return to my home.\u201d She started forward again. The brush began to thin. In the distance, she could see a field.</p><p>He walked backward to keep his gaze locked on hers. \u201cI can\u2019t allow that. We will not be parted. After this long without you, how could I release you now?\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand shining with blue energy in front of his face. \u201cYou won\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p><p>He glowered at her hand. \u201cMelanthe, just stop and discuss this with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same problems as before apply. When you can see past my number, then maybe we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I could see past it, you\u2019d come with me to the Skye? Then use your power to make me forget the men you\u2019ve been with,\u201d he said, as if he\u2019d just lit on the idea and found it excellent. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes, then I\u2019ll subject myself to your sorcery once more.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her blue fists, hating him for hurting her yet again, hating that he didn\u2019t even understand how he was hurting her. \u201cShould I make you think I\u2019m totally a virgin, or maybe that I only had a couple of fuck buddies? How about one conquest per century?\u201d Voice rising with each word, she yelled, \u201cI hate the way you make me feel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to! But I don\u2019t know how to handle this. I can\u2019t just act like I haven\u2019t felt wrath. Like I haven\u2019t been brought to my knees with jealousy. . . .\u201d He trailed off, frowning at a pair of marble markers that bordered the path. Only two lines had been carved on them.</p><p>Thronos had already gone across their border.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they say?\u201d she asked, backing away.</p><p>He read them, gazing up with bafflement. And then things really got weird.</p><p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>The markers read:</p><p>Pain confesses all.</p><p>And Time cares naught.</p><p>What did that mean? Enough with this bloody place! What would this zone have in store? The mention of pain didn\u2019t worry him; he knew pain, could handle any physical agony. But what about Melanthe?</p><p>The sun was beginning to rise, purple clouds in the background like a halo over her black hair. He\u2019d just taken a step in her direction when he spied movement.</p><p>He disbelieved his sight\u2014not far behind her was a tank-sized beast with bloodred eyes, dripping fangs, and bony spikes protruding from its spine.</p><p>A hellhound.</p><p>\u201cFreeze, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>She did. Eyes wide, she whispered, \u201cSomething\u2019s behind me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shallow nod.</p><p>The beast\u2019s soot-colored pelt was said to be dense enough to repel swords. And talons.</p><p>But if Thronos could reach her and get them into the air . . .</p><p>The hound lifted its snout. Catching their scent, it let out a chilling howl. When it charged them, Thronos lunged for her.</p><p>He never reached Melanthe. Another beast collided with him from the side, a locomotive of force that nearly knocked him out of his boots.</p><p>A second hound.</p><p>Thronos crashed to the ground. When his vision cleared, he found one mammoth paw pinning him by the waist. He cast his wing up, talon slashing.</p><p>The strike didn\u2019t even disturb the beast\u2019s dense fur.</p><p>\u201cRun, Lanthe!\u201d</p><p>She was already sprinting in his direction, as if a hound of hell pursued her\u2014because it did. She ran with a feylike quickness.</p><p>Melanthe was fast. It was faster.</p><p>Thronos launched another strike of his wings, and another, buying time to glance over his shoulder, taking in every detail of their possible escape route.</p><p>Behind him was an open field fringed with moonraker trees. To the west, a charred mountain peak loomed over the field. Atop it were dozens of dragons, jostling for territory. Their hive? They clawed the black stone for purchase and loosed great streams of fire. Rocks plummeted.</p><p>A pair of dragons took off from that height, heading in the direction of the demon valley. Sparring in the air, they tore chunks of flesh from each other, scales raining down.</p><p>Sunrise; feed on fallen. More dragons would follow.</p><p>As Melanthe high-stepped past Thronos, she cried, \u201cStop playing with yours and kill it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I\u201d\u2014he jerked his body left to right to avoid snapping fangs\u2014\u201cthink of that?!\u201d</p><p>If the beast\u2019s pelt was impervious, it\u2019d have only a few vulnerabilities. As swiftly as he could, Thronos whipped his wings up, talons crossing over the creature\u2019s face. Before the hound could bite down on them, he gave a yell, dug in, then ripped his wings to the sides.</p><p>His talons raked across the beast\u2019s eyes, slicing through to the very bone of its eye sockets.</p><p>Blood spurted. The beast yelped in pain, blindly stumbling toward the brush. A mistake. Dozens of huge reptilian-looking predators snatched the defenseless hound into the shadows.</p><p>With a haphazard swoop of his wings, Thronos half-lunged to his feet, stumbling after Melanthe, pain coursing through his bad leg. He craned his head around. Where was she\u2014</p><p>He caught sight of her, eluding the hound on her tail. He stepped forward, nearly planting his foot in resin. \u201cWatch for resin!\u201d This pit was covered with silver reeds, almost indistinguishable from the rest of the ground.</p><p>Risking the dragons, Thronos bounded into the air. He wouldn\u2019t be able to reach her before the hound did. So he pulled his wings tight and dove, aiming for the beast itself. At the last second, he rolled to launch a shoulder into the hound\u2019s flank, knocking it off its feet.</p><p>While it shook away confusion, Thronos snared its meaty tail, pinning it between his arm and torso, digging his claws in. Gnashing his teeth, using all the strength he possessed, he hauled on the tail as he began to rotate. As if throwing a discus, he spun the beast. Again. And again. With a bellow, he released the thing, sending it flying through the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When it landed against the mountain, stone fractured. Its limp body collapsed.</p><p>Hounds dispatched, Thronos tensed to run for her; almost fell flat on his face. His feet were caught in mere inches of resin! He pulled with all his might.</p><p>More of the dragons launched themselves from the peak, heading toward the plateau. The mountain shook with an earthquake\u2019s force, boulders falling.</p> <p>Melanthe was about to run through a narrow ravine. From this distance, he could see a rockslide crashing toward her.</p><p>\u201cThe rocks, Lanthe!\u201d</p><p>She spotted them herself, skidding to a stop. Whirling around, she headed back toward the field.</p><p>Toward him. \u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>The sky rained boulders. They pocked the clearing, shaking the ground with each impact. Thunk, thunk, thunk.</p> <p>She sidestepped, dodging an arrow-shaped boulder of charred stone. If it\u2019d hit her . . .</p><p>Her body would\u2019ve been pulverized. He strained harder, working his wings to free his legs. She would have died.</p><p>A real death. He\u2019d heard of Sorceri ended by illness and by stab wounds, for gods\u2019 sakes.</p><p>She was almost back to this clearing. She ran under one of those gigantic trees for cover, nimbly skipping over its roots.</p><p>Then she\u2014stopped. Her upper body jolted forward before she righted her balance.</p><p>Their eyes met. \u201cMelanthe?\u201d</p> <p>She peered down, frowned.</p><p>She . . . no. She couldn\u2019t be caught in a pit. \u201cI\u2019m coming for you!\u201d Every muscle in his body strained. Though the quakes had stopped, the onrush of boulders continued. He could hear their deafening descent down the side of the mountain.</p><p>A monolith the size of a garbage truck was heading for Melanthe\u2019s tree. She gazed up in horror, hunching down.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d He thrashed, kicking, sweat pouring into his eyes, wings heaving. Damn it! The backdraft was cooling the resin, only solidifying its hold.</p><p>High in the tree, a giant limb caught the boulder. He and Melanthe shared a look of relief.</p><p>Until they heard the first crack of wood above her. The limb was about to give way. She started struggling in a frenzy.</p><p>He\u2019d never get to her in time! He flared his claws to sever his legs, slashing at his skin. When the top tree limb snapped, the boulder landed on the next one down. It was already bowing . . .</p><p>He bit back yells as he cut, hacking through his calf muscle, baring the bone. Gripping his bloody leg in two fists, he wrenched his hands in different directions. The bone wouldn\u2019t break!</p> <p>She murmured, \u201cThronos?\u201d Across this distance, he heard her distinctly, felt the timbre of pure fear in her voice. She had to know a boulder that big would kill her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d Even as his talon gouged chunks of flesh from his other leg, the process was taking too much time, too much! Three failed tries to break one leg!</p><p>Craaaack. His bone snapped just as a tree limb did. A leg free! But the boulder was plummeting like a juggernaut, crushing one limb after another until it caught on the one directly over Lanthe, not twenty feet above her head.</p><p>A final defense. Could he reach her in time, and have the strength to pull her from her own pit?</p><p>She\u2019d gone still, as if she feared making too much movement.</p><p>\u201cStart cutting!\u201d he yelled as he set to his other leg, balancing even as he swung his razor-sharp claws.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Never slowing his gruesome task, he glanced at her. She was holding up her bare hands, with their tiny pink fingernails. No gauntlets. Tears began trailing down her cheeks.</p><p>The last tree limb was about to go; splinters fluttered over her, dusting her braids. \u201cTell my sister I love her\u201d\u2014she swiped at her eyes\u2014\u201cand f-for what it\u2019s worth, those months in the meadow . . . I was happy. Happiest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, NO!\u201d He was free of the pit! Using wings, hands, and what was left of his legs, he sped toward her.</p><p>Their eyes met again, tears pouring from hers. She raised her chin and gave him a pilot\u2019s salute.</p><p>The wood broke. The boulder crashed down.</p><p>One second Melanthe was standing there. The next she\u2019d disappeared, crushed.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>He bellowed, \u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d She couldn\u2019t be gone!</p><p>When he reached the boulder, he thought he could scent blood and . . . ground bone. Because there was nothing left of her.</p><p>With a strangled yell, he dug his claws into the stone; using his wings for propulsion, he shoved with all the strength he had left.</p><p>Moved it not one inch. She\u2019s dead.</p><p>Another desperate shove. Not a godsdamned inch.</p><p>She was dead. He felt it. Knew it.</p><p>He roared with agony. He had five centuries\u2019 worth of hate to give that stone\u2014his new enemy. Another shove. Another. And another. And another. He rammed his horns into it until blood poured down into his eyes.</p><p>In the midst of this frenzy, memories of her flashed through his mind.</p><p>Of him telling her they would be wed when they grew older . . .</p><p>\u201cWould that make me a princess of heaven?\u201d she asked with a chuckle. \u201cWould we have much gold up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have me\u2014and you like me far better than gold!\u201d He tickled her, chasing her around the meadow while she squealed with laughter.</p><p>Of the first time he\u2019d taken her flying . . .</p><p>She peeked up from his chest, her eyes wide, as blue as the sky they crossed. \u201cThronos, this . . . this . . . let\u2019s never go back down!\u201d</p><p>Of them as children caught in the rain, on the very day his father had later raided the abbey.</p><p>Thronos took her in his arms, and she leaned against him.</p><p>When the drops grew heavier, he spread his wings over his head, creating a shelter. \u201cI\u2019ve always room for you too.\u201d</p><p>She nestled against him. As they watched the rain fall, she sighed, \u201cI love you, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>His heart felt too big for his chest, and he had to swallow past the lump in his throat to answer her.</p><p>He\u2019d squandered the treasure he\u2019d been given.</p><p>His claws and horns were gone, but he hadn\u2019t budged the stone. Blood from his hands and head painted his enemy.</p><p>That stone . . . not a godsdamned inch.</p><p>Unmovable. So too would he be.</p><p>Tears blinded him when he realized the stone would be her grave marker. Thronos closed his eyes and took comfort in knowing that they would share it.</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p><p>Melanthe whispered, \u201cSomething\u2019s behind me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Thronos\u2019s eyes shot wide open. She stood before him on the path, frozen, her black hair haloed by purple clouds.</p><p>With not a mark upon her. He was unwounded as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, sorceress?\u201d he rasped. \u201cReal?\u201d Of course not; he must be delirious, still sitting in his own blood, his back against the gravestone, dreaming this. But what if . . . \u201cDo you have no memory of what\u2019s just occurred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were fighting, as usual,\u201d Melanthe snapped under her breath. \u201cFocus, Thronos\u2014what\u2019s behind me?!\u201d</p><p>That same hound howled and charged; with a screech, she took off past Thronos.</p><p>\u201cMelanthe, watch for resin!\u201d What the hell is happening? I am in hell.</p><p>No, maybe a benevolent god was giving him a second chance to save her!</p><p>On that thought, he did a swift about-face, readying for the side attack. He knew what was coming.</p><p>The second hound leapt; Thronos evaded as his wings lashed out, blinding the beast.</p><p>One down.</p><p>He\u2019d taken the hound out earlier this time. The events would be different; he could snag Melanthe before the other beast got too close. He took to the sky, planning to scoop her into his arms.</p><p>The hound pursuing Melanthe must have heard Thronos\u2019s wings swooping; it veered from him\u2014</p><p>Suddenly its body crumpled. Its front paw was stuck in resin!</p><p>See how you like it, beast!</p><p>The pair of sparring dragons launched from the peak then, sending the mountain quaking. As Thronos closed in on Melanthe, the two creatures spotted him in the air and plunged for him.</p><p>New threats. If hell conspired to keep him from saving his mate . . . I\u2019ll defeat hell.</p><p>The dragons spewed fire, but he evaded the crisscrossing streams. He dove under them, heading for the camouflage of the ground.</p><p>Thronos landed, dropping to his hands and one knee, beginning to sprint as if from a starting line. He chanced a glance behind him. As he\u2019d hoped, the pair had abandoned their hunt, continuing on to the plateau for a guaranteed meal. But more followed, so he stayed on the ground. With the hound taken care of, he had more time\u2014</p><p>His third stride was his last.</p><p>His feet were caught again. Another godsdamned pit! He\u2019d done exactly as the hound had! \u201cOh, come on!\u201d he yelled, grappling to free himself. \u201cMelanthe! Don\u2019t run, if you move another inch, you will die!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear him, was about to enter that ravine. With the boulders falling! She skidded to a stop, then whirled around to sprint for the field.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go under that tree!\u201d He gritted his teeth, pulling with all his might.</p><p>She sidestepped, dodging that first arrow-shaped boulder, the charred one from before.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t head for the tree!\u201d She was heading for the tree! \u201cThere\u2019s a pit between the roots!\u201d</p><p>Still not hearing him, she skipped over the roots. Then . . . too late. Her upper body jolted forward before she righted her balance.</p><p>She murmured, \u201cThronos?\u201d Even from this distance, he could hear her distinctly, felt the timbre of pure fear in her voice.</p><p>Their eyes didn\u2019t meet this time; he was too busy hacking at his legs. Break the bones in one go or she dies. \u201cJust hold on! I\u2019m coming for you!\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body strained. He could already hear the gravestone\u2019s descent.</p><p>Thrashing, kicking, sweat burning his eyes. The gravestone snapped the limb high atop the tree.</p><p>Thronos\u2019s bone cracked\u2014earlier than before! I can do this, I can reach her! With one leg freed, he dared a look. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d The next limb down was bowing.</p><p>She knew a boulder that big would kill her. She struggled wildly.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on!\u201d He bit back yells as he cut, hacking through the bloody calf muscle of his other leg. Taking too much time, too much!</p><p>The boulder plummeted like a juggernaut, crushing one limb after another until it caught on the one directly over Lanthe, not twenty feet above her head.</p><p>A final defense.</p><p>\u201cThronos?\u201d She\u2019d gone still, as if she feared making too much movement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go! I\u2019m coming for you! We\u2019re not done, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish things had been different,\u201d she said, voice thick with tears.</p><p>\u201cThey will be! Fight, Lanthe!\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met again. \u201cTell my sister I love her.\u201d Chin raised, Lanthe gave him a salute.</p><p>Second leg free! The tree limb was about to go. He took to the air, diving for her; she kept her gaze on him, as if for courage.</p><p>Craaaack. The boulder crashed down. He collided with it. An instant too late.</p><p>\u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d</p><p>He dug his claws into the stone; using his wings for propulsion, he shoved with all the strength he had left. Ruined my second chance!</p><p>He directed his five hundred years of hate\u2014at himself. I am the enemy. He\u2019d had three fleeting nights with his mate, and he\u2019d taken every opportunity to frighten her, to shame her, to hurt her. As if hundreds of years fleeing his kind hadn\u2019t been enough pain.</p><p>I squandered what I was given, never comprehending the treasure.</p><p>She\u2019s dead.</p><p>Another shove. Another. And another. And another. He gave an agonized roar, clawing at the stone in a frenzy. As he rammed his horns into it, madness threatened, his thoughts taking flight in odd directions. He recalled the end of that encounter he\u2019d had with her mother. . . .</p><p>\u201cMelanthe will never be what you need her to be. You can\u2019t break my daughter, and that\u2019s the only way she\u2019d love you.\u201d</p><p>Thronos sputtered, \u201cI-I don\u2019t want to break her!\u201d Melanthe was perfect as she was!</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to break yourself, hawkling.\u201d</p><p>Perfect, if only? Melanthe would be perfect.</p><p>If only she were alive.</p><p>As blood poured into his eyes, he closed them. Please, gods, give me just one more chance.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s behind me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Thronos\u2019s eyes shot open. Melanthe was before him, heartbreakingly beautiful, not a mark upon her. The sun was starting to rise, purple clouds in the background like a halo over her black hair.</p><p>The hound\u2019s howl marked the beginning.</p><p>Hell conspired.</p><p>Minutes later, the boulder was poised to fall above Lanthe.</p><p>Thronos was missing a wing and a leg. Slashes and puncture wounds covered him. The reptilian predators in the brush that had snatched the first hellhound had come for him this time.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t have ignored that direction. Won\u2019t next time.</p><p>What if he didn\u2019t get a next time? What if three was the limit?</p><p>He prayed to any gods listening: I will do this until I get it right. I will do this for eternity if I have to, but I will save her. . . .</p><p>THIRTY-THREE</p><p>Lanthe toed Thronos\u2019s convulsing body, then hopped back. Her gaze darted from one marble marker to the other, looking for the threat.</p><p>One minute, she and Thronos had been arguing. The next, his eyes had rolled back in his head and he\u2019d dropped like a rock. He was now unconscious, seizing on the ground as if afflicted by a supernatural malady.</p><p>What zone had he crossed into? The nightmare sector? The noxious-air belt? The markers were inscribed with those weird glyphs, and her translator was currently writhing, out cold on the path.</p><p>Lowering clouds closed in, darkening the morning. A soft rain began to fall; lightning streaking above. What to do? Despite his dickitry, she couldn\u2019t just leave him like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was almost as if she felt the same kind of loyalty to Thronos that she did to Sabine. But Sabine had never hurt her the way Thronos continued to do.</p><p>Even so, Lanthe would drag him out of the zone. All seven feet of him.</p><p>\u201cThronos, you are such a pain in my ass,\u201d she snapped at his unconscious form. \u201cHere I am\u2014saving yours yet again! I want this noted.\u201d</p> <p>Careful not to cross the markers herself, she reached for his feet, lugging him toward her. The instant she\u2019d pulled his head out of the zone, his eyes shot open, locking on her. \u201cMelanthe?\u201d</p><p>She dropped his feet; he scrambled to stand. With his irises fully silver, he jerked his gaze around, as if danger was on the horizon. He scented the air.</p><p>Under his breath, he grated, \u201cNot real?\u201d The crazed look on his face had her backing away from him.</p><p>Then he turned to her. \u201cNot real.\u201d He eased closer.</p><p>\u201cUm, what\u2019s happening, Thronos?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d In the light rain, he reached for her, cupping her face with hands that shook. His thumbs brushed along her cheekbones. His brows were drawn together, lips thinned.</p><p>She\u2019d seen this yearning expression before\u2014after that three-day absence when she\u2019d called him a demon. So long ago, when he\u2019d finally returned to their meadow, his eyes had told her, I\u2019ve been pretty much lost without you.</p><p>\u201cI want your future, Melanthe,\u201d he rasped now. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the past. We\u2019ll work out the fucking details.\u201d</p><p>Where was this coming from? Why had he changed\u2014</p><p>His lips descended on hers. As in her dream, his pained groan rumbled against her mouth. He sounded like he\u2019d die if she didn\u2019t return his kiss.</p><p>A claiming kiss. A no-going-back kiss.</p> <p>Despite her issues with him, she found herself parting her lips beneath his. He groaned again, as if she\u2019d conceded far more than a kiss. When his tongue dipped, her eyes slid shut in bliss.</p><p>His lips slowly slanted, his tongue sensuously tangling with hers. For someone with so little practice, he was turning into a devastating kisser. Her hands twined around his neck, her toes curling as they began sharing breaths.</p><p>When he drew back, he left her dazed, blinking up at him. \u201cThronos, I think that\u2019s the best conversation we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t release Melanthe, just kept his quaking hands on her cheeks.</p><p>She was brimming with vitality, sorcery, life. He savored the beating of her heart, the coursing of her lifeblood.</p><p>Each wondrous breath she took.</p><p>Though she\u2019d initially looked stunned\u2014and pleased\u2014her brows were drawing together. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d She dropped her hands, ducking from his grip. \u201cYou have a seizure, and now you\u2019re thinking clearly? You\u2019ve suddenly realized how stupid it is to obsess about my past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you.\u201d He bit out the words, unable to process what had just happened\u2014what he\u2019d seen and felt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . you dragged me out of it.\u201d He opened and closed his fists, needing his hands on her. \u201cDelivered me from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. I was in my personal version of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell changed your mind about my past?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou talked about traps when we first arrived, about repeated labors. I believe I was in a loop of some kind. In each repetition, no matter what I did, I couldn\u2019t save you. You . . . died. You were crushed by stone.\u201d</p><p>She arched her brows. \u201cTypical. The harlot got stoned to death.\u201d</p><p>His voice hoarse, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. Please.\u201d He took her hand in his, never wanting to let it go.</p><p>She gazed up at him as if she was measuring the emotions in him\u2014the ones he didn\u2019t bother to hide. How asinine he\u2019d been! He wanted to make a life with her, a marriage and family. To have all those things, he need only look to their future. It was there\u2014for the taking!</p><p>She was.</p><p>Unless he\u2019d already ruined things beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cWhat do the markers say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPain confesses all. And Time cares naught.\u201d He now comprehended that what he\u2019d just gone through wasn\u2019t real.</p><p>But the lesson had been.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime cared naught when it allowed itself to repeat.\u201d With his free hand, he tucked a lock of raven hair behind her ear. \u201cAnd pain clarified my thoughts about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds . . . intense.\u201d</p><p>You have no idea. \u201cWe need to move away from the edge of this zone. If we\u2019d both crossed into it, we could\u2019ve been there for eternity. And I\u2019d rather spend forever with the pest that is.\u201d He brushed the backs of his fingers along her delicate jawline, vowing to all the Lore, to all the gods, that he would protect this woman for eternity.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t stopped touching me, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to grow accustomed to that\u2014\u201d</p><p>A demon war bugle sounded from not far in the distance.</p><p>She gazed over her shoulder. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be signaling a charge during the day . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they\u2019re coming for those keys. Let\u2019s put some distance between us and them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? We can\u2019t go back. And we don\u2019t know which way this zone\u2019s edge extends.\u201d</p><p>He craned his head up to the sky, biting out a curse. \u201cWe can\u2019t go up.\u201d</p><p>Outlined by bursts of lightning, a pack of Volar demons hovered above. An advance contingent? Their position pinned Thronos and Lanthe against the hell zone.</p><p>Their backs were against an invisible wall.</p><p>THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>If I take you into the air, they\u2019ll rip you from me,\u201d Thronos grated as the ground began to vibrate beneath their feet.</p><p>\u201cMore are coming!\u201d Lanthe cried. Just beyond the brush, demon foot soldiers were charging toward them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to fight them here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen him victorious against a number of ghouls, but demons were cunning.</p><p>With reluctance, Thronos released her hand, bringing his wings in tight to strike. \u201cStay behind me\u2014right at the edge of those markers. The demons won\u2019t go near them.\u201d</p><p>She edged back.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t cross the line, Lanthe\u2014\u201d</p><p>The first wave broke from the brush. So many of them!</p><p>In a blur, swords arced out, whistling all around Thronos. He struck with both wings. Heads rolled across the ground like horned bowling balls. Jugular blood painted the silver grass red.</p><p>More demons advanced. More died. When Thronos\u2019s wings whipped like sails, billowing the air, a fine mist of crimson sprayed over her face.</p><p>Any demon who attacked paid with his life. Thronos decapitated with a ruthless efficiency.</p><p>But they kept coming. Even the demons at the back started firing on Thronos, lobbing a hail of spears and daggers, fire and ice grenades.</p><p>He had to use one wing as a constant shield against the sky as more warriors closed in, swarming like ants from a kicked mound. He deflected the volleys, but he was getting slower, expending so much strength. He couldn\u2019t stall them for much longer.</p><p>Only a matter of time.</p><p>Then he would die, and she\u2019d be captured. Unless she did something. When in trouble . . . Portal!</p><p>She had some power, but was it enough to create a gateway to a different world, under pressure, just two days after her last one?</p><p>It\u2019ll never happen.</p><p>Still, she raised her hand, dispelling sorcery right at the edge of the hell zone. As she labored to split the seam of this reality, Thronos must have felt the energy; he turned to her with his blood-wetted wings splayed, a warning in his eyes: Do not run from me.</p><p>She gasped. In the lightning flashes, he looked like a . . . legend.</p><p>Like an avenging angel.</p><p>From hell.</p><p>Every inch of his skin was coated with others\u2019 blood, his own as well. Gashes sliced his flesh, bisecting ancient scars. Stark against the crimson, his eyes were fully onyx\u2014and locked on Lanthe as he began fighting his way toward her.</p><p>A rift was opening, drawing her attention from him! Come on, portal! Come on! Almost big enough for her to step through. Rothkalina, Rothkalina, Rothkalina, she repeated like a mantra.</p><p>There was nothing to stop her from leaving Pandemonia. Could she abandon Thronos to save herself? To return to her family?</p><p>After that kiss . . .</p><p>Look back over your shoulder at him again, and you\u2019ll regret it. Still, at the threshold, Lanthe bit her lip and turned back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d His voice was rife with pain\u2014as if he already knew she would leave him behind. \u201cDon\u2019t run from me, lamb!\u201d</p><p>Lamb.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t called her that since they were children. She remembered their last day together as they\u2019d sat beneath his wings. She\u2019d sighed that she loved him. His voice had been thick when he\u2019d replied, \u201cI-I love you too, lamb.\u201d</p><p>Damn him! She couldn\u2019t leave him.</p><p>Though demons dogged his heels, she bit out a curse and waited for him. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this!</p><p>He looked as shocked as she felt. Yet then he cast her that determined expression of his, the one she now recognized. It meant he believed he was about to beat all odds and triumph.</p><p>He continued fighting to reach her, but with his attention divided, his strikes weren\u2019t as efficient. She could see demons circling him in the air\u2014and on the ground. Some lay in wait between Thronos and Lanthe.</p><p>He\u2019d never reach her. And malicious gazes had already turned to her. Demons ready to kill. Or worse.</p><p>Think, Lanthe! She couldn\u2019t use persuasion on this many, especially not the ones farthest back. She frowned. Did she even need to?</p><p>As Sabine had told her: Illusion is reality.</p><p>Lanthe yanked off the chain around her neck, holding it in a fist above her head. The pieces clanked loudly. \u201cLook what I\u2019ve got!\u201d A few demons locked their gazes on the shining keys.</p><p>Infusing her command with sorcery, she yelled, \u201cLook, Pandemonians, look.\u201d Blue light coiled all around her, until she was radiating as brightly as the lightning above.</p><p>More warriors stilled, hushed murmurs floating over the crowd. In the lull, Thronos backed toward her.</p><p>She jostled the keys above her. \u201cDo you want these?\u201d Her sorcery was reflected in the eyes of the closest demons. \u201cOr should I simply disintegrate them\u2014with my deadly blue light?\u201d Ha!</p><p>Audible gasps sounded.</p><p>\u201cI am a great and terrible goddess, the Keeper of Keys and the Queen of Hell.\u201d She pointed at Thronos. \u201cHe is the mighty . . . Reader of Words.\u201d (Best she got.) \u201cCease fighting him!\u201d Another command.</p><p>The demons closest to her disengaged at once.</p><p>Brows raised, Thronos hastened to her. He mouthed, Reader of Words?</p><p>Lanthe wasn\u2019t done yet. She told the crowd, \u201cThough we leave you now, I will return with these keys\u201d\u2014return for more gold\u2014\u201cbut only if you achieve peace here.\u201d Geopolitical stability makes for easier treasure transpo. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d She slipped the necklace back on.</p><p>When the unsteady threshold began to waver and shrink, Thronos sprinted for her. Would the space be wide enough for them to squeeze through?</p><p>He tucked her against him on his way to the portal. \u201cYou awaited me. For the first time, you didn\u2019t run from me!\u201d At her ear, he rasped, \u201cYou will never regret this.\u201d Clasping her tight, he dove for the opening at the last second.</p><p>The rift sealed behind them as they barreled headlong into a new world.</p><p>THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>Ahh!\u201d Lanthe screeched to find herself under a pounding waterfall in waist-high water.</p><p>She swiped her forearm across her face, sputtering. Thronos was before her, filling her vision.</p><p>He pulled her from the cascade, shaking out his dark hair. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d The demon blood that had coated him had been scoured clean.</p><p>Turning to survey their surroundings, she blinked against the brightness of the day. The sun was a blazing golden ball in the sky. Past a field of bloodred wildflowers, she saw pink sand and a placid sea the color of new grass. This huge waterfall and pool were the same shade.</p><p>I know this pink beach. I know this scent. The air was sultry, smelling of . . . Hawaiian Tropic, flowers, and sex.</p><p>Oh, no, no, this couldn\u2019t be!</p><p>Yet then the sun began to twinkle. Feveris was usually sunny because its clouds were translucent; when they passed in front of the sun, they made it glimmer like a star. \u201cOh, my gold, this is Feveris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the Land of Lusts?\u201d Thronos said in the same tone a human might say, \u201cFor real, we\u2019re Powerball winners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be\u2014I aimed for Rothkalina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will it be till we\u2019re robbed of control?\u201d His voice was growing huskier.</p><p>\u201cLess than ten minutes. That\u2019s how long I was here before I had my servants drag me back. I\u2019d just wanted to see if the rumors were true.\u201d She lost track of what she\u2019d been saying\u2014because Thronos was smiling.</p><p>And it was glorious.</p><p>Twinkling sunlight struck his eyes, setting his irises aglow, molten silver. His firm lips curled, revealing more of his even, white teeth and those fangs. She felt the mad urge to tap one of those points\u2014with her tongue. With his face relaxed, his scars seemed to fade.</p><p>The first time she\u2019d seen him smile since he was a boy.</p><p>Struggling to collect her thoughts, she asked, \u201cWhy do you look so pleased with yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one, you\u2019re alive. More, you saved me from a demon army\u2014and waited for me. For the first time! And then you brought us to Feveris. Maybe you wanted to come here with me as badly as I did with you? I think I\u2019m growing on you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted to deny it, but couldn\u2019t. Something had happened in Pandemonia, a shift in her feelings for him. Had a fragile sprout of affection poked its head above snow?</p><p>Illusion was reality. Act like partners long enough, guess what you\u2019ll become. . . .</p><p>Stupid sprout.</p> <p>\u201cAlready I feel the effects of this place.\u201d He raked his gaze over her body, making her skin flush.</p><p>\u201cI do too,\u201d she admitted. Out from under the cascade, the water of this pool was balmy and soft. Warm breezes caressed her face, soothing her.</p><p>Before, she\u2019d worried about letting go with him. She\u2019d worried what he would think about her. Now the decision had been taken from her. Had she subconsciously steered them here?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you await me, Melanthe?\u201d He reached forward to smooth his fingertips along her cheekbone, casting her a proud smile. \u201cWhy did my brilliant mate save me?\u201d</p><p>Because this entire journey felt bigger than the two of them? Because when he\u2019d called her lamb, her heart had ached from missing their friendship? \u201cI just did, okay? But I didn\u2019t intend to come here!\u201d</p> <p>At her tone, his smile dimmed, and she wanted to call it back. What was happening to her? She just needed time to think!</p><p>She tried to march away from him in the waist-deep pool, but her boots were water-logged. With a curse, she pulled off one, then the other, tossing them to the bank.</p><p>He must\u2019ve seen this as an invitation to shed his own clothes. He dragged the remains of his shirt over his head. Faced with the body he was revealing, she couldn\u2019t quite disabuse him.</p><p>\u201cI thought Sorceri were hedonists?\u201d Off went his own boots. \u201cWe\u2019re in a plane devoted solely to pleasure. You should be gladdened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we lose control and have sex, it would be disastrous! I might get pregnant.\u201d She could ask him to pull out at the last second, but she doubted a virgin would have the willpower necessary\u2014especially when his instinct would be clamoring for him to break his demon seal and spill his seed.</p><p>He closed in on her. \u201cWould it be so bad to have a child with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean a bastard?\u201d she countered. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re really gung-ho about having kids and all. But to me, getting pregnant would feel like getting trapped.\u201d She reminded herself that Sorceri were unfruitful in general. The odds of it happening were overwhelmingly against.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not as gung-ho as I was,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, I thought our young would be the only thing we had in common, and raising them our sole occupation. Now I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s much else for us to do.\u201d He brought her hand to his groin, to the stiff shaft straining against his sodden breeches.</p><p>In a heartbeat\u2019s time, she was just as aroused. \u201cLike sex?\u201d Typical male. And this one didn\u2019t even know what he was missing!</p><p>\u201cNot only sex. You could teach me all the references I don\u2019t get. We could travel over realms together, exploring worlds.\u201d With each of his deep raspy words, her willpower dwindled. \u201cYou liked exploring with me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She had. Their wild-and-woolly adventure in Pandemonia had exhilarated pampered Lanthe.</p><p>But there was more to consider! \u201cWhat about our history? Our families? The war between our factions? We haven\u2019t resolved anything between us.\u201d Even as she expressed her worries, her hand had begun stroking his length.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d he said, biting back a groan. \u201cBut now is not that time. Right now, we\u2019re in Feveris, together, after surviving Pandemonia. We desire each other. Denying pleasure between us would be like squandering our coins.\u201d He curled his finger under her chin. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something we don\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>Irresistible demon. Her anxiety was diminishing, Feveris\u2019s spell taking hold. Still she fought it. \u201cTurning my words against me?\u201d She dropped her hand\u2014and regretted it immediately. \u201cIf we succumb to the magics here, how will we ever escape?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce we\u2019ve burned off the worst of the lust, you can persuade me to feel no Feveris effects. I\u2019ll keep us focused until you can create another portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again, you want me to use my power on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m already losing control. For now, lose it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThronos\u2014\u201d She felt a sudden sharp twinge across her entire shoulder. What the hell? But when she glanced down there was no mark, and the pain ebbed. It was forgotten when he reached for her breastplate, unfastening the clips.</p><p>He tugged off the piece, tossing it to shore like a Frisbee.</p><p>Sunlight met her bare breasts. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from arching toward the warmth, rolling her shoulders. Lingering misgivings receded like the lazy waves of the nearby sea.</p><p>When her breasts bobbed with her movement, Thronos was transfixed, as if he was witnessing a miracle. \u201cMelanthe, I\u2019ve never wanted anything like I want this.\u201d With his black claws curling, he reached for her skirt. It soon joined her breastplate. \u201cI must claim my beautiful mate.\u201d He tried to remove her panties, but in his haste, the lace gave way.</p><p>Once she was stripped of everything but her necklace, his eyes roamed over her greedily. He never took his gaze from her as he started removing his breeches, fumbling with the laces.</p><p>How nervous he must be! Did he worry how he\u2019d measure up to her past lovers? Despite his uneasiness, he wore his determined look. He knew what he wanted\u2014and he knew he was about to get it.</p><p>He shoved off his breeches, lobbing them to shore as well, the soaked leather making a fwap sound.</p><p>And then he was naked. Mist from the waterfall dotted his tanned skin, drops clinging to his lean muscles. Just beneath the surface, Lanthe could see his shaft pulsing.</p><p>She probed his thoughts, finding his blocks wide open. He craved to feel her sex, to taste it.</p><p>To claim it.</p><p>His gaze met hers. And he wants me to know these things.</p><p>Maybe they could just release some steam without consummating anything?</p><p>She stiffened when she felt pain on her forearm, like a fresh burn. She broke away to search for a mark, finding none.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Probably residual hell-plane stress. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>He looked to say more, so she reached for his cock, curving her fingers around it, which apparently robbed him of thought. His lips parted, and he couldn\u2019t keep from bucking to her grip.</p><p>When she traced her thumb across the taut head, his shaft jerked in her palm, continuing to grow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really big,\u201d she said as she fondled him from base to tip.</p><p>He had to clear his throat to manage: \u201cFemales like big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if they\u2019re prepared for it, and it\u2019s deployed properly.\u201d</p><p>Worry creased his brow. \u201cHow should I prepare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get me ready.\u201d Because sex was inevitable? It was beginning to feel that way.</p><p>She continued to stroke him as he rocked to her fist, but when she cupped his testicles, he went stock-still. \u201cMelanthe,\u201d he grated, grasping her wrist to stay her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve many things I\u2019m dying to do to you. I want to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. What things?\u201d By the way he was staring at her eyes, she knew they must be glittering.</p><p>In an anguished tone, he said, \u201cReadying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite off your foreclaw.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he did.</p><p>She took his hand in both of hers. When she guided his forefinger into her core, his lids went heavy. Eyes on his, she gave a soft moan.</p><p>\u201cMy gods,\u201d he choked out, his horns straightening fully. She caught his thought: How will I ever fit inside her?</p><p>Fit? No, they didn\u2019t have to have sex! She told herself this, even as she was motioning for him to move his finger. Once he began to thrust with it, they both shuddered.</p><p>Her clitoris swelled for attention, her lips plumping around his finger. Soon she was panting, kissing and licking the warm skin of his chest.</p><p>Yet then he drew his hand away. Lifting it to his mouth, he sucked his forefinger down to the second knuckle, his eyes hooded.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her breath hitched. Who was this sexy male? \u201cOhhh.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d taken all of her taste, he released his finger. \u201cI want more of that, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>Should she broach oral sex with him? He might want more, but it was an offendment. Feveris\u2019s spell made her feel reckless: Bring it up. He\u2019ll totally love it! \u201cSpeaking of readying me? I think oral sex would help\u2014\u201d</p><p>In the space of a heartbeat, he\u2019d seized her in his arms. Striding through the water as if something chased them, he carried her to the bank of the pool. Scrambling out, he strode toward the sea, setting her down on a mat of flowers beneath swaying palms.</p><p>His gaze seemed to follow the drops sluicing down her body as he joined her. Soft rays of sunlight filtered through the palm fronds, glinting off her necklace.</p><p>With a questioning glance, he reached for it. Though she was loath to remove it, even for a minute, she didn\u2019t want anything to distract her from this male. She nodded, and he set it close by.</p><p>\u201cI truly was going to give this to you, as a courtship gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou risked your life for a gift?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWhen it\u2019s the one your mate\u2019s set her heart on . . .\u201d Then he moved between her legs, clasping her behind her knees, lifting until she brought her feet up.</p><p>She rose up on her elbows, needing to see his every reaction. Judging by the intent look on his face, nothing could stop him from this.</p><p>He laid his roughened palms on her inner thighs, spreading them till her knees opened wider. A breeze blew sultry air against her slickened sex.</p><p>Even if she hadn\u2019t known it was his first time in this position, the way he stared in fascination would give him away. His smoldering eyes were rapt, his expression saying, Mercy.</p><p>His thoughts drifted into her mind: \u2014Her exquisite flesh . . . so delicate. Want to set upon her . . . \u2014 When he licked his lips in anticipation, the sight of that pointed tongue made her tremble.</p><p>In a barely recognizable voice, he said, \u201cI had my turn in the glade. You\u2019ll have yours now.\u201d His gaze bored into hers. \u201cSee that it happens.\u201d</p><p>It? Her orgasm? He was telling her in his own way to guide him\u2014because he\u2019d never done this before.</p><p>When she gave an unsteady nod, he eased in to press his mouth to one of her thighs. With a tender lick, he told her, \u201cHold back nothing, Melanthe. . . .\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d sampled her taste on his finger, Thronos had known what forbidden thing he would do. And then for her to suggest it? That she wanted his kiss aroused him like nothing he\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>He could scarcely think past the ache in his shaft. His horns had straightened and were aching along with it.</p><p>He knew only two things for certain:</p><p>His mate was incomparable, her glistening sex a thing of beauty.</p><p>And he was the luckiest male alive.</p><p>Yet then he frowned when he felt a stabbing pain low on his torso. He glanced down, spied no matching injury, just old scars.</p><p>His pain was forgotten when she rolled her hips, as if to attract his mouth. He gently eased her pink folds apart with his thumbs, riveted by the shadowy dip he uncovered. Her entrance. While he wondered again how he\u2019d ever fit that tiny opening, his shaft jerked, straining for it.</p><p>Brows drawn with absorption, he rubbed the dip with his finger, breaching her slick core. Her cream was more slippery than water, and sweet.</p><p>The intoxicating taste of his mate.</p><p>As his head descended, his sensual female was panting in anticipation, her blue eyes shimmering like metal.</p><p>She cried out when he delved his tongue right at her opening. Now that he\u2019d taken her taste into him, he didn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d lived his entire life without it. He licked his lips, shuddered, then set back in with a ravening hunger.</p><p>\u201cOh, ohh!\u201d As she undulated, he followed her sex, piercing that slight dip with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>He gazed up to gauge her reaction. Her hands had found her lush breasts and started to squeeze. Her expression was lost. When the breeze blew, she arched her back, her nipples stiffening even more.</p><p>He rubbed his palms up her thighs, pressing her legs even wider. As he gave her seeking licks, she thumbed those stiff nipples, the peaks he would soon suckle at his leisure.</p><p>His hips had begun rocking, his erection hanging down like a steel rod. The pressure within it surged. Even still, his lips curled against her. Because Melanthe seemed to be going out of her head with pleasure.</p><p>He was as well. How could he not when her flaring folds grew ever wetter against his tongue?</p><p>Between kisses, he murmured, \u201cLanthe, I can\u2019t ever go back.\u201d</p><p>To life without her. Without sharing this.</p><p>She curled one arm under her head like a pillow. Her free hand descended down her flat belly, her palm curving over her mons. Brows drawn, he pulled back, his breaths ragged against her rosy flesh.</p><p>She caught his eyes, then grazed the pad of her forefinger over the little bud at the apex of her sex. \u201cIf you lick my clitoris like this . . .\u201d She slowly masturbated it, rubbing back and forth as her tongue moistened her lips.</p><p>Telling him how she wished to be kissed.</p><p>Then her hand wandered back to her chest, to nipples so hard they looked like they throbbed.</p><p>He eagerly leaned in, tonguing her clitoris as she\u2019d instructed.</p><p>\u201cYes, Thronos! Just like that,\u201d she cried out, earning herself another slick lash. \u201cNow your finger. Put it back inside me while you kiss.\u201d</p><p>He penetrated the gripping heat of her channel, thrusting his finger in and out as he licked.</p><p>\u201cAh! It\u2019s so good!\u201d She reached forward to grasp his horns.</p><p>At the contact, he yelled out against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She released him as if burned. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Sorry? The idea of her handling him was unbearably erotic. \u201cTake hold of me again!\u201d</p><p>Once she tentatively did, he quaked from her grip, assailed by the same currents that sparked whenever their skin touched. Voice low, he commanded her, \u201cStroke them while I feast.\u201d</p> <p>In a wondering tone, she breathed, \u201cWho\u2014are\u2014you?\u201d But she dutifully rubbed her fists, slaying him with pleasure.</p><p>Stroking him thus made her even wetter! He growled and lapped. \u201cYou like that too.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she panted, rubbing him faster.</p><p>His light licks grew fiercer. As her little bud swelled for him, he groaned with amazement. Maybe I should . . .</p><p>He suckled her clitoris between his lips\u2014</p> <p>\u201cOh, my gods!\u201d she screamed, tearing an answering yell from his lungs.</p><p>When she bucked for more, he almost came. He started sucking on her bud like a luscious candy, his groans vibrating it.</p><p>She went crazy, her head thrashing, her breasts quivering. She made a string of insensible sounds, then managed: \u201cDon\u2019t stop that, Thronos. So close! Oh. OHH!\u201d</p><p>Pride. It\u2019s happening.</p><p>She ground against his mouth, moaning, \u201cYou\u2019re about to make me come . . . so hard . . . for you.\u201d</p><p>Her movements\u2014her words\u2014made his shaft jerk, threatening release. He\u2019d just felt her sheath tighten around his finger when she keened with ecstasy; sorcery shot from her eyes and hands, enough to light a night sky.</p> <p>As soon as he tasted her orgasm . . . thought left his brain.</p><p>THIRTY-SIX</p><p>Lanthe gasped on a final, bone-melting spasm. She\u2019d never loosed sorcery like that!</p><p>Probably because she\u2019d never had such a cataclysmic orgasm.</p><p>He\u2019d suckled her so divinely, penetrating her so deeply . . . but it was more.</p><p>It\u2019s Thronos. It\u2019s all him.</p><p>Yet he kept licking her too-sensitive flesh, continuing to finger her. When she tugged on his horns to pry him away, he shook his head, so she pulled harder. He nipped her thigh in warning!</p><p>Heaving breaths through his slickened lips, he grated, \u201cNot done with you, woman.\u201d Then he set back in.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t! Not so . . . soon . . .\u201d She trailed off\u2014because his strong tongue was licking her into submission. His mouth was conquering.</p><p>Soon she\u2019d reach a point where he could do anything to her.</p><p>And Lanthe thought he knew it.</p><p>She rose on her elbows again, watching in bewilderment as his eyes turned to full black. Maybe she oughtn\u2019t to have wished for a demon lover? \u201cThronos?\u201d She swallowed with trepidation and desire. Was Feveris bringing out their most primal selves?</p><p>When his remaining claws seized her ass, lifting her to his mouth, her head fell back into the flowers. With a savage growl, he buried his face between her thighs, tonguing her furiously.</p><p>\u201cOh! Ohhh!\u201d Her control gone, she arched her back like a total wanton. \u201cYes, Thronos!\u201d With each of his ruthless licks, sorcery filled her again. Swirls of it tickled her skin and caressed her face. She tightened her grip on his horns, about to come for this male. Again.</p><p>For Thronos Talos.</p><p>Shameless, she snatched down on his horns as she bucked upward.</p><p>It was as if she\u2019d lashed him with a whip.</p><p>She could barely hang on as his head moved, thrashing back and forth as he licked, a wild demon maddened with lust.</p><p>Lanthe wanted to savor his abandon, to remember this forever, but she couldn\u2019t fight her mounting orgasm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, need to come . . .\u201d</p><p>He growled between her legs, \u201cYes, yes, give me more of it.\u201d Then he set back in\u2014</p><p>Rapture crashed into her. The force of it wrenched the air from her lungs. She caught her breath just to lose it again on a desperate scream. \u201cThronos!\u201d Her body writhed, her vision blurring. With each spasm, her sheath squeezed his thrusting finger.</p><p>Consciousness dimmed, her thoughts blanking until her heart finally slowed its frantic beat.</p><p>With soothing kisses along her thighs, he released her at last. She thought she heard him rasping against her skin, \u201cNever go back.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Thronos. Her devastating demon lover.</p><p>Still catching her breath, she rose to her knees before him. He sat back on his heels, his thick cock jutting upright, rigid as granite, the head bulging. He inhaled deeply, as if to regain control of himself. In one instant, he looked like a demon about to die from need. In the next, he appeared proud, thrumming with masculine satisfaction.</p><p>He should be proud. He\u2019d just wrung from her two mind-shattering orgasms.</p><p>But Feveris\u2019s spell was potent. She wasn\u2019t sated. As she gazed at his engorged shaft, desire bloomed once more. Another breeze blew; could he feel the cooling air on that tight, aching part of him?</p><p>He shuddered, answering her question. A translucent bead rose from the slit. He looked shocked to feel moisture there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pre-cum,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIs this the closest you\u2019ve ever been to ejaculating?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Because he was with his mate. Only for her would he release his seed, only inside of her. But it seemed a drop had escaped. Her tongue twirled in her mouth for it. She couldn\u2019t tell which part of her was hungrier for his shaft: her sex or her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMelanthe, I need to claim you,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>She\u2019d wondered if they could simply burn off steam, averting intercourse. How ridiculous that seemed now. He was going to be inside her today. But that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t first kiss him in a like fashion.</p><p>She wanted to give him that pleasure because he\u2019d just delivered her to unknown heights\u2014but also because she was experiencing feelings for him.</p><p>Feelings that demanded an outlet.</p><p>She needed to lavish kisses on the scars he hated. To thank his invincible heart for never succumbing. \u201cCan we do that in a bit, Thronos? I thought I could taste you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaste?\u201d His voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cWill you lie back?\u201d</p><p>He wordlessly nodded, eyes widening a touch when he fully comprehended what she was offering. The proud look he\u2019d sported had turned to one of disbelief.</p><p>Once he reclined with his wings spread out over the field, she settled between his legs. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he impatiently bucked his hips, his muscled torso flexing, his mouthwatering cock bobbing\u2014the most erotic sight she\u2019d ever witnessed.</p><p>Lust jumbled his thoughts.</p><p>Thronos wanted to take his mate, but after what he\u2019d just experienced . . . he\u2019d never last.</p><p>He was rattled by how much he\u2019d needed to pleasure her like that. What male wouldn\u2019t be uneasy when he\u2019d just discovered something he was certain he\u2019d die without?</p><p>She started kissing down his chest, holding his gaze with her shimmery eyes. She pressed her lips to the scar over his heart, remaining there for long moments. As she nuzzled her smooth cheek against his marked flesh, he thought he heard her breathe, \u201cInvincible.\u201d</p><p>Did she mean . . . his heart?</p><p>He\u2019d been confused before. Now? He didn\u2019t know how he should react, what he should say.</p><p>She continued lower, sending his mind into turmoil. Her hair had begun to dry in silken curls around her face and shoulders. When the winds made locks dance over his skin, he could perceive each tendril.</p><p>Enchantress . . .</p><p>He felt like he was watching some kind of mystery being played out, something he\u2019d known occurred\u2014without any idea of the inner workings.</p><p>Hands shaking, he grasped her head, barely checking the urge to guide her down to his aching member.</p><p>Yet then she descended to . . . his thigh? He jerked in surprise when she pressed more loving kisses along the length of that scar.</p><p>As in the dream she\u2019d described, he wanted more. He\u2019d never thought she could convey affection with this act.</p><p>She kissed his damaged ankle and calf, sources of grueling pain for him. In the beginning, he\u2019d wanted her to suffer guilt, to regret.</p><p>No longer.</p><p>There were a thousand things he wanted to tell her. \u201cMelanthe . . .\u201d But he fell silent when she moved to his erection, taking hold of him.</p><p>His shaft pulsated in her soft grip. Moisture glistened across the crown. Would she mind that? When she was about to kiss him there? To his way of thinking, it seemed almost impolite to her. He was shocked at how little dominion he had over his body. He was literally in her hands\u2014</p><p>She daubed the hot bead with her tongue.</p><p>A dumbfounded breath escaped him. With a shudder, he gave her another drop.</p><p>Her lips curled, as if he\u2019d pleased her. Not impolite? Erotic. She liked it. She used that bead to thumb the head in mind-numbing circles. \u201cDoes this make you feel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanthe, you know it does.\u201d She was teasing him? Now?</p><p>He stared down at the seductive curve of her red lips. He wished he could read her mind.</p><p>Because he feared he was about to lose his.</p><p>She rubbed him until his head swam, lust firing inside him. His claws dug deep into his palms when visions arose . . .</p><p>Of thrusting into her mouth. Of lifting her by her hips and planting her on his throbbing shaft.</p><p>Of tossing her to the ground so he could cover her, shoving deep within her tight, wet sheath.</p><p>Not visions. Impulses. Gods help them if he lost control.</p><p>Suddenly he felt her tongue\u2014against his sensitive sac. \u201cUnh!\u201d His knees fell wide, allowing her free rein to do as she would.</p><p>She gave a light suck to one of his testicles, then the other, nearly ending everything! He didn\u2019t breathe as she rose up over his shaft.</p><p>With her hand wrapped around the base, she guided the head toward her mouth to run the tip across her red lips. Then came her moist little tongue to circle the flared head. He couldn\u2019t stop an astonished grunt.</p><p>Yet then he frowned to feel pain sear over his arm, as if the skin was burning. When he glanced at it, there was nothing, soon forgotten.</p><p>She tongued the crown, darting flicks to the underside, making him growl her name. He\u2019d barely recovered from that new delight when she closed her lips over him\u2014with sublime suction.</p><p>\u201cGods almighty.\u201d His hips shot up. Her mouth slid even farther down. . . .</p><p>The only thing that could make this better would be if she was straddling his own tongue at the same time.</p><p>When she glanced up then, she caught him licking his lips for more of her taste. Her brows drew together. Moaning around him, she took his length even more aggressively. Deeper.</p><p>Finally a deep he craved.</p><p>As his restraint deteriorated, he cupped her face to give shallow thrusts between her lips. He lifted one wing, using a flare to cup her ass. When he rubbed those supple curves, she shivered.</p><p>His heavy testicles tightened as his body prepared to release. No way he could hold back. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Melanthe! I need more of this.\u201d More of her shimmering eyes, her teasing lips. \u201cClose, sweet. So close.\u201d His head tipped back, eyes sliding shut.</p><p>Wait. She\u2019d stopped? He faced her again.</p><p>She\u2019d taken away that hot wet suction! \u201cMelanthe?!\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward to kiss his navel, leaving him racked with need and confusion. Yet then he felt her plump breasts pillowing each side of his erection. Desperate for the contact he\u2019d lost, he rolled his hips. His shaft glided along her cleavage. \u201cGood gods.\u201d</p><p>Another rock of his hips, and he grew nigh once more. \u201cI\u2019ll release like this . . . between your perfect breasts . . .\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, gauging his expression. Then, with a sensual grin, she dragged her chest down his body to return to her kiss, adding the stimulation of her hand.</p><p>With her fist pumping the base of his dampened shaft, she sucked him with greedy, spine-tingling pulls.</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d Nothing could feel this good. Nothing, nothing . . . \u201cI\u2019m about to come!\u201d</p><p>As she sucked and pumped, she cupped his testicles with her free hand, giving them an electrifying squeeze that brought him right over the edge.</p><p>Pleasure erupted. He threw back his head and roared\u2014a sound that could never be contained.</p><p>Against her clever tongue, his length pulsed again and again, his back bowing in time.</p><p>She wrung every last shudder from him, forcing him to ride that pleasure . . . over and over. . . . A culmination so heart-stopping, it was almost fearsome.</p><p>He gave her only a drop or two of seed, but she hungrily drew on him for more. As if she\u2019d been waiting forever to take him into her.</p><p>When she\u2019d rendered his body boneless and his mind boggled, she gave him a last sweet kiss, then curled up against his side. As they both caught their breath, she laid her hand upon his chest, drawing her thigh up over his.</p><p>Time passed. Disbelief and satisfaction waged war in his hazy thoughts.</p><p>Melanthe began lazily dragging the backs of her nails up and down his chest. Breezes drifted over them as he floated without pain, discovering what bliss was. I\u2019m to experience this with her for the rest of my eternal life?</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t even claimed her.</p><p>He was eager to, but resting with his mate like this was an ecstasy all its own. He wondered how long it took for a female\u2019s desire to stir anew. He wondered how many times a day she would let him attend to her. After he claimed her, once he\u2019d found that home, how could he ever force himself to leave it?</p><p>Were these now to be his concerns? At the thought, he grinned up to the sky. He drew her closer, pressing his smiling lips against her forehead.</p><p>When they\u2019d been young, they\u2019d fallen into a ready camaraderie. Being with her had proved effortless\u2014their interplay filled with rapport and affinity, with ease.</p><p>Now, after sharing pleasure with her, he believed they could become that close again, that they could rekindle the connection they\u2019d shared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And more.</p><p>When a ray of light wavered through the palm trees, he lifted her raven locks to the sun, just to watch them shine. . . .</p><p>\u201cSometimes I feel so comfortable with you that I forget our pasts,\u201d she said in a languorous voice. \u201cSometimes I feel as if nothing had separated us, and only yesterday we were gazing up at clouds together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was just thinking about our camaraderie. It\u2019s still here between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Something is,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>As if an alarm had sounded, he picked up on the subtle change in her tone. When her hand started to dip, tension renewed within him.</p><p>Because Feveris wasn\u2019t satisfied. He remained erect, and his mate\u2019s hips began to move, rubbing the slick heat of her sex against him. Bliss.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hard as iron.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou make me thus.\u201d He turned to her, cupping her face. \u201cAre you ready for more? I can give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Worry crossed her face, but she still nodded. \u201cI have to feel you inside me.\u201d</p><p>Even as his shaft strained demandingly, his chest twisted with emotion. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to regret this.\u201d</p><p>She lay back in the flowers and reached for him, her hair like a cloud around her head, night-black curls against bloodred petals. He knew he\u2019d never forget this sight for the rest of his immortal life.</p><p>\u201cI can barely think past this fever for you.\u201d Her eyes were luminous, telling him things he didn\u2019t have the experience to recognize.</p><p>He sensed a vulnerability in her that he wouldn\u2019t have expected.</p> <p>As he knelt between her thighs, he said, \u201cWorry not, Melanthe. I\u2019ll be good to you. I\u2019ll be true to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we do this, we might be taking a step there\u2019s no turning back from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you want this.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Then it will be done. He was to take his mate.</p><p>At the thought, his gaze was drawn to the smooth column of her neck. His fangs ached, as if to mark her.</p><p>Vrekener males didn\u2019t bite their mates upon claiming. Defeating the compulsion, he fisted his erection, swiping his thumb over the head as he aimed it toward her tiny opening. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo slow at first.\u201d With a smile in her tone, she said, \u201cBe tender for as long as you can.\u201d</p> <p>He tilted his hips toward her. Just as dampness kissed his sensitive skin, she gave a moan, undulating, sending the crown slipping up and down her wet folds.</p><p>A growl rose up from his chest. He wanted her arousal all over him. On his tongue, on his fingers, covering his shaft.</p><p>He placed his hands on either side of her head, easing his hips forward. Uncontrollable urges tormented him, and he had to gnash his teeth to keep from plunging inside at once. He\u2019d delved just an inch into her core when his entire body gave a shudder. \u201cMy gods!\u201d Another inch. \u201cMelanthe, I will want this every hour of the day. You are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d a female said from not ten feet behind them. \u201cHot interspecies action! And I didn\u2019t even have to subscribe to this channel!\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>For a brief second, Lanthe wondered if Thronos would ignore the interruption and keep going.</p><p>Gazing at the intense hunger on his face, she could tell he was debating it. . . .</p><p>But then protectiveness or propriety made him stop. With a surprisingly vile curse, Thronos pulled out. As he stood, he dragged Lanthe up as well, tucking her back against his front as his wings enfolded their bodies.</p><p>Lanthe narrowed her eyes at the dark-haired female who\u2019d come upon them. It was none other than N\u00efx the Ever-Knowing. \u201cWhy are you in Feveris, N\u00efx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I in Feveris? Are we?\u201d Her voice was melodious, her amber eyes amused. She had a freaking bat perched on her shoulder. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here before and know what it looks like.\u201d Lanthe could hardly believe she\u2019d just been caught beneath a Vrekener. Would N\u00efx tell Sabine? Stressing the words, Lanthe said, \u201cNot to mention that we\u2019ve been bespelled with unending desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you two have no urge to do me?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe muttered, \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d N\u00efx was a dish.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Thronos yanked Lanthe closer.</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d N\u00efx twirled her long hair. \u201cYou two get dressed, and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>When the Valkyrie turned from them, Lanthe eased around within the circle of Thronos\u2019s wings to face him. \u201cWe were bespelled.\u201d They might not have been bespelled.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWe must have been.\u201d Otherwise, Lanthe had so very nearly let Thronos Talos claim her\u2014during her most fertile time. And she\u2019d been about to shove her hips up to get him inside her faster!</p><p>If she got pregnant with a Vrekener\u2019s baby . . . with his baby . . .</p><p>His expression was inscrutable. Was he angry at himself for their offendments? \u201cOf course,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThe Valkyrie must be mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Untruth.</p><p>He released Lanthe so they could find their clothes. She darted for her necklace right away.</p><p>The Valkyrie sauntered back to them as soon as Lanthe and Thronos were dressed. N\u00efx herself wore a T-shirt that read: I lost my heart on Immortal Island!</p><p>Recalling how N\u00efx had helped Thronos, Lanthe narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou told him how to capture me. Why would you betray me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been running from him for centuries.\u201d Or she had been. Act like partners long enough . . .</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop answering questions with questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Lanthe wanted to strangle her!</p><p>\u201cYou both have roles to fulfill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat roles?\u201d Thronos grated.</p><p>N\u00efx waved her hand in an arc above her as she breathed, \u201cFuture ones!\u201d</p><p>Wait . . . immortal island? \u201cYou were on the Order\u2019s prison island, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I?\u201d N\u00efx asked with a coy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to me when I was unconscious!\u201d Lanthe flashed a look of realization. \u201cYou hit me in the face with a log!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare accuse me of such a thing?!\u201d N\u00efx snapped, her Valkyrie emotions producing lightning above. \u201cOutrageous! I would never!\u201d Then she abruptly frowned. \u201cI might have hit you in the face with a log.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to me about realms and fires. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in the mortal plane, then Pandemonia, now here, and soon . . . there. You really are the cutest wittle devilkin of a catalyst!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatalyst? You\u2019ve been steering my portals! You\u2014you rigged my subconscious.\u201d Hadn\u2019t Lanthe felt like this journey was bigger than just her and Thronos? Had N\u00efx wanted them in Pandemonia to shake up those demons? To bring peace to hell? After all, what could those armies fight over now?</p><p>Or did N\u00efx want the dainty keys Lanthe now wore? Not without a fight, Valkyrie.</p><p>N\u00efx murmured, \u201cIn one realm, hurt. In one realm, leave. In one realm, cleave. In one realm, shine.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe had hurt in Pandemonia, as if the festering wounds of the past had been sliced open. At last to heal? \u201cSo here, I\u2019m supposed to leave?\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx smiled blankly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you playing at, Valkyrie?\u201d Thronos sounded like he was struggling not to lose his temper. He must be regretting their actions as much as Lanthe did.</p><p>Ignoring him, N\u00efx asked Lanthe, \u201cHow\u2019s your power coming, sorceress? You look at it as if it\u2019s a pot that needs to be filled. When in fact, it\u2019s a muscle that has been flexed very little.\u201d</p><p>This news was exciting! \u201cSo the more I use it, the stronger it\u2019ll be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse, use, rest. Use, use, use, rest. Use, use, use, use, rest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it!\u201d</p><p>To Thronos, the Valkyrie said, \u201cHow did you like your vacay in Pandemonia? Glad you saved up sick days? Did you feel all . . . liberated? And swagger-y? I bet that plane made your soft parts tingle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce and for all, tell me, woman: Are Vrekeners demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, man: Does it matter?\u201d she said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes! Absolutely. Are we a demonarchy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would be the difference between your life now versus if you were a demon? You\u2019d be able to trace. Big deal.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe could sense his steep disappointment. Because he still didn\u2019t have the conclusive answers he sought? Or because N\u00efx hadn\u2019t denied Vrekeners were demons?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal, Thronos,\u201d the Valkyrie said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you where you really are if your mate stores something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStores what?\u201d Lanthe didn\u2019t even have a bag with her.</p><p>N\u00efx plucked up a curl of her lustrous dark hair, peering down at it. \u201cThis is the one, you know.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe didn\u2019t know. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that enslaves all the Valkyries. The tipping point with the Scourge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lanthe said slowly. \u201cYour hair enslaves?\u201d She turned to Thronos, as if he could make sense of N\u00efx\u2019s ramblings.</p><p>The Valkyrie nodded. \u201cQuite.\u201d Baring her foreclaw, she sliced off the curl, then glanced around, muttering, \u201cWhat to tie it with?\u201d She beamed at the bat, who now had a length of string in its creepy little maw. \u201cWhy thank you, Bertil!\u201d N\u00efx tied the end of the curl tight, handing it to Lanthe. \u201cIn your pocket, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe patted down her outfit. \u201cI don\u2019t have a pock\u2014\u201d Sure enough, there was a concealed pocket in one of the leather bands of her skirt. \u201cOkay, give it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for an explanation, soothsayer,\u201d Thronos told N\u00efx. \u201cMelanthe and I both felt the influence of this place; there was no denying it.\u201d</p><p>The Valkyrie\u2019s eyes flashed like her lightning. \u201cOr maybe you two simply wanted an excuse to have each other. Here, you were able to get around your premarital sex rule. Here, Lanthe reasoned that you couldn\u2019t think badly of her because she would have no control over her actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where are we?\u201d Thronos demanded.</p><p>A sudden rank smell wafted over Lanthe, like . . . vomit. Where had that come from?</p><p>\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Thronos alone.\u201d N\u00efx sauntered up to him, standing on tiptoe.</p><p>When he leaned down to accommodate her, putting their faces close together, a spike of irritation hit Lanthe. Jealousy? No, of course not. Still, she pointed out, \u201cHey, I\u2019m part of this too!\u201d</p><p>Whatever N\u00efx was whispering made Thronos\u2019s eyes widen. When she\u2019d finished, he straightened, looking paler than Lanthe had ever seen him. His scars whitened.</p><p>N\u00efx turned to her. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to stay and discuss my plans for the Accession\u2014hint: there will be wearable party favors!\u2014I have a meeting that was penciled in one hundred and twenty-five years ago. Do take care with my lock, Lanthe.\u201d Then the Valkyrie gazed up at the sky, her eyes swirling like mercury. A split second later, a bolt of lightning struck her.</p><p>When the smoke cleared and their eyes readjusted, N\u00efx was gone.</p><p>Loreans had long wondered how N\u00efx traveled the world(s). Lightning bolts. Who knew?</p><p>Thronos hastened to Lanthe, grabbing her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d She winced as that pain in her side flared up again. She began to feel more burns up and down her legs.</p><p>\u201cYou need to wake up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you? I\u2019m not asleep.\u201d She glanced past him. Had the fields of flowers wavered? Her nose was now burning with that ghastly smell.</p><p>His hands tightened on her. \u201cNone of this is real. It\u2019s a shared hallucination\u2014so that we don\u2019t fight our captivity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptivity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat last portal took us to . . . to a treacherous place. Into the belly of a beast. It will want to keep us\u2014immortals are a source of constantly replenishing nourishment\u2014but we\u2019re going to fight.\u201d</p><p>Was he saying she was something\u2019s food? One of her worst fears. \u201cY-you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you free, but you\u2019ll have to create a portal directly after, or we\u2019ll be drugged and trapped once more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</p><p>In a gallows tone, he said, \u201cNo, Lanthe. It isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>Thrymheim Hold, Northlands</p><p>Home of Skathi, goddess of the hunt</p><p>Goddess council convening</p><p>Agenda: Petition for godhood submitted by Phen\u00efx the Ever-Knowing, firstborn Valkyrie</p><p>N\u00efx, you\u2019ve known about this meeting for decades and decades,\u201d Riora, the goddess of impossibility, said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have prepared better?\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx blinked at Riora as they made their way through the rumbling halls carved into Godsbellow Mountain, a peak continually shaken by thunder. \u201cI don\u2019t take your meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing a T-shirt and flops, you\u2019re carrying a sleeping bat, and you reek of what can only be gastric acid.\u201d The bat burped in its sleep, expelling a puff of green mist. Then it smacked its lips. \u201cThis is a formal affair. Kali is wearing twelve skulls.\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cI should\u2019ve vajazzled!\u201d Her excitement woke the bat. It clawed its way up her T-shirt to perch on her shoulder. With a shrug, N\u00efx opened her backpack, retrieving sheets of paper.</p><p>Riora looked approving, expecting a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of N\u00efx\u2019s great works and deeds, a divine CV to advance her cause\u2014then frowned when the Valkyrie turned to post a flyer for a \u201cbarely used\u201d Bentley on one of Thrymheim\u2019s sacred walls. \u201cAs your friend, I have to tell you that the atmosphere in Skathi\u2019s meeting hall is contentious. Most of the deities think you reach above your station. The questioning will be intense.\u201d From within the hall, they could hear goddesses debating whether N\u00efx had \u201cthe juice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost goddesses. Standing, levitating, and astral projection room only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you liking my chances?\u201d N\u00efx asked.</p> <p>Riora tilted her head. \u201cNothing is impossible with you, which is why I\u2019ve always liked you.\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx nodded thoughtfully. \u201cAside from a few other deities, you\u2019ve always been my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Riora pursed her lips, and she and N\u00efx entered.</p><p>The focus of the room was a grand wooden table with three concentric rotating disks. One disk measured all times. The second was a perpetually changing map of the mortal world and connecting domains. The third monitored celestial acts taking place across all realms. The center of the table was hollow, with a dais in the middle.</p><p>A number of goddesses, or their dimensional likenesses, were in attendance. In the flesh were the witch deities Hekate and Hela; Lamia, the goddess of life and fertility; Wohpe, goddess of peace; Saroh, the goddess of the Jinn; and the Great She-Bear, protectoress of shifters. Among many more . . .</p> <p>With a nod of encouragement, Riora left N\u00efx and took her saved spot at the table.</p><p>The legendary Skathi presided. She looked exasperated, not bothering to hide her feelings about N\u00efx\u2019s petition.</p><p>The Valkyrie didn\u2019t seem to notice the goddess\u2019s displeasure. With that bat on her shoulder, she nonchalantly made her way toward the dais in the center of the rotating table. As she approached, a path opened up, the wood disappearing, then reappearing behind her, like a wake.</p><p>Atop the dais, N\u00efx turned to Skathi. It was known that if one gazed into that goddess\u2019s eyes, he or she would experience all the fear and sorrow of Skathi\u2019s prey over the ages; yet N\u00efx boldly met her gaze. Which appeared to surprise the goddess.</p><p>Clearing her throat, Skathi called the meeting to order, then took her seat. \u201cWe will dispense with formalities to limit the duration of this meeting. We convene because Phen\u00efx the Ever-Knowing is petitioning to join our ranks in the pantheon of goddesses.\u201d Skathi steepled her fingers. \u201cTell us in your own words: Why should we welcome you into our blessed number?\u201d</p><p>Bright-eyed and breathless, N\u00efx said, \u201cWell, I can mime\u201d\u2014she demonstrated as Riora dropped her forehead to the table. \u201cI\u2019m a mistress of keg stands\u201d\u2014N\u00efx looked around for a keg with which to demonstrate\u2014\u201ctwo of my three parents are gods, and I have a goddesslike power.\u201d</p> <p>Skathi raised her brows. \u201cYour talent for mime notwithstanding, you have an obvious mark against you: human blood. One of those three parents of yours was mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem to slow me down.\u201d N\u00efx hiked a thumb at herself. \u201cAfter all, just this Accession, I orchestrated the death of Crom Cruach.\u201d The god of cannibalism. \u201cHmm, Skathi, wasn\u2019t he your curse to deal with? Right, then.\u201d She brushed off her hands matter-of-factly. \u201cWe\u2019ll settle up at the bar.\u201d</p><p>Skathi glared, and the flames of her temple climbed higher. Yet then, a bout of thunder shook the mountain, seeming to soothe her. \u201cA goddess is measured by the company she keeps. Yet you\u2019re close to Loa, the voodoo priestess, a mere shopkeeper who grows to be a practitioner of the darkest arts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoa prefers to be known as the Commercenary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize the power she wields?\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx sighed. \u201cCounting on it.\u201d</p><p>Seductive Lamia observed, \u201cUnder your direction, La Dorada the Queen of Evil has arisen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDora and I are like this.\u201d N\u00efx spread her arms wide. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll be the first to admit she\u2019s not without faults. Very grumpy when she wakes up. And with Dora, it\u2019s always me me me, ring ring ring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you resurrect her?\u201d Skathi demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo one else was going to do it!\u201d N\u00efx said, just as her bat leaned in beside her ear. The soothsayer nodded to it, then murmured, \u201cMeet me at the lightning bolt.\u201d She gazed on fondly as the creature flew away with a screech.</p><p>\u201cYour attention!\u201d Skathi snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat were we talking about? Let\u2019s be quick, then. It\u2019s past Bertil\u2019s bedtime.\u201d</p><p>Jaws dropped at N\u00efx\u2019s temerity.</p><p>Speaking to no one in particular, N\u00efx said, \u201cAnd because we\u2019re going to need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Lamia asked.</p><p>\u201cDora.\u201d As if speaking to a child, N\u00efx said, \u201cYou asked me why I\u2019d resurrect her, and I\u2019m answering your question.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cAre all of you inebriated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinuing on,\u201d Skathi intoned. \u201cYou claim a goddesslike power, styling yourself ever-knowing, yet you can\u2019t even find your sister Furie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind? As in bring to light?\u201d she asked, leaving the pantheon to puzzle over her words.</p><p>Hekate said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been working to ally factions of immortals for the Accession, assisting Loreans of different species to find their mates. From what I understand, we\u2019re to have a rash of halflings in future generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalflings are formidable,\u201d N\u00efx pointed out. \u201cThink of Queen Emmaline of the Lykae, Queen Bettina of the Deathly Ones, and Mariketa the Awaited, leader of your House of Witches. Plus, Valkyries have a soft spot for halflings, since we have three vastly different parents. I guess you could call us triflings.\u201d Broad wink.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you tirelessly seeding halflings and renewing ancient alliances?\u201d Hekate asked. \u201cTo battle what foe?\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx breathed, \u201cThe M\u00f8ri\u00f8r.\u201d</p><p>The other goddesses tensed at the mention of the Bringers of Doom. They didn\u2019t speak of the M\u00f8ri\u00f8r lightly.</p><p>The Valkyrie seemed unaware of the stir she\u2019d caused. \u201cAll the harbingers are there. They descend upon us. Though the Accession exists to cull the immortal population, mortals and gods alike should fear this one.\u201d</p><p>Lamia offered, \u201cN\u00efx would sense them first,\u201d and earned glares.</p><p>Skathi\u2019s flames grew and grew. \u201cYou took it upon yourself to plan a defense against the M\u00f8ri\u00f8r? You toy with the fate of the entire Lore, Valkyrie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot defense. Offense. Why come out of the dugout for anything less? I\u2019m not interested in a farm league. Which is why I\u2019m here. Only a divinity\u2014with this pantheon\u2019s resources\u2014could unite all of the factions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe you can lead the charge? Against them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReview: transcript of this meeting. See: farm league comment.\u201d</p><p>Skathi drew her head back. \u201cAll of your sarcastic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMultilayered.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014answers will not help your cause. You\u2019re very flippant about these proceedings.\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx\u2019s playful demeanor vanished in an instant, her amber irises swirling, mercurial. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve already seen the outcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll move to dismiss my petition, telling me that I must have a cause\u2014an area of power, a specialization of sorts. After all, you are goddess of the hunt, the Great She-Bear is goddess of shapeshifters, Lamia is goddess of some-some.\u201d</p><p>When Lamia scowled, N\u00efx shrugged. \u201cI calls \u2019em like I sees \u2019em.\u201d Then she addressed all the goddesses: \u201cYou believe that this area of power must be a critical one. Since foresight has been taken\u2014hat tip to the goddess Pronoea\u2014you expect I\u2019ll come up short. Yet, in fact, I\u2019m going to reveal my specialization, and all of you will comprehend the inevitability of it.\u201d</p><p>Skathi pursed her lips. \u201cThrall us, Valkyrie.\u201d</p><p>N\u00efx paused dramatically. \u201cI will rise from the ashes of the old ways to become Phen\u00efx, the goddess of . . . accessions.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-NINE</p><p>In the belly of the beast, stygian darkness was interrupted only by glowing green filth.</p><p>Thronos had awakened to find himself trapped against a pulpy surface, held upright by meaty tentacle-like veins that snaked around his arms and legs.</p><p>Oozing cavities covered each vein; at that moment, one secreted green sludge onto his disintegrated clothing, his skin, his wings.</p><p>Pain flared, smoke rising. Acid! The putrid air was noxious, scalding his lungs. He thrashed\u2014the need to fly surging inside him\u2014but he couldn\u2019t get loose.</p><p>N\u00efx had given him just four minutes to get himself and Melanthe free.</p><p>He darted his eyes to his right. Lanthe.</p><p>She was in the same predicament as he\u2014attached to what looked like a stomach lining, surrounded by sizable glowing pustules. She remained unconscious, no doubt believing them still in Feveris.</p><p>Acid had eaten away parts of her skin as well, even most of her metal breastplate. The indestructible dragon gold around her neck had protected her to a degree.</p><p>A pustule burst beside her, thicker tentacles emerging from the sore to sweep up bits of her pale flesh.</p><p>To consume her.</p><p>With a bellow, Thronos thrashed with all his might, yanking at his arms. As the tentacle trapping his right arm stretched, he gazed out, spotting thousands more immortals ensnared, unconscious. The stomach walls seemed to go on for miles.</p><p>In a rush of bile, the tentacle vein around his arm ripped open. He used his claws to slash another. At his legs, he hesitated, peering over his shoulders and then down. Hundreds of feet below him, a bubbling pool of green acid awaited his fall. How damaged were his wings?</p><p>Praying they could support him\u2014and Melanthe\u2014he freed his legs. He plummeted, unfurling his wings, grimacing in pain. But even in the dense miasma, he was able to ascend the wall back to her.</p><p>Though he heard eerie moans from a legion of beings, he couldn\u2019t think about anyone but his mate. N\u00efx had told him that this stomach was too thick to slash through, that he\u2019d be drugged again before he could fight his way free. She\u2019d warned him he had only two hundred and forty seconds from the time he awoke until a poisonous mist would be dispersed, wiping away his memories and sending him back to the place of his most coveted dreams.</p><p>He darted a glance over his shoulder. On the opposite wall of the stomach, some kind of bulbous gland, at least twenty feet in diameter, was swelling. To emit the mist?</p><p>Running out of time! A portal was their only hope. He flew to Melanthe.</p><p>Thronos wished he didn\u2019t have to wake her until he\u2019d taken her from this place\u2014he\u2019d heard of Loreans faced with such horror that they never recovered their faculties\u2014but he had no choice.</p><p>Gripping the tentacle vein coiled around her arm, he slashed at the rubbery surface, pointing the acid-dripping end away from her body.</p><p>Her eyes shot open. She sucked in a breath\u2014then released it in an earsplitting shriek.</p><p>He redoubled his efforts, attacking another tentacle.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, this isn\u2019t happening.\u201d Her face crumpled. \u201cTell me it\u2019s not eating my skin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanthe, you have to calm yourself. You\u2019ve got to create a portal.\u201d</p><p>Her head thrashed against the putrid lining, searing strands of her hair clear away. \u201cThat\u2019s why it felt like I was burning in Feveris!\u201d Once he\u2019d freed her and taken her into his arms, she latched onto him. \u201cM-make this stop! I\u2019ll do anything. Just make me wake up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are awake. But if we don\u2019t leave this place, we\u2019ll be here for eternity. In Feveris, you restored your power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that wasn\u2019t real!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t it feel real?\u201d He wished to the gods it had been. \u201cYou have power, right now. I need you to use it. Remember, it\u2019s a muscle.\u201d</p><p>She darted her gaze at her surroundings, a series of cries bursting from her lips. That gland swelled, threatening to burst.</p><p>\u201cNo, look at me!\u201d He pinched her chin. \u201cI know you can do this.\u201d</p><p>Her tears threatened to spill, wrecking him.</p><p>He rasped, \u201cYou can do this, lamb.\u201d</p><p>At that, she said, \u201cI-I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>When her eyes began to glitter, he murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He felt her tensing in his arms. Despite her terror, she called up her power; he could perceive it welling, unstoppable.</p><p>Could others? Unconscious captives moaned louder.</p><p>Sorcery sparked around her, growing and growing, blazing out from her like dawn\u2014pure, pristine blue overwhelming rancid green.</p><p>Dimly, in the back of his mind, he wondered how he\u2019d ever considered the light of her sorcery anything but . . . wondrous.</p><p>Heartbeats passed.</p><p>She sagged against him.</p><p>\u201cI did it,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d He spun them in circles. No opening. The mist would come at any second.</p><p>\u201cIt should be here! I made a portal. I felt it happening.\u201d</p><p>The gland erupted, spewing a green fog. \u201cDamn it, no!\u201d</p><p>Relaxation stole through Lanthe\u2019s body. \u201cThis is better.\u201d She grinned up at him as her eyes slid closed.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay with me!\u201d Another turn. Nothing. \u201cWhere is the bloody portal?\u201d</p><p>With dread, he looked down. A narrow tear in this reality lay waiting\u2014one surrounded by piping acid.</p><p>When the portal started to close, he muttered a prayer, wrapped his wings around Lanthe . . .</p><p>And dropped.</p><p>As they plummeted through the rift, he realized some being had followed.</p><p>FORTY</p><p>Lanthe woke to the resounding silence of the sea.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she saw murky ocean pressing down all around her and Thronos. In the dim light, his face was set with pain as he struggled to hold on to her and get them to safety.</p><p>They\u2019d been freed from that nightmare\u2014only to reach another one.</p><p>She clasped him tighter, so he could use both arms to swim. The water was lightening. At least there was a surface! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were halfway there when her lungs reached their limit. She clawed him, needing air . . . about to involuntarily breathe water. He swam even faster, his heart pounding against her ear.</p><p>They breached the surface into a stormy day, sucking in misty breaths as they rolled on giant swells. She blinked against sea spray, trying to get her bearings.</p><p>\u201cWhere are . . . ?\u201d She trailed off when Thronos\u2019s head craned up. She twisted to look over her shoulder, saw water all the way up to the sky.</p> <p>Inconceivably high. About to crash over them.</p><p>He\u2019d already kicked for propulsion, shooting into flight. But if he couldn\u2019t get high enough . . .</p><p>Her mind couldn\u2019t accept the size of the wave\u2014like a mountain of liquid toppling over. \u201cFaster, Thronos!\u201d</p><p>His jaw was clenched, his heart sounding like it\u2019d explode. \u201cDon\u2019t let go of me, Lanthe!\u201d</p><p>When the swell began to crest over them, he rotated in the air, wrapping his wings tightly around her. The wave collided with them so fast the water became as solid as brick.</p> <p>The momentum hurtled them toward the coast, a jagged stone cliff. When they crashed into it, the rocks tore his wings like a monster with fangs, trying to rip her away from Thronos.</p><p>They clung to each other.</p><p>The wave sucked them back out to sea.</p><p>They clung harder.</p><p>The force raked them over coral reefs\u2014before catapulting them back against the wall.</p><p>But when it receded the second time, they . . . remained.</p> <p>Somehow Thronos had clung to the cliff with one quaking hand.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he leapt higher, pulling them out of the wave\u2019s reach. The next crest slapped just beneath their feet, foam licking their legs, but it couldn\u2019t catch hold of them.</p><p>He hauled them up until they\u2019d made the top of the cliff. At the edge, he shoved her ahead of him onto solid ground, then followed.</p><p>They lay on the stony ground, heaving breaths, coughing seawater. Beneath them, the cliff shook with each crashing wave.</p><p>\u201cMelanthe, speak to me,\u201d he said between gulps of air. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Again, he\u2019d kept her cocooned for the most part. \u201cJust some wounds from . . . from where we were.\u201d Swatches of her skin had been loosened by the acid, then sucked away.</p><p>She\u2019d been food. Still would be, if not for N\u00efx. Except that the Valkyrie had sent them there in the first place! Why, why, why?</p><p>Most of Lanthe\u2019s breastplate was gone; the scant remains of her skirt clung to her hips. \u201cHow long do you think we were in . . . there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould\u2019ve been hours or days,\u201d he answered. \u201cEven weeks. I doubt our conception of time in Feveris corresponded to the actual duration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She would never have words to convey to anyone else how horrific it\u2019d been. Only Thronos could understand those tentacles, the pus, the burning.</p><p>Lanthe shuddered. She simply couldn\u2019t think about that place right now without losing her ever-living shit.</p><p>When he rolled toward the edge of the cliff, scanning the waves as if searching for something, she noticed that one of his wings looked worse than normal, those scale mosaics even more skewed.</p><p>\u201cHow bad off are you?\u201d</p><p>Over his shoulder, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a forearm and a wing snapped. I might\u2019ve cracked my skull. Nothing major.\u201d</p><p>That all? \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think someone\u2014or something\u2014followed us out. It was difficult to see in there, but I believe I spied a being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who followed is probably dead. No one could break free of that current.\u201d She frowned. \u201cHow did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as weak as you think me.\u201d As if to prove his point, he lumbered to his feet. His shirt had been either eaten away or torn free; most of his leather pants had disintegrated from acid. \u201cI\u2019m an immortal male in my prime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was the equivalent of an immortal current. Our bodies should have been dashed to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re not.\u201d He reached a hand down, helping her stand.</p><p>As he steadied her, she asked, \u201cDo you think we had supernatural assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it so difficult to believe I did that on my own?\u201d He stared down into her eyes as he said, \u201cMaybe you make me strong.\u201d</p><p>He looked so earnest about this, she decided not to argue the point. \u201cIn any case, thanks for getting me to safety. We keep saving each other\u2019s asses, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be, no?\u201d He seemed to be asking more than just that simple question, so she changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She turned her attention to herself. Though her necklace was unharmed, her breastplate was beyond salvage, the irregular edges cutting into her already damaged skin. She unfastened the last stubborn clip, then dumped it. Not that she cared, but her hair was long enough to cover most of her breasts. In the back, her locks had been eaten away, an involuntary bob cut. Her boots looked like acid had been drizzled over them, but at least the soles covered most of her feet.</p><p>Her skirt had only a few leather strands left. For Thronos\u2019s sake, she shifted the garment to cover her front, which gave her an ass-less skirt.</p><p>He flicked his gaze over her torso. \u201cYou\u2019re burned worse than I thought. You need to rest and regenerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? We have no idea what dangers surround us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we need to get to higher ground while my wing heals.\u201d He surveyed the horizon.</p><p>She saw only flat terrain, a sheet of slate-gray stone that matched the dismal sky. \u201cIf there is higher ground.\u201d But he could see farther than she could.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He took her hand in his.</p><p>Though the rock had countless craters\u2014just ideal for her acid-eaten stiletto boots\u2014she said, \u201cI can walk on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can.\u201d He kept her hand. After that Pandemonian hell zone, he seemed to have a constant need to touch her.</p><p>Still fearing something would take her away from him?</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d seen had changed this man. So what would happen to him once they ultimately separated . . . ?</p><p>For now, hand in hand, they set off, wending around larger holes.</p><p>\u201cWhat if this is another dream?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat hallucination was so realistic.\u201d You know, Thro, the one where we were having hot interspecies action.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve known you. Almost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky that none of it happened. You didn\u2019t commit any offendments. I didn\u2019t almost get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we weren\u2019t bespelled, then why did we feel such frenzy for each other?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to read his mind to know that the guy in Thronos wanted the two orgasms he\u2019d given her to, well, count. \u201cPlacebo effect maybe? All I know is that Feveris\u2014or faux Feveris\u2014changes nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m your mate just as much as you are mine.\u201d Cocky Thronos was back.</p><p>She repeated her standard reply. \u201cSorceri don\u2019t have mates.\u201d</p><p>When he opened his mouth to argue, she held up her free hand. \u201cI\u2019m too tired for this, Thronos. At least wait until all my skin regenerates before you hassle me.\u201d</p><p>With a scowl, he started forward once more, toward a horizon of nothingness.</p><p>N\u00efx had told her to set worlds aflame. What could Lanthe possibly affect in a place like this? And she hadn\u2019t exactly been a torch in that belly.</p><p>Lanthe had thought she could at least learn from this experience, from her travels. All she\u2019d learned from faux Feveris was that Thronos could be sexy as sin, and that he had a very talented\u2014pointed\u2014tongue.</p><p>Oh, and that being intimate with him had been life altering.</p><p>For her.</p><p>When they\u2019d lain in each other\u2019s arms . . . as if nothing had ever torn them apart . . .</p><p>As the terrain grew even more challenging, he took her arm, helping her along. Gods, her awareness of him had gone through the roof. She could not, could not, could not be falling for Thronos.</p><p>Doomed did not even begin to describe a future together with him.</p><p>If she told Sabine, \u201cI want to be with a Vrekener,\u201d her sister would have no doubt that Lanthe had been brainwashed. Which would make Sabine and Rydstrom murderous.</p><p>How could Lanthe keep them from killing Thronos? Oh, wait\u2014she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>A briny gust of wind howled over the flats, chilling her bare skin. To escape her current dismal reality, she lost herself in thoughts of her sister and their new extended family, bracing for homesickness. She missed Sabine to the point of pain. She missed Rydstrom, their bedrock of stability. She missed her gurgling nieces with their downy blond hair and wide violet eyes.</p><p>The elder by seconds was called Brianna, Bri for short, and the younger was Alyson, or Aly. Cadeon and Holly had wanted to name their girls after loved ones, but in the end, the appeal of three-syllable names that could be shortened to three-letter nicknames was too overwhelming for Holly (she had an OCD thing for threes, thwarted in itself by twins).</p><p>Aly and Bri were little badasses. Everyone had been worried about the Pravus making attempts on their lives\u2014as the vessel of this Accession, Holly had certainly been besieged by them\u2014but there\u2019d been no cause for alarm.</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s nieces were super brilliant, could already trace. If they sensed danger\u2014or bath time\u2014they would simply teleport their diapered butts away.</p><p>When hungry, they traced right to their mother\u2019s breast, which still freaked out the rather staid Holly. Cadeon thought it was uproarious, would croon praise to them. The twins and the boobs.</p><p>Rydstrom\u2019s ne\u2019er-do-well mercenary brother had finally done well, abandoning his soldier-of-fortune past to build a life and start a family with his mate. Like Rydstrom and Sabine, Cadeon and Holly were as opposite as they could be.</p><p>Maybe the differences kept things interesting. Lanthe\u2019s gaze was helplessly drawn to Thronos.</p><p>But none of their factions were at war. None of their siblings would want to murder significant others.</p><p>She felt . . . despairing over the future. Because she couldn\u2019t have Thronos? She wished she didn\u2019t know how warm his chest was when he held her close\u2014or what it would be like to make love to him.</p><p>Lanthe was a sorceress who wanted what she wanted when she wanted it. . . .</p><p>Not to be.</p><p>Despair promptly turned to resentment. Thronos had done this to her.</p><p>Made her wonder. Made her imagine more.</p><p>After several minutes of silence, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about Feveris.\u201d</p><p>She yanked her hand from his. \u201cTry!\u201d When another gust hit them, she glared at her surroundings and kicked a stone. \u201cThis whole ordeal is like motherfucking Time Bandits, and I\u2019m over it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know who those bandits are, Lanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d Because he\u2019d never watched a movie in his eternal life.</p><p>They had nothing in common, except for some shared childhood experiences and recent hallucinatory orgasms.</p><p>Extremes.</p><p>Thronos now knew what it would be like to lose Melanthe forever, powerless to save her, forced to watch her die.</p><p>But he\u2019d also glimpsed what it would be like to claim her as his woman. Neither experience had actually happened, which made him question if he were truly here with her even now. And she wondered why he kept touching her?</p><p>In their last two realms, he and Melanthe had been tested together\u2014making him feel closer to her. Yet she was drawing away.</p><p>The situation wasn\u2019t helping. Her skin was wounded. She must be freezing from regeneration, and still half shocked over where they\u2019d been.</p><p>She was probably starving as well. He had no idea when they\u2019d last eaten. How many days or weeks were we within that beast? Already, he\u2019d suspected Pandemonian time moved differently. He could only guess how long he and Melanthe had been missing.</p><p>He helped her over a gulley, his thoughts ricocheting among four things: concern for her immediate safety, reliving her death in those harrowing loops, recalling his pride as she\u2019d manipulated those demons to save him\u2014and relishing how she\u2019d responded to him in their dream of Feveris.</p><p>For the latter, he lowered his mental shield, letting her hear his musings loud and clear.</p><p>He replayed her wet heat kissing the head of his shaft . . . the pressure of her sex beginning to squeeze the crown as he inched inside . . . her pulse racing because she\u2019d needed him too . . .</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t real!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt feels bloody real!\u201d No one got his wings up like she did! \u201cDamn it, I know your taste. I know your moans. Why are you so eager to deny what we felt?\u201d</p><p>It was as if she considered herself weak because she\u2019d surrendered to it. And all I feel is strong.</p><p>\u201cBecause it never happened!\u201d Brows raised in challenge, she said, \u201cIf that hallucination truly took place, then shouldn\u2019t N\u00efx\u2019s lock of hair be in my pocket?\u201d She dug into the waterlogged leather strip, one of the last remaining.</p><p>She pulled out a lock of Valkyrie hair.</p><p>He gaped. Could Feveris have been real?</p><p>Melanthe pinched her brow with confusion. \u201cNo, no. N\u00efx must\u2019ve planted this on me when she attacked me on the island. She could\u2019ve slipped this in when I was unconscious. Or maybe she was in the beast herself?\u201d Melanthe shoved it back in her pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I made you scream with pleasure?\u201d He closed in on her. \u201cFace it, sorceress, I nearly claimed you as mine\u2014and you loved it.\u201d They were toe to toe. \u201cYou wanted me inside you. You wanted more. Nothing can ever take that away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat would\u2019ve been disastrous!\u201d She looked half enraged, half wary.</p><p>He reached forward to brush his thumb over her bottom lip. \u201cI want to get us back to where we were before we got interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA male wanting sex from me.\u201d She jerked away from him. \u201cHow novel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I want more than just sex.\u201d He grabbed her upper arm, drawing her close once more. \u201cI want everything from you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, but then she seemed to collect herself. \u201cJust because Sorceri don\u2019t dwell on regrets doesn\u2019t mean we set ourselves up for them either. What you want to happen between us just . . . can\u2019t. We\u2019re too different. Our families and factions would never accept this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a relationship between another sorceress and a Vrekener would prove impossible. But we\u2019ve been through too much. We\u2019ve earned each other. You can\u2019t deny that. If you took away all the strife surrounding us, could you accept me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Melanthe.\u201d</p> <p>When she eventually faced him, he stared into her eyes, seeing that same vulnerability he\u2019d beheld when he\u2019d been about to claim her.</p><p>He thought he was beginning to understand it. . . .</p><p>In Pandemonia, he\u2019d discovered his mate yearned for love. She\u2019d never found it with another\u2014and she clearly wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less. She\u2019d told him she would give her heart only to the right male.</p><p>I\u2019m that male.</p><p>Looking at her now, he comprehended that she felt vulnerable\u2014because her heart was already in play. He believed he could make Melanthe fall in love with him, claiming something from her all his own.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Thronos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I say never?\u201d In that moment, he realized exactly how he should handle her sorcery in the Skye. The solution was so blindingly obvious, he almost slapped his forehead.</p><p>With a groan of frustration, she kicked his shin; he cupped her nape, pulling her close for an overdue kiss\u2014</p><p>A metal net descended over them.</p><p>He yelled, splaying his wings, snaring himself in the weighted lines.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods, it\u2019s like the tentacles!\u201d She dropped to the ground, cringing away from the mesh. \u201cGet it off, get it off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying!\u201d When he clawed the metal, sparks erupted. Mystically protected.</p><p>Just as he scented foreign creatures over the sparks, Melanthe cried, \u201cStheno sentries!\u201d</p><p>Before he could reach her, she\u2019d been snatched out from under the net. He lunged for her, thrashing to get free, until one of the towering creatures propped Melanthe up like a doll to hold a trident at her neck.</p> <p>They were surrounded by a dozen vicious Sthenos, nine-foot-tall gorgons with crimson sea snakes for hair. Each sentry carried a trident.</p><p>\u201cRelease us,\u201d Melanthe commanded, blue light emanating from her eyes and hands. Nothing. \u201cRelease us now!\u201d</p><p>The largest Stheno, and obvious leader, said, \u201cYour powers will not work on us, sorceress. We have been divinely shielded.\u201d</p><p>Time to fight, then. His gaze flicked as he calculated his next several moves\u2014until the Stheno holding his mate threatened her with more than a trident.</p><p>Sea snakes coiled down to drape over one of her graceful shoulders, their fangs bared, forked tongues twitching.</p><p>Melanthe swallowed. \u201cTheir poison . . . I might not recover from it.\u201d</p><p>He froze, holding up his hands.</p><p>The leader said, \u201cYou\u2019ve erred by trespassing in Sargasoe, kingdom of Nereus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sea god?\u201d Melanthe asked.</p><p>\u201cThe deity Nereus, our lord and master. You will attend him in his keep, where he holds feasts of celebration. Depending on His Highness\u2019s mood, you will either be guests\u2014or the entertainment.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-ONE</p><p>The Sthenos had bound and blindfolded their captives, making the descent from towering cliff to sea level even more perilous for Lanthe. She wanted to tell them that she could never, ever find her way back to Nereus\u2019s keep. But they hadn\u2019t exactly been chatty.</p><p>\u2014What is this god like?\u2014 Thronos asked her on their unending trek along a beach.</p><p>Lanthe supposed the Vrekener was getting over his telepathy hang-up. \u2014Nereus is a party-hearty trickster, like a cross between Pan and Loki. He\u2019s notorious for his games and manipulations.\u2014</p><p>\u2014What happens if we\u2019re \u201centertainment\u201d?\u2014</p><p>\u2014Probably something that\u2019ll make you want to take a boiling shower and scrub your skin with steel wool. Let\u2019s just put it this way: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to twerk my way out of this.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Don\u2019t know what twerk means, Melanthe.\u2014</p><p>Sigh. \u2014I\u2019ve heard that Sargasoe is a hidden realm on the human plane.\u2014 Like Skye Hall. \u2014The goal should be to get Nereus to transport us from here.\u2014</p><p>Without sacrificing too much of themselves . . .</p><p>\u2014Do you think you can ensorcel him?\u2014</p><p>\u2014If he can shield the Sthenos from my power, there\u2019s not a chance. And he\u2019d likely kill me for trying.\u2014</p><p>Thronos fell silent, seeming lost in his own thoughts.</p><p>Though Lanthe\u2019s skin was gradually healing during their long walk, she was drained from keeping up with the fast Sthenos. Their lower halves were fat snake coils, kind of like Cerunnos, except Sthenos gorgons were all females. Plus they had hypnotically wavering snakes for hair. Oh, and brass hands and claws.</p><p>Whenever Lanthe tripped in the shifting sands, her Stheno personal guard would heft her up, those claws digging into her arm.</p><p>After the belly of the beast, this was nothing. Right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>A blast of ocean wind buffeted her. When Lanthe tottered and got clawed yet again, she snapped, \u201cWatch the claws, bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u2014Melanthe?\u2014 She could all but see Thronos raising his eyebrows. Just because he was cool and collected didn\u2019t mean she had to be. He\u2019d had his tantrum\u2014his mantrum\u2014on the Order\u2019s island, and it was now her turn.</p><p>\u2014I have no more fucks to give. Okay, Vrekener?\u2014 She\u2019d hit her limit. She was sick of portaling, sick of getting captured, sick of being food or potential food.</p><p>\u2014We\u2019re going to escape once more. Worry not.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Why are you so calm?\u2014</p><p>He was quiet for long moments. \u2014It\u2019s my nature. What you saw those first nights and days was not . . . me.\u2014</p><p>She\u2019d figured calm was his default setting. So to all his other attractive attributes, she could add not psycho.</p><p>Finally, their entourage slowed, entering some kind of echoing space. A sea cave?</p><p>They descended for what must be miles. When pressure made her ears pop repeatedly, she realized they were deep beneath the ocean. No flying for Thronos, even if he got free.</p><p>She felt sympathy for him. His fear of depths was like her fear of heights. She couldn\u2019t imagine how difficult this must be for him.</p><p>Probably as difficult as she would find the Skye. Still, she asked: \u2014You okay with this?\u2014</p><p>\u2014It\u2019s temporary.\u2014</p><p>In other words, he wasn\u2019t, but he would handle it.</p><p>In Pandemonia, she\u2019d told him about crazy stuff going down with Sorceri kids, and he\u2019d confidently said, \u201cWe can handle it.\u201d</p><p>We.</p><p>She and Thronos did work well together.</p><p>Gods, she did not need to conclude that the Vrekener would be a good father. Her biological clock cried, The best. None better!</p><p>Suddenly Lanthe heard gears whirring, cogs clicking, as if a gate was opening. They entered a warm, damp area, and the gears whirred once more. Behind them, a seal closed with a hiss. The scent of brine pervaded everything.</p><p>Off went the blindfolds. Thronos swung his head around to face her, as if he\u2019d been hungry for a single look.</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m okay. Still standing.\u2014</p><p>When he gave a grim nod of encouragement, she dragged her gaze from him to survey Sargasoe, the legendary lair of Nereus.</p><p>This hall had been carved from rock with glittering coral-pink and blue striations. A sheen of water poured down all the walls, but it seemed to be by design.</p><p>The area was lit with . . . sconces\u2014basically raised glass bowls where luminescent jellyfish shuttled in circles. Rippling reflections abounded, as they did underwater, making the walls seem to sway.</p><p>\u201cForward,\u201d the leader commanded, the Sthenos slithering behind them.</p><p>As Lanthe and Thronos trudged deeper, huge sections of the stone floor would shift and retract, revealing the sea. The construction of this place was spectacular.</p><p>Mirrors abounded. Shadows and light danced for dominance. Glowing eyes peeked out from darkened passageways.</p><p>This totally looked like the lair of a capricious deity notorious for his games.</p><p>She also sensed a permanent portal down here. How to get Nereus to let them use it?</p><p>Their group eventually entered what must be an underwater gallery of sorts. There were enormous rounded windows at intervals, the way paintings might line a museum wall.</p><p>When Lanthe passed the first, her eyes went wide. Ships were piled up, as if in a junkyard. She turned to Thronos. \u2014Are you seeing this?\u2014</p><p>\u2014It makes sense that a sea god\u2019s home would have a vortex.\u2014 A mystical magnet. \u2014We\u2019re in an abyss; everything sinks to this level.\u2014</p><p>At the next window, she squinted out into the dark, seeing gems the size of footballs scattered all over the sand. Schools of mercreature sentries glided by. They were humanoids to a degree, but instead of legs, the mermaids sported fishtails, the mermen collections of tentacles.</p><p>The next window revealed a submarine with Russian lettering on its hull, and what looked like part of an aircraft carrier. This was too wild!</p><p>For all the suffering Lanthe had borne just to reach Sargasoe, she was excited to behold such an exotic place. But what was in store? N\u00efx\u2019s prediction echoed in her mind: In one realm, hurt. In one realm, leave. In one realm, cleave. In one realm, shine.</p><p>So was Lanthe supposed to cleave here? She bit her lip, glancing at Thronos. Cleave was a word with several meanings, one of which was to separate.</p><p>She\u2019d already sensed a portal. What if Nereus offered two different rides: one to the Skye and one to Rothkalina?</p><p>Was she ready to part from Thronos? Despite all her blustering and denials earlier, the thought made her chest ache. If only a relationship between them didn\u2019t pose so many insurmountable odds.</p><p>When they passed a mirror, she turned away, not wanting to see her reflection. Yet suddenly all the injuries over her body began mending. The restraints around her wrists disappeared, and she felt as fresh as if she\u2019d recently bathed. With a gasp, she peered down at herself.</p><p>She now wore a black leather skirt, mesh hose, and leather boots. Her top was a halter woven of gold and silver strands\u2014with denser weaves of metal over the front to conceal her breasts. Sleek metal gauntlets covered her hands and forearms, and she detected a mask over her face.</p><p>Sorceri formal dress! Her hands flew to her necklace. Still there!</p><p>She whirled around to the mirror. Her mask was sapphire blue, accentuating her eyes. Her hair had been twined around a substantial gold headpiece, with wild braids framing her face. No more bob cut in the back\u2014long locks had grown out, left to curl down her back.</p><p>She felt more like a sorceress\u2014less like food. She was starting to enjoy Sargasoe\u2019s amenities! She turned to Thronos, and her lips parted.</p><p>The Vrekener was . . . drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p>His recent injuries had disappeared, and he was dressed in new clothes. Leather breeches and boots. A wide leather belt to highlight his narrow hips.</p><p>A crisp, white lawn shirt molded over his muscles and wing stems as if tailored. Which she supposed it had been, by a divine hand.</p><p>She was entranced by her tall, built, devilish, demon lover. Or would-be lover. He had the physical attributes to attract any female\u2014but Lanthe also admired how he stood so proud and stalwart, ready to do battle once more.</p><p>She and Thronos continued to be challenged; they continued to overcome, protecting each other. Maybe he was right; maybe they were the Vrekener/Sorceri couple who could beat those odds.</p><p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d he asked, gazing back at their guards. \u201cBetween the loops and Feveris, I\u2019m unsure.\u201d</p><p>She was used to magics like these, Thronos not so much. \u201cI think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow the sounds to the feast,\u201d the Stheno leader said, using her trident to point down the corridor. \u201cDo not entertain ideas of escape. For your kind, there is only one way out of Sargasoe.\u201d</p><p>When the cadre turned to slither away, a thought occurred to Lanthe. \u201cWait! Where are my clothes from before? There was a lock of hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour offering has been received,\u201d the leader said, her head snakes wavering. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason you live yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d And then Lanthe and Thronos were alone. \u201cHope N\u00efx didn\u2019t need that back.\u201d</p><p>When he canted his head at her, Lanthe realized he hadn\u2019t seen her looking this put-together in forever. \u201cSooo, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour garments are revealing. It won\u2019t bother you to attend a feast half-naked?\u201d</p><p>Before Melanthe could answer, a covey of scantily clad sea nymphs began to rise up from one of the floor cutouts. Nereids. The females were all ethereally stunning, and dressed in nothing but short sea-foam skirts.</p><p>Each time a nymph emerged from the water and flipped her hair back, she seemed to move in breathless slo-mo.</p><p>The Lore held that Nereus had been trapped in Sargasoe either by another power\u2014or by his own agoraphobia. His loneliness had driven him to create a new species of nymph to serve as his concubines and servants.</p><p>The females stopped and stared at Thronos, pointing at his wings with admiring looks and giggling flirtatiously behind their hands. Lanthe supposed he could be the first male with wings that they\u2019d ever seen. Not many sky-born Loreans would journey to the bottom of the ocean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Lanthe\u2019s eyes, the nymphs\u2019 flirtation transformed to brazen desire.</p><p>What would Thronos think about their interest? As they raked their gazes over him, she delved into his mind, but found his shields up.</p><p>Because he was thinking lustful thoughts about them and didn\u2019t want her to know?</p> <p>Dick. Typical male.</p><p>So this is jealousy. How had Thronos lived with it for so long?</p><p>She glared daggers at the females. Back off, nymphos. He\u2019s mine.</p><p>Mine?</p><p>Mine.</p> <p>Merely thinking that word was like a gunshot triggering an avalanche of emotion.</p><p>She and Thronos had literally been through hell together. Act like partners . . . They\u2019d become a team, and the idea of parting from him\u2014or sharing him with nymphs\u2014hurt.</p><p>When the gaggle of Nereids finally sashayed away, Lanthe said, \u201cPerhaps I should go without this top? Since the nymphs wear none, I don\u2019t want to be overdressed.\u201d</p><p>He drew closer to her. \u201cThat is not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You seemed as taken by them as they were by you.\u201d Jealousy sucked.</p><p>His expression was inscrutable. \u201cDid I? Hmm.\u201d</p> <p>What did that mean?</p><p>Thronos changed the subject. \u201cIf we\u2019ve been healed and dressed, have we escaped a fate as \u2018entertainment\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not necessarily.\u201d She didn\u2019t need to be hissying over Thronos; she needed to be plotting. \u201cThis could be part of the setup. Be wary. I\u2019ve heard that if guests bore him, Nereus smites them down.\u201d</p><p>As she and Thronos neared the sounds of revelry, she squared her shoulders, feeling like she was going to a court event in Castle Tornin.</p><p>Under the reign of Omort the Deathless.</p><p>Intrigues, plots, and machinations had been constantly in play. To lower one\u2019s guard could mean a stolen power\u2014or death.</p><p>She was ready for this, had been honed in a war zone like no other.</p><p>Outside an arched doorway, she murmured, \u201cOur goal is to get him to transport us. Just follow my lead. Remember, nothing can get in the way of escape. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He pinned his wings as much as he could, until they jutted only slightly past his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Thronos, this sea god considers himself a Casanova. I\u2019m going to have to flirt, and you\u2019ve got to roll with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, even as he draped an arm over her shoulders. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>They stepped into the hall to find the feast in full swing. The area was resplendent with shimmering shells and garlands of sea grass. Pearls the size of bowling balls adorned the walls and ceilings. There were more floor cutouts revealing the sea; serving nymphs emerged from them with bubble-encased platters and pitchers.</p><p>Hundreds of guests were in attendance. Their species ran the Lore gamut from oceanfolk to woodland beings\u2014but none from the air.</p><p>In addition to the mercreatures, she saw selkies with their seal-skin coats, tree nymphs, and satyrs. Kobolds and gremlins scurried about underfoot. Lanthe even spotted a no-nosed fuath\u2014one among an evil species of water spirits. It had webbed feet, a blond, shaggy mane down its back, and a spiked tail.</p><p>They all looked wasted.</p><p>The dining table was immense, a weighty glass surface laid over coral tubes. The chairs were made of polished driftwood. Smiling Nereids served drinks to guests. Others danced and played instruments.</p><p>One blew on a conch to signal their arrival, announcing them as \u201cMelanthe of the Deie Sorceri, Queen of Persuasion, and Prince Thronos of Skye Hall and all Air Territories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome, my honored guests!\u201d a male called from the head of the table.</p><p>Must be Nereus. He was strikingly tall. His long red hair and beard were streaked through with blond. He wore only the bottom half of a toga, displaying the brawny muscles of his oiled chest, arms, and shoulders. Gold bands encircled his beefy biceps.</p><p>His emerald-green eyes roved over her with such intensity that Thronos\u2019s arm tightened around her.</p><p>Nereus waved them over. On the surface, he seemed in a joyous mood. Yet there was an undercurrent of something in his gaze, something that turned his handsome mien almost creepy.</p><p>She could handle creepy. Lanthe cast him a bright smile. Showtime.</p><p>FORTY-TWO</p><p>Once the god had greeted Melanthe and Thronos, all the revelers stared.</p><p>Though not as intently as Nereus himself had ogled Thronos\u2019s mate!</p><p>Out of the corner of her mouth, she said, \u201cJust smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave.\u201d</p><p>As she was speaking to a single male, Thronos figured this was another cultural reference he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>The entire trek here, he\u2019d worked to remain calm because he\u2019d sensed that Melanthe was nearing her breaking point. Perhaps she had been, but no longer.</p><p>Now she looked like a knight about to enter a fray: focused, confident, yet aware of the stakes.</p><p>\u201cJoin me here,\u201d Nereus called. At the far end of the table, he pointed to a pair of chairs just to the right of his throne.</p><p>Why would he seat them in such a place of honor?</p><p>The festivities ramped up once more, the music restarting. The nymphs\u2019 song was strangely relaxing, but Thronos knew he needed to stay sharp.</p><p>He assessed his environs. Exits: only the doorway and floor cutouts. Adversaries: unknown. So he\u2019d consider every single being a potential enemy\u2014except the harmless nymphs.</p><p>Disadvantages: they were deep beneath the ocean, not exactly his preferred battleground. A week ago, he would have said this was his worst nightmare.</p><p>Now he knew that losing his mate was.</p><p>As he and Lanthe made their way down the length of the table, Thronos worked to limit his limp\u2014in hostile situations, opponents always scouted for weaknesses. Though his arm and wing had been healed, his old injuries still plagued him.</p><p>Other guests were already seated, some Loreans he\u2019d never seen before. Most wore skimpy togas, their heads decorated with wreaths.</p><p>Thronos counted himself lucky to be dressed in traditional Vrekener attire.</p><p>At some sections of the table, water-filled tanks had been pulled up for the comfort of mercreatures. They drank heavily from shell goblets. Though the tanks were transparent, tentacles groped or . . . probed.</p><p>That\u2019s just not right. But Thronos showed no reaction.</p><p>Farther down the table was even more lechery. Nymphs perched across knees or astraddle males, their hands busy beneath the glass tabletop. The way one nymph was writhing over a satyr\u2019s furry lap, Thronos figured the male had to be inside her, concealed by her sea-foam skirt.</p><p>Melanthe cast him a look from under her lashes, probably thinking he couldn\u2019t handle the iniquity of these scenes. After Inferno, he was growing more accustomed.</p><p>As he and Melanthe passed, revelers cast amorous glances at her. How could they not? None of the females here could hold a candle to his. She was a sensual sorceress, blessed with unmatched beauty.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen her dressed like this in ages. Her glossy braided hair shone in the hall\u2019s light. Her eyes were sky blue behind her mask.</p><p>He pictured her wearing these garments in the Territories. Compared to the bare-breasted Nereids strolling Sargasoe, Melanthe appeared almost demure. Thronos supposed everything was relative\u2014a startling realization for an all-or-nothing thinker to have.</p><p>Nereus told the crowd, \u201cEveryone, partake heartily of libations, feast on rich foods, and fill my hall with merriment!\u201d</p><p>Melanthe murmured to Thronos, \u201cLibations? Rich foods and merriment? In other words, this is your special kind of hell.\u201d She made him sound like a killjoy. She\u2019d called him a killjoy.</p><p>He could be merry if he wanted. If it was so bloody important to her . . .</p><p>Yet with each new detail he registered in this hall, he became more certain that \u201cfeasting\u201d would never be a favorite activity. He was used to action, used to searching for Melanthe.</p><p>Now he merely wanted to begin a life with her.</p><p>Once they\u2019d seated themselves beside Nereus with formal greetings exchanged, the god snapped his fingers and two serving nymphs arrived.</p><p>They poured wine for her and ale for Thronos, again showing a perplexing degree of interest in him. Earlier, he\u2019d noted Melanthe\u2019s displeasure over this. When he\u2019d felt her delving, he\u2019d shielded his thoughts, wanting her to wonder what he was thinking about for once.</p><p>\u201cMy dear travelers, this is a time of celebration,\u201d the sea god explained\u2014to Melanthe\u2019s breasts. \u201cThough a foe breached our walls last month, he didn\u2019t seek any of my offspring! Only wanted to settle a small debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelicitations, Nereus,\u201d Melanthe said warmly, raising her goblet.</p><p>Nereus finally met her gaze. \u201cAnd now I have new and interesting visitors at my table. My dinner guests have been so boring of late.\u201d He stroked his lengthy beard. \u201cI have to execute them just to salvage the night!\u201d</p><p>Still smiling serenely, she asked Thronos: \u2014Now do you understand the stakes?! We\u2019ve come this far. I don\u2019t want to die in Sargasoe.\u2014</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m rolling with it, aren\u2019t I? Even though his gaze has scarcely left your chest.\u2014 Thronos\u2019s wings tensed with the need to lash out against the male, his fangs and claws readying to rend flesh.</p><p>As a demon\u2019s might. But he bridled his rage.</p><p>\u201cA toast is in order!\u201d When Nereus stood, Melanthe coughed, her wide eyes on the god. What was she looking at?</p><p>Oh. Nereus was grossly endowed, so much so that when he\u2019d stood, his member had swung like a pendulum beneath the thin fabric.</p><p>Melanthe gawked. \u2014It\u2019s his very own kickstand! You could snuggle it like a body pillow.\u2014</p><p>Thronos clenched his jaw. \u2014Got an eyeful?\u2014</p><p>\u2014And then some! No one will believe me when I tell them about this.\u2014</p><p>\u201cTo our castaways,\u201d Nereus said, with a grand gesture toward them. \u201cMay they find everything they seek in my domain.\u201d</p><p>His tone made Thronos\u2019s wings twitch, but when Melanthe elbowed him to raise his goblet, he played along. Yet he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of a threat.</p><p>\u2014Drink it. Nereus can make you if he wants to.\u2014</p><p>Scowling into the cup, Thronos took a drink, and found the ale . . . delectable. He\u2019d downed the goblet\u2019s contents before he\u2019d realized it.</p><p>At once, a Nereid crossed to him with a pitcher, shoving her breasts into his face as she poured.</p><p>Naked breasts in his face, and all he could think was: I hope Melanthe is seeing this.</p><p>Lanthe would soon have to walk a very fine line.</p><p>She needed to intrigue and arouse Nereus, a debauched libertine. And she needed to do that without inflaming Thronos\u2019s jealousy beyond his control.</p><p>Easy as easy pie; except it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>When Nereus turned his full attention to her, she felt like footlights had just lit up. \u201cDo you like your Sorceri wine? The vintner assures me it\u2019s sweet enough to please a sorceress\u2019s tongue.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe took a sip. \u201cScrumptious! It\u2019s not often that I get to enjoy it away from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you come to be upon Sargasoe\u2019s coast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s such a long and boring tale.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Boring? The hell it was.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Pipe down. I need to concentrate here.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Then go on, weave your spell. I could almost pity the sea god.\u2014</p><p>She laid her hand over Nereus\u2019s. \u201cInstead, let\u2019s talk about you. It\u2019s not every day I get to meet a divinity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to know, sorceress? Am I attracted to your charms? Absolutely. Next question.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at Nereus, even as she sensed Thronos turning away, refusing to watch their interaction. \u201cWhat enemy dared to descend on Sargasoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire,\u201d Nereus answered. \u201cYou might know him\u2014Lothaire the Enemy of Old. I\u2019d been indebted to him, but no longer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect half of the Lore is in his infamous book of debts.\u201d Unfortunately Rydstrom was; he and Sabine had been hunting the diabolical vamp over the last year, figuring a dead leech couldn\u2019t collect. As of a few days ago, Lothaire had been an Order prisoner, obviously escaped now.</p><p>In the past, Lanthe had considered the Enemy of Old to be one of the sexiest males in the Lore. But now . . .</p><p>Her gaze slid over to Thronos. He didn\u2019t even act like he was with her, just sipped from his goblet, glowering at his surroundings. \u2014Easy with the booze, tiger.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Just get this over with.\u2014</p><p>She turned back to Nereus, inwardly frowning as a thought occurred. The god had said his foe Lothaire had come last month. Between Pandemonia and the belly, how much time had she and Thronos lost? Sabine must be out of her head with worry!</p><p>Nereus observed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected to see a sorceress and a Vrekener as traveling companions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheap airfare,\u201d she said with a wink.</p><p>He smiled, revealing straight, white teeth. A nice smile. Fangs would make it better. \u201cYes, but I sense that you are a hedonist like myself. And the Vrekener is not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterestingly, he and I share a fated connection.\u201d</p><p>\u2014You. Are. Mine.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Thronos, come on!\u2014 She reached for her wine again.</p><p>Nereus waved her statement away. \u201cI detect a great many things about you. You\u2019re a sensual connoisseur, are you not?\u201d</p><p>She paused over the rim of her goblet.</p><p>\u201cFrom one hedonist to another,\u201d he continued, \u201cI find it refreshing when women know their way around the bedroom. A humanoid female who happens to be a connoisseur of males is a most coveted creature in nautical realms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much in other realms.\u201d</p><p>In a bemused tone, Nereus asked, \u201cWhy is sex the only endeavor where a male hopes his partner is a rank novice?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lanthe couldn\u2019t stop the grin that spread over her face. \u201cWhy indeed?\u201d</p><p>Nereus gazed at her smiling lips for long moments, then leaned in with a get-down-to-business look. \u201cYou want to get to know me, but I want us to get to know each other.\u201d He might as well have cracked his knuckles. \u201cSo tell me, what is the favorite pastime of a sorceress like yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking wine and watching TV.\u201d She illustrated the first with a deep draw from her glass.</p> <p>\u201cAdmirable. And how would you react if you developed gills?\u201d he asked, as if he was ticking off a mental list of questions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wonder how to accessorize them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour stance on sharing males?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally not a fan.\u201d The dick was speed-date interviewing her! \u201cI\u2019m high-maintenance, usually more than one male can handle.\u201d</p><p>Thronos snorted. He might as well have said, \u201cPreach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn five years, where do you see yourself?\u201d Nereus asked. \u201cWith more than a dozen spawn? Or fewer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely fewer than a dozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPets in the bed. Yay or nay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor instance, a pod of Nereids.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Yes, Melanthe, tell us. How would you feel?\u2014</p> <p>\u2014Gold preserve me.\u2014 \u201cDo I get a pass?\u201d</p><p>Nereus hesitated, then let her off the hook on that one. \u201cIf you could meet any Lorean, alive or dead, who would it be?\u201d</p><p>Finally a question that wasn\u2019t laden with skeevy undertones. In all honesty, she would have liked a chance to talk to her mother.</p><p>She wished she could tell Elisabet that she now understood how difficult it must\u2019ve proved to be the vessel of an Accession, to be banished from her Deie Sorceri family, to leave her home and all she\u2019d known.</p><p>To beget a child like Omort.</p><p>Lanthe now knew Elisabet had done the best she could. Their father, too.</p><p>But Lanthe could never answer honestly. So she glibly said, \u201cNaturally, it would be you, Nereus.\u201d</p><p>If the god noticed that her mood had changed, he didn\u2019t indicate it. Yet she felt Thronos\u2019s penetrating eyes on her.</p> <p>\u201cFlattering sorceress,\u201d Nereus fake-chided, but she could tell he was pleased. The questions resumed. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite art and music, across all planes and worlds?\u201d</p><p>She felt herself relaxing. This was an easy subject for her. \u201cFor art, I enjoy the Helvitan masters. The way those vampires use ground bloodroot on a canvas of cured flesh is nothing short of inspiring. For music, I like a mortal genre called top one hundred. Or, of course, classical Draiksulian. Those fey know how to compose a jaunty tune. I noticed earlier that your Nereids were playing thirteenth-century sirenades. Lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were indeed! I hadn\u2019t thought anyone would notice.\u201d He narrowed his green eyes. \u201cYou are clearly well educated. How are you at trivia?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes she would play trivia games with Sabine, Rydstrom, Cadeon, and Holly, going from third wheel to fifth wheel. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not too bad. When I was young, I\u2019d often read to pass the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen answer this: Who was the leader of the Three-Century Rebellion in the Quondam realm?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected a trick question from a trickster god. \u201cActually, that rebellion was in the Quandimi realm. The leader was Bagatur the Battlecrafter.\u201d</p><p>Nereus gave a robust laugh, his oiled chest rumbling. \u201cI thought I would stump you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister and I studied ruthless leaders to pick up pointers. We were convinced we would rule the worlds in one great co-queendom.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Thronos cast her a quizzical look. \u2014You know a great many things.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Maybe I earned my idle pastime of TV viewing? I\u2019m not an empty-headed bimbo. Which is why I didn\u2019t take kindly to your suggestion that I study Vrekener history and spend time in contemplation.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Fair enough.\u2014</p><p>Nereus too was impressed with her knowledge. \u201cI find you to be quite learned about art and culture and the ways of the world. I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d His hand landed on her knee. \u201cWith your beauty and sexual prowess, you would be ideal for spawning.\u201d</p><p>He had been interviewing her. She glanced down, saw Thronos\u2019s arm muscles bulging as he clenched his fists.</p><p>\u2014You said you\u2019d roll with this!\u2014 She sipped from her goblet to buy time.</p><p>Thronos drained his. \u2014If you\u2019d been alone, would you have received Nereus?\u2014</p><p>\u2014Anatomically, I would have concerns.\u2014 So how should she lead Nereus off this spawning path? Bait and switch? Whom could she throw under the bus?</p><p>It came to her in a flash. \u201cMy dear Nereus, while I\u2019m humbled that you would think of me for such an honor, I fear I can\u2019t betray my queen.\u201d Morgana was a big girl. She could handle an infatuated god.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe peeled his hand from her knee. \u201cSurely you know of Morgana\u2019s interest in you? She constantly rhapsodizes about your prodigious . . . intellect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not aware of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me to cross the Queen of Sorceri in this would be a fatal mistake.\u201d Actually, crossing her in anything would prove fatal.</p><p>Morgana was a queen in two senses. Just as Lanthe was the Queen of Persuasion, with a persuasive ability greater than that of any other, Morgana\u2014the Queen of Sorceri\u2014possessed the ability to control her subjects and their powers absolutely. Plus, she was also the regent of the Sorceri.</p><p>\u201cIs Morgana so fearsome, then?\u201d Nereus asked.</p><p>\u201cWe are all fairly much helpless before her.\u201d Well, except for her arch-nemesis La Dorada\u2014who, incidentally, had risen for this Accession. \u201cTaking something Morgana wants would be a treasonous act.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his beard. \u201cI will have to think on that.\u201d</p><p>Had Lanthe done enough to deflect him?</p><p>An army of Nereids began serving the main course: lobster still in the shell, with sea vegetables as an accompaniment.</p><p>\u201cThis looks amazing!\u201d Lanthe said, though she would never touch the lobster.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy, my winsome sorceress.\u201d When Nereus rose, she jerked her gaze upward before she got another eyeful. \u201cAllow me to circulate so that my other guests don\u2019t accuse you of monopolizing me. I\u2019m not the only one who considers smiting a solution to social blunders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Take your time.\u201d She waved bye-bye, then turned her attention to Thronos, who was presently slouched in his chair, wings slack, regarding everything with a gimlet eye. Probably pondering how to kill a god.</p><p>\u201cWhen Nereus gets back, I\u2019m going to ask him about the portal.\u201d</p><p>Thronos\u2019s knuckles were white on his goblet when he drank.</p><p>Under her breath, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice in this. I refuse to die here, and I refuse to be trapped as some spawner beneath the ocean. I\u2019m doing the best I can in a honey/vinegar situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this!\u201d Thronos exhaled, then said in a lower tone, \u201cI know. And that was clever to throw Morgana into the mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope it works.\u201d</p><p>Appearing to shake away the worst of his ire, Thronos raised his goblet before her. \u201cTaste this ale.\u201d He seemed almost buzzed. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip from his cup, then handed it back with a grimace. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He downed a large gulp.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s demon brew.\u201d Loved by demons and hated by most others in the Lore.</p><p>He swallowed loudly, nearly choking on the liquid. He must know that this drink left one steadily tipsy, until abrupt drunkenness hit like a sledgehammer.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they serve me demon brew?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Lanthe gave him a bless your heart look.</p><p>He bit out a harsh laugh. \u201cSo the evidence continues to mount? And N\u00efx wants to know if it matters that we might be demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much have you had, Thronos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree or so goblets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree? You\u2019re going to be tanked.\u201d Though she\u2019d only had a little more than a goblet of wine, she would taper off, just in case.</p><p>He gazed at her mouth, his lids heavier. \u201cMy impending drunkenness should please you, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood me. I don\u2019t care if you drink or not; I just don\u2019t want you to tell me not to. But tonight, I\u2019ll take it easy, so one of us is on guard.\u201d</p><p>A Nereid squeezed between them to fill his goblet. The female all but pressed her voluptuous breasts in his face, before traipsing off.</p><p>Even though he was buzzed, he kept his mind blocked.</p><p>As her glare followed the Nereid, Lanthe told him, \u201cIf she shoved her breasts any closer to your ear, I believe you could\u2019ve heard the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompared to the belly of the beast, this situation is a vast improvement,\u201d he said nonchalantly.</p><p>She turned her glare on him. \u201cBecause the belly of the beast lacked topless nymphs? Talk to management.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d He leaned in closer, the electricity between them sparking. \u201cI knew I was growing on you.\u201d With a crooked grin, he said, \u201cAfter all, you loved hallucinated sex acts with me.\u201d</p><p>Had she ever! She sipped her wine to cover her reaction to him.</p><p>When she licked her lip, Thronos muttered, \u201cLucky lip.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s fine line had just gotten finer. The brew would hit Thronos soon. \u201cYou need to eat something.\u201d She pointed to his platter of lobster. \u201cA full stomach might forestall some of the effects.\u201d</p><p>He had to be starving, but he was clearly at a loss. \u201cCrustaceans are not something I\u2019ve much experience with. What I wouldn\u2019t give for a nice haunch of venison.\u201d He looked around as if to see how others were handling their lobsters. The mercreatures ate the entire thing, including the shell, probably throwing up that part later. He turned back to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>With a look of commiseration, she started on the salad of seaweed, sea lettuce, and kelp. She found it surprisingly tasty.</p><p>Once Nereus returned, Thronos turned surly straightaway.</p><p>The god noticed. \u201cYou show no interest in my lovely nymphs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanthe is my mate,\u201d Thronos said with unmistakable pride. \u201cI have interest in only one female.\u201d</p><p>Nereus\u2019s gaze was shrewd. \u201cAh, but does the interest run both ways? Well, sorceress? Are you as besotted with the Vrekener as he is with you?\u201d</p><p>I might be falling for him.</p><p>But the next step in their relationship was her accompanying him to Skye Hall, an all-in scenario. Going with him to heaven would be the craziest thing she\u2019d ever done. Yet as she peered over at him, she realized that wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>Letting this one go might be.</p><p>How proud Thronos had sounded when he\u2019d said, \u201cMelanthe is my mate,\u201d declaring interest only in her. For years, she\u2019d imagined what it would be like having a male to prize her and hold her hand in public. To take her to court events.</p><p>Instead of into the shadows for whispered assignations.</p><p>Thronos would never wince at his watch, claiming, \u201cGot a really early morning tomorrow, sweet.\u201d He would never, ever blaze.</p><p>The situation with him\u2014with their families and factions\u2014was anything but ideal. Yet Thronos, the man, was getting there.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking it day by day,\u201d she finally told the god, earning a black look from Thronos. \u201cSo, let\u2019s get back to you.\u201d Resting her chin on her hand, she gazed at Nereus with\u2014seemingly\u2014utter absorption. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell me about the Marianas Trench siege? That was supposed to have been a doozy!\u201d</p><p>She planned to go in for the kill soon. Would Nereus let them leave immediately? Or make them wait till after the feast? She wanted to get Thronos out of here as soon as possible, before the brew hit him.</p><p>\u201cI remember that one,\u201d Nereus began. \u201cI was only a millennium or two in age. . . .\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019d recounted the tale, she sighed, \u201cThe stuff of legend. Nereus, your hospitality has been as fabulous as your spectacular realm. I can\u2019t wait to tell my fellow Sorceri all about you, as well as my friends among the witches and Valkyrie. The Vertas alliance will know of your generosity. . . .\u201d She trailed off, frowning at a nearby wine pourer.</p><p>The nymph was giving Thronos another assessing glance.</p><p>No, not assessing. Something darker.</p><p>Lanthe gazed around, saw other nymphs with the same expression. They looked . . . proprietary.</p><p>As if they already owned him.</p><p>\u2014Stop drinking, Thronos. We might be in trouble.\u2014</p><p>\u2014This ale is hitting me hard, Melanthe.\u2014 Even telepathically, his words were slurred.</p><p>When fogginess overtook her as well, she knew it wasn\u2019t only the demon brew affecting him. \u2014I need you to fight it.\u2014</p><p>At once, she scented blood. He was digging his claws into his palms. But it was a losing proposition.</p><p>She swung her head around at Nereus, and almost toppled out of her chair. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she snapped, her words sounding far away. The Nereids weren\u2019t the only ones looking proprietary.</p><p>As her head lolled, she heard Thronos murmur aloud, \u201cLanthe?\u201d</p><p>Black dots swirled at the edges of her vision. The last thing she saw was Nereus throwing back his head to give a loud laugh.</p><p>And then nothing.</p><p>FORTY-THREE</p><p>Lanthe woke in a cavernous chamber, atop a bed with a shell canopy.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d she asked groggily. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She was having a hard time marshaling her thoughts, felt like she was riding waves\u2014or beset by that spinning-bed feeling. Had she drunk that much wine? Had she wandered into the wrong room, then passed out fully dressed? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wished she could say that had never happened. But then, Lanthe liked her wine. So where was Thronos?</p><p>With bleary eyes, she regarded the room. Along one wall, a waterfall cascaded; scenes from under the sea played across the surface, like a TV.</p><p>Wait, was that Nereus crossing toward her?</p> <p>Everything came crashing back. She and Thronos had either been drugged or bespelled!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my private chambers, sorceress.\u201d Nereus was leering like a kraken about to take his sacrifice. As he stalked closer, his shaft swayed under his filmy toga.</p><p>\u201cI must have accidentally found my way in here,\u201d she said to give him an out, though she knew he wasn\u2019t about to take it.</p><p>A giggle sounded from beneath her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Oh, for the love of gold! Lanthe wasn\u2019t atop a mattress; she was atop a collection of curvy Nereids. They lay on their bellies, tightly nestled together.</p><p>Did Nereus sleep on them? Make love atop them?</p><p>She scrambled to her feet. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d she cried, trying to shake off whatever the god had roofied her with. \u201cI need to get back to Thronos. He\u2019s going to be wondering where I am.\u201d When he woke. Wherever he woke.</p><p>Nereus kept advancing on her. She backed away from him, darting a glance out the round underwater window to her left: no help there. She was about to turn from it\u2014until she heard a muffled shriek that vibrated the glass.</p><p>Chills broke out on her skin as she scanned the depths. A field of glittering gems drew her gaze. Her lips parted with shock.</p><p>Like the rays of the sun, the gems radiated out from a female . . . who was shackled to an anchor at the bottom of the ocean.</p> <p>Her long black hair streamed across her naked body and floated above her head. The strands were coated in phosphorescence, illuminating her pale, corpselike face, her haunted violet eyes.</p><p>It was the queen of the Valkyrie, Furie, so named because she was part Fury\u2014a fire-winged Arch-Fury. Rumor held that she\u2019d been captured by the old vampire king, who\u2019d cursed her to this existence, trapped alive underwater, hidden from her Valkyrie sisters and allies.</p><p>As a Lorean, Furie would drown every few minutes before her immortality revived her; she\u2019d been missing for more than fifty years. Five decades of breathing water into her lungs.</p><p>Lanthe had almost drowned earlier\u2014once\u2014and it had been horrifying.</p><p>The Valkyrie locked eyes with her. Furie\u2019s violet gaze was filled with madness\u2014but also blankness. As if she couldn\u2019t comprehend where she was or how she\u2019d gotten here.</p><p>Flames ignited behind her\u2014Furie\u2019s unique fire wings splaying.</p><p>Only to be extinguished.</p><p>Lanthe had been wrong. There was another sky-born here at the bottom of the ocean.</p> <p>Realization dawned. As with the other realms, N\u00efx had wanted Lanthe here. She was the planted spy, conducting Valkyrie recon.</p><p>\u201cDo you like my new acquisition?\u201d Nereus asked, as if he\u2019d just pointed out a vase. \u201cI found her along the ocean bed.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe turned to him. \u201cTruly an original,\u201d she managed to say with Sabine\u2019s composure. \u201cBut really, I need to get back to Thronos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s occupied at the moment. You\u2019ll remain with me.\u201d</p><p>The god\u2019s ominous tone filled her with fear. \u201cNereus, I don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. You think I cannot sense such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve sensed anything, it was my need for Thronos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shame he doesn\u2019t return it.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cWhat does that mean? I know he does. He has for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Nereids right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re seducing him as we speak. For those centuries, how many times has he prayed to be free of the bonds of matehood? To collect his own sexual experiences, as you have? I\u2019m merely answering a prayer.\u201d</p><p>Nereus and his games. He\u2019d known Lanthe and Thronos\u2019s story all along.</p><p>\u201cHere in Sargasoe, matehood holds no sway. The Nereids now exude your scent. His body and instinct are as free as if he\u2019d never met you.\u201d</p><p>So, physically Thronos could stray. That didn\u2019t mean he would. In Feveris, he\u2019d told her he would be true to her.</p><p>Except Feveris wasn\u2019t real. You said so yourself, Lanthe. Still . . . \u201cHe won\u2019t go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has ever resisted them.\u201d</p><p>The god didn\u2019t understand; if there was any male out there who would prove loyal, it was Thronos. He was upstanding, principled, and forthright. He made tough choices. He was going to try to rehabilitate his evil brother, for gold\u2019s sake!</p><p>Lanthe straightened her mask. Sorceri were gamblers. She would bet on Thronos to be, well, Thronos. \u201cCare to make a wager on that score?\u201d</p><p>Nereus raised his red brows. \u201cI would. If the Vrekener succumbs to their considerable charms, you will spend the night with me. Willingly and lustily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will release both of you, giving you use of Sargasoe\u2019s portal to travel wherever you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will we know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Nereus waved a hand, and a new scene played on the waterfall.</p><p>Lanthe could see Thronos lying on a bed, much like the one in which she\u2019d woken\u2014with Nereids for a mattress. He was slowly coming to.</p><p>A dozen more nymphs loomed over him. The sea-foam skirts they\u2019d worn at the feast had disappeared. Their made-for-sex bodies were completely unclothed, their eyes lambent with desire.</p><p>Naked nymphs in obvious heat surrounded Lanthe\u2019s male.</p><p>This situation would be any man\u2019s most fevered fantasy\u2014yet Thronos looked agitated. \u201cWhere\u2019s Melanthe?\u201d In the face of such splendor, his first thought was of her.</p><p>Because he\u2019s mine.</p><p>He pushed them away, and her heart soared. He was so handsome, so strong. So . . . good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your bet,\u201d Lanthe told the god in a smug tone.</p><p>Nereus\u2019s smile was unctuous. \u201cThen we have a pact, sorceress.\u201d</p><p>Yet before Thronos could reach the door, the nymphs fell upon him. Pale hands roamed all over his body, stroking his wings, his chest, his horns, their touch seeming to daze him. \u201cI just want to find . . . it\u2019s important to find her,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cFind us,\u201d they purred, as if with one voice. \u201cWe desire you so deeply.\u201d</p><p>Over her shoulder, Lanthe snapped, \u201cThey\u2019re bespelling him! That wasn\u2019t part of the deal!\u201d</p><p>Nereus shrugged. \u201cA worthy male, one who intends absolute fidelity, could shake off their spell. Otherwise he\u2019ll succumb, and once he does, he\u2019ll never want to leave. In fact, he\u2019ll go into a murderous rage if separated from his harem.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s stomach lurched as the females led Thronos back to the bed, ripping off his shirt on the way.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he demanded, but his resistance faltered with each expert caress.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d they chorused, coaxing him to lie back. \u201cNot like we do.\u201d</p><p>I do! Faced with losing him, Lanthe was rocked by a yawning loss. She\u2019d already been having possessive feelings toward Thronos, but now . . .</p><p>I want him so much.</p><p>Since she could remember, she\u2019d pined for a male who would adore her above all things. Yes, there was a vicious history between her and Thronos, but she\u2019d believed he would eventually fall in love with her.</p><p>True love. Which was more than she could say about any other male she\u2019d met in her lifetime. . . .</p><p>Off went his boots. \u201cAll your life, you\u2019ve pursued and endured,\u201d the Nereids murmured, \u201cwhile she enjoyed other males. You longed for the freedom to choose who you desired. Now you can, but only here, where there\u2019s no such thing as matehood.\u201d</p><p>How could he resist that reasoning? He\u2019d felt \u201ccuckolded.\u201d He\u2019d tried to stray. And now in this realm, he was finally free to.</p><p>No longer was Lanthe his bitter necessity.</p><p>Just days ago, he\u2019d told her she was lacking, that he would never desire someone like her.</p><p>But things had changed between them. He\u2019d told her he wanted everything from her. Maybe if she\u2019d given him any kind of encouragement, any definitive signal that her own feelings had changed, he would\u2019ve stayed faithful.</p><p>When one of the Nereids began undoing Thronos\u2019s pants\u2014with her teeth\u2014Lanthe was staggered by the tears spilling from her eyes. \u201cLet me go to him and stop this. Please, Nereus!\u201d</p><p>His mien darkened, growing more piscine. She heard doors shutting and locking to prevent her escape.</p><p>Even after the nymphs had stripped Thronos naked, he gave one last struggle, so they deepened their spells to knock him out completely.</p><p>One nymph told another, \u201cHe\u2019ll wake in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Then it was as good as done. No male alive could wake to a nymph blow-job and deny the female.</p><p>Crying, sick, Lanthe turned her back on the scene. I should\u2019ve locked Thronos down. I should\u2019ve fought for him when I had the chance.</p><p>Now she would have to face his murderous wrath when she tried to steal him back from the nymphs.</p><p>If she somehow could, would Thronos even want her after she bedded Nereus?</p><p>\u201cMy dear sorceress, if it\u2019s any consolation\u201d\u2014Nereus patted the \u201cbed\u201d by his side\u2014\u201che resisted them longer than any other male I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><p>She was too heartbroken to react much to her own predicament. The overly endowed god wasn\u2019t known to be a gentle lover.</p><p>She wanted to blame Thronos for her situation, but of course she couldn\u2019t. She was responsible for her fate. If she\u2019d given him any sign . . .</p><p>With leaden feet, she crossed to Nereus\u2014</p><p>A bellow sounded.</p><p>She whirled toward the waterfall screen, saw Thronos shoving away Nereids, sending them flying across the room. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mate?\u201d he yelled, wings flaring, his naked body magnificent. \u201cBegone from me, you foul witches!\u201d</p><p>She smiled through new tears, cheering him as he yanked his pants on. Snatching up his clothes, he stormed away\u2014from a carnal paradise.</p><p>For me.</p><p>She beamed with pride. By denying those nymphs, he\u2019d gone against his instincts\u2014and his ego.</p><p>Nereus released a stunned breath. \u201cAmazing. Go to your Vrekener with my blessing.\u201d In the distance, doors began to clang, unlocking for her. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can sense the location of Sargasoe\u2019s portal.\u201d Giving her a salacious grin, he added, \u201cBut you have no idea what you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, thank you. We\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way\u201d\u2014out of thin air, he produced a lock of shining black hair, scenting it\u2014\u201ctell N\u00efx that she asks much. Quelling a tsunami is no mean task.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. \u201cWill do, Nereus, will do,\u201d she assured him, sprinting for the door.</p><p>FORTY-FOUR</p><p>What did I do with them?</p><p>Thronos recalled little of what had happened in that room, just knew he\u2019d woken with no clothes on and naked Nereids kissing his body\u2014while more had been layered beneath him.</p><p>\u201cMelanthe!\u201d he bellowed as he strode down the corridor, hastily dressing as he went.</p><p>Those nymphs had whispered that there was no matehood in Nereus\u2019s realm. Thronos would be free to partake\u2014as he\u2019d wanted to for ages.</p><p>But that had been before.</p><p>I was unfaithful.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten drunk on demon brew, then betrayed his lovely, brave, intelligent mate. All of his laws, all of his righteousness, all of the grief he\u2019d given her about her behavior\u2014and he was the one who fell.</p><p>How could he tell her?</p><p>If he\u2019d been seduced by nymphs, then what in the hell was happening to her? Was Nereus ravishing her? If the god touches her . . . \u201cMelanthe!\u201d His fear for her, his blind panic, burned away much of his inebriation. \u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>He heard, \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d just before he saw her speeding around a corner.</p><p>She ran for him, face ecstatic. My incomparable mate. So bloody beautiful.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re free, Thronos! We can leave now.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod, looping his arm over her shoulder. \u201cI want to get far away from this wretched place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe portal\u2019s near.\u201d She led him down a shadowy passageway.</p><p>As they hastened along it, sweat beaded on his lip. What did I do? \u201cWhere were you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNereus didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he kept his hands to himself.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re going to have to tell her. The only thing worse than his infidelity would be hiding it. How would she react?</p><p>At the end of the corridor was the portal. Living coral framed the rippling surface.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can all but hear you grinding your molars to dust. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re finally here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanthe, my instinct tells me to do anything I can to get you to the Skye.\u201d Only a coward would confess afterward. \u201cBut I must be honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to rail at himself, to tear at his hair. His fist shot out, connected with the wall. Stone cracked, and a trickle of water seeped through it. \u201cLanthe, I . . . I was unfaithful to you.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNereids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlural?\u201d She seemed to be vibrating with some kind of tension.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t stray,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThey smelled like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do to them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was . . . drunk.\u201d An excuse he\u2019d never expected to give, an excuse that shamed him. \u201cI tried to fight off the effects, but at one point I lost consciousness. I woke unclothed.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWith their mouths upon me. I don\u2019t know what I did or how long I was out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look sick about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am! I want only you. It will always be this way.\u201d He scrubbed his hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this could happen. If you knew how badly I desire you . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you decided to confess this to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to come to my home. But I won\u2019t trick you to get you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about the Nereids.\u201d She looked unperturbed. \u201cNereus set it up so that I could see all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not . . . upset? You don\u2019t even care, do you? What would it take to make you give a damn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey bespelled you, and you still didn\u2019t do anything. You\u2019re the first male ever to shake off their magics.\u201d</p> <p>That relieved some of his guilt, but his chest felt hollow at her lack of reaction. She\u2019d witnessed those nymphs seducing him; if he\u2019d ever seen a male\u2019s hands on her naked body, it would have annihilated him. \u201cYou suffer no jealousy?\u201d She might as well have sunk a sword into him. \u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve indulged them!\u201d</p><p>She went up on her toes and grabbed his face. \u201cWhen I thought you were going to succumb, I cried.\u201d</p><p>After all the times he would\u2019ve expected her to cry in the last week? Even in the belly of the beast, she\u2019d somehow stemmed her tears. \u201cYou cried over me?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd not just because of the bet I\u2019d made with Nereus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you speaking of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Nereus that you couldn\u2019t be seduced. If I won, we\u2019d go free. If I lost, he\u2019d bed me.\u201d</p> <p>Nereus would\u2019ve taken my mate this very night! But Thronos had proved stronger than even the Nereids\u2019 spells, and now he and Lanthe would be rewarded.</p><p>He seized her hands. \u201cThen come with me to the Skye.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip. \u201cWe could go to Rothkalina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to return home to get something settled with Aristo. Changes must be made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still plan to rehab him?\u201d She drew away.</p><p>He reluctantly released her. \u201cI told you. I will make him see reason. You will help me. Once he understands what we have together, what we\u2019ve overcome, he\u2019ll have to conclude that his views are mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I won\u2019t use my power for ill while I\u2019m up there?\u201d</p><p>Earlier, he\u2019d thought of the solution. \u201cI have ways.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to trust you not to. I\u2019m going to take you fully empowered to my home, because I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Clever, clever demon.</p><p>Of all the things he could\u2019ve said . . .</p><p>\u201cYou are trusting me to deal with my brother,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m trusting you to use your sorcery in a way we both can live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s my plan. I know you, Melanthe. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLower your voice!\u201d Her eyes darted. \u201cIf that got out . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, take this step with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think King Aristo will let me stay empowered in the Skye?\u201d</p><p>He quirked his brow. \u201cIf anyone tries anything, then I\u2019m sure you can persuade them not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me leave to protect myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t harm anyone unless you must do it in self-defense.\u201d</p><p>Was this a good-with-the-bad situation? If a sorceress wanted a man who would stay faithful even when bespelled and accosted by nymphs, then she had to support that man even when he believed he could rehab his douchelord brother.</p><p>But Lanthe and Thronos had so many issues unsettled between them. She didn\u2019t see how these things could be improved in the realm of the Vrekeners. To her, going there would be like going into the belly of the beast. Having actually been in the belly of the beast, she didn\u2019t think this lightly.</p><p>He curled his finger under her chin. \u201cIn Pandemonia, you accused me of wanting something from you. I do. The opportunity to protect you and treasure you.\u201d She parted her lips to argue, but he stopped her. \u201cNot only because of my instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to believe that. I would. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what N\u00efx\u2019s advice was concerning you? One sentence: \u2018Before Melanthe was this, she was that.\u2019 I figured it out two worlds ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you were my enemy, you were my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Just as it had centuries ago, her heart ached with yearning.</p><p>\u201cYou still are,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd that is why I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>He was nothing like Felix\u2014or most other males she\u2019d met.</p><p>Thronos was a good man. He was her man.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she wished for the opportunity to give him encouragement? She replayed the yawning loss she\u2019d felt when she\u2019d thought he would succumb. Now, she needed to say something, anything, but her thoughts were tangled.</p><p>He must have sensed she was on the ropes. He inched closer to her. \u201cWhen we were children, we made big plans in that meadow, expecting every happiness to follow. I want to look back one day and say that our plans went awry for only the first five hundred years, but not for the following millennia. Lanthe, if you come with me, I\u2019ll want to wed you. This very day.\u201d</p><p>Marry him today? The word cleave had another meaning. To bind.</p><p>In a flash, she understood: on this night, she would either separate from Thronos or bind her life to his.</p><p>If she went with him, she would be all-in, committed to him, to them. She would do her damnedest to make a future with Thronos.</p><p>But could she abide Skye Hall? Could she bring her family around? And survive his?</p><p>He released her and moved to the edge of the portal, the threshold of something more, and awaited her.</p><p>She swallowed. All-in?</p><p>With his eyes gone molten silver, Thronos Talos\u2014a fierce, sensual demon\u2014offered his hand, inviting Lanthe to her idea of hell, to become his bride.</p><p>Like a fool in love . . .</p><p>She took it.</p><p>FORTY-FIVE</p><p>It was night in the Skye.</p><p>With Thronos leading the way through the portal, he and Lanthe stepped onto a cobblestone path in the Air Territories. He didn\u2019t release her hand.</p><p>She\u2019d asked him to go first\u2014after all, she hadn\u2019t had the best run of luck with portal directions. And she had to admit she still might be conflicted about this on some level.</p><p>Though she\u2019d never been so high up, her gaze was drawn even higher. The stars were sparkling brilliantly, arcing above them like a diadem. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel right now.\u201d He squeezed her hand.</p><p>She lowered her face to behold just as wondrous a sight: Thronos smiling down at her with starlight reflecting in his eyes.</p><p>Just like that, the apprehension she\u2019d felt at crossing that threshold began to fade.</p><p>When she could drag her attention away from him, she observed her surroundings with interest. They were in a shallow, sandy vale, with treeless mounts and hills rising up on all sides. White, sun-bleached buildings covered those heights, connected squares or rectangles of various sizes\u2014like one might see on a cliffside along the Mediterranean.</p><p>Bordering the structures were cobblestone streets and walkways, all seeming to be straight and narrow, all leading down to this clearing.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly . . . uniform.\u201d And monochromatic. \u201cHow far are we from the edge of the island?\u201d She\u2019d expected her fear of heights would have kicked in by now, but she felt no different than if she were standing on terra firma.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about in the center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt truly is warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe climate extends for miles around the Territories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Not a soul could be seen.</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s the middle of the night. Morning comes very early here.\u201d He pointed toward the largest building in the area, one elevated above all the rest. \u201cThat\u2019s Skye Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew it was an actual hall.\u201d The seat of Vrekener power.</p><p>The grand edifice was the only building with the slightest ornamentation; Corinthian columns fronted it, but like all the others, it apparently had no roof. What might be this island\u2019s only trees grew around it.</p><p>\u201cThe building was constructed against a ridge. The assembly rooms front the elevation, while the royal residence is above it.\u201d</p><p>After all she and Thronos had been through, the prospect of entering that hall and facing Aristo left her queasy. \u201cCan we wait till tomorrow to talk with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We must be wed first,\u201d Thronos said decisively.</p><p>Shit just got real.</p><p>\u201cHe might not even be in residence,\u201d Thronos pointed out. \u201cHe often travels.\u201d</p><p>Busy, busy Aristo. Wonder what he\u2019s up to now . . . \u201cOkay, then, show me your digs.\u201d Even if there was some kind of air mojo up here, she was getting dizzy from the altitude, having gone from miles below sea level to miles above it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what digs are, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur place.\u201d She knew the exact moment when he comprehended he was truly going to claim her\u2014and soon. He swallowed, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing, his piercing gaze sweeping over her body\u2014as if he was deciding what he wanted to do with it first. He didn\u2019t block his thoughts, but she didn\u2019t delve.</p><p>In a huskier voice, he said, \u201cWe live there.\u201d With his free hand, he pointed out another structure high on a cliffside, at the edge of the village. Though unconnected to the other structures, it wasn\u2019t more than a hundred yards or so from them.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d They started toward it.</p><p>\u201cHmm what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I was expecting a palace or something. Our roofless house is really close to other roofless houses, huh?\u201d How \u2019bout those wedding night sex acoustics?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not without problems in our kingdom, Lanthe. We live immortal lives, yet our lands are finite. We face overpopulation.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. \u201cWhen we talk to Aristo, you can tell him we\u2019re going to go found a Vrekener offshoot colony in a different realm. We\u2019ll call it LantheLand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs appealing as LantheLand sounds, I don\u2019t see it happening. The Vrekeners will always live together. Our unity is our strength.\u201d Thronos stopped to gaze down at her. \u201cSo eager to leave? When you just got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear things won\u2019t turn out with your brother as you expect them to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t expect a resolution. Maybe I just need to say I tried.\u201d</p><p>That she could accept. She nodded, and he continued leading her toward . . . their home.</p><p>On the way, he pointed out a trio of obelisks of differing heights. \u201cI learned to fly by dropping from those columns\u2014the smallest one when I was but two or so.\u201d</p><p>She imagined him as a toddler, fearlessly leaping into a parent\u2019s arms, wearing the determined expression she knew so well; maybe that look had been born there. His wings would probably have been oversized for his little body. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you were absolutely adorable.\u201d A thought struck her. \u201cDoes your mother still live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost Vrekeners don\u2019t go on without their mates.\u201d</p><p>So Sabine had essentially killed both of his parents. Were Lanthe and Thronos kidding themselves?</p><p>He swiftly changed the subject. \u201cOn the other side of Skye Hall is the bastion, an area where we eat and socialize. It used to be a prison, but we had to reclaim the space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVrekeners socialize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s a gathering hall on each island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that work, if you can\u2019t drink or gamble? I\u2019m guessing dancing is out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have sporting events and contests. Those of a more studious bent gather to read and debate.\u201d</p><p>Bully. When all the dust settled, Lanthe would be portaling to Rothkalina weekly, just to tie one on. She\u2019d force Thronos to come with her. \u201cI\u2019m sure your people will be overjoyed to have someone like me living among them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first they might not know what to think. But they\u2019ll come to see you as I have. It will happen.\u201d His utter certainty reassured her, his confidence proving contagious.</p><p>They started up a steep walkway with a series of switchbacks. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you guys bother with steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do have Sorceri who live here. And injuries occasionally happen to the wings of the young.\u201d</p><p>A very generous way of putting the latter. He was doing everything possible to make her comfortable.</p><p>\u201cHow many islands are there? How many Vrekeners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTens and tens of thousands are spread over one hundred and seventy islands.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had no idea there were so many of them. But it made sense that an immortal faction would thrive in a hidden realm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you over the entire kingdom in the coming days,\u201d he said as they reached the landing in front of his\u2014their\u2014place. The wooden door was of simple construction, with a rustic latch and no lock. He opened it, ushering her inside.</p><p>Filled with curiosity about the man he\u2019d become, she took in details. The best word to describe the area: spartan. The few pieces of furniture were no-frills\u2014a table with a couple of backless benches, additional benches in a sitting area. Just as with the rest of the realm, there was no color. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And no freaking roof. This lack had looked weird from the outside but was even weirder from within. The structure felt like a dollhouse, as if they were being watched from above. No wonder Vrekeners were so concerned with private behavior.</p><p>Thronos led her along a hallway, past a study lined with books; she decided to come back later and investigate at her leisure. With limited space in his home, every tome he kept must be important.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the kitchen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe eat in the bastion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no servants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the Skye.\u201d</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>Past a surprisingly modern-looking bathroom was a spacious bedroom, with just a nightstand, a chest of drawers, and an enormous bed. The mattress was larger than a king-size, probably because of wingspan considerations.</p> <p>When her steps teetered, he grabbed her elbow.</p><p>\u201cLanthe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m light-headed after coming from the bottom of the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should lie down.\u201d He led her to the bed.</p><p>She sat at the edge. \u201cIn the legendary Bed of Troth?\u201d It\u2019d been crafted of a dark wood and looked sturdy. In a head-on collision with a truck, this bed would dominate. The headboard and footboard were carved with mysterious Vrekener markings. \u201cSo this is where we\u2019ll do the deed?\u201d</p><p>As if the words were pulled from him, he said, \u201cI will wait until you feel better. I\u2019ve waited this long.\u201d</p> <p>Since he\u2019d been a teenager. Lifetimes of curiosity and building lust.</p><p>\u201cThronos, I\u2019ll be fine if you give me a few minutes to get used to the altitude.\u201d</p><p>She could hear his pulse accelerate as he said, \u201cSo tonight, we\u2019ll . . .\u201d</p><p>All in, Lanthe? Accompanying him to heaven meant marriage. Marriage meant possible pregnancy.</p><p>Which was a lot for any sorceress to have to decide in one night. Was she really going to take this step?</p><p>She\u2019d told him that if he ever gave her a loving expression like the one that Volar had sported, she\u2019d consider giving it up.</p><p>She regarded his face and found herself saying, \u201cI figure I\u2019ll go ahead and claim you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThen I need to retrieve something from the Hall. I\u2019ll be right back. Make yourself at home\u2014because it is your home.\u201d At the doorway, he turned back. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to let you out my sight. I feel like I should be chasing you, or we should be saving each other from some calamity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here waiting for you.\u201d When he exited with a look of longing, she reclined to gaze at the stars. I\u2019m in Thronos\u2019s bed.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>How many times had he lain here and thought of her? He\u2019d told her he\u2019d dreamed of her for hundreds of thousands of nights. How many of those times had been in this bed?</p><p>Now she began to get nervous. Because he was a virgin (her first and only virgin), she felt even more pressure to make this unforgettable.</p><p>But how could the reality possibly measure up to five hundred years of fantasy?</p><p>FORTY-SIX</p><p>Thronos was tempted to fly to the Hall, but didn\u2019t want to deal with that grinding pain right now. So he ran, withstanding a lesser agony in his leg.</p><p>He was actually going to claim Melanthe tonight! He\u2019d been so close in Feveris\u2014or in his hallucination\u2014yet then he\u2019d had that bliss wrenched away from him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something would befall them before he could return to her. He resolved to avoid Aristo. Though his brother might be away, Thronos entered the Hall quietly.</p><p>He passed the sorcery power vault and the sacred scribe\u2019s room, where the extensive list of offendments was kept. This close to the hallowed writings, he experienced a twinge of guilt for all the things he\u2019d done with Melanthe before they\u2019d been wed.</p><p>Some things couldn\u2019t be helped. They would marry this night, a proper wedding.</p><p>He headed toward his family\u2019s storage room. Inside, he combed through boxes of ancient mementos and books. By the time he\u2019d located the specific case he sought, in the most out-of-the-way spot, he was covered in dust.</p><p>Whoever had organized this closet clearly hadn\u2019t thought Thronos would ever get married.</p><p>Case in hand, he hastened back to his mate. Though pain coursed up his leg, he found himself growing hard in anticipation of this night. He could feel his horns straightening, becoming more sensitive\u2014</p><p>He froze. Had the distinct impression of being watched. Rubbing the back of his neck, he turned and scanned the shadows. Spied nothing.</p><p>Surely any Vrekener or Sorceri ward drifting about would hail him, and no one else could find this place.</p><p>He shrugged off his disquiet by the time he\u2019d reached the house. He swallowed nervously as he unlatched their front door. When he passed the bathroom, he saw her mesh top hanging beside the shower, with her skirt and hose folded atop a hamper. Her blue mask dangled from a towel hook.</p><p>Seeing her things here gratified him to a staggering degree.</p><p>She\u2019d showered. Should he? Another delay. He glanced down at himself, at the dust.</p><p>With an impatient curse, he set down the case, ripping off his garments. Under the water, he rested his head and hands against the wall. Though the temperature was ice cold, it did nothing to diminish his erection.</p><p>He recalled his mate\u2019s tightness . . . would he last long enough even to get inside her? Would he hurt her?</p><p>She\u2019d taught him how to get her ready. He bit off his foreclaws. Thinking better of it, he took the next ones over as well.</p><p>When he returned to the bedroom, he had a towel wrapped around his hips and the case at the ready.</p><p>His heart stuttered a beat. She was kneeling at the end of the bed, running the pads of her fingers over the footboard. She wore her long shining hair loose, and she\u2019d donned one of his shirts, rolling the sleeves up to her wrists. The sight of her clad in something that belonged to him affected him in inexplicable ways, made him want to squeeze her in his wings, to rub his horns all over her trembling body.</p><p>Mine, all mine.</p><p>Melanthe in his bed, awaiting him. She was too beautiful.</p><p>He watched her gaze leisurely take in his face, his chest, lower. . . . She parted her lips on a sigh, and her little tongue wetted them. Gods almighty.</p><p>Her eyes glittered with appreciation\u2014for him.</p><p>She mightn\u2019t even be real. Feveris hadn\u2019t been, nor those time loops.</p><p>Soon he\u2019d wake from slumber, aching for her, greeted by his customary pain\u2014always more excruciating in the morning. He would clench his fists, renewing his determination, resuming his search. . . .</p><p>With a grin, she waved at his blatant erection behind the towel. \u201cAre you doing your Nereus impression?\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped him before he even realized it. \u201cYou really are here.\u201d Her mischievous smile got him tied up in knots, always had. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see you in this bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d She had removed her prized necklace, setting it on his nightstand. On their nightstand. \u201cBy the way, the hot water\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Probably not a good time to tell her that there was never any hot water for showers.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s in the case?\u201d</p><p>He sat beside her, opening it to reveal the claiming sheet sewn for him ages ago. The material carried the pleasant scent of preserving herbs.</p><p>She unfolded it with a frown. \u201cThis is what you had to retrieve? It won\u2019t be big enough for your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re expected to keep that sheet between us. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that going to work . . . ?\u201d She trailed off when she found the stitched opening in the middle of the material. \u201cWell, how kinky. But isn\u2019t this supposed to be rubber?\u201d She poked her forefinger through the gap, waggling her eyebrows at him.</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cWhy would it be rubber?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cSo many things I\u2019ll have to teach you. I\u2019m all for tradition, but do you really want something between us?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her onto his lap, wrapping his arms around her. \u201cSomehow we managed to get to this bed before sleeping together. I want to do this right. A proper marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis claiming business is important to you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d His forehead rested against hers. \u201cBut, Melanthe, you must be certain of this. We haven\u2019t been together for long. And while I can\u2019t have others\u2014obviously wouldn\u2019t even if I could\u2014you could find someone else.\u201d He began stroking one of her supple thighs. \u201cIf we take this step, you\u2019ll have to pick me over all the men you\u2019ll meet in your eternal life. Because I won\u2019t ever let you go.\u201d As if I would now . . .</p><p>She laid her silken hands on his face. \u201cI picked you over all others when I walked through that portal with you. I want to be your wife.\u201d</p><p>His heart felt too big for his chest. \u201cMy wife.\u201d He dipped down, rubbing the base of one horn up and down her neck. Mine. She had to know he was marking her with his scent.</p><p>When she tilted her head away to give him more access, to let him do as his instinct commanded, he wanted to kiss her until her little toes curled.</p><p>\u201cJust one last consideration,\u201d she murmured absently. \u201cI\u2019m probably not even in season anymore, right? We could\u2019ve been in the belly of the beast for weeks.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cThough I\u2019d wanted to impregnate you so you\u2019d feel bound to me, I can\u2019t lie. I scent you\u2019re in season. It\u2019s waned, but still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen our already slim odds waned too.\u201d She pressed her lips to his neck, then his jawline, then to the corner of his mouth. \u201cYou amaze me, Thronos. I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get used to your honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to. Because I\u2019m about to marry you.\u201d Season or not, she still wanted this. He turned to slant his mouth over hers.</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s lips parted, welcoming his tongue as it slipped toward hers. She loved how leisurely he took their kisses, working the slow build\u2014despite the tension in his massive body.</p><p>Despite the scorching hardness of his shaft beneath her ass.</p><p>As they tangled tongues, he reached higher between her thighs, his fingers trailing upward. There was something so erotic about wearing his shirt, his hand moving unseen beneath the fabric.</p><p>Against her lips, he rasped, \u201cNeed to get you ready.\u201d</p><p>Seeing his gorgeous physique in that towel had already primed her pump. But who was she to disappoint the Vrekener? \u201cI told you: I look at your body and mine grows wet for it. Anything else will be a bonus.\u201d She spread her thighs for him.</p><p>He took the invitation, gently cupping her sex, pressing the heel of his hand against her sensitive clitoris.</p><p>With his other hand he started to rub her stiffened nipples, one, then the other.</p><p>Lightly pinching. Thumbing the very tip. Rolling each peak between his fingers . . .</p><p>When he dipped down to suckle her through the fabric, she gasped, threading her fingers in his damp hair. With each pull of his lips, she arched to him for more.</p><p>\u201cLove suckling you. Could do it for hours.\u201d</p><p>She was moaning when he moved to her other nipple, his breaths hot against the sensitive tip. As he sucked, he eased his finger inside her, groaning to find her so aroused.</p><p>The electricity that always sparked between them grew like a lightning storm. His finger was just a tease, a precursor to the delight she\u2019d almost experienced with Thronos before\u2014when he\u2019d started to wedge his huge shaft into her.</p><p>At the thought, she rocked to meet his thrusting finger, her ass rubbing over the hardness she\u2019d soon enjoy.</p><p>He grated, \u201cThis will be over before it starts.\u201d</p><p>She was ready for him. She cupped the back of his neck. \u201cThen get inside me. Quick, before something interrupts our wedding.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d He moved her from his lap, laying her back on the bed. Once he\u2019d stripped her of the shirt, he dropped his towel, revealing that mouthwatering erection.</p><p>She took her time admiring all seven feet of his warrior\u2019s body. His wings were unfurled, her demon\u2019s sexy backdrop. His horns had gone ramrod straight.</p><p>When he\u2019d run those lengths against her before, her sex had clenched in reaction. He\u2019d marked her with his scent\u2014and she\u2019d loved it. She wanted to kiss and stroke those horns. Then lick his firm lips. And his flat nipples. She wanted to run her mouth along the rigid edges of his pec muscles before following his goodie trail down. . . .</p><p>What was her type? Voil\u00e0.</p><p>He moved to kneel between her legs. Because they were about to do this. Without protection.</p><p>Her biological clock was screaming: Roll. The. Dice.</p><p>Yet then he spread that sheet over her. It was about eight feet square, with a strategically placed slit. The politics of this rankled. She didn\u2019t get contraception, but he got this barrier?</p><p>No, no, this was important to him. Her self-help books told her compromise was vital to a developing relationship.</p><p>Then she lit on an idea, a way for them both to be happy with the sheet; she decided to play along for now.</p><p>As he aligned the opening with her sex, he asked, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you go slow.\u201d</p><p>He levered himself above her, resting on one straightened arm. \u201cSlow?\u201d His gaze fell upon her nipples jutting against the sheet. \u201cI fear I won\u2019t last. I\u2019ve craved you for too long.\u201d With his free hand, he gripped himself, aiming for the sheet\u2019s gap.</p><p>She rested her hands on his broad shoulders as she awaited that first contact. When the bulbous head bumped right at her hungry core, she moaned in readiness. \u201cI might not last long either!\u201d Blue sorcery shimmered from her hands, tendrils of it swathing them.</p><p>He hissed in a breath, determinedly pressing against her. \u201cMy sensual sorceress.\u201d He gazed down with possessiveness ablaze in his expression. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His silver eyes were telling her he was about to claim her, that nothing could stop him.</p><p>When he\u2019d raised himself up on both arms, she kneaded his shoulders. \u201cCan you feel how slick I am? How wet for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanthe . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were in the glade, I imagined what your shaft would feel like plunging inside me.\u201d Her words were throaty. \u201cTonight you\u2019ll show me.\u201d</p><p>A shudder strangled whatever he\u2019d been about to say.</p><p>His unpracticed reactions, the honesty of his responses, ratcheted up her arousal to a shocking degree.</p><p>Honesty was a turn-on. Who knew?</p><p>Subtly rocking to his pulsing rod, she murmured, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be sexier, Thronos.\u201d</p> <p>He canted his head, as if he didn\u2019t believe her. But whatever he saw in her eyes convinced him otherwise. Whatever he saw made his shuddering grow worse.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d planted the crown inside, he was sweating. His voice broke lower as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re so tight around me. Never knew you\u2019d be so hot.\u201d The wonder in his tone made her toes curl.</p><p>The sheet rose and fell with her shallow breaths. She arched her back so that her nipples strained against the material, which seemed to bespell him more than the nymphs had. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to bare my breasts at least?\u201d</p><p>The dilemma was clear on his face. He finally tugged down the sheet just past her breasts. \u201cToo lovely to cover.\u201d</p><p>And she lost a little bit more of her heart to him.</p><p>Eyes rapt on the pebbled tips, he licked his sensual lips. He\u2019d expressed a particular pleasure in suckling her. If he did now, this might truly be over before it started. To distract him, she rolled her hips\u2014</p> <p>Which impaled his shaft even deeper.</p><p>She gasped at the sudden fullness; he grunted, \u201cTight.\u201d</p><p>His gradual pace was the only reason she hadn\u2019t cried out. \u201cSlow is good, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>With a solemn nod, he fed her sheath more of his throbbing length. Already he waged an obvious battle not to come. His wings were furling and unfurling like a fist opening and closing. Sweat slicked the breathtaking swells of his brawny chest, the rippling muscles of his rock-hard torso.</p><p>As he sank ever deeper, a drop of his clean sweat splatted over one of her swollen breasts, making her shiver\u2014and undermining her own control.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cFor driving me crazy?\u201d She cupped his nape, arching up to graze her breasts across his chest\u2014sending the sheet to her waist, sending him deeper inside her.</p><p>\u201cI feel your nipples . . . so stiff . . . ah, gods\u2014\u201d His hips bucked forward in an uncontrollable rush, till he was seated deep within her, a growl wrenched from his lungs.</p> <p>Her own lungs were squeezed for breath. His body was inside her, surrounding her, seeming to vibrate from his struggle to regain the control he\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cLanthe! I didn\u2019t mean\u2014have I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She wriggled beneath him, adjusting to his length. \u201cJust give me a second.\u201d Deep within her, she could perceive his cock pulsating to the beat of his heart. His invincible heart. \u201cI\u2019m good, Thronos. All good.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her face in his big hands, touching her with reverence. \u201cI just wed you,\u201d he rasped, making her melt.</p><p>I\u2019ve waited my entire life to see that look. \u201cSince I\u2019m also engaged in the act\u201d\u2014she shimmied beneath him, eliciting a groan\u2014\u201cI\u2019d say we just wed each other.\u201d</p><p>With a pained smile, he grated, \u201cThat sounds fairer.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop grinning back at him. As if they\u2019d pulled off a stupendous achievement. Which, she supposed, they had.</p><p>But their amusement receded when he began to withdraw. The friction of his cock and that flared crown wrested a plaintive cry from her.</p><p>Before he gave his first thrust, he said, \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>When he tilted his hips forward, he threw his head back, the muscles of his neck bulging. \u201cMy Lanthe!\u201d Then he faced her once more, to gaze at her\u2014with awe.</p><p>He was still swelling inside her, much more than she\u2019d expected. Apparently, he was a show-er and a grower. She did her best to stifle a wince. Brave little soldier, and all that.</p><p>Lanthe had always thought the term joined was hyperbole in a sexual sense. Now, so much of his body was within hers, she did feel joined to him. If she could just get herself accustomed . . . \u201cStir yourself in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStir?\u201d He circled his hips, grinding against her sensitive clitoris.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Pleasure seared her with the intensity of flames.</p><p>A sharp exhalation escaped him. Puh. His expression was thunderstruck.</p><p>In the quiet of the night, his heart pounded like a drum. His wings were stretched wide, the pulselines glowing like shooting stars from the diadem above.</p><p>His starry eyes, gazing down at her, outshone them all.</p><p>He stirred himself again, stretching her, filling her thoroughly. Bliss suffused her, warmth coursing throughout every inch of her. She felt brimming with him, with emotions.</p><p>Replete.</p><p>But her emotions confused her. Amid the tenderness she felt for him, she also experienced gratitude, relief\u2014and even joy.</p><p>With her hands meeting around his nape, she murmured, \u201cThronos . . .\u201d I\u2019m yours. You\u2019re mine. You confuse me. This confuses me. She hadn\u2019t even orgasmed, and it was the best sex she\u2019d ever had. Never had sex felt like coming home to someone.</p><p>Like she was being showered with fate\u2019s gold coins.</p><p>He laid his big palm on the side of her face. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize . . . what your expression\u2019s telling me,\u201d he admitted in a gravelly voice. \u201cBut I think I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you a thousand things at once. I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m ready\u2014to be taken by you.\u201d Not only was she accustomed to him; his cock now felt so critical that she wondered how she\u2019d survived without it. \u201cI\u2019ll give you anything you need.\u201d Her hands moved to his ass, digging into the flexing muscles. \u201cDo you need to thrust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all the gods, yes.\u201d He drew his hips back, sinking himself more slowly.</p><p>Ecstasy surged inside her. Her lids fluttered as she moaned.</p><p>Another painstaking thrust. \u201cIs it always like this, Lanthe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmphatically no.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop writhing on his hardness, wanting ever more of it. \u201cMore, Thronos!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you move . . . maddening.\u201d He clamped her restless hips, his body driving forward. Then again. Each time he hit the end of her sheath, her clitoris got a shot of delicious stimulation. Her orgasm mounted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re squeezing me so tight.\u201d His pace quickened. \u201cI can\u2019t hold out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t come,\u201d she said, feeling her sorcery rising. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d The air blurred near her lips.</p><p>Had she just used her power on him?</p><p>He thrust hard, groaning as if in pain. \u201cLanthe . . .\u201d His skin sheened with sweat, his muscles corded. Just looking at him like this\u2014her steady Vrekener in the throes, a massive warrior about to unleash centuries of need\u2014brought her right to the edge.</p><p>She was going to come for this male, and she could almost fear the intensity of the escalating pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNeed to . . . thrust harder. Can\u2019t go slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Take me as you need to.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he shoved into her body. Again. And again, until he was railing between her legs, to her delight. His hands dipped beneath her, his remaining claws biting into the curves of her ass\u2014a primal sign of possession that sent her spiraling.</p><p>So close, so close.</p><p>He gave a frustrated yell, confusion flashing in his eyes. \u201cLanthe, I can\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have . . . commanded you.\u201d Though she\u2019d been tripping headlong toward her climax, she sucked in a breath and resisted it, wanting to torment them both.</p><p>\u201cUndo it!\u201d His tendons stood out with strain, his mighty body toiling to free its seed.</p><p>\u201cHmm. We\u2019re going to have such fun tonight. . . .\u201d</p><p>FORTY-SEVEN</p><p>This was anything but fun! Thronos could feel a knot of semen trapped right beneath the crown, and he couldn\u2019t release it.</p><p>His body knew exactly who he was claiming, knew it was to spill seed for her womb. The pressure of it made his erection throb like a hammered thumb\u2014worse than it ever had before because he had semen welling for her.</p><p>Her hot channel clutched him so tightly, seeming to demand it. He wanted to savor his first time, to savor her, but he could hardly think past that damned violent throbbing.</p><p>He gazed down to where their bodies joined. Mistake. Through the slit in the sheet, he could see her rosy flesh gloving his engorged length.</p><p>When he saw his mate was wetting the material with her arousal, his shaft jerked within her, as if panting for her. \u201cAbout to lose my mind!\u201d She\u2019d told him that if he was ever inside her, there would be no doubt; he would be broken down at a molecular level, altered irretrievably.</p><p>She\u2019d gravely understated.</p><p>Their crackling electricity now scorched him, as if lightning bolts detonated between them. The feeling of connection overpowered him, awed him. Physically, his body was wracked\u2014he labored to ease the pressure and claim his pleasure\u2014but he also needed to give his fated mate his seed, to leave something of himself inside her.</p><p>He gazed down at her face; her eyes were luminous, speaking to him in a language he didn\u2019t yet understand. \u201cRelease me, Melanthe!\u201d His voice was strangled, the pain unbearable.</p><p>Even as it felt so damned good.</p><p>In answer, she leaned up to kiss his neck. With her ethereal, blue sorcery coiling all around them, she licked his pulse point, the same way she\u2019d taken gold dust from him. It drove him just as crazy. When she started sucking on his neck, he wondered if she sought to unhinge him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll release you,\u201d she murmured against his skin, \u201conce you release me.\u201d</p><p>Comprehension hit his lust-addled brain. He had to bring her to orgasm before she\u2019d let him come.</p><p>He ran his arms behind her back, scooping her up, arching her breasts to him. His mouth grazed one nipple, then the other. He took them with his tongue, then his lips, rocking between her legs as he sucked.</p><p>Against one plump breast, he yelled, \u201cRelease me!\u201d Rocking, suckling, rocking her. Losing my mind.</p><p>\u201cThronos, I can\u2019t hold back any longer . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold back?\u201d This was all deliberate?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need . . . to get you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kiss\u2014take my lips!\u201d</p><p>Their heads shot forward, teeth clicking before he slanted his mouth over hers. Their tongues tangled, flicking licks. They traded breaths, her moans and his groans. She was thrashing against him as wildly as he plunged into her.</p><p>Just as he reached a crisis point\u2014when he couldn\u2019t think past pressure, and wetness, and heat\u2014she broke away to whisper at his ear, \u201cWhen you feel me coming around you . . . give me your seed.\u201d Sorcery swirled with her command.</p><p>Between gnashed teeth, he hissed, \u201cGods almighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you might want to cover my mouth, because you\u2019re about to make me scream.\u201d She held his gaze. \u201cThronos, now!\u201d</p><p>He used his palm to muffle her abandoned scream. Her back bowed beneath him, her little body surprising him with its strength.</p><p>His own body stilled, stunned when her sheath clenched him like a fist. To milk him of the seed he could finally provide? With that first contraction around him, his shaft gave an answering pulse, primed to ejaculate. His seal about to break.</p><p>His wings snapped wide as he began pounding between her legs with all his might.</p><p>Like an animal. Like a demon.</p><p>Then . . .</p><p>In a scalding rush, semen erupted. His hot essence for his mate alone.</p><p>Before his bellow shook the night, he sank his fangs into her neck, roaring against her skin.</p><p>Just before he\u2019d latched onto her neck, Thronos\u2019s starry eyes had turned black as night.</p><p>Then had come his fangs, claiming her flesh. When Lanthe had felt him marking her\u2014as a demon would\u2014sorcery exploded from her like a bomb blast.</p><p>Her orgasm ramped up all over again, until she was screaming into his palm, thrashing beneath him as he fucked like a piston. His cock forced its way even deeper inside her as he pumped his sizzling come into her.</p><p>As jet after jet of his seed filled her, his muscles tightened all around her, his claws digging into her skin, his wings shuddering.</p><p>Brutal, beautiful demon.</p><p>He thrust till he\u2019d emptied himself dry, till she\u2019d grown lax and dazed beneath him. . . .</p><p>He removed his hand from her mouth and collapsed atop her, releasing his bite with clear reluctance. As he licked his mark with his pointed tongue, he loosed a long groan of utter satisfaction.</p><p>Then he seemed to wake up. He rose on his arms above her. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Your bite might have hurt, but I was too busy coming to feel it.\u201d She nipped at his chest. \u201cYou were tender for as long as you could be.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed, lowering himself to his elbows. \u201cMore evidence that I\u2019m a demon, then? Lanthe, nothing could\u2019ve kept me from marking you as mine.\u201d He brushed her hair from her forehead. \u201cBut no other Vrekener males do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you know of. My skin will be healed by morning. Who\u2019s to know what we\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>He still looked uncertain, so she said, \u201cMaybe Pandemonia liberated the demon in you, but I don\u2019t care. Whatever you are\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter to me. What just happened was mind-blowing and shattering and perfect. I wouldn\u2019t change an instant of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The corners of his lips curled with pride. Such a guy.</p><p>\u201cI felt you coming.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother trying to keep the amazement out of his voice.</p><p>With a grin, she clenched her sheath around him; his eyes went wide.</p> <p>\u201cI felt you, too.\u201d She supposed she should be worried about him spilling inside her, but she was still high from their sex. She was addicted to this male. Not just physically, but . . . emotionally.</p><p>His honesty had affected her, coaxing her to lower all her guards. Tonight she\u2019d learned that, for her, trust was the strongest aphrodisiac.</p><p>His eyes gleamed with excitement. \u201cI always thought my seed would, I don\u2019t know, flow from me. I had no idea the pressure would be so intense. When it releases, it\u2019s almost . . . violent\u2014but in the best way.\u201d</p><p>Already his shaft stirred for more. She grinned, realizing her Vrekener was only getting warmed up for the night. \u201cSo, was I worth the wait? I talked a big game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d every right to, sorceress. Just as you said\u201d\u2014he dipped a kiss to her lips\u2014\u201cyou broke me down at a molecular level.\u201d</p> <p>FORTY-EIGHT</p><p>Thronos was a male transformed, with too many thoughts for his mind to handle, too many emotions to be contained.</p><p>He remained inside her, still hard. He could feel the dampness of his semen in her\u2014and that satisfied him so deeply. \u201cI never want to leave,\u201d he told her. Like him, she seemed in no hurry for their bodies to part. \u201cCan we sleep like this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI could lie over you. Though I think sleep would be the last thing we\u2019d be interested in. Speaking of which, when can you do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can do it as much as you like,\u201d he said with a thrust.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard all night.\u201d Her eyes were merry.</p> <p>He reached out, stroking his thumb over her silken cheek. She turned her head into his palm, drawing his thumb between her lips to suckle.</p><p>\u201cUhn.\u201d How could that enflame his entire body so fiercely? The jolt of sensation was startling\u2014not to mention the memories she conjured, of when she\u2019d sucked his shaft thus . . .</p><p>Now that he had seed to give her, would she take it between her lips? Spending semen like that was an offendment, but if Lanthe would drink, he\u2019d give and give till she\u2019d had her fill.</p><p>Just like that, he was desperate for her, his hips beginning to pump into her hot glove. When she released him with a last lick, he cupped her nape, drawing her closer\u2014</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she cried. \u201cLet me up, let me up.\u201d</p><p>He jerked back. \u201cHave I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoll onto your back.\u201d</p><p>With a frown, he did, reversing their positions.</p> <p>Once she was on top, she gracefully dismounted, leaving the sheet\u2019s opening to ring the base of his shaft.</p><p>She\u2019d turned the claiming sheet around on him.</p><p>His eyes widened at his rampant erection protruding from the sacred sheet. \u201cLanthe, this . . . this might be blasphemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it to me, and I\u2019ll do it to you. That\u2019s what our marriage will be like\u2014equal and a little subversive to both of our factions. But it\u2019ll work for us.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded. Though he was convinced, her certainty surprised him. \u201cWill it work for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on how much grief you give me about the freaking sheet.\u201d</p><p>Realization struck him with the force of an anvil. If they continued to make concessions for each other, they would not only be wed forever, but wed well. She\u2019d traveled here for him\u2014no other reason\u2014and she\u2019d surrendered much; he would meet her halfway. \u201cNo grief, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSo are we done with the sheet now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But only because we\u2019re married.\u201d He enjoyed saying that. \u201cIt\u2019s served its purpose.\u201d</p><p>She tugged the material off him, tossing it to a far corner of the bed. \u201cBack to business, then.\u201d With a smile, she straddled him, kneeling up above his shaft. \u201cSo, this is what I like to call Thronos and Lanthe\u2019s Pandemonian position.\u201d</p><p>His grin faded when she began to slip down his length. He could only stare as her sex swallowed him inch by torturous inch. . . .</p><p>Altering.</p><p>Once she\u2019d taken him as deep as he could go, he gazed up at his exquisite wife. Her hair was a glossy tangle all around her heartbreakingly lovely face, her sorcery shimmering. He dimly noted that her swollen nipples were the same shade as her curving lips.</p><p>While he beheld her, she\u2019d been gazing at him. \u201cLook how big and hard your body is. And it\u2019s all for me. The greedy sorceress in me is well pleased.\u201d</p><p>Gods, she made his chest bow with pride.</p><p>She rasped one of his nipples with a nail, and the jolt of pleasure was as unexpected as when she\u2019d suckled his thumb!</p><p>Then she pressed her hands on his shoulders to rise up. . . .</p><p>The night air cooled his heated testicles, the base of his wetted shaft. When his hips bucked, chasing her tight heat, she dropped down at the same time.</p><p>His eyes rolled back in his head.</p><p>He roused when she began to slowly ride him, her breasts bouncing for his enthralled gaze. Mesmerized by the way they moved, he fought the urge to knead them. \u201cSo damned lovely\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words were cut off. As she slipped up and down his length, she squeezed it\u2014from the inside.</p><p>\u201cLanthe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d she asked in a siren\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cNever want this to end!\u201d Part of him still disbelieved he was inside her. He realized it would take him a while to accept this turnaround.</p><p>To accept that his dream woman was in their bed sating her lusts with his body, as he did the same.</p><p>She bent her arms over her head, crossing her wrists as she snapped her hips. The way she writhed atop him robbed him of breath. Hypnotic female.</p><p>Her hands glided down, one to cup a breast, one to masturbate her sex. In the future, he would watch her self-pleasure; for now, he brushed that hand away. When he stroked the swollen bud with his forefinger, she threw back her head.</p><p>The ends of her hair tickled his thighs; added sensation for a male awash in it. The more he rubbed her sex, the harder she writhed. Rubbing her, petting . . . \u201cI grow nigh again!\u201d</p><p>She faced him. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything to stop you this time.\u201d</p><p>He grated, \u201cGood to know.\u201d He had another urge to contend with. The need to wrap his protective wings around her was overwhelming.</p><p>He\u2019d marked her with his horns\u2014and his fangs. She\u2019d accepted his most primal drives. So he leaned up to take her in his arms. As his wings closed around her, she grew even slicker, her tempo increasing.</p><p>\u201cI think you like my wings.\u201d</p><p>She nodded breathlessly. \u201cYou are such a surprise to me. Everything about you . . .\u201d</p><p>When he enfolded her against him, she wrapped her arms around his neck, and the satisfaction made him quake. It was just the two of them, cocooned against the world, bodies lit by his pulselines.</p><p>Her nipples raked up and down his chest. \u201cSo when I scream\u2014soon\u2014do you think anyone could hear me past your wings?\u201d</p><p>He rose up on his knees, cupping her ass. Pinned on his length, she tightened her legs around him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s how the others keep quiet? One way to find out.\u201d</p><p>In an urgent whisper, she told him, \u201cI\u2019m so close, Thronos.\u201d She leaned in to suck on his neck in that maddening way, bearing down on him at the same time. When he realized his mate was grinding her needy little bud against the base of his shaft, he spontaneously . . .</p><p>Came. Hard.</p><p>His roar reverberated within his wings as he bucked furiously against her, grinding back as he started pumping his seed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hot!\u201d She rode him faster, sending him into a frenzy. \u201cI\u2019m coming, Thronos! You make me feel so\u2014\u201d She tensed against him, her thighs trembling around his sides. Her head fell back against his wings, her climax wrenching a scream from her.</p><p>He experienced something like euphoria when her channel demanded its due once more. He eased his thrusts just to feel her spasms rippling up and down his length, her pleasure wringing his so perfectly.</p><p>He groaned his lingering disbelief. \u201cMy Lanthe . . .\u201d</p><p>When her orgasm subsided, he continued to quake\u2014as if his release had generated aftershocks.</p><p>With her head tucked against his shoulder, her breaths on his neck, she patted his heaving chest. \u201cThere. I claimed you too.\u201d</p><p>Late in the night, Lanthe and Thronos lay facing each other, wrapped in his wings. As they\u2019d done when young, they murmured secrets.</p><p>All those years ago, he\u2019d told her that he\u2019d be her husband. How right he\u2019d been!</p><p>Lanthe had been claimed. She\u2019d lost track of all the times he\u2019d taken her, how many times he\u2019d brought her over the edge.</p><p>The sheet separating them had been tossed by the wayside. All the sheets had. His wings kept them plenty warm.</p><p>Now, seeing him with his hair ruffled, looking relaxed and drowsy, made her heart ache.</p><p>\u201cWas it like you expected?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really, lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, as if searching for words. \u201cWhen we first met, I took your scent into me\u2014sky and home. When I\u2019m inside you, I feel like I\u2019ve found the sky for the first time, or returned home after an eternal absence. It\u2019s as if every want and need I\u2019ve ever had, or ever will have, is fulfilled. I hadn\u2019t expected the . . . totality of it.\u201d</p><p>Though his admission was one of the most moving things she\u2019d ever heard, he exhaled and said, \u201cI make little sense. Woman, you\u2019ve addled me.\u201d He turned the question on her. \u201cWas it like you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but in a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>How to explain what she\u2019d felt and learned? \u201cI discovered things tonight, Thronos. So many things.\u201d She stroked his hair from his forehead. \u201cI felt safe with you, connected to you. And those feelings heightened everything. It\u2019s addictive.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI feel the same. I sometimes wonder what I wouldn\u2019t do for more of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Let\u2019s put it this way\u2014I\u2019m so happy I took your hand earlier.\u201d</p><p>Even as his lips curled, his lids grew heavier. She\u2019d never seen him sleep. He hadn\u2019t in weeks, but now that he\u2019d released tension and was back in his own bed, she hoped he could. \u201cYou should rest.\u201d She motioned for him to go to his back, then draped herself over his chest. His strong arms twined around her. \u201cWe have a big day tomorrow.\u201d Words she\u2019d despaired of ever saying to a significant other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to sleep.\u201d He pulled her even closer to him. \u201cFear you won\u2019t be here when I wake.\u201d</p><p>His gruff words made the ache in her heart worse. \u201cWe\u2019re married now. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d And she meant it. He was her husband, her lover, her prince.</p><p>Thronos was her best friend.</p><p>Though she worried what tomorrow would bring, she believed in them.</p><p>As he was drifting off, he said, \u201cWith all my dreams having come true, what will I dream of now?\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn. Lanthe gazed at his face in sleep. I just fell in love with him.</p><p>FORTY-NINE</p><p>The brightest sunlight Lanthe had ever encountered blazed down on her. The harsh light of day\u2014and she had zero regrets. Still, she grumbled, \u201cI feel like Private Benjamin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know who that is, Lanthe.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the grin in his voice. \u201cTurn off the light!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t turn off the sun.\u201d</p><p>She cracked her eyes open to find him sitting at the edge of the bed, looking like a boss. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you happy with yourself?\u201d His smile was brilliant against his crisp linen shirt. Glorious male.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI woke this morning, disoriented, convinced last night had been a reverie. Then I gazed down and your head was upon my chest. I comprehended that we are wed.\u201d He gazed deeply into her eyes. \u201cThere has never been a better morning.\u201d</p><p>This was a world away from her typical morning-after scenarios. \u201cHow long have you been sitting there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of hours. I enjoy watching you sleep.\u201d</p><p>With anyone else, Lanthe would have found that creepy, but not with her new husband.</p><p>In any case, she couldn\u2019t talk since she\u2019d mooned over his relaxed, sleepy face until she\u2019d dozed off. Then she\u2019d been out like the dead. No nightmares. No restlessness.</p><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019m eager to introduce you to our people.\u201d</p><p>Bully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find you a grand breakfast. Apple tartlets, maybe? Or honey bread?\u201d</p><p>She was hungry. \u201cOkay, okay. I need a shower first.\u201d When she rose and knotted her hair above her head, his gaze fell on her breasts, his brows drawn tight. As she padded into the bathroom, she knew he was ogling her ass so she put an extra spring in her step.</p><p>His growl made her grin. She\u2019d wager she wasn\u2019t leaving this house before he took her again.</p><p>She checked her appearance in the mirror. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks pinkened. She felt a tinge of regret to see that his claiming mark had healed.</p><p>In the shower, she called, \u201cHey, can we get the hot water fixed?\u201d She\u2019d turned the single lever all the way right, but the water never approached warm.</p><p>\u201cIn the Territories, there is no hot water for showers,\u201d he called back.</p><p>To herself, she muttered, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shitting me.\u201d She sucked in a breath and stepped under, screeching, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right\u2014I didn\u2019t join the army!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He came to gloat, leaning against the doorway with a barely checked grin. \u201cWe Vrekeners find cold water\u2019s good for the mind and body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? That\u2019s a shame\u2014because hot water\u2019s good for morning sex.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered. \u201cI\u2019ll warm you up. . . .\u201d</p> <p>Some time later, when they emerged, Lanthe was a cold-water convert. Now she was grinning like a boss.</p><p>After she dried off, she reached for her clothes from the night before. Full regalia. Including the mask.</p><p>The beauty of metal and leather garments? Easy cleaning. She tugged on her skirt.</p><p>\u201cShall I find you some gowns?\u201d he asked as he dressed again.</p><p>She studied his face. \u201cYou can, but I won\u2019t wear them until I have them altered.\u201d Lanthe had lived through the Victorian age; out of necessity, she\u2019d learned how to transform a high-necked, floor-length, long-sleeved gown into a proper sleeveless minidress. Or, rather, to give directions for someone else to. \u201cI\u2019ll feel more comfortable in my own clothes.\u201d</p> <p>He parted his lips, hesitated, then said, \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Good man, she thought again. \u201cI feared we were about to have our first married fight.\u201d She slipped on her top. As far as Sorceri clothing went, the outfit wasn\u2019t even that provocative. Her hemline almost reached her knees. Her boots did, so little of her legs would be exposed.</p><p>\u201cI know how much you compromised to come here with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to meet you halfway. Besides, if you scream at me, it should only be because you\u2019re about to erupt/explode/die with ecstasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, later today?\u201d She reached forward to cup him between the legs, loving how he rocked on his toes to her hand.</p><p>When he groaned, she released him with an affectionate pat.</p><p>She donned her boots and gauntlets, then did a quick job braiding her hair. Thronos watched her every movement with undisguised fascination.</p> <p>\u201cGrab my necklace?\u201d</p><p>He hastened to get it, returning to lace it over her head. \u201cI kick myself for not giving you this sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we were a mite preoccupied with dragons and demons and pests and all. I treasure it as if you presented it to me\u2014since you put your life at risk to retrieve it. Even if it weren\u2019t silisk gold, it would always be my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorceri exchange rings with marriage, do they not?\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cYes, I want a ring! A gold one, with extra gold.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled. \u201cWhen my mate sets her heart on something, who am I to deny her?\u201d</p><p>With an answering grin, she slipped on her mask. \u201cOkay, then, let\u2019s go get this over with.\u201d</p><p>He offered his hand; she proudly took it.</p> <p>The moment they walked out the door, a Vrekener male greeted them, as if he\u2019d been loitering just outside. Tall and broad-shouldered, with a rangy build like Thronos\u2019s, he had olive-green eyes and sandy brown hair tied in a queue.</p><p>Lanthe stiffened when she saw his silvered talons. A knight. She wondered how many Sorceri he\u2019d killed. Or neutered?</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Jasen!\u201d Thronos said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone knew we\u2019d arrived.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe frowned at Jasen\u2019s reaction to Thronos; the male\u2019s pensive expression had turned to one of abject relief, the way one might look when handing over a ponderous weight\u2014or a rabid animal.</p><p>\u201cMelanthe, this is Jasen,\u201d he said, introducing the man to her first, showing her deference. \u201cJasen, this is Princess Melanthe, my bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . you have her.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe didn\u2019t offer her hand. Because it was glimmering blue behind her back.</p><p>After a moment, Jasen appeared to shake away his shock at this development. He turned to Thronos. \u201cMy liege, the knights have assembled in the Hall for an important security meeting. Will you attend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my brother here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my liege, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Thronos was calm and cool on the outside, but now that she knew him better she could see that his scars were a touch lighter, which meant his face was tense.</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m sorry, Thronos. I know you\u2019d wanted to get something settled with Aristo.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Gods only know what he\u2019s up to out in the worlds.\u2014 To Jasen, he said, \u201cMelanthe and I will attend.\u201d Hand in hand, they followed the knight down the steps to the sandy vale. \u2014In this assembly, I will not tolerate disrespect to you. Remember that you are their princess.\u2014</p><p>Talk about a trial by fire! She drew her sorcery close. \u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for me to go. What if the meeting is about my presence here? What if I\u2019m in danger?\u2014</p><p>He glanced at the power swirling around her. \u2014You can take care of yourself. Just try not to hurt anybody.\u2014</p><p>\u2014Ha.\u2014</p><p>\u2014You know I\u2019d slay them all before I let them touch a hair on your head.\u2014</p><p>On the hills above them, Vrekeners stopped their daily routines to stare down at her.</p><p>What would Sabine do in this situation? Her sister would put her shoulders back and never let anyone forget she was a noble daughter of the Sorceri. Lanthe would do no less. To those who stared the most boldly, she inclined her head with a regal air.</p><p>Of course, she could understand their interest. Her garments must shock them, plus she had sorcery around her. Not to mention her one-of-a-kind, priceless necklace. She defied any female not to secretly pine for it.</p><p>The Vrekener males all wore white lawn shirts and leather breeches. Each female\u2019s dress was drab and baggy, revealing only her face and hands. Their wings were pinned so tightly, one would think the Vrekeners were embarrassed by them. These people absolutely looked like they had quiet, boring sex.</p><p>They were the anti-Sorceri.</p><p>But then, Thronos had once been too\u2014before she\u2019d gotten ahold of him. These Vrekeners had no idea that Hurricane Lanthe had just made landfall in the Skye. \u2014Are Vrekeners always so somber?\u2014 If she didn\u2019t know better, she might have thought someone had ensorcelled their land with misery.</p><p>To be fair, she would\u2019ve expected shrieks as mothers shoved their kids back into their weird roofless houses. But the people were steady and unflinching.</p><p>Unsmiling.</p><p>\u2014Not usually this tense. I\u2019m keen to find out what\u2019s going on.\u2014</p><p>The moment he\u2019d come within sight of his people, Thronos had clenched his jaw and worked not to limp, which must be killing him. She had used her powers on him last night; maybe she could try to help with his pain.</p><p>But pain obliteration was a command that could seriously backfire. As she debated the pros and cons, she realized what was missing from this picture. \u2014Where are the Sorceri?\u2014</p><p>\u2014Good question. I\u2019ll soon have answers for you.\u2014</p><p>Then the grand Skye Hall loomed over her and Thronos. Last night she\u2019d gazed upon it and marveled that she was that close to the seat of Vrekener power.</p><p>Now she was about to enter. Sabine would never believe it!</p><p>As Lanthe and Thronos climbed the stairs, his wings rippled, as if he was preparing for battle.</p><p>They entered what looked like an anteroom of sorts. The construction was awing, but she couldn\u2019t quite wrap her mind around it. Without a roof, it seemed like a ruin\u2014or an arena. Yet it was pristine.</p><p>From there, she and Thronos crossed through a double doorway into a larger room with a giant round table. Forty or so males were seated about it in backless chairs.</p><p>Shocker, it was a sausage fest. Not a single female knight. Ugh.</p><p>There was no throne or dais. The arrangement looked like one of those town-hall kinds of settings where royalty acted like they were just normal folks, and no one got elevated above others (though the royals were the ones whose heads would roll if shit went down).</p><p>All the males appeared astonished to see Melanthe.</p><p>\u201cMy wife and princess.\u201d Thronos held up her gauntleted hand. \u201cMelanthe of the Deie Sorceri.\u201d</p><p>She peered up at him, and her heart thudded. He gazed at her with absolute acceptance. My husband. When her sorcery sparked with her pleasure, several hawk-eyed gazes locked on it, but no one said a word. They probably assumed it was just sorcery left over\u2014after Thronos had harvested her power.</p><p>If so . . . psych!</p><p>The Vrekeners who recovered quickest shot to their feet, in respect for their prince at least. The ones who hadn\u2019t stood received a murderous look from Thronos until they did.</p><p>\u201cMy wife and I are eager to hear news of the realm.\u201d</p><p>When all the males took a step away from the table and began to kneel, Thronos\u2019s scars grew even lighter\u2014and Lanthe got a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. . . .</p><p>FIFTY</p><p>My brother is dead.</p><p>These males would kneel before only one male in this domain or any other. Their king.</p><p>Thronos said one word: \u201cAristo?\u201d</p><p>Jasen answered, \u201cHe has recently passed on, my liege. I apologize for not saying something earlier, but I couldn\u2019t reveal any details out of the assembly. And there is . . . much to be explained.\u201d</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m sorry, Thronos.\u2014 Melanthe looked as shocked as he felt.</p><p>Working to make his tone even, Thronos said, \u201cBe seated.\u201d He led her to a chair, taking the one beside her. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was murdered,\u201d Jasen said. \u201cBy the king of the Deathly Ones demonarchy.\u201d</p><p>Murdered?</p><p>\u201cThere is no king of that demonarchy,\u201d Melanthe said. \u201cI\u2019m friends with Bettina, their princess. She\u2019s half Sorceri. As of a few weeks ago, she was unwed.\u201d</p><p>Jasen told her, \u201cWe understand that the male who wed their princess is a Dacian vampire who won her in a recent tournament.\u201d</p><p>Thronos cast her a questioning glance. \u2014Dacians actually exist? I thought they were a myth.\u2014</p><p>\u2014I\u2019ve always believed they did. Thronos, I fear we\u2019ve been gone for longer than we thought.\u2014</p><p>\u2014As do I.\u2014 Aloud, he asked the others, \u201cWhat reason had this king to murder another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are those who say the act was purportedly carried out in retaliation for some perceived violence done to his Bride.\u201d</p><p>Thronos frowned at Jasen. \u201cPerceived violence?\u201d Compared to Melanthe\u2019s straight-from-the hip talk, this deferential speak grated.</p><p>With regret on her face, she told him, \u201cA few months ago, Bettina was attacked by four Vrekeners. Though she\u2019s a young, ninety-five-pound waif who\u2019s never harmed anyone, they broke every bone in her body. Then they doused her with spirits, about to burn her alive. She was rescued just in time.\u201d</p><p>He recalled Melanthe telling him that she and Sabine weren\u2019t the only ones brutalized. Thronos expected denials from the knights. Any second the warrior males would staunchly reject the idea that a Vrekener could be capable of such a craven act.</p><p>The silence that reigned gave Thronos chills.</p><p>All eyes turned to Jasen to continue. Thronos supposed the male had assumed the role of leader in the absence of a king, which was surprising. Thronos would\u2019ve expected Cadmus, their general knight of war, to lead. Yet Cadmus sat quietly, as if biding his time.</p><p>Jasen said, \u201cThe vampire took your brother and three of his knights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom where?\u201d</p><p>Around the table, eyes darted.</p><p>\u201cFrom here. The male traced to Skye Hall.\u201d</p><p>A leech had located this kingdom. \u201cHow is that possible? A vampire can only trace to a place he\u2019s previously been. And what about our wards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no idea how he did it\u2014or if he\u2019ll lead more vampires or demons back here. We\u2019ve posted extra sentries.\u201d</p><p>Hidden guards. So that was who\u2019d watched Thronos last night.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready to take more action. My liege, this has understandably sent shockwaves through the populace.\u201d</p><p>All Thronos had wanted to do was wed Lanthe and come to an understanding with Aristo, or to endeavor to. Now . . .</p><p>I am king. The last of his line.</p><p>He could scarcely process that his brother was dead\u2014and that the welfare of all these people rested on his shoulders. \u201cWhy would the vampire target my brother so specifically?\u201d</p><p>Jasen said, \u201cThere might . . . there\u2019s a chance King Aristo was one of the four who inflicted those injuries upon Princess Bettina, not understanding who she was.\u201d</p><p>His brother might have tortured a tiny young sorceress, intending to burn her alive. Aristo\u2019s voice sounded in his head: \u201cDeath to every last one of them!\u201d Though Thronos felt like he couldn\u2019t get enough air, he fought to keep his expression neutral.</p><p>\u201cMy liege, there\u2019s more. The vampire stole your brother\u2019s fire scythe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a grievous loss, but there are three others.\u201d And Thronos didn\u2019t intend for the knights to use the scythes for sorcery harvesting in the future.</p><p>Because my word will be law.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire turned it over to Morgana. She perverted its purpose, using it to loose the powers from the vault. She has reclaimed them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe emptied the vault?\u201d What else could she do with a scythe?</p><p>Jasen nodded. \u201cShe sent some of the powers out into the ether to reach their original possessors. We know this because a few of the Sorceri here received theirs.\u201d</p><p>Melanthe asked, \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey fled. As far as we can tell, one of them reclaimed a teleportation ability. The rest left with him.\u201d</p><p>Fled. So they had been as miserable as Melanthe had said, escaping at the first opportunity.</p><p>Thronos gazed at her. \u2014You were right. About everything.\u2014</p><p>Lanthe didn\u2019t necessarily want to be right, now that she\u2019d signed on for life above the clouds. Nor was she pleased about being queen of the Vrekeners. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Queen of any other faction? Sure, why not!</p><p>But these people?</p><p>Another male rose to speak, another knight. Melanthe didn\u2019t like the looks of him. He was waxy-skinned with light hair and eyes. He had one of the beefier builds among the males. Where the other Vrekeners struck her as still-waters-run-deep types, this guy seemed smarmy\u2014like some of the Sorceri courtiers she\u2019d known.</p> <p>\u201cMy liege, four factions of the Lore have declared war on us. If we count the Sorceri\u2019s age-old declaration, that brings the total to five.\u201d</p><p>Just weeks ago, Lanthe would\u2019ve been heartened by this development. Now she was part of the us.</p><p>Even when Thronos was faced with this news, his shoulders remained squared. And she wanted to kiss him for it. \u201cTell me, Cadmus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rage demons, the House of Witches, the Dacians, and not unexpectedly the Deathly Ones.\u201d Though conveying distressing news, Cadmus sounded almost thrilled.</p><p>Did war turn him on?</p> <p>Thronos\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do we know about these enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as we\u2019d like, my liege,\u201d Jasen answered. Lanthe supposed that Vrekener wasn\u2019t too bad. Compared to Cadmus, Jasen struck her as a levelheaded font of reason. \u201cThe Dacians live in a secreted realm, but they have very recently begun opening up communications with outside factions. Their newly crowned king is Lothaire, the Enemy of Old.\u201d</p><p>Lothaire? Like a bad penny!</p><p>Thronos turned to her. \u201cYou know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. If we can deliver a missive to him, I will try to establish a dialogue.\u201d</p><p>Thronos told her, \u201cWe have a station on the ground, with messengers awaiting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t know why he would declare war. It seems random.\u201d</p><p>Jasen answered, \u201cThe new king of the Deathly Ones is a Dacian royal. We believe Lothaire is backing his relative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected the rage demons to declare war,\u201d Thronos said. Because of me. \u201cNow it becomes clear why the Deathly Ones and the Dacians have. But what of the House of Witches? Are they not in the Vertas alliance? The House has always maintained an uneasy truce with the Vrekeners, no matter how closely their faction is related to the Sorceri.\u201d</p><p>Historically, witches and Sorceri hadn\u2019t been chummy. Unlike Lanthe and Carrow.</p><p>Cadmus shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why they call us enemy.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe did. She\u2019d bet Carrow had survived the island and was still trying to get Lanthe\u2019s back. I knew I liked that witch.</p><p>Cadmus said, \u201cIt\u2019s my recommendation that we strike back against the vampire who stole into our kingdom, sending Vrekener might to crush the Deathly Ones. If the Dacians want a war, we can give them a reckoning.\u201d</p><p>Thronos intoned, \u201cYou\u2019re quick to want war for a kingdom in flux.\u201d</p> <p>Cadmus\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cKing Aristo was given no death rites\u2014because the vampire made a gift of your brother\u2019s head to the princess in that sick demon tournament,\u201d he said, again seeming to relish delivering the gruesome news.</p><p>Lanthe squeezed Thronos\u2019s hand. He had to be freaking inside, but he appeared undaunted.</p><p>Turning to Cadmus, she said, \u201cYou want to crush the Deathly Ones? Those demons garner strength with each kill they make. In other words, they get more powerful as a war drags on. Plus, their kingdom is specifically warded against Vrekeners. As for the Dacians, they\u2019re fairly much supervampires, with unearthly might and cunning. Lothaire alone is millennia old.\u201d And immortals grew stronger with age.</p><p>\u201cThe Sorceri seek to war with us,\u201d Cadmus said, addressing Thronos as if Lanthe hadn\u2019t even spoken. \u201cYet now we have one of them as queen? How can we be sure where her loyalties lie?\u201d</p><p>Oh, it\u2019s on. \u201cMy loyalties lie with Thronos,\u201d Lanthe declared. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything within my power to protect him and his interests.\u201d \u2014By the way, Cadmus is an asshole.\u2014</p><p>\u2014We are in agreement.\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo the sorceress says now.\u201d</p><p>Blue light began to swirl around her just as Thronos snapped, \u201cYour queen has spoken, and you will not doubt her.\u201d</p><p>Cadmus choked out a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not residual sorcery flowing from her. You left her empowered?\u201d Others looked stunned by this as well. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve felt her very sorcery compelling me against my will?\u201d</p><p>What was this tool talking about? \u2014When has he felt my sorcery?\u2014</p><p>\u2014He was with me in Louisiana when we ambushed you last year. Jasen as well.\u2014</p><p>Oops.</p><p>Cadmus pounded his fist on the table. \u201cShe must be disempowered to walk freely in our realm. It\u2019s the law!\u201d</p><p>In an eerily calm voice, Thronos said, \u201cObviously I just changed that law, General Cadmus. Get up to speed.\u201d</p><p>When Cadmus looked like he was about to go off, Jasen hastily said, \u201cWe have burdened our regents with much unwelcome news.\u201d He turned to them. \u201cYour new apartments in the Hall have been readied.\u201d</p><p>Thronos hesitated, so she said: \u2014Cadmus will get what\u2019s coming to him. But for right now, Thronos, our army of two needs to regroup off the battlefield.\u2014</p><p>With a kingly air, he stood. \u201cI\u2019ve much to think about. We\u2019ll reconvene later.\u201d</p><p>As she and Thronos walked from the assembly room, again hand in hand, the knights lined the aisle, lifting their wings above it like an arc of swords. Even Cadmus.</p><p>She might enjoy Thronos\u2019s wings; didn\u2019t mean she could tolerate anyone else\u2019s.</p><p>\u2014Easy, Lanthe.\u2014</p><p>She held her breath until she\u2019d gotten out from under those jagged flares and glinting talons. . . .</p><p>The adjoining royal residence was built on a higher protrusion of rock, a wide stairwell leading to it. Inside, there were more roofless rooms and they were larger, but the space was still fairly bare.</p><p>As Thronos showed her around, his thoughts obviously preoccupied, she removed her gauntlets, settling in. Home sweet home.</p><p>He escorted her to a balcony, stopping just short of it. \u201cFrom this height, you can see all the way to the edge of the island. I don\u2019t want you to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared when you\u2019re around.\u201d At the risk of sounding mushy . . . sustaining a fear of heights was difficult when she knew he would always catch her.</p><p>He led her to the railing, then draped a protective arm around her shoulders.</p><p>In the distance, the blindingly blue sky was dotted with other islands, each with its own city. Below them, a thunderstorm hovered, lightning flashing.</p><p>The sight was remarkable, but she and Thronos had work to do. She turned to survey his face. \u201cI was proud of you in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what reason could you possibly be proud?\u201d He led her back inside, heading for a sitting area.</p><p>\u201cThough you were repeatedly kicked in the ballbag, you didn\u2019t look like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerception is important. When Omort\u2019s rule crumbled, it was because no one believed in him any longer. His powers were still intact, godlike even, but he lost his followers through his behavior, his lack of leadership. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m telling you this, but . . . these Vrekeners need a strong king right now. They need you.\u201d</p><p>He let out a breath. \u201cI never wanted to be king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always dreamed of being a Vrekener queen.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow at that. \u201cAnd what about now\u2014can I look as though I\u2019ve been repeatedly kicked in the ballbag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me, of course.\u201d</p><p>He sank into a chair, rubbing his swollen leg. Then her upstanding Vrekener muttered, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>She pulled up a chair beside him, leaning in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right all along. Things are not as I\u2019d imagined them. I had this idea of black and white, and now I\u2019m immersed in gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret that you lost your sibling\u201d\u2014best she could muster\u2014\u201cbut you\u2019ll make a great king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Aristo is gone. I know he did evil things\u2014he hurt you\u2014yet I\u2019m still conflicted. Just when I add one member to my family, I lose another.\u201d He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cWas he the one who did those things to Queen Bettina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me that she thought the group acted with impunity, as if they were outside of the normal Vrekener command. Who besides Aristo would dare such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe him capable of such an act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d seen him as my sister and I have . . .\u201d</p><p>Thronos shut his eyes. \u201cDid Cadmus speak the truth about my brother\u2019s ultimate fate?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s likely. The Deathly Ones are a warrior breed. If the vampire was trying to impress them, that would be just the way. Plus, he was probably venting some serious rage. The vampire\u2019s young Bride was . . . savaged.\u201d</p><p>Thronos opened his eyes. \u201cHow did Aristo become like that? Your brother was destined to become evil, but mine seems to have rushed headlong toward it.\u201d</p><p>She had no answer for him. He didn\u2019t seem to expect one.</p><p>He motioned for her to come to him; she gladly went into his arms, sitting on his lap. \u201cI\u2019m the last of my line, Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter last night, there\u2019s a chance\u2014slim to none, but still a chance\u2014that you aren\u2019t.\u201d Lanthe\u2019s overwrought biological clock gave a sigh of hope.</p><p>Thronos stared at her with eyes gone silver. Kind of like he loved her. Then he said, \u201cHow am I to fix all that my brother\u2019s broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this. My sister is very good friends with Bettina. We can extend an offer of peace to the Deathly Ones. You might have to apologize on behalf of your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019m bloody eager to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to get her to the table. She kind of became a shut-in after her attack. If you even utter the word Vrekener, she runs away, sobbing and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s an upside. Bettina\u2019s not only a gold fanatic like me, she\u2019s a goldsmith. She would do just about anything for this.\u201d Lanthe held up the silisk medallion. \u201cSo we\u2019ll offer it as a present to celebrate peace between our factions. Depending on how much sway she has over her new king, this could be a lock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me earlier that the necklace is your favorite. You\u2019d give up your most treasured gold for the Vrekeners? For this kingdom?\u201d</p><p>She made a scoffing sound. \u201cNot in a million years. But I\u2019d give it up for you. Because that\u2019s what we do\u2014we save each other\u2019s asses.\u201d She let that sink in. \u201cSo by neutralizing the Deathly Ones, we\u2019ll be taking care of the Dacians as well. As for the House of Witches, I think that\u2019s all Carrow. The good news is that she survived the island. The bad news is that the last she saw of us wasn\u2019t . . . ideal.\u201d When Thronos had been dragging Lanthe down a tunnel as she\u2019d spat and cussed.</p><p>Thronos winced at the memory. \u201cLanthe, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you can make that up to me by biting your tongue when you first meet my sister. For now, we can\u2019t worry about anything other than getting this kingdom out of the crosshairs. I\u2019ll write to Carrow and explain to her that I\u2019m with you voluntarily. Same with the rage demons. The only reason Rydstrom declared war is that he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m in Skye Hall of my own volition.\u201d She frowned. \u201cDid I really just say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re to be my ambassador queen?\u201d Thronos curled his finger under her chin. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to fight my battles.\u201d</p><p>She leveled her gaze on his. \u201cWe are partners. We\u2019ll be co-ruling this joint, and we\u2019ll play to our strengths. I\u2019m pretty good at stuff like this. N\u00efx said that I was to shine in this realm. So just let the sorceress do like she do.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled a long breath. \u201cThen I\u2019m heartened. And grateful for my co-ruler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s one faction that I can\u2019t guarantee. My own. If Morgana drained the powers from the vault, she will have kept the choice ones. She was already a force in the Lore before, so I can only imagine how dangerous she\u2019s become.\u201d</p><p>In the past, Morgana had been impossible to reason with. Her ego was so colossal, it outstripped even Sabine\u2019s. And now that Morgana\u2019s adversary Dorada had risen, who knew how the queen would react about anything?</p><p>\u201cI can extend an olive branch,\u201d Lanthe said, \u201cletting her know that Skye Hall is under new management, and that fifty percent of the royals here are Sorceri. But I make no promises. She\u2019s about as predictable as Emberine. Thronos, she could strike down everyone here with a snap of her fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming she can find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the vampire breached these wards, what\u2019s to stop him from teaching Morgana how to do the same? We already know the two were working together to some degree since he gave her the fire scythe. Morgana won\u2019t stop until the vampire tells her everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be so bent on reaching us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to heap bad news upon bad news, but Bettina is her ward. One of the few people in existence that Morgana cares about. Now that Bettina\u2019s married a Dacian royal vampire, I don\u2019t see how your brother could have targeted a worse victim.\u201d Aristo had screwed up, well, royally.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your presence here? Will that not influence your queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she thinks I\u2019ve been abducted and brainwashed. Even if I convinced her I\u2019m here by choice, I\u2019m only one among her many subjects. She and Sabine have a bond of sorts, but Morgana wouldn\u2019t forgo any of her plans for Sabine\u2014and definitely not for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps if I make amends to Bettina, it would lessen Morgana\u2019s hostility?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe shook her head. \u201cIt infuriates Morgana that this place is hidden, that she\u2019s been unable to retaliate for all the harm done to her subjects. She\u2019d love to strip the wards here completely, leaving the Territories defenseless. Imagine if she enlisted Portia and Emberine. These islands are made of rock. Portia could send them colliding like bumper cars. Emberine is packing the firepower\u2014literally\u2014of dozens of fire demons. She\u2019d be lying in wait to burn anyone who thought to escape to the air.\u201d</p><p>With Lanthe\u2019s every word, Thronos grew more tense. She hated that, but she wouldn\u2019t sugarcoat the problem.</p> <p>Or hide the sheer magnitude of it.</p><p>\u201cThere are other Sorceri with powers just as catastrophic,\u201d she said. \u201cMorgana doesn\u2019t even have to get them to sign on\u2014she can simply control them. That\u2019s her sorceress power: the ability to control others\u2019 powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they attacked in that manner, humans would be able to detect us,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSome Loreans don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sorceress in me is wondering how all these Vrekeners can get scarce really quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, the idea of fleeing completely foreign to a warrior like him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an evacuation plan in effect? Everybody, even the strongest species, needs a contingency, a plan B, a rabbit hole.\u201d A harsh reality she\u2019d learned by running from Vrekeners. Fate is weird. \u201cIs there some place where these people could go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the Territories reside over Canada, there\u2019s a remote forest we visit to hunt. A permanent fog bank cloaks the tops of the trees, so some have built cabins in the mist. It\u2019s an outpost of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Maybe we could head that way? Oh, and can you and your guys devise a security alarm of sorts? Like a first-warning system that would encompass all the islands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She stood, cracking her knuckles. \u201cWe\u2019ve got shit to do. I need pen and paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParchment and quill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I know you were going to say that?\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-ONE</p><p>SPLAT.</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Another inkblot on an official Vrekener queen document. Lanthe laid down her quill and examined her stained fingers. She looked like she\u2019d been finger painting.</p><p>Occupational hazard, she supposed, now that she was pretty much the royal letter writer. For the last five days, her quill (because of course it was a quill) had been her sword.</p><p>Lanthe wasn\u2019t saying she\u2019d do murder for a Bic; but she wasn\u2019t not saying that either.</p> <p>Her first letter had been to Sabine. In it, she\u2019d vowed to gold that things were well and that she was happy to have wed Thronos. She\u2019d written that she was now a queen and included a plea to get Morgana to enter into talks with her.</p><p>Lanthe had known there was a risk in sounding like she adored it up here\u2014everyone would think she\u2019d been brainwashed\u2014so she\u2019d tried to sound as much like herself as possible.</p><p>She\u2019d had that letter delivered immediately. Then she\u2019d set about contacting all the factions who\u2019d declared war on them.</p><p>To Carrow, she\u2019d explained that Thronos had turned out to be a wonderful surprise.</p><p>Kind of like Malkom Slaine turned out for you, if I\u2019m not mistaken? Do you remember how everyone in the prison cell disbelieved you\u2019d wed him, but you refused to deny it? Though no one will believe I willingly married Thronos, I need you to. So, a couple of things, Crow: Say hi to Ruby, and please get the witches to back off.</p><p>To Bettina, she\u2019d written:</p><p>The old Vrekener king was a vicious fiend who got what he deserved. Kudos to your new vamp husband for a well-played assassination and tournament victory.</p><p>Lanthe had also written that the new Vrekener king would like to personally make amends to Bettina with a gift of priceless dragon gold.</p><p>In her letter to Lothaire, Lanthe had reintroduced herself, then related that heaven was under new management. The Vrekeners wanted only peace with the Dacians, so could the two factions reach an accord? She hoped the missive would get to the Enemy of Old; the contact details for the newly revealed kingdom of Dacia were sketchy. But Thronos had a trusted knight who had yet to fail on a delivery.</p><p>She\u2019d also written to N\u00efx:</p><p>From Nereus\u2019s bedroom window (don\u2019t ask), I saw Furie, trapped at the bottom of the ocean. She\u2019s alive and doing as well as can be expected\u2014i.e., cataclysmically bad. I assume you and the Valks are going to bring the pain to Sargasoe soon? P.S. We sure could use some foresight up here in the Skye.</p><p>With all those letters written, Lanthe had struggled with a more lengthy explanation for her sister. She\u2019d started\u2014then wadded up\u2014more than a dozen of them. She hadn\u2019t been able to decide how much to reveal of her past with Thronos.</p><p>It was one thing to tell her big sister to her face: \u201cWell, I kind of misled you for centuries.\u201d It was quite another to write it out.</p><p>How to explain what Thronos had come to mean to her?</p><p>Yesterday she\u2019d decided to start from the beginning, the day she\u2019d first met him. Now it was late afternoon, and she\u2019d only just gotten to the\u2014heavily edited\u2014faux Feveris part. She\u2019d given herself a deadline of one more day. . . .</p><p>She gazed up from her desk, scanning the sky for Thronos. He\u2019d be home soon to take her to the bastion for dinner.</p><p>He\u2019d been meeting with his knights, tirelessly strategizing their defenses and implementing their new evacuation plan. Yesterday they\u2019d organized their first drill. There\u2019d been some hiccups, so today, they planned to \u201ccalibrate\u201d things.</p><p>His body was paining him until he could barely conceal the agony in front of others. The stress of leading a realm on the brink of war wasn\u2019t helping anything. He was exhausted from all his duties, exhausted from his conflicted grief.</p><p>In Pandemonia, he\u2019d told her that when he\u2019d realized his father had killed her parents, he\u2019d looked up at the man and seen a stranger. He felt the same way about his brother\u2014</p><p>She heard the now familiar swoop of Thronos\u2019s wings. When she was with him and they were able to close out the world, life could be sublime. When she wasn\u2019t with him . . . not so much. Unable to hide her customary jolt of excitement, she leapt up from the desk. \u201cYou\u2019re home\u2014\u201d</p><p>He seized her hand. Without a word, he headed straight for their bedroom to fall face-first atop the bed\u2014his big body was like a tree gone timber.</p><p>\u201cYour day was that good, huh?\u201d She climbed onto the bed, rucking up her skirt. \u201cScooch your wings.\u201d When he parted them, she straddled the small of his back.</p><p>He turned his face to the side. \u201cI had more fun with the pest.\u201d Clearly, he was not in the mood to go dine with others right now.</p><p>Oh, darn. They\u2019d have to miss eating in the grim dining hall? Not a problem. She\u2019d been stockpiling fruit, surprisingly tasty breads, and divine cheeses\u2014for just such an occasion.</p><p>When she began to knead his muscles, he gave a deep groan. \u201cYou\u2019re a gods-send, lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said though she\u2019d just gotten ink prints all over the back of his shirt. Oops. \u201cUm, how did the calibration go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alarm does work. Unfortunately, the only place to trigger it is in the Hall. Every island needs this ability to sound the alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll come.\u201d She pressed her thumbs round and round into his fatigued muscles.</p><p>\u201cTell me your day was better than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine was okay.\u201d Lanthe found it funny to be having this \u201cHow was your day, dear?\u201d conversation with him. As if they were a long-wed couple.</p><p>But the two of them had started to fall into rhythms. Each night after dinner, they assailed each other\u2014even if he\u2019d managed to drop in a few times over the day. During those stolen daytime trysts, he\u2019d take her hard against the wall or atop her desk, with his hand over her mouth to mute her desperate moans. He\u2019d sink his fangs into his forearm to stifle his own bellows.</p><p>Every time he brought her release, he grew more sexually confident. More cocky.</p><p>Which was hot as hell.</p><p>If he came before her, he\u2019d drop down and use his mouth to bring her over the edge. The first time he\u2019d done this, she\u2019d cried, \u201cOh! Ohhh . . .\u201d and felt obligated to say something before he tasted his own seed.</p><p>He\u2019d answered, \u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable. Throughout every day and night, I will fill your sheath and kiss it at every opportunity. Besides, it\u2019s me mingled with you\u2014never deny me that.\u201d</p><p>Wicked, pervy Vrekener.</p><p>Once the worst of their need had been slaked, they would read correspondence together. He always wanted her opinion on things. More than once he\u2019d told her, \u201cWhen you said you wanted to co-rule, I took that very seriously. Tell me what you think. . . .\u201d</p><p>Now he asked her, \u201cDid you pick up your new clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did!\u201d Her second day here, she\u2019d realized that she needed lots of new garments, and that they should be fabulous since she was a queen and all. Even if her subjects were lame.</p><p>After giving designs for metal garments to the smithy, she\u2019d crashed a group\u2019s sewing circle with instructions for strapless dresses. Lanthe figured she would split the hemline difference with Thronos\u2014mini instead of micromini.</p><p>\u201cHow did the females treat you this time?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid they, um, throw \u2019tude?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been no pushback from the sewing circle\u2014by now everyone knew their sorceress queen could bespell them\u2014but Lanthe had gotten some attitude.</p><p>After she\u2019d faced down the females of Omort\u2019s court and vanquished a sorceress like Hettiah, those Vrekeners had been a cakewalk. \u201cNo, I shut that down.\u201d Remembering one of Sabine\u2019s favorite sayings\u2014if one shows me fear, he shows me respect\u2014Lanthe had returned the \u2019tude and then some.</p><p>In other words, her clothes had been rush-ready! The dresses were plain white, but when she wore them with the necklace . . .</p><p>Not too shabby.</p><p>Of course, her current dress was white\u2014and ink. \u201cAnything new about Aristo?\u201d Every day, more Vrekeners found the courage to divulge horror stories about the previous king and his three trusted knights. Those four had been a scourge on the Lore, hiding behind a cloak of righteousness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s everything you warned me of.\u201d</p><p>As king of a people who believed in chastity until marriage, total sobriety, and forthrightness in all instances, Aristo had kept several love nests, drunk like a fish, and lied about his behavior.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she would feel vindicated when Thronos comprehended these things. Instead she hurt for him. He was ashamed of his blood relative, feeling responsible.</p><p>\u201cThings can only get better, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, I got a response from Bettina today.\u201d The queen of the Deathly Ones had reported progress with her Vrekener phobia, but she\u2019d still been less than enthusiastic to meet with one.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t stopped Bettina from inquiring about the dragon gold. \u201cShe requested a detailed description of the medallion with a weight estimation and a photo if possible. So we\u2019ve got her on the hook. Go, peace!\u201d</p><p>Though his eyes remained closed, his lips curled. Yet then he tensed up again. \u201cI regret that you have to give up your treasure.\u201d</p><p>At least she\u2019d still have her silisk gold keys.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as things settle down here,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ll replace the medallion with something even greater.\u201d</p><p>Another queen might have said, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to do that, my goodly monarch, for I reap satisfaction just from assisting whenever I can.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe? She cried, \u201cOkay! And that has to be in addition to the ring you already promised me.\u201d She worked her hands to the edges of his broad shoulders, massaging there, making his wings ripple from pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDuly noted,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cAnd your letter to Sabine? How far have you gotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to Feveris. I might have spent a bit of time describing the gold temple. In any case, I want the Reader of Words to scan it before I send.\u201d She bent down and pressed a kiss to his neck. \u201cOur story\u2019s pretty epic.\u201d</p><p>But she had a chapter she wanted to add: the \u201cThronos\u2019s Eternal Pain Ends\u201d part. She couldn\u2019t change the past, couldn\u2019t magically transform their current circumstances\u2014but could she make his old injuries better?</p><p>She\u2019d hesitated to use power on him; ensorcelling his pain away would be a huge risk. For instance, in combat he might need pain to recognize how bad an injury was, or to remind him of blood loss so he could adjust his tactics for weakness.</p><p>Lanthe would have to straight-up heal him. Though she\u2019d become an expert at this when she was a girl, she hadn\u2019t needed to use those commands for ages.</p><p>Plus, back then, Sabine hadn\u2019t been frozen into her immortality yet; she\u2019d been more . . . malleable.</p><p>With Thronos, Lanthe would need to take her time. An unresisting patient would be ideal.</p><p>Her sorcery heated the air when she whispered at his ear, \u201cSleep, Thronos.\u201d He passed out at once, body gone lax on the bed.</p><p>She rose to remove his boots, inspecting his lower right leg. The muscles on the inside of his ankle were contorted, as if he\u2019d sprained them to a supernatural degree. Even with his body at rest, the tendons were knotted so tightly, they pulled his foot inward.</p><p>His calf was equally bad. She probed the bunched muscles with her fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Total healing? She cracked her knuckles. She had to at least try.</p><p>Blue sorcery began to shimmer in her ink-stained palms as she brushed them over his flesh. \u201cHeal,\u201d she commanded as she massaged him.</p><p>Heat sprang from her hands, seeping into him. She could see currents of it beneath his skin, blue swirls. \u201cHeal.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath her fingertips, she felt the tiniest twinge. Had some tension eased?</p><p>Massaging. Sorcery. Massaging. \u201cHEAL.\u201d</p><p>His muscles . . . started to relax! His foot was returning to a normal resting position!</p><p>With a delighted laugh, she turned to his left wing. She grasped the gnarled joint, repeating the process. \u201cHeal.\u201d</p><p>In a rush, his wing scales rippled, like a racetrack betting board refreshing. With a snap, Thronos\u2019s skewed mosaics settled back into their natural spellbinding alignment.</p> <p>She lovingly traced the pads of her fingertips over those metallic scales. After repeating the same treatment on his right wing, she surveyed the rest of his big body.</p><p>If she knew her Vrekener, she\u2019d bet he had other aches that he would never mention. So she gave him a sorcery-powered full-body massage.</p><p>Because he was a transitioned immortal, she didn\u2019t know if these changes would stick. Most alterations on an immortal, such as a tattoo, would disappear within a day or so. But as long as her sorcery was flowing, she could do this every day.</p><p>Time to find out how her patient was doing. . . .</p><p>Thronos roused from a deep, ensorcelled sleep.</p><p>He shot to his feet, scowling at Melanthe. \u201cDamn it, woman, why would you knock me out?\u201d</p> <p>Wait. Having bounded out of bed with no care\u2014as opposed to his usual gradual rising\u2014he should be feeling a chorus of anguish starting in his feet, shooting through his legs and torso, stabbing into his back and neck, before clawing through his wings.</p><p>Where is the pain?</p><p>He frowned down at his feet; they lined up perfectly. A sight he hadn\u2019t seen in ages.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d she remarked from the bed, buffing her nails.</p><p>He tentatively unfurled his wings, groaning with relief. Holding his breath, he tried to pin them . . .</p><p>They folded and compressed, just as they were supposed to. \u201cHow? How is this possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanthe\u2019s Sorcery Massage. Tee-em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what tee-em means,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cYou fixed my pain?\u201d</p> <p>Her own smile faded. In a voice laced with sadness, she said, \u201cThe least I could do since I gave it to you.\u201d</p><p>And then she took it away. In no imagining had he dared to envision this. \u201cYour powers are growing, lamb.\u201d</p><p>He felt no pain; she was regenerating her abilities. They were both healing from the wounds of the past. He would allow no sadness on this night.</p><p>The Sorceri were right: dwelling on the past injured the present.</p><p>\u201cThronos, I don\u2019t know if this is permanent. But I can do it every day if I have to\u2014\u201d She didn\u2019t get to finish because he\u2019d already taken her into his arms, and into the air.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She rested her head on his chest, her braids dancing over him. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>He swooped his wings as hard as he could, taking them far from the Hall, from worries, from responsibilities. Under the stars, he couldn\u2019t contain a laugh. \u201cI feel no pain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might only last a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll have to massage me daily?\u201d Her hands all over him? Just like that, he was stiff for her. \u201cLucky me. But I must be awake next time. And I\u2019d prefer to be on my back, sorceress.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze glittered as her hand dipped. She parted her lips when she found him fully erect. \u201cTake me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time like the present.\u201d He adjusted her to their Pandemonian position, with her legs around his waist and his arms clasped securely around her.</p><p>\u201cIn the air?\u201d Her eyes widened with excitement. \u201cMy weird, pervy Vrekener. I love it!\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-TWO</p><p>Thronos was barely listening as Jasen and Cadmus argued over further security. A group of knights had met on one of the outermost islands, assessing weaknesses\u2014and quarreling about defenses.</p><p>Thronos and Melanthe had been here only a week, but already the kingdom was more secure. He and the knights had implemented a successful alarm. In time, they\u2019d install an emergency lever on every island. For now, Vrekener sentries patrolled the perimeter of the entire realm.</p><p>As a plan B, Thronos had ordered that the Territories begin their inexorable journey toward the Vrekeners\u2019 forest outpost. After days over the ocean, they\u2019d passed the tip of Greenland and were now crossing a wintry gulf far in the northeast of North America.</p><p>At first, the idea of an evacuation system\u2014and an unscheduled move\u2014had sat ill with the assembly. At least until Thronos had described some of the Sorceri power he\u2019d witnessed on the Order\u2019s island.</p><p>Jasen agreed with Thronos that the Vrekeners couldn\u2019t have enough measures in place.</p><p>Cadmus believed that his king was discounting the might of their warriors\u2014because Cadmus had never met a being like Portia and could never conceive what she was capable of until he\u2019d seen it with his own eyes.</p><p>On the one hand, Thronos had to convince others how malevolent some Sorceri could be. On the other, he wanted them to respect his queen and worked ceaselessly to smooth her way among his people. He\u2019d been quick to tell the assembly of Melanthe\u2019s part in the assassination of Omort. He\u2019d lauded all her work to neutralize threats from other factions.</p><p>Already, the House of Witches had declared peace. Once Bettina of the Deathly Ones had received Melanthe\u2019s description of the red gold medallion, she\u2019d promptly agreed to future talks.</p><p>The Dacian ruler, Lothaire, had responded with a terse missive written in blood:</p><p>Vrekeners actually exist?</p><p>L, The King</p><p>Which might have been a joke? Thronos decided it was a good sign.</p><p>As for the rage demons, Rydstrom had written Thronos a personal message that still left him grinding his teeth. . . .</p><p>Thronos,</p><p>You are fucking up mightily, son.</p><p>My queen and I received Melanthe\u2019s letter, and based on your history with her, we can find no truth in it.</p><p>Gods only know what you\u2019re doing to my sister-in-law up there. Release her within the week, or court war with all of my vast kingdom.</p><p>Since I know Lanthe is your mate, I also know that you\u2019ll never release her, despite my threats. If anyone had tried to force me to relinquish Sabine, I would\u2019ve laughed in his face.</p><p>The only thing that can save us from bloody conflict is if Lanthe convinces her sister that she is with you of her own free will.</p><p>Your best bet is to make your mate so deliriously happy that she can give a glowing\u2014and believable\u2014report. If you\u2019re willing to try, then take my advice, because I\u2019ve been right where you are.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to understand Sorceri ways; you just have to accept them.</p><p>Allow her to be as she needs to be.</p><p>Sabine has told me of your animosity toward all Sorceri, so unfortunately, I don\u2019t have high hopes that you can content Lanthe. I ready for war. I recommend you do as well.</p><p>Vrekener, harm my sister-in-law in any way, and I will find you on the battlefield. Your last sight will be of me, laughing as I take your head with my bare hands.</p><p>R</p><p>Of course Thronos had shown Melanthe the letter; she\u2019d read it with wide eyes. \u201cSo my first letter was a Patty Hearst bust?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d had no idea what that meant. \u201cAdvise me in this,\u201d he\u2019d told her. \u201cDo you want to meet with your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared she\u2019ll use her sorcery to take me from you. Or Rydstrom will attack you. Let me try one more time.\u201d She\u2019d bitten her lip. \u201cAre you going to write him back?\u201d</p><p>Thronos had given the matter much thought. As he\u2019d watched Melanthe sleeping last night, he\u2019d penned a response, sending it this morning. . . .</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s work had mitigated danger from three formidable sources, and most of the assembly was grateful. But Cadmus and his contingent remained suspicious of their queen and disgruntled that Thronos had left her empowered.</p><p>He could understand their doubt\u2014because he\u2019d initially contended with it himself. He\u2019d had to go through hell before he\u2019d appreciated Melanthe.</p><p>Pain had confessed all.</p><p>In Pandemonia, he\u2019d resisted his feelings for her, bent on returning to the Hall, to reason and sanity, to find his anchor.</p><p>Now that he was here, he\u2019d realized Melanthe was his anchor.</p><p>In any case, sanity and reason had proved in short supply for his brother. When had Aristo become so twisted? How? And how had he found three other males who\u2019d shared his proclivities?</p><p>Thronos feared that the rules of their culture were so strict, the specter of offendments so pervasive, that some grew warped under the strain.</p><p>Should one truly be punished for something so harmless as a kiss?</p><p>Thronos had failed to follow the letter of Vrekener law; how could he expect others to be bound by them?</p><p>During his and Melanthe\u2019s tour of worlds, he\u2019d learned that his all-or-nothing, inflexible thinking was a liability. As she\u2019d told him, \u201cUp in heaven, I\u2019m sure things make sense and everyone acts as they\u2019re expected to and surprises are few. But outside of heaven, life can be confusing and heartbreaking and dire. So most of us take pleasure where we can find it. And we don\u2019t judge anyone who does the same.\u201d</p><p>In \u201cheaven,\u201d surprises had been many. Thronos\u2019s brother had not acted in expected ways.</p><p>Life had proved utterly confusing.</p><p>Perhaps Vrekeners should judge less and enjoy more, taking pleasure where they could find it\u2014especially since dire threats now surrounded them. Eternal life could be grindingly long, or heartbreakingly short.</p><p>Once the Territories were \u201cout of the crosshairs,\u201d he would discuss social reforms with his co-ruler. . . .</p><p>The debate between Cadmus and Jasen was winding down, the day coming to a close, which meant he could soon return to her. Every second he wasn\u2019t with Melanthe, he wished he were.</p><p>For the public, he maintained what she called his poker face. At home with her, he could relax. Thanks to her generous infusion of sorcery, he remained pain-free, even days later. Still, she wanted to do a maintenance massage tonight, just in case.</p><p>Lucky, lucky me.</p><p>How could he have handled this time without her? She made him laugh. She forced him to shuck off some worries and most regrets. He was insatiable for her. To his remarkable fortune, she was just as much so for him.</p><p>He\u2019d started taking more control, which she\u2019d seemed all too happy to relinquish. Two nights ago, he\u2019d positioned her on all fours, mounting her from behind, using his pain-free wings to propel his thrusts. When he\u2019d felt her coming around his length, he\u2019d reached forward to cover her mouth, then followed her, biting down on his forearm.</p><p>Late last night, he\u2019d been gripped by an erotic dream about her, despite their many couplings. Just as he\u2019d once hoped, he\u2019d awakened with his shaft buried deep inside his wife, his hips pounding between her thighs.</p><p>When he\u2019d realized what he was doing, he eased his movements, dumbfounded.</p><p>Until he\u2019d felt her nails dig into the muscles of his ass. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Thronos. So close! I\u2019ll be quiet. . . .\u201d</p><p>Over these days, he\u2019d done things that he could tell had surprised her. She\u2019d cry, \u201cOh!\u201d then follow it with a breathy, \u201cOhhh.\u201d To tell him she liked it.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d promised in Inferno, she always let him know what she needed.</p><p>When he thought about how eagerly his lusty mate took his seed with her body, her hands\u2014and yes, her mouth\u2014he couldn\u2019t prevent the grin that spread over his face.</p><p>Until he realized that all attention was on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, my liege?\u201d Jasen asked.</p><p>About? Thronos coughed into his fist. \u201cI think we\u2019ll pick this up tomorrow. I know most of you have families awaiting you.\u201d</p><p>I have a family. He and Melanthe were an army of two.</p><p>He could fly, without pain, to meet his wife in their home. Gods, how things had changed in the weeks since he\u2019d taken her. He smiled more often. So did she, casting him that mischievous grin.</p><p>As a girl, Melanthe had snared his heart with it.</p><p>As a woman, she owned his heart\u2014invincible no longer.</p><p>I have her had become I love her.</p><p>Thronos would tell her tonight. He couldn\u2019t be certain how she\u2019d react, but he would never again keep something so important in his pocket.</p><p>FIFTY-THREE</p><p>Having completed her and Thronos\u2019s history, Lanthe was tweaking her opening to Sabine. The letter would go out in one hour\u2014and would prove even more important than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Sabine and Rydstrom still thought she was a prisoner.</p><p>Lanthe had begun . . .</p><p>My dearest sister,</p><p>How I do adore Skye Hall! I now enjoy cooking and cleaning, tasteful jokes, and demure clothing. Why, I hardly miss my sorcery or gold at all!</p><p>JK JK! I wouldn\u2019t know if I like any of that shit, because I\u2019ve never tried it. My lust for gold is as strong as ever, my sorcery even stronger.</p><p>Your little sis is quite a boss.</p><p>And she\u2019s totally in love with a Vrekener.</p><p>In Inferno, Thronos had asked her if she\u2019d ever been in love. She\u2019d answered, \u201cI\u2019ve never known romantic love.\u201d True. But as a girl, Lanthe had loved Thronos\u2014fiercely.</p><p>Deep down, maybe she\u2019d never stopped. Maybe it\u2019d always been there, waiting to bloom into a different kind of love. The fragile sprout of affection that she\u2019d copped to in faux Feveris had grown into . . . a moonraker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And her feelings for him were so strong, they\u2019d even started coloring how she viewed Vrekeners.</p><p>Lanthe could still call them lame\u2014but if anyone else did, she\u2019d shut that down.</p><p>Sabine, when you read the rest of this letter, please keep an open mind. I\u2019m not brainwashed, and I never will be. Just as you\u2019re bringing change to Rothkalina, I plan to here. Once all the dust settles, you can give me queenly pointers!</p> <p>When Lanthe felt a vibration of power, she frowned, laying the quill down. She sensed sorcery\u2014not hers.</p><p>She leapt to her feet. Something was approaching, a threat to the people here. She raced for the assembly hall.</p><p>Where was everyone? Was it dinnertime already?</p><p>Lanthe hastened toward the vibration, out the front doorway of the Hall. A portal was opening, right before her eyes.</p><p>On the freaking steps of Skye Hall.</p> <p>Her jaw dropped when Sabine emerged. \u201cAi-bee?\u201d Her sister was in full war regalia, with a broad gold headdress atop her flame-red tresses. A metal breastplate served as her top, and a jade mask adorned her face.</p><p>Sabine was a jolt of color in this monochrome realm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rescuing you,\u201d Sabine said blithely as she traipsed onto Vrekener land. \u201cLook at your necklace\u2014is that red gold? To die for! It almost makes up for that dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need rescuing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I feared, the Vrekeners brainwashed you, just like so many Sorceri before you. But I vow I will get you back. When we return to Rothkalina, I\u2019m enrolling you in cult deprogramming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hearing me. I want to stay with Thronos.\u201d</p><p>As if Lanthe hadn\u2019t spoken, Sabine said, \u201cThe stress of all you\u2019ve been through isn\u2019t helping. I know about the Order, about your fight to stay alive. About your capture and imprisonment here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not imprisoned! Why would I still have my sorcery if I were a prisoner?\u201d Nothing. \u201cHow did you find the Skye, Sabine?\u201d Can others?</p><p>\u201cThe same way that Dacian vampire did: with a one-of-a-kind scry crystal. It\u2019s been tucked away in hidden Dacia for ages. Anyway, the leech let us borrow it. And then we used a portal power similar to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>With a wave of her hand, Sabine used her sorcery to make Lanthe\u2019s necklace invisible. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want that to be taken from you. She\u2019ll think I merely gave you a glamour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe . . . ?\u201d Lanthe trailed off, swallowing with fear when Morgana emerged from the threshold, also in war regalia.</p><p>Her pale blond hair was interwoven throughout her gold headdress. Her irises were the color of a bottomless pit. Sorcery of differing colors swirled around her. Lanthe had never perceived so much of it in one being\u2014Morgana was overflowing with reclaimed powers, laden with them.</p> <p>Like a snake who\u2019d recently fed.</p><p>The queen glared at her enemy\u2019s domain with a vicious eye.</p><p>Lanthe held up her unlit hands, a gesture of yielding for Sorceri. \u201cNow, let\u2019s just talk about this, Morgana. Can we do that?\u201d Lanthe glanced around; the people were all gathered in the bastion, which meant no targets at hand for Morgana to smite. For now.</p><p>But this also meant Thronos would return soon. . . .</p><p>\u201cWe shall talk,\u201d Sabine said. \u201cBack at Rothkalina. Come, Lanthe, we\u2019re on a bit of a clock here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTick tock,\u201d Morgana sneered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen more than enough.\u201d</p><p>When Lanthe vowed, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving here,\u201d Sabine clamped her arm in her gauntlet, turning her toward the portal. On the other side, visible through the threshold, was Lanthe\u2019s tower room.</p><p>\u201cBehold, sister, your room in Rothkalina.\u201d As if speaking to a baby, she asked, \u201cDo you remember your room? All your fabulous clothes, luxuries, servants, and self-help books are just beyond this threshold. Your TV and vault of gold await you. That is where you belong.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe fought to throw off her grip. \u201cI belong here. What can I do to make you believe I\u2019m not brainwashed! I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d Thronos had caught sight of them from above. \u201cDon\u2019t touch her!\u201d His wings snapped close to his body as he dove for them.</p><p>An enraged Vrekener was attacking, expression grim, eyes deadly.</p><p>A reckoning.</p><p>\u201cStay away!\u201d Lanthe screamed. He was the embodiment of physical power, Morgana of mystical. Despite all the strength in his mighty body, and all his battle-hardened centuries, Thronos couldn\u2019t match that queen. \u201cShe will kill you!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even slow; the rage in his eyes . . .</p><p>Morgana raised one hand. As if a giant fist had seized him in the air, he was brought up short, held in place\u2014though he grappled to reach Lanthe.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him!\u201d She started drawing on her own power.</p><p>Morgana squinted at her as if she were an insect in need of a good crushing. \u201cCareful, little girl, I\u2019ll snatch that persuasion from you before you could ever wield it against me.\u201d She turned her attention back to Thronos in the air. With another wave of her hand, the queen began lowering him in front of her for a better look.</p><p>Lanthe turned to Sabine. \u2014Ai-bee, please, please help us! I love Thronos.\u2014</p><p>Behind her mask, Sabine rolled her eyes. \u2014You cannot be serious.\u2014</p><p>\u2014I\u2019ve loved him since I was nine. I have so much to tell you, but if Morgana kills him, she\u2019ll be killing me!\u2014</p><p>\u2014I don\u2019t believe your brainwashed babble. It makes no sense!\u2014</p><p>\u2014What if there\u2019s even a chance it\u2019s true? Imagine if Morgana was about to murder Rydstrom. Imagine how you\u2019d feel. This is HAPPENING to me, right now.\u2014</p><p>\u2014How could you possibly love one of . . . them?\u2014 Sabine flicked her hand in Thronos\u2019s direction.</p><p>Lanthe wanted to strangle her. \u2014If I\u2019m brainwashed, you can always kill him later. For now, HELP US!\u2014</p><p>\u2014I suppose that is true.\u2014</p><p>When Morgana brought Thronos to the ground, to his knees, he grated, \u201cRelease my mate, and begone from these lands.\u201d Gnashing his teeth, he fought her sorcery enough to stand.</p><p>Morgana appeared surprised by his strength. But when Thronos again tried to reach Lanthe, the queen redoubled her hold, halting him in place. \u201cThis one had the audacity to abduct one of my subjects.\u201d Prismatic wisps of sorcery coiled around her. \u201cActions against Sorceri will now have swift and severe consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgana, I wasn\u2019t abducted! I made a conscious decision to come here!\u201d</p><p>The queen merely ignored her.</p><p>\u2014Ai-bee, please!\u2014</p><p>\u2014Fine. My gods.\u2014 Sabine\u2019s insouciance never faded as she said, \u201cMorgana, though this is tiresome even to bring up . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t slay that one if I were you.\u201d Sabine peered at her gauntlets, rapping the claws with boredom. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you take him as prisoner?\u201d</p><p>Morgana\u2019s eyes sparked ominously, glinting like obsidian. \u201cDo you comprehend how long I\u2019ve waited for this?\u201d She squeezed her fist harder until Thronos labored to breathe. \u201cMy ward was brutalized by his brother. This Talos will pay as well!\u201d</p><p>Lanthe tried to get between Morgana and him, but the queen\u2019s magic was an impenetrable leash from her to her prey. \u201cPlease, Morgana! Thronos was disgusted by what happened to Bettina. He\u2019s already in talks with her. Just speak with her! But for now, spare him. Please!\u201d</p><p>At once, the air blurred around Morgana\u2019s body. Above her headpiece, her blond braids wavered like a gorgon\u2019s serpents. \u201cSpare him?\u201d she bit out. \u201cSPARE him? Are you jesting with me? You and your sister have been running from him and his brother for ages! Now that your queen is in a position to mete out justice, you cower from what must be done?\u201d</p><p>Before Lanthe could say anything, Morgana cut her off. \u201cDo you know how many powers I pulled from the Vrekener vault? Do you know how many attacks those powers represented? How many of my subjects were victimized?\u201d Voice rising with every word, she yelled, \u201cThe fact that I don\u2019t torture every godsforsaken Vrekener individually is my GIFT to them!\u201d Sorcery whipped about her, coils electrified by her rage. \u201cThronos Talos will be punished!\u201d</p><p>Sabine said, \u201cI believe that\u2019s about to happen, no? In moments.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s dread intensified even more. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, Morgana raked her fathomless gaze over Thronos. Though his skin reddened from lack of oxygen, he still struggled against her power.</p><p>But Morgana was just too strong. \u201cI believe this being loves you, Melanthe.\u201d The queen smiled, as if in anticipation\u2014one of the most bloodcurdling sights Lanthe had beheld. \u201cWhat a weakness he\u2019s delivered to us. If I spare his life, he\u2019ll suffer a worse fate.\u201d Morgana could be diabolical, seemed to love devising twisted punishments for those who crossed her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, my queen\u2014\u201d Lanthe\u2019s words were cut off when she felt Morgana pulling on her persuasion. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cControlling your sorcery. Your root power should be the one that curses him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurses? Please stop this!\u201d</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s blue light started to emanate from Morgana\u2019s hands. \u201cThronos, brother of Aristo, heed my voice and obey my commands. You will forget Melanthe.\u201d</p><p>He stole enough air to bellow, \u201cNever!\u201d Muscles all over his body rippled with strain as he fought the order.</p><p>Lanthe cried, \u201cMorgana, I\u2019m begging you!\u201d She couldn\u2019t fight the queen now, but at least Thronos would live. In the future, Lanthe could reverse this! \u2014Thronos, I\u2019ll return for you! I\u2019ll make you remember me. Just stay alive!\u2014</p><p>Morgana commanded him, \u201cForget her, forget her, forget her! All memories of Melanthe are gone!\u201d</p><p>Thronos\u2019s eyes met Lanthe\u2019s just as blue sorcery exploded out from Morgana, striking him like a bolt.</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m coming back for you, Thronos!\u2014</p><p>It was already too late; once he\u2019d recovered from that strike, he gazed blankly at her. Zero recognition.</p><p>She swallowed past the lump in her throat. If the queen forced her from the Territories, Lanthe would create another portal right back here and fix everything. But that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t killing her to see Thronos like this.</p><p>Morgana wasn\u2019t finished with him. \u201cYour love for her will remain. The yearning you would feel to be parted from her will endure. Yet you won\u2019t understand the never-ending ache, won\u2019t comprehend the source of your misery. Should anyone speak to you of your queen, you\u2019ll react with anger, then forget the conversation. And, Thronos, should you live past the next two minutes, you\u2019ll forget we were ever here.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe swung her head around on Morgana. \u201cWhat happens in two minutes?\u201d</p><p>The queen looked like revenge personified as she said, \u201cThe mighty shall fall.\u201d</p><p>Tick tock? Mother of gold . . . \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Somehow, Morgana was going to bring the Territories down.</p><p>\u201cWith access to their power vault, I turned their infuriating defenses against them. Their magics will destroy all that was long guarded and shrouded. Tick tock goes the clock.\u201d</p><p>Sabine began shoving Lanthe toward the portal. \u2014This is a done thing. I have to protect you.\u2014</p><p>Lanthe broke away from Sabine and lunged for the security lever just inside the doors of Skye Hall. The alarm roared to life, blaring across the Territories.</p><p>From the bastion, Vrekeners shot upward in a flood, wings spread as they evacuated according to plan.</p><p>At once, the late-day sky turned to night. The air grew chill.</p><p>Across all islands, they soared. Except for Thronos, who was still trapped by Morgana.</p><p>With her chin lifted, Lanthe turned to face her queen, to accept her wrath.</p><p>Morgana seemed to boil with fury, the very ground shaking beneath her. The rainbow colors of her powers merged to . . . black. Raising a hand, she hissed, \u201cIll-advised, sorceress.\u201d</p><p>When Sabine lunged in front of Lanthe, Morgana hesitated, then seemed to rein in the worst of her rage. \u201cI\u2019d punish you for this\u2014and them for fleeing\u2014but I haven\u2019t the time.\u201d With another wave of her hand, Lanthe was propelled toward the portal.</p><p>\u201cNo, leave me here!\u201d</p><p>Sabine snapped, \u201cNot going to happen!\u201d</p><p>As Lanthe clung to the edge of the invisible threshold, she screamed, \u201cThronos, leave this place!\u201d</p><p>Though Morgana\u2019s hold on him had eased\u2014he could breathe once more\u2014he continued to stare at the spot where she\u2019d been standing.</p><p>\u201cFLY AWAY!\u201d Lanthe commanded.</p><p>But her persuasion had been drained from Morgana\u2019s catastrophic use of it.</p><p>Sabine peeled her fingers away. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time, Lanthe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave, Thronos!\u201d With her grip loosened, Lanthe was sent careening into her room. \u201cPlease, GO!\u201d she sobbed as the threshold closed behind them. . . .</p><p>The blaring alarm roused Thronos.</p><p>He blinked again and again. Why was he standing on the steps of Skye Hall, staring at nothing? He shook his head hard.</p><p>Vrekeners had surged upward from the islands, flying in the direction of the outpost. Why was he not moving with them? He wondered if this was another drill, until he heard explosions coming from the outer islands.</p><p>One blast after another detonated along the lines of the monoliths. Fires erupted, overrunning the islands in blue and white flames\u2014an unnatural fire.</p><p>An immortal killer.</p><p>Burning rock shot upward\u2014and downward, cascading toward the gulf far below them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The warded and protected Territories were being annihilated by some unseen force.</p><p>Act, Talos. Move! He tensed to fly\u2014</p><p>A white flash fire roared from the Hall itself, engulfing him just as his wings reflexively shielded his body. The mystical flames consumed both wings; the explosive percussion hurtled him down to the vale.</p> <p>Which had disappeared.</p><p>The island had . . . disintegrated.</p><p>Thronos plummeted amid the fiery rubble. Blood poured from his ringing ears. Wind snapped what was left of his still-burning wings. They were useless.</p><p>My lands, my people. He was helpless to do anything for them.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fly. Could only fall.</p> <p>He knew he had fallen as a boy. Though he didn\u2019t remember why, he hadn\u2019t used his wings all the way down.</p><p>As now.</p><p>Once more I fall.</p><p>His back was turned to the world below\u2014so he could keep his eyes on the sky. Time seemed to slow.</p><p>Traces of malevolent sorcery eddied around crimson and purple clouds. Lightning fractured those clouds, illuminating all the debris raining down around him.</p><p>Scorched plaster. Burning books. A charred cradle.</p> <p>For mere days, he\u2019d been king. Now his realm had died.</p><p>You\u2019ve lost something else, something even dearer. His heart twisted. What could possibly be more treasured than a kingdom?</p><p>What was it he\u2019d lost?</p><p>He finally dragged his eyes from the heavens and gazed below him. The water rushed ever closer. Blue and white flames soared from the gulf. Thronos had no shield from the heat. When he hit, he would be incinerated.</p><p>His life had been long and unfulfilling, his dream of finding his mate unrealized. Perhaps he was meant to have died after his first fall. Perhaps fate sought to right that misguided mercy now.</p><p>He turned to the nearby mountainside and spotted . . . Vrekeners. Thousands of them. They\u2019d gathered on a plateau above the gulf to watch their home perish.</p><p>Thronos had never named a successor. His people were more vulnerable than they\u2019d ever been. For them, he had to survive.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t there a way? He couldn\u2019t remember it!</p> <p>What couldn\u2019t he remember?</p><p>Once more I fall. . . .</p><p>FIFTY-FOUR</p><p>On a mountaintop far across the gulf from the gathered Vrekeners, N\u00efx the Ever-Knowing and Morgana, the Queen of Sorceri, watched the Skye fall.</p><p>One female had allowed it; one had caused it.</p><p>N\u00efx\u2019s lightning crackled all around her\u2014and the bat she carried. Morgana\u2019s usurped powers were so volatile that the color streams of her sorcery had morphed to a permanent black.</p><p>As the two immortals bore witness, they sparked off each other like negatively charged ions.</p><p>\u201cI foresaw the Queen of Persuasion desperate to stay with King Thronos,\u201d N\u00efx said, never looking away. The water was already aflame with soaring plumes of otherworldly fire.</p><p>Morgana too kept her gaze trained. \u201cAs soon as I left her and Sabine in Rothkalina, Melanthe probably created a portal back. To nothing.\u201d Black swirls danced from her lips, as if a contagion was trying to escape her body. \u201cIf the Vrekener survives, the memory of his wife will not\u2014\u201d</p><p>The giant monoliths crashed into the flames, displacing miles of water, generating towering tsunamis.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the mortals will know of this now,\u201d Morgana said, tone inscrutable. \u201cOf us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet. . . .\u201d</p><p>From the gulf, the sea god Nereus rose up like a mountain himself, visible only to the immortal pair. With a monstrous inhalation, he sucked all the flames into his lungs.</p><p>Then he brandished his divine triton, raising it over his head to subdue the waves. The tsunamis paused, their terrible surge arrested in midswell\u2014</p><p>Yielding to his command, they gradually subsided, slipping to acquiescence.</p><p>The surface was still, the fire defeated. Before Nereus sank to the depths once more, his smoldering gaze lingered on Morgana.</p><p>She frowned, but that was the least extraordinary thing she\u2019d seen this day.</p><p>A reviled realm\u2014the bane of her entire life\u2014had perished by fire and been entombed in the sea.

Save up power for tomorrow</p><p>\u201cWhat have I told you about chasing after boys?\u201d Sabine drawled, sashaying into Lanthe\u2019s substitute suite.</p><p>Her former residence was still being repaired, nearly a week after the Territories had fallen.</p><p>Lanthe glanced up from her desperate letters and lists, allowing Sabine see her panic, her despondency. Both grew with each minute. \u201cThronos is not a boy\u2014he\u2019s my husband. And I want him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell. Would you like me to weave an illusion over you?\u201d</p><p>As if Lanthe could be bothered with her appearance\u2014when every other thought in her head was YOU\u2019RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO FIND HIM!</p><p>How was Thronos dealing with the destruction of his kingdom? How was he coping with his feelings of loss? What if he thought he had nothing to live for and was careless in some battle? What if Cadmus staged a refugee coup?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing yourself far too hard, Lanthe.\u201d Sabine reclined on a nearby divan. \u201cSince when have you been able to create portals so frequently?\u201d</p><p>After Lanthe had failed to locate the outpost that first day, she\u2019d reasoned that N\u00efx had actually been talking about all of Lanthe\u2019s powers behaving like muscles. She\u2019d been able to shave down the time between her portals to once a day, but that was the limit.</p><p>Use, use, use, use, use\u2014and no rest? Accuracy . . . suffered.</p><p>\u201cYou need to dial down the thresholds,\u201d Sabine warned.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t created one today.\u201d Holding off was one of the hardest things she\u2019d ever done.</p><p>But she was about to go for broke, to try to reach a realm that could be light-years away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only one of the things I\u2019m here to talk about.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known Sabine would want a sit-down soon. Lanthe heard the whispers in the castle growing louder and more numerous. They said that Thronos had surely perished.</p><p>She supposed they had reason to believe that. . . .</p><p>As soon as Morgana had left Rothkalina to go watch her handiwork from some vantage like a ghoulish spectator, Lanthe had slashed open a rift to get back to Thronos.</p><p>In time to catch the blast.</p><p>Sabine had shoved her out of the way, taking the full brunt\u2014a force strong enough to send her flying across the room. Her impact had buckled a tower wall. Luckily Sabine had been wearing scads of metal.</p><p>Lanthe hadn\u2019t been able to create another portal until the next day. With a suitcase full of clothes and big hopes, she\u2019d portaled to Canada, using the just-in-case directions Thronos had given her to the Vrekeners\u2019 outpost.</p><p>Past Lanthe\u2019s threshold, there\u2019d been nothing but rocks and trees, not a trace of Vrekeners. She\u2019d been greeted by a herd of deer so tame they\u2019d approached her. Clearly, no winged hunters had been in that area stalking them, though Thronos loved venison.</p><p>Either she\u2019d gotten the directions jumbled (as she had every other time in her life, in which case, she sucked) or her portal had gone awry (in which case, she sucked).</p><p>While she\u2019d been recharging for another futile go at Canada, Sabine and Rydstrom had told Lanthe that even an immortal like Thronos couldn\u2019t survive a fire born of sorcery like Morgana\u2019s. Sabine relayed to her that Morgana had watched it all\u2014after the blast, the islands had simply crumbled into flames and plunged.</p><p>\u201cYes, but Thronos\u2019s wings are fireproof,\u201d Lanthe had argued.</p><p>Sabine had said, \u201cEven his wings would be vulnerable to an unnatural fire.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe had reasoned, \u201cSomeone could have swooped in to save him.\u201d</p><p>With grave hesitation, Rydstrom had pointed out, \u201cBut hadn\u2019t everyone already evacuated, Lanthe?\u201d</p><p>Whatever. Thronos had survived. Period. Lanthe had promised herself that she would never underestimate him again. He was an extraordinary male who would prevail in any situation.</p><p>Besides, her husband had one more trick up his sleeve. Granted, he wouldn\u2019t quite know he had it. . . .</p><p>\u201cWe can talk later,\u201d she told Sabine now. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d She waved at the stack of missives she was penning to witches and oracles all over the worlds.</p><p>The afternoon of her first ill-fated Canada trip, Lanthe had gotten one of the castle guards to trace her to the Louisiana chapter of the House of Witches. Carrow and her super-powerful friend Mariketa had scried for Thronos, but some of the Vrekeners\u2019 ancient magics still held. The same cloaks that had hidden them from humans lingered.</p><p>The witches couldn\u2019t locate an entire populace.</p><p>So Lanthe had dispatched Cadeon\u2019s former band of mercenaries to manually search Canuck forests. \u201cWhich ones?\u201d they\u2019d asked.</p><p>All of them. Because I suck.</p><p>From the divan, Sabine picked up one of the maps that Lanthe had spread over every available surface. \u201cToo busy with your search to inquire after my healing? I\u2019m right as rain, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe felt a twinge of guilt.</p><p>\u201cBusy or not, you won\u2019t get rid of me so easily.\u201d Her sister rang for wine.</p><p>Powerless Sorceri servants known as Inferi promptly answered the call, then vanished once more.</p><p>\u201cRydstrom made me promise to talk to you because he thinks I\u2019m upset about this tiff between us.\u201d Sabine sipped from a golden goblet. \u201cSo here I remain because, weirdly, I keep promises to him. By the way, Morgana wanted me to ask you why the sea god Nereus sent her a coral tube carved to look like a humongous cock. Apparently he mentioned your name in a very naughty gift card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story, meager payoff.\u201d</p><p>Sabine sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re still angry with me. Though surely you know I couldn\u2019t have convinced Morgana to call off her attack. Fearing for your life, I went to her, trying to do just that. She suggested the use of that scry crystal to evacuate you. I did what I thought was right. And I do believe my actions prevented Morgana from simply smiting the Vrekener outright.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe put down her pen. \u201cYou want credit for that\u2014even though you think he\u2019s dead anyway?\u201d</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t have expected Sabine to defy Morgana any more than she had. But Sabine didn\u2019t seem to regret what the queen had done, even after Lanthe had told her everything about Thronos, about all that she and the Vrekener had been through together.</p><p>The pages Lanthe had written of their history had been erased from existence\u2014just like their history had been erased from Thronos\u2019s mind.</p><p>Sabine had been shocked to discover that Lanthe truly loved him, and probably had since she was a girl. But she hadn\u2019t embraced the idea of her little sister wed to an enemy Vrekener: \u201cEspecially one who doesn\u2019t even have a house, much less a kingdom,\u201d Sabine had said, making Lanthe want to punch her in the tit.</p><p>Sabine had been more worked up about Emberine daring to cut off Lanthe\u2019s tongue: \u201cShe will pay dearly for that. I plot for her very soul!\u201d Sabine had also raised a fuss over the dragon gold: \u201cI didn\u2019t conceal your necklace from Morgana just so you can throw it away willy-nilly! Let me handle Bettina. I know her pressure points. Consider their declaration of war null and void.\u201d</p><p>In an attempt to distract Lanthe from her search, Sabine had invited Cadeon and his family to stay for a few weeks. Lanthe had paused only to press a kiss on each babe\u2019s downy head, greet their parents, and ask Holly if she knew where N\u00efx was (\u201cNo earthly idea\u201d). So Lanthe had gotten back to work.</p><p>The entire royal family pitied her. Yesterday Lanthe had gone to Tornin\u2019s library for more maps. Rydstrom and Cadeon had been down in the courtyard, conversing amiably in their deep demon voices and Sith Ifrican accents. With a swaddled babe in each arm, Cadeon had crowed, \u201cI\u2019ve got a trio of females who all adore me. Life is rich, brother!\u201d</p><p>Spying Lanthe above, Rydstrom had motioned for Cadeon to keep it down.</p><p>They shouldn\u2019t pity her. Because Lanthe was going to fix this. She needed to get her husband back for more than just\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you sending out even more gold?\u201d Sabine said now, setting away her goblet. \u201cLanthe, you\u2019ve spent a fortune!\u201d</p><p>In their childhood meadow, Thronos had tickled Lanthe, teasing her, \u201cYou like me far better than gold.\u201d</p><p>I do. I really do. \u201cAs if you wouldn\u2019t do the same for Rydstrom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Thronos is a Vrekener. They\u2019re despicable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are my subjects you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Lanthe could call them names all day long, but if anyone else did . . .</p><p>\u201cI insult our age-old foes, and your eyes glimmer with outrage? Up is down, down is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave, Sabine. I don\u2019t have time to make you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKicking me out, when I have in my possession a letter from Thronos to Rydstrom, sent before the collapse of the Territories?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only just learned of it today, because I allegedly ordered the Vrekener messenger to be waylaid and interrogated\u2014in defiance of Lore law. Which allegedly delayed the letter a bit.\u201d She tugged a folded sheet of parchment from inside her gauntlet. \u201cI make no apologies. Based on the information I had, I was desperate to find you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOpen it!\u201d</p><p>When Sabine patted the divan beside her, Lanthe nearly tripped on her feet to join her there. \u201cYou haven\u2019t read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Rydstrom has, and he suggested we read it together.\u201d</p> <p>Lanthe saw Thronos\u2019s handwriting and seal, and tears welled. She didn\u2019t trust her voice, so she circled her hand in the air, come on, come on.</p><p>Ever dramatic, Sabine took her time unfolding it. \u201cI wonder how your Vrekener will respond. Rydstrom\u2019s letter to him was by no means gentle, so I can only imagine what this rebuttal will contain.\u201d Finally Sabine held up the letter, and together they read:</p><p>King Rydstrom,</p><p>My first reaction when I received your message was anger. Who the hell are you to advise me on how to treat my beloved wife? To make her happy?</p><p>Beloved wife? Lanthe\u2019s tears spilled down her face, making Sabine roll her eyes. They read on. . . .</p> <p>I think you and Queen Sabine have a mistaken impression of Melanthe\u2019s life in the Territories.</p><p>She roams the kingdom freely, fully empowered\u2014because I trust her implicitly. She wears whatever garments she chooses and worships gold, of which I plan to provide her ever more.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t do these things because I allow her to, or because she demands to\u2014this is simply the way things are in our life.</p><p>We co-rule our kingdom. Our marriage is a partnership.</p><p>It works.</p><p>Lanthe gave a sob.</p> <p>\u201cThronos truly understands about the gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe m-met Mother when he was a boy. He understands the importance.\u201d</p><p>Sabine didn\u2019t look surprised, but then she\u2019d long since woven an illusion over her face.</p><p>However, upon further reflection over your letter, I realize that my only response to you can be gratitude. Melanthe is not only my wife and queen, she is my most treasured friend. You helped free her from the tyranny of Omort, and you\u2019ve pledged your protection since.</p><p>Because of this, I am deeply in your debt. I wish for no war between us.</p><p>If you can agree to terms, I propose a meeting that would include you with your wife, and me with mine.</p><p>Melanthe has been against this course, fearing that you or Sabine will take her from me against her will.</p><p>I look upon my powerful queen even now as I write this, and confidently dare you to try.</p> <p>Thronos</p><p>Lanthe choked back her next sob. If he hadn\u2019t written of her being a powerful queen, she\u2019d probably be curled up in a ball, her tears wetting the divan upholstery.</p><p>\u201cThat was . . . big of him.\u201d Sabine folded the letter. \u201cPerhaps we Sorceri oughtn\u2019t to have blown up his kingdom?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe whirled around and punched her sister in the tit. Regrettably, Sabine was wearing a metal breastplate.</p><p>As Lanthe shook out her hand, Sabine snapped, \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about your history with the Vrekener!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to make of it back then! For so long, it only brought pain. I was embarrassed. It seemed like all I ever did was confess my poor judgment to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you not understand what it looked like to me? I thought you\u2019d finally been caught by a fiend. I was just trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your protection anymore! I don\u2019t need your worry! Sabine, I stole keys to the gates of hell and convinced demon hordes that I was a goddess.\u201d She held up her necklace, the red gold nearly mesmerizing Sabine. \u201cI somehow made a portal under duress in the belly of a beast! Thronos and I prevailed over a deity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t simply stop worrying about you or stop protecting you. Short of your commanding me not to, it will never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fine, don\u2019t stop. But support me in this.\u201d She took her sister\u2019s face in her hands. \u201cFor me, Thronos is all the gold in the world. He\u2019s my next heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Sabine was bewildered, and let her sister see it. \u201cWell. Way to sum up your feelings.\u201d At length, she exhaled with defeat. \u201cAll right, then, consider me . . . supportive\u2014if you\u2019ll forgive me, and stop being cross. I can\u2019t stand having discord between us.\u201d She opened her arms. \u201cYou know I only want what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe hugged her for long moments\u2014she\u2019d hated the discord too.</p><p>Sabine was teary when they broke away. \u201cYou know, the Queen of Zephyr is a very disagreeable sorceress. In the future, if you\u2019d like to spend some quality sister time together, we could ambush her and steal her power of flight. In case Thronos wants a flying wife, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe smiled through her own tears. \u201cQT with my big sis? I\u2019d really like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, if you\u2019re out of leads, you could renew my search for the Hag in the Basement.\u201d After Omort had died, Hag had delivered those antidotes for the morsus, then fled Tornin. \u201cShe\u2019s rumored to be working for King Lothaire in Dacia. Wrap your head around that for a moment, will you?\u201d</p><p>Hag possessed locating powers! \u201cYou\u2019ve stopped looking for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sought her\u2014only to find her partner in crime, Lothaire, and his hateful book of debts. No longer. It\u2019s rumored that he gave the book to La Dorada for some reason.\u201d</p><p>Then Rydstrom owed the Queen of Evil a blood debt? That didn\u2019t bode well. And he and Sabine already had a lot on their plate.</p><p>Because the mysterious Well of Souls was . . . stirring.</p><p>\u201cHag\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Lanthe said. \u201cI\u2019ll send a dispatch to Dacia right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more idea. Cadeon came up with it. . . . If Thronos truly is a demon, it might be possible for you to summon him.\u201d</p><p>A female who slept with a demon of certain breeds could summon him at any time\u2014if she knew the rites and possessed the esoteric ingredients. The demon would uncontrollably teleport back to her.</p><p>Lanthe had contemplated this\u2014was preparing for it\u2014but had decided to save the idea until she\u2019d exhausted all others.</p><p>Despite the amount of gold she\u2019d offered Loa the Commercenary, the priestess couldn\u2019t get the ingredients to Lanthe for another three weeks.</p><p>In any case, the situation with Thronos was . . . tricky. He wasn\u2019t going to remember Lanthe when he saw her. As far as he\u2019d know, she might be an enemy sorceress. Plus, she wasn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019d ever fully accepted he was a demon.</p><p>Being involuntarily demon-summoned by an unknown Sorceri would have to spook him.</p><p>\u201cOf course, some breeds are immune,\u201d Sabine continued, \u201cand I can\u2019t imagine anyone having tried it on a Vrekener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Cadeon thank you from me. But it\u2019s my last-ditch option\u2014since I have Thronos\u2019s memory issues to consider.\u201d</p><p>Sabine narrowed her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got another plan up your gauntlet. You never used to keep secrets from me.\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cOh, wait. You did for five hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving up my sorcery till tomorrow, so I can create a portal all the way to Pandemonia.\u201d She\u2019d attempted it yesterday and had accidentally opened a rift back to the belly of the beast. She\u2019d slammed the portal door in an instant, but her room had still smelled like gastric acid.</p><p>Surely if Lanthe rested her threshold muscle, she could reach that demon plane. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Does he have a portal . . . Ah! You think he can trace! That\u2019s why you\u2019re so confident he lives.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe shrugged. N\u00efx had mentioned it in faux Feveris: You\u2019d be able to trace\u2014big deal. Thinking back, Lanthe realized the Valkyrie might have been saying that in earnest.</p><p>Tracing was a big deal. It could save a demon\u2019s life.</p><p>Even if N\u00efx had said nothing, Lanthe would believe. \u201cSabine, you\u2019d have to know Thronos like I do\u2014he always beats the odds. He wasn\u2019t supposed to survive his fall as a boy. He did. He wasn\u2019t supposed to fly again. He does. He was never supposed to catch me or win my heart. How could I ever bet against him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why Pandemonia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think his subconscious will take him back there. Or his demonic blood will, or vestiges of our history. Pandemonia is where Thronos and I made a fresh start.\u201d Melanthe, let\u2019s begin with a kiss. \u201cThere\u2019s a glade we rested in, where we had our first real connection.\u201d Or reconnection.</p><p>\u201cThen Rydstrom and I will accompany you,\u201d Sabine said. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in that realm\u2019s dragons. We have an extraordinary female here who needs her own stable of males; she\u2019s basically a basilisk rock star\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going alone. If Thronos sees two Sorceri and a rage demon, it\u2019ll put him on guard. And even with no memory of me, he might remember you as Morgana\u2019s henchwoman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPandemonia\u2019s really not that bad once you know the zones. Some parts were even hauntingly beautiful. The dragons can be a problem, but I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Lanthe didn\u2019t expect to arrive there on the same day he did. Which was why she\u2019d packed a bag\u2014and a tent.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t leaving hell without her man. Melanthe, of the Deie Sorceri\u2014late of the lavish Castle Tornin\u2014was going to . . . camp out.</p><p>\u201cSay he lives, Lanthe. Say he can trace. Then say he goes to Pandemonia. If you can somehow find him, how will you handle him? He might be so enraged at Sorceri that he\u2019ll kill you first and ask questions later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to undo Morgana\u2019s curse with a wave of your hand. You\u2019ll have to be fully empowered. She amped up the voltage of your sorcery to astronomical levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Lanthe\u2019s persuasion had been strengthening once more, but would it be enough?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you should restore his memory?\u201d At Lanthe\u2019s glare, Sabine said, \u201cBased on what you told me, he had some issues with how you\u2019ve lived your life. Why not let him be blissfully ignorant? You two could meet and date, as if it\u2019s the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe changed; those issues are resolved. And even if I had no problem lying to him\u2014which I do\u2014I have to let him know that we were together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t fall over in shock when I have a halfling in a few months.\u201d The witch Mariketa had been the one to sense it, telling her: \u201cYou do know you\u2019re totes preggo, right?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe\u2019s biological clock had cried, That\u2019s right, bitches, remember my name!</p><p>Her first reaction had been a muttered \u201cFuck,\u201d \u00e0 la Thronos. But with each passing hour, she\u2019d had time to grow accustomed to the idea. She was now officially elated\u2014or she would be.</p><p>As soon as she located her kid\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cAmusing, sister.\u201d When Sabine saw that she wasn\u2019t joking, she gasped, \u201cMother of gold.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-SIX</p><p>He must\u2019ve damaged his head in the fall. He\u2019s . . . different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wings were wasted by flame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did the king come to be on that mountain?\u201d</p><p>As Thronos completed his nightly patrol of the outpost, he heard his people\u2019s whispers, had been hearing them for a week.</p><p>Some believed he\u2019d traced to the mountain, as a demon might. Some believed he\u2019d been ensorcelled with a protection spell\u2014though Thronos had no idea what would make them think that.</p><p>All of his subjects were wary about their king and their future, and he couldn\u2019t blame them\u2014he wasn\u2019t confident in either of those things himself.</p><p>My mind is not well. . . .</p><p>He descended through a profuse bank of fog, splaying his wings. Since they\u2019d regenerated, flying had become excruciating once more, such a change from the inexplicable reprieve he\u2019d enjoyed.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he dropped to the landing of his elevated cabin, one of many in their outpost. Trees housed thousands more.</p><p>Jasen was already there awaiting him. Each night the two of them met to discuss the day\u2019s events. The male appeared as exhausted as he felt.</p><p>Inside, Thronos took his place at his rough-hewn desk. \u201cAny new developments today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Jasen sat on a simple wooden bench. \u201cThe people remain unsettled. They feel like we\u2019re living on borrowed time.\u201d</p><p>Thronos gazed out his sole window into the night; as usual he could see little past the blanket of mist that enveloped this forest.</p><p>But eventually the humans would find them here. Their wards would not screen them forever. A horde of Vrekeners couldn\u2019t live in the mortal world. Not all together.</p><p>And our unity is our strength.</p><p>\u201cThere is some talk of dividing our numbers, my liege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will not happen.\u201d</p><p>Jasen looked relieved by Thronos\u2019s unequivocal reaction. \u201cBut in one thing, many agree\u2014they want revenge for what we\u2019ve lost. Cadmus stirs the pot for war.\u201d</p><p>Thronos had heard those rumblings as well. \u201cRevenge against a revenge?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid Aristo\u2019s actions not deserve reprisal?\u201d Thronos was more conflicted about that than most. After all, it was his brother who\u2019d brutalized Morgana\u2019s ward. It was his brother who\u2019d waged a silent and relentless predation on her subjects.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying we deserved this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying that everything isn\u2019t black and white. I\u2019m saying that revenge is a zero-sum game. Especially for immortals. If we start it, we\u2019d better be prepared to play it for eternity.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cEven if we come to decide on war, now is not the time.\u201d</p><p>Thronos was in no shape to lead them. He\u2019d been injured in the explosion, and had suffered some kind of damage to his mind\u2014yet it wasn\u2019t healing. He still had gaps in his memory, and his temper had grown short. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could remember a meadow in the Alps of the mortal realm, where he\u2019d played as a boy\u2014but he couldn\u2019t recall what he\u2019d been doing ten nights ago.</p><p>When his thoughts wandered, they always turned to the demon plane of Pandemonia. He knew he\u2019d been there for some reason, narrowly escaping with his life. There\u2019d been dragons, hellhounds, and demon hordes.</p><p>In his daydreams, Thronos mused on the realm\u2019s paths, like The Long Way. He\u2019d avoided it\u2014as most would.</p> <p>Unless one was looking for something. . . .</p><p>Thronos could remember with precise detail every glyph he\u2019d read there\u2014from Behold a temple unequaled to The pest that WAS\u2014but he couldn\u2019t determine how he\u2019d traveled into the belly of a beast.</p><p>Nor how he\u2019d come to be in the lair of a sea god.</p><p>Asides from all these gaps, Thronos felt like he\u2019d forgotten something critical, and that memory churned so close to the surface\u2014maddeningly\u2014like a word on the tip of his tongue that refused to reveal itself.</p><p>His chest ached with a loss so marked that he sometimes thought he\u2019d go insane. He felt as if the glass shard that had so grievously wounded him in his boyhood had again lodged itself beside his heart, but he couldn\u2019t remove it. When he was alone, his claws constantly found his chest and flayed his skin\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWhen will it be time?\u201d Jasen asked.</p><p>Thronos glanced up, nearly startled by the male\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cFor war?\u201d Jasen prompted. \u201cI understand you\u2019re hesitant because of your queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a queen,\u201d Thronos grated, wondering if his knight had suffered head damage as well.</p><p>\u201cYou said the same when I asked if she had survived the explosion. My liege, I\u2019m a simple soldier\u2014I don\u2019t understand pretext as you do. Are we to behave as if she never existed? By your actions, it seems you want to forget she ever lived\u2014but why?\u201d Jasen scrubbed his hand over his face, looking genuinely upset, while Thronos was baffled\u2014and angered\u2014by this outburst.</p><p>\u201cWe know she wasn\u2019t involved in the attack,\u201d Jasen continued. \u201cA few even spied the queen at the lever. Only because of her did we have the alarm in the first place, and then she warned everyone. It could be argued that she saved our species.\u201d</p> <p>Thronos grasped for patience, saying slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2014have\u2014no\u2014queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, my liege.\u201d Jasen sounded rocked with disappointment. \u201cI won\u2019t mention it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you don\u2019t. See that no one does!\u201d Thronos regretted his tone immediately. He knew he was on edge, his ire ever at the ready. Yet moments later, he could never recall what he\u2019d been angered about. \u201cAs for Cadmus and his warmongering, no longer are we hidden and immune to harm. We live in an indefensible outpost. We must approach this coolly. Jasen, if we war, we risk not only defeat\u2014but our very extinction.\u201d</p><p>He was about to pinch his aching temples, but then lowered his hand. Eyes were on him. He needed to look like a competent leader. \u201cUntil we find a place to call home, we should focus on nothing but that.\u201d</p><p>What if we took the long way home . . . ?</p><p>Thronos cut off the idea before it even fully formed. Too far-fetched.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered seeking asylum with another faction?\u201d Jasen asked. \u201cOne within our alliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about asking Rydstrom the Good of the rage demonarchy for refuge in the Grave Realm.\u201d The badlands of Rothkalina, filled with outlaws and dragons. After Pandemonia, dragons no longer gave Thronos pause.</p> <p>This seemed to surprise Jasen.</p><p>\u201cI corresponded with him recently.\u201d Though Thronos didn\u2019t remember about what, or even what had been said. All he remembered was that he\u2019d come away with the idea that Rydstrom was irritating but honorable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re speaking of colonization on a demon plane?\u201d</p><p>The vaguest memory arose. He could hear a muted voice, a female saying, We\u2019re going to go found a Vrekener offshoot colony in a different realm.</p><p>At the memory, Thronos fought the urge to take his head between his hands and squeeze till something cracked. My mind, my mind . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do for now, my king?\u201d</p><p>With effort, Thronos kept his tone even. \u201cWe recover. We plan.\u201d</p><p>Jasen opened his mouth, then closed it. Thronos knew what question the knight had been trying to pose all week\u2014but he didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d answer.</p><p>\u201cMy liege . . . will you tell me how you came to be on that mountain?\u201d Jasen finally dared to ask. \u201cHundreds saw you simply appear.\u201d</p><p>As Thronos had fallen, he\u2019d desperately wanted to reach his people. Air had shrilled over him, his heartbeat booming in his damaged ears. Suddenly a wave of dizziness had overcome him, so fierce he\u2019d had to close his eyes. When he\u2019d opened them, he\u2019d been standing amongst the others.</p><p>I traced for the first time.</p><p>Over the last week, he\u2019d debated revealing his talent. If he had the ability, others would too.</p><p>After his journeys, he\u2019d begun to suspect their blood might be demonic. Hadn\u2019t he recognized that strange script in Pandemonia, as if from a genetic memory? Hadn\u2019t he felt at home in that plane\u2019s harshness? Why was he still so drawn to its untamed and tumultuous lands?</p><p>The ability to trace could be a priceless talent in any upcoming war. But his people had recently lost their king and then their kingdom; Thronos didn\u2019t believe it was the time for them to learn of their demonic origins.</p><p>After arriving at the outpost, he\u2019d given himself just one night to explore his new talent. He\u2019d envisioned the temple of gold. That dizziness had struck him; an instant later, he\u2019d traced there. As he\u2019d run his fingers over the bricks, the feel of that invisible shard in his chest had returned with a vengeance.</p><p>When he\u2019d flown over an eerily silent battle plateau and a river of lava, deeper went the glass.</p><p>And then, arriving in the forest glade\u2014the oasis where he\u2019d rested between his trials\u2014he\u2019d been nearly debilitated by the pain in his chest.</p><p>With a bellow, he\u2019d traced back to the outpost, resolving never to return.</p><p>He\u2019d only made it until the next night, drawn back to Pandemonia. . . . \u201cI will tell you this, Jasen,\u201d he said at length. \u201cYou alone for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my liege?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to reach something badly enough, you will.\u201d</p><p>Jasen\u2019s eyes lit with excitement. \u201cVery good, sir.\u201d Before he left, he turned and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad that you are our king.\u201d</p><p>Thronos wanted only to be a worthy one.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t true. He wanted something else, craved it with a blistering intensity. Yet he couldn\u2019t identify what it was.</p><p>Alone, he made his way to his simple cot, telling himself that he needed to sleep in order to heal. He lay back, the pain in his body flaring even worse at rest.</p><p>Sleep proved elusive. He felt he should be somewhere else, anywhere but here. Agitated didn\u2019t begin to describe the turmoil inside him.</p><p>His shaft started to harden with insistent pulses, as if it had every expectation of releasing. The pressure only aggravated Thronos\u2019s restlessness.</p><p>Perhaps he should make just one more trip. . . .</p><p>The lure proved too great to resist. He closed his eyes and pictured the forest glade, then tensed to trace there.</p><p>From the coolness of his cabin, he teleported into warmth and sprinkling water. He gazed up at towering moonraker trees, marveling anew at the floating bubbles, the drops that couldn\u2019t seem to decide whether to travel up or down.</p><p>Lucky drops.</p><p>Why would he think that? He waved his wing, fanning the bubbles. Such a whimsical gesture, yet for some reason it grieved him. The glass shard was back, gouging through his flesh down to his godsdamned spine. He snatched at his hair, then twisted around to punch the trunk of a moonraker.</p><p>Leave this place of pain. Return to the outpost.</p><p>He made a vow to himself then: he would not ever come back here\u2014until his mind had healed.</p><p>Pandemonia isn\u2019t going anywhere. . . .</p><p>Lanthe sucked in a steadying breath. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she told the group that had assembled in her room.</p><p>Rydstrom had his brawny arms crossed over his chest. Cadeon would have as well if he hadn\u2019t been holding a baby. Holly, also holding a baby, looked worried for Lanthe. Sabine did too, having forgone her illusion of indifference.</p><p>Rydstrom said, \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, Lanthe.\u201d They still wanted to accompany her.</p><p>All of them. Well, except for the twins. Though those little badasses would probably think Pandemonia was great fun.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this,\u201d Lanthe said. \u201cIf Thronos sees huge demons, a Valkyrie, and two Sorceri, it\u2019ll put him on the defensive. Face it, we look like a marauding gang. One more time, guys, I will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Assuming she could even get to Pandemonia, Lanthe was as prepared as she could be. Sabine had insisted she borrow her ability to talk to animals. If a dragon wanted to chat, Lanthe was ready.</p><p>Another loaner? Lanthe wore her sister\u2019s most battle-tested breastplate. As Sabine had grumbled, \u201cYou need extra insurance for my halfling niece or nephew.\u201d Lanthe was also wearing more sensible boots (no stilettos this time) and a pair of second-skin leather pants\u2014might as well squeeze into them while she still could!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to simply run into him there,\u201d Sabine said. \u201cWhat if you miss him?\u201d</p><p>Lanthe marched over to her camping backpack. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m staying there.\u201d</p><p>Jaws dropped.</p><p>Cadeon recovered first. \u201cYou? Camping?\u201d He snorted. \u201cMuch less camping in hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCade.\u201d Holly slapped his chest.</p><p>He muttered, \u201cYou gotta admit that\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>Lanthe piped her lip and blew a braid out of her eyes. Apparently everyone here had forgotten that she\u2019d already camped in hell. Granted, she hadn\u2019t been alone. . . .</p><p>Sabine said, \u201cI was opposed to you going by yourself for just an hour or so! Now you want to go indefinitely? And if you tell me it\u2019s really not that bad there one more time, I might scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve set everything in motion here that I can. In a few days, I\u2019ll check in for news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to provide proof of life,\u201d Rydstrom said.</p><p>Cadeon gave him a damn straight look.</p><p>\u201cIf I haven\u2019t found Thronos in three weeks, I\u2019ll return to summon him. And, Sabine, it\u2019s really not that bad there.\u201d</p><p>When Sabine parted her lips to argue, Lanthe said, \u201cThis baby bird\u2019s gotta fly, sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Sabine drawled. \u201cShe\u2019s already speaking in avian metaphors.\u201d</p><p>Holly chuckled, then made her face serious once more.</p><p>Lanthe gazed at her sister, hating that she worried. But there was nothing she could do about it. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go. I\u2019m recharged, resolved, and ready to do this\u2014on my own.\u201d</p><p>Rydstrom drew Sabine close. \u201cShe\u2019s got a point, cwena.\u201d Demonish for little queen, his nickname for her. \u201cThere comes a time when you just have to trust. I had to do that with Cadeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly took him fifteen hundred years,\u201d Cadeon remarked. Aly blew a bubble and tugged on her pointed ear at the same time, which Cadeon clearly thought was a marvelous feat.</p><p>\u201cAt least leave the portal open,\u201d Sabine said, \u201cuntil we can be sure you even got to the right realm.\u201d</p><p>In a grousing tone, Lanthe muttered, \u201cFine. Just so you won\u2019t worry so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget what we talked about, Lanthe,\u201d Rydstrom told her. Now that he knew what Thronos was really like, he was cordially offering refuge in Rothkalina to every Vrekener. Sabine was grudgingly co-offering it.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that.\u201d But Lanthe had another idea. It was so crazy, she hadn\u2019t mentioned it to a soul. . . .</p><p>Dreaming of reuniting with Thronos and restoring his memory, she felt sorcery coursing through her. She raised her hands and began to open a rift.</p><p>For me\u2014and for our halfling.</p><p>Lanthe directed the door straight to the glade (in theory). Squeezing her eyes shut, she inwardly begged that she\u2019d find floating bubbles\u2014and not a giant stomach.</p><p>FIFTY-SEVEN</p><p>Thronos\u2019s pain continued to escalate.</p><p>He\u2019d decided to leave, but at the last moment he\u2019d felt as if he was on the verge of remembering something. So pain be damned. He remained in the forest glade.</p><p>Thronos knew pain. He could handle it.</p><p>The day was beginning its long, slow fade to twilight. Considering this realm\u2019s sluggish passage of time, he\u2019d already been away from the outpost far too long. But leaving this place would be cowardly. And he was no\u2014</p><p>Movement behind him? He twisted around.</p><p>In the center of this glade, the air blurred. A gap opened, a portal.</p><p>Cautiously stepping from it was the most breathtaking female Thronos had ever seen.</p><p>Long raven hair. Plump red lips. Eyes as blue as the skies he\u2019d lost when his kingdom fell.</p><p>That raw emptiness, that maddening absence began to . . . ease? As if some magnet were pulling him toward her, his feet started to close the distance between them.</p><p>But she was dressed as a sorceress, with a metal headdress and breastplate, an unusual gold necklace\u2014and leather trews that lovingly molded to her generous curves. He scrubbed his palm over his mouth, needing to focus; difficult when treated to such a sight.</p><p>A sorceress might fear he meant her harm. After Morgana, he supposed he should be suspicious of this one as well.</p><p>If he announced himself, would she run back into that portal, lost to him? At the thought, panic seized his chest. Why did he feel like she would run? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She caught sight of him, and her gaze widened, as if with disbelief. She dropped the bag she was carrying, taking a quick step forward, body tensed, those red lips parted.</p><p>He could almost swear she\u2019d been about to leap into his arms before she\u2019d stopped herself. Which couldn\u2019t be right. A trick of the mind.</p><p>Raising his palms, he quickly said, \u201cMy name is Thronos Talos, and I mean you no harm, sorceress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her eyes started to shimmer with a blue metallic gleam. \u201cI don\u2019t mean you any harm either,\u201d said the tiny female\u2014who looked like she couldn\u2019t hurt a fly.</p><p>But with Sorceri, appearances were deceiving.</p><p>Her friendly demeanor emboldened him to step closer to her. He struggled not to limp in front of such a beauty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lanthe.\u201d She looked like running from him was the last thing on her mind. Again, he got the curious impression that she was barely holding herself in place.</p><p>She also showed no surprise at her surroundings, as if she\u2019d been to this glade before. Thronos had half believed he was the only one who knew of it.</p> <p>All around her, surreal drops floated and bubbles bobbed, but she never took her eyes from him. When she tilted her head, her black hair swept over her shoulder, sending tendrils of her scent toward him.</p><p>He inhaled greedily. His muscles shot tight with tension.</p><p>Sky. Home.</p><p>This exquisite creature was . . . his mate. A sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu wracked him. \u201cWill you not close that threshold and speak with me, Lanthe?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, turning back to the portal. She leaned over to poke her head back in. Gods, the body on that female! He didn\u2019t know whether he wanted to kiss her\u2014or crush her in a hug.</p><p>All he knew was that the shard was slowly withdrawing from his chest.</p> <p>Lanthe seemed to be speaking to someone on the other side. Was there another who would yank her back through? Who could ever let such a female go?</p><p>His face fell. How could a woman this incomparable have no mate?</p><p>\u201cYes, right this very minute!\u201d she said to someone unseen. \u201cNot twenty freaking feet behind me!\u201d Pause. \u201cBecause maybe I don\u2019t suck.\u201d Another pause. \u201cFor the love of gold, I don\u2019t need an illusion,\u201d she said in an exasperated tone. \u201cI look fine. I\u2019ll portal soon!\u201d</p><p>Relief rushed through him as soon as the threshold closed.</p><p>\u201cMy sister.\u201d Lanthe rolled her eyes. \u201cFor someone so cool, she\u2019s turned into a mother hen. Weird. So where were we?\u201d She seemed nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in a place like this, sorceress?\u201d A dark thought arose. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve come to spy on me for your queen?\u201d Maybe Morgana sought their total annihilation.</p><p>\u201cI vow to you that I have no loyalties to Morgana. She\u2019s taken much from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have that in common.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your kingdom, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you know of the situation?\u201d</p><p>Seeming to choose her words carefully, she said, \u201cI believe that I\u2019m versed in both sides of the conflict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know Vrekener actions could have prevented the attack. I could have. I should have paid more attention to the former king and his actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blame yourself?\u201d she demanded, as if indignant on his behalf.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this: Let\u2019s not blame anyone. Let\u2019s just fix the situation as best as we can.\u201d</p><p>He liked this sorceress! Playing along, he said, \u201cHow shall we fix it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it even as we speak. But first, tell me\u2014why are you here? What do you hope to find in Pandemonia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I can\u2019t lie.\u201d He ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ve been unwell. In the explosion that destroyed my home, I somehow injured my mind, and I\u2019m not healing. Some of my memories were lost.\u201d Why did he find it so easy to talk to her? Just because she was his fated one? Yet she also felt familiar to him. \u201cI recall traveling to this place, but it\u2019s like looking at a puzzle with half of the pieces missing. Incomplete. I come here in the hopes of remembering.\u201d Sharing these things with her felt like shucking weights from his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can help with that?\u201d she said softly, her voice like a balm.</p><p>Surely this sorceress had to be taken by someone. And even if she wasn\u2019t, the idea of a female like her choosing him was implausible.</p><p>He was scarred, his body and mind battered. He had no wealth, no real home, nothing in the worlds to offer her.</p><p>But I want her. He\u2019d still try. Because he also had nothing to lose.</p><p>Yet when she sidled closer and he drew more deeply of her scent, he detected the faintest hint of . . . another.</p><p>Recognition slammed him, along with a misery so weighty he felt that his knees would buckle. Voice gone hoarse, he said, \u201cSorceress, you\u2019re expecting.\u201d She was taken. \u201cWhere\u2019s your man?\u201d I will challenge him for her. And since the other male would fight to the death for a female like this . . . I will kill him.</p><p>Her eyes misted as she murmured, \u201cI fear the man I knew is lost to me forever.\u201d</p><p>The depths of sadness she conveyed roused a seething jealousy inside him. He wanted her to feel so strongly about him\u2014only him!</p><p>But if the other male was lost . . .</p><p>Then I can have her for my own.</p><p>Lanthe had just probed his mind\u2014and nearly wept.</p><p>She\u2019d found nothing of herself in Thronos\u2019s thoughts, not past today. His blocks were down\u2014he might not even remember that he had them\u2014so she\u2019d searched, and found . . .</p><p>Not a single fleeting memory of a girl named Melanthe.</p><p>A wife. A queen. A best friend.</p><p>How could she make him recall what was no longer there?</p><p>His thoughts troubled her as well. Though he was filled with fury toward the man she loved\u2014unknowingly himself\u2014he was struggling to choke it back so he could speak to her with his full attention, because his \u201cmind was not well.\u201d</p><p>Already, he\u2019d scented that she was his mate. He neared, tentatively, so as not to scare her away. He had no idea he\u2019d never be rid of her.</p><p>When drops from the canopy kissed her face, he drew his wings over his head, creating a shelter. \u201cI\u2019ve always room for you too.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. As she met him halfway, she gazed up at him, taking in his exhausted mien, his troubled gray eyes. He didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d eaten or slept since they\u2019d been separated, and his wings had reverted to their gnarled and twisted state. She\u2019d noticed him trying to conceal his limp in front of her.</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t his Lanthe anymore. She was a mysterious woman\u2014his fated one\u2014and he longed to impress her.</p><p>Yes, she would start over with him and tell him about their past, but how could she adequately put their journey into words?</p><p>Overcoming impossible odds. Defying death and learning to trust. Coming to love each other again.</p><p>Reminded of all they\u2019d beaten, she set her jaw. I\u2019m getting my Vrekener back. She would juice him with all the power in her body if she had to.</p><p>She\u2019d done it for Sabine; she\u2019d do it for him. When he stood before her, Lanthe said, \u201cThronos, if I tell you something crazy, could you try to believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorceress, in these last few weeks, I\u2019ve seen crazy. I\u2019ve lived it.\u201d</p><p>No kidding. \u201cWhat if I told you that we were well acquainted with each other? But you were bespelled to forget me?\u201d</p><p>She debated telling him upfront that they were married (oh, and having a kid!), but decided against it. She didn\u2019t want him to believe she was a lock, didn\u2019t want him complacent. For now, she needed him to ache for her\u2014as badly as she did for him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how I could ever forget you. Lanthe, I believe that you are my mate.\u201d He eased even closer to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t look surprised by this news?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBefore Morgana destroyed your kingdom, she erased all your memories of me.\u201d Voice going throaty, Lanthe said, \u201cBut, Thronos, we knew each other.\u201d</p><p>He was in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019ve known you?\u201d As if testing the waters, he tentatively smoothed her hair behind her ear, his hand trailing down to her face . . . to her neck . . . to her collarbone . . .</p><p>When she didn\u2019t stop him, in fact arched to his touch, a shocked breath escaped him.</p><p>Puh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Thronos. I want to make you remember that and everything else. Because our story is epic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this possible? It would explain so much. . . .\u201d He swallowed thickly, as if he were starting to believe\u2014to hope. \u201cHow would you restore my memory? Understand me, sorceress: I can\u2019t express how fiercely I covet these memories. How I covet you.\u201d</p><p>She laid her palm on his chest; his heart thundered. \u201cI\u2019ll need to use my sorcery on you.\u201d It radiated from her palms. \u201cCan you trust me to make this right?\u201d</p><p>Ever brave, he squared his shoulders. \u201cDo as you will, Lanthe. I\u2019ve nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>She shook away any thoughts about her on-the-fritz power or her sorcery limitations. Yes, Morgana was stronger. Yes, the queen had packed one hell of a persuasive punch.</p><p>But love would triumph.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Lanthe pressed her alight palm over his chest as she commanded, \u201cRemember me, Thronos. Remember.\u201d Her sorcery burned brighter, coiling around them, through them. \u201cRemember.\u201d</p><p>The air grew warmer. Subtle tremors rippled beneath their feet. Floating drops of water began to rocket in haphazard directions. \u201cRemember me.\u201d Her voice sounded altered, vibrating with power.</p><p>Sadness seeped into his expression. \u201cI . . . don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only getting started, Vrekener. Just open your mind as much as you can.\u201d</p><p>He got that determined look, the one she\u2019d seen hundreds of times before, the one she couldn\u2019t love more. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember me. Restore your memories. Shake off what Morgana did to you.\u201d To us.</p><p>When he still evinced no recognition, she bit her lip, deciding to reveal more of their past. \u201cDo you feel the need to enclose us in your wings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverwhelmingly. But I don\u2019t want to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Again, as if he were testing the waters, he gradually wrapped his wings around her, enfolding them both completely. His pulselines were lighting like crazy. Her poor Vrekener must be a bewildered mix of nerves and anticipation. \u201cThronos, when we\u2019re like this, we tell each other secrets. Do you want to know some?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe were best friends as children,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust as we are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut we\u2019re so much more. You love me. And I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWildly. Madly.\u201d Maybe a kiss would remind him. Maybe she needed to spur his body as much as his mind. She rose on her toes, cupping his face between her glowing hands, drawing him to her. Within his wings, her iridescent sorcery lit his eyes, joining his surreal pulselines. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew tight. \u201cBy all the gods, yes.\u201d</p><p>Just as he had kissed her after those time loops\u2014so she would kiss him.</p><p>A claiming kiss.</p><p>A no-going-back kiss.</p><p>He went motionless as she brushed her lips over his, once and again. When she slanted her mouth across his, he parted his lips.</p><p>She deepened the contact, slipping in her tongue to tease his. He met her with a groan, and she grew encouraged\u2014as if he\u2019d conceded far more than a kiss.</p><p>He began one of his slow-build love affairs with her mouth, sensuously licking her until her eyes slid shut.</p><p>Her hands shook on his face as their tongues slowly twined. His arms wrapped around her. He palmed the back of her head with one hand, his other dipping toward her ass, as if he couldn\u2019t help himself. His wings tightened around her back even more, squeezing her closer.</p><p>Once they were sharing breaths, she drew back to whisper against his lips, \u201cRemember me, love.\u201d The ground tremors intensified, until even the immense trees shuddered. She felt like a sorcery reactor, stronger than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>Because I\u2019ve never wanted anything like I want him.</p><p>\u201cRemember\u201d\u2014she commanded between seeking kisses\u2014\u201cThronos, please, remember me. I\u2019m waiting for you. Remember, remember, REMEMBER!\u201d Sorcery blasted from her to him.</p><p>Breathless, she drew back.</p><p>His eyes were heavy-lidded, vivid silver. Flickering remnants of blue light sparked around them.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThough I\u2019d like to repeat this process to be sure.\u201d He tenderly brushed the pad of his thumb over her bottom lip. \u201cShall we try again, lamb?\u201d</p><p>He frowned; she beamed.</p><p>Voice roughened, he murmured, \u201cI . . . smell magics on you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes misted again. \u201cThose were the first words you ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>His brow creased as he clearly recollected. \u201cI remember you!\u201d Recognition flared in his gaze. \u201cMy Lanthe.\u201d As they had so long ago, his eyes told her, I\u2019ve been pretty much lost without you.</p><p>\u201cUm, there\u2019s a part in the middle. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already skipped past it,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe don\u2019t dwell on things that have no consequence, and I\u2019m not one to squander my golden\u201d\u2014he kissed her forehead\u2014\u201ccoins.\u201d</p><p>She grinned up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you! I never would\u2019ve given up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lanthe. I knew it before, was going to tell you that night . . .\u201d He trailed off. \u201cAnd you love me too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do. I love us together. I want you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d His smile was glorious. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Our story is epic.\u201d He buried his face in her hair, inhaling\u2014</p><p>His muscles went tense. \u201cWait. I\u2019m to be a father?\u201d His wings fluttered open\u2014as if they were stunned. \u201cWe\u2019re having a baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat were the odds, huh?\u201d she asked wryly. \u201cNow we\u2019ll be an army of three. And I have it on good authority that we can handle this.\u201d</p><p>He swooped her up, spinning her around. Then he slowed, his face falling. He set her back on her feet, his hand dipping to her belly. \u201cI have nothing to offer you. You\u2014and our babe.\u201d His hand shook over her as he said those words. \u201cI have no kingdom. No home. What would you want with a displaced king and faction, living on borrowed time in a mortal forest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur faction could live here in Pandemonia. You felt something for this realm, I know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. But the land is rife with danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the demon hordes?\u201d She waved that away, tugging her necklace up. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that I\u2019m the Keeper of Keys and you\u2019re the Reader of Words. We\u2019ll open both gates and air this place out a bit. Oh, oh, I can speak Dragon now! So we could negotiate some kind of treaty with them\u2014we might have to offer them a hottie Rothkalinan dragoness, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d Lanthe walked her fingers up his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we, like, own Pandemonia. But I\u2019m not not saying that either.\u201d</p> <p>He caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her palm. \u201cYou\u2019d live with me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019d rather live in hell with you than in heaven without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vrekeners will think we\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe they\u2019ll feel a pull to this place, just like you did. In any case, we\u2019ll convince them. I know it\u2019s a bit of a fixer-upper\u201d\u2014she motioned around her\u2014\u201cin need of Vrekener TLC. But it\u2019s nothing that a bucket of paint and some lava dams can\u2019t spruce up!\u201d She stood on her toes, wanting more of his kiss. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this, Thronos.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, his eyes telling her he was about to kiss her till her toes curled. Just before his lips met hers, he rasped, \u201cIf my mate has her heart set on Pandemonia, who am I to deny her?\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-EIGHT</p> <p>What if there\u2019s an even better place than the demon valley?\u201d Thronos asked, his voice roughened from his many bellows to the proverbial rafters. After Lanthe had healed his old injuries once more, he\u2019d made love to her until well after the sun had gone down. Now they lay within the cocoon of his wings, telling secrets. \u201cWhat if we were to lead the Vrekeners to something even greater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She stroked the backs of her fingers over one of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking about one of the paths here: The Long Way. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it must mean something,\u201d Lanthe said, excitement filling her. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what awaits us at the end!\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face. \u201cExactly my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>After dressing, they set off hand in hand into the night. They stepped upon The Long Way\u2014which was anything but straight and narrow.</p><p>Together, they followed its many twists and turns.</p><p>With each league away from the fuming lava and the miasma of the swamp, the air grew cleaner. The sun was beginning its long, slow rise when their army of two (soon to be three) arrived at a lush plain. In the center was a colossal gray-stone mountain wreathed in white clouds and moonrakers. A babbling brook meandered around the trunks.</p> <p>The temperature was cooler here, the morning sun brighter.</p><p>The sky was a dazzling violet.</p><p>\u201cOh, my gold,\u201d Lanthe whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Gaze still on her, he said, \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cAnd what do you think about the mountain?\u201d</p><p>Thronos turned to take it in, canting his head.</p><p>Lanthe saw his chest bow, as if it were filled with too much emotion to be contained.</p><p>He tugged her back against his front, draping a possessive arm over her. \u201cIt smells like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d She sank into him, luxuriating in his warmth. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Pressing a kiss into her hair, Thronos murmured, \u201cIt smells like sky. And home. . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
