The second time? Not so much.</p><p>After cutting five or six more, the blade in her left hand began to feel like an extension of her body, and she started to take it all in stride. The exhilaration subsided, and so did the nausea. There was no longer a rush of anxiety, no longer a racing heartbeat. Blood didn\u2019t faze her. The thrill was gone, and that, in her line of work, was a very good thing.</p><p>Dr. Eleanor Kathleen Sullivan, or Ellie, as she was called by her family and friends, was just two days shy of completing a grueling surgical fellowship in one of the busiest trauma centers in the Midwest. Since trauma was her specialty, she had certainly seen her share of mangled and brutalized bodies. It was her responsibility to put them back together, and as a senior fellow, she had the added duty of training the first- and second-year residents.</p> <p>St. Vincent\u2019s emergency room had been full since four a.m. that morning, and Ellie was completing what she hoped was her last surgery of the day, a repair of a splenic rupture. A teenager, barely old enough to have a driver\u2019s license, had decided to test the limits of the speedometer in his parents\u2019 Camry and had lost control, rolling the car over an embankment and landing upside down in an open field. Lucky for him, he had been wearing a seat belt, and luckier still, a man following some distance behind him had seen the whole thing and was able to call for an ambulance immediately. The boy made it to the emergency room just in time.</p><p>Ellie was observed by three second-year surgical residents, who hung on her every word. She was a natural teacher and, unlike 90 percent of the surgeons on staff at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, didn\u2019t have much of an ego. She was amazingly patient with the medical students and residents. While she worked, she explained\u2014and explained again\u2014until they finally understood what she was doing and why. No question was deemed too insignificant or foolish, which was one of the many reasons they idolized her, and for the male residents, the fact that she was drop-dead gorgeous didn\u2019t hurt. Because she was such a talented surgeon and supportive teacher, all these fledgling doctors fought to sign up for her rotation. Ironically, what most of them didn\u2019t know was that she was younger than most of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re off duty this weekend, aren\u2019t you, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>Ellie glanced over at Dr. Kevin Andrews, the anesthesiologist, who had asked the question. He had joined the staff six months before and, since the day he\u2019d met Ellie, had been hounding her to go out with him. He was an outrageous flirt and yet very sweet. Blond hair, blue eyes, tall, and well built with an adorable smile, he could turn the head of almost every woman in the hospital, but for Ellie there just wasn\u2019t any spark.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she answered. \u201cCharlie, would you like to close up for me?\u201d she asked one of the hovering residents.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely, Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better hurry,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cI\u2019m waking him up.\u201d</p><p>The resident looked panic-stricken.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, Charlie. He\u2019s just messing with you,\u201d she said, a smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cTuesday\u2019s your last day at St. Vincent\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Andrews asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Tuesday\u2019s my last official day. I might help out on a temporary basis later on, but I\u2019m not promising anything yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you could decide to come back permanently.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>He persisted. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you anything you want. You could name your price, your hours . . . you should stay here, Ellie. You belong here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree or disagree. In truth, she didn\u2019t know where she belonged. It had been such a hard road to get this far, she hadn\u2019t had time to think about the future. At least that was the excuse she used for her indecision.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she finally conceded. \u201cI just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>She stood over Charlie, watching like a mother hen. \u201cI want those stitches tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Monday night is my last chance to take you to heaven?\u201d Andrews asked in a teasing drawl.</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cHeaven? Last week you were going to rock my world. Now you\u2019re going to take me to heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee it. I\u2019ve got testimonials if you want to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>As she checked the last suture, she rolled her shoulders and stretched her neck to one side then the other to get the kinks out. She\u2019d been in the OR since five a.m., which meant she had been bent over patients for eleven hours. Sad to say, that wasn\u2019t a record for her.</p><p>She felt wrung out and stiff and sore. A good run around the park would get those muscles moving, she decided, maybe even rev up her energy.</p><p>\u201cYou know what would help you get rid of a stiff neck?\u201d Andrews said.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. A trip to heaven?\u201d</p><p>One of the nurses snorted with laughter. \u201cHe\u2019s awfully persistent, Dr. Sullivan. Maybe you should give in.\u201d</p><p>Ellie removed her gloves and dropped them in the trash bag by the OR doors. \u201cThanks, Megan, but I think I\u2019ll just go for a run instead.\u201d As she pushed the doors wide, she untied her surgical mask and pulled off her cap, shaking her blond hair loose to fall to her shoulders.</p><p>Twenty minutes later she was officially off duty. She changed into her workout clothes, a pair of faded red shorts and a white tank top. She double tied her beat-up running shoes, grabbed a rubber band and swept her hair up in a pony tail, slipped her iPod into one pocket and her cell phone into the other, and she was ready. Walking a maze of corridors to get outside, she avoided the direct route through the ER for fear she\u2019d get waylaid with another case.</p><p>There was never a lack of patients rolling through the doors. Along with the usual emergencies\u2014the car accidents, the heart attacks, the work injuries\u2014the ER saw a steady stream of victims of violent crimes. The vast majority were young men. Gangs roamed the area east of the highway, and shooting one another seemed to be a nightly sport. Since St. Vincent\u2019s was the largest trauma center in St. Louis, all the serious cases came to them. Weekends were a nightmare for the staff. There were times, especially during the hot summer months, when gurneys lined the halls of the ER with patients handcuffed to the railings while they waited to go into surgery. Additional police had to be routinely called in to monitor them to make certain one gang member hadn\u2019t been placed too close to a rival.</p><p>Ellie became a member of the One Hundred Club when she removed her one hundredth bullet. It wasn\u2019t a club she wanted to join, but she would always remember the case. The young man was only twenty years old, and it was the third time he\u2019d been shot. She couldn\u2019t forget his insolence and his cold, empty eyes. They were almost as lifeless as the cadavers\u2019 down in the morgue. Patching up these boys so that they could return to the streets and the same violence was heart wrenching, and she prayed, with every surgery, that this time they would learn something, that this time they would find a new life. It was a naive hope, but she clung to it anyway.</p><p>Like the other overworked and underpaid residents and fellows, Ellie operated on broken bodies, the consequence of violence. But she had never actually witnessed a crime . . . until today.</p><p>It was a hot and humid late afternoon. Two medical students had caught up with Ellie just as she began her run on the one-mile track in Cambridge Park, a vast area that sat adjacent to the hospital. Heavy rain clouds hung over them, and all three panted for air. After the first mile, both students dropped out, but Ellie was determined to get in at least one more mile before calling it quits and heading home. She made mental lists as she ran. She had a million things to do this weekend before flying to Winston Falls.</p><p>Dear God, it was muggy. The humidity was so thick, she felt as though she were running through a sauna. Sweat trickled down the back of her neck, and her drenched clothes clung to her body. Her friend Jennifer, a nurse in pediatrics, who was taking a shortcut across the track to get to the ER entrance, shouted to Ellie that she was crazy to run in this heat. Ellie waved and continued on. She probably was crazy, but getting any time to work out was such a luxury, she couldn\u2019t afford to be choosy about the weather.</p><p>Ellie could hear faint cheering coming from the new soccer field across the street to the north, and as she rounded the curve, she saw the players, high school-age girls, sprinting across the field. From the large number of fans in the bleachers, she guessed it was an important game.</p><p>The administrator of the hospital, the board, and a plethora of attorneys had fought the soccer field. They wanted to purchase the land to build another huge parking garage, and Ellie was happy they had lost their bid. Like the track and small playground to the south, the soccer field was far enough away from the hospital that, no matter how much noise the teams and fans made, the patients weren\u2019t disturbed.</p><p>Ellie was a football, basketball, and soccer fan, in that order. She loved to watch most sporting events. She admired the grace, skill, and finesse of the players, probably because she didn\u2019t possess any of those attributes herself. She had been such an awkward child, her mother had enrolled her in ballet classes, and she never got to play a sport. When she wasn\u2019t tripping over her own feet trying to do a pli\u00e9, she was reading. She was much more comfortable with her books. Her uncle Matthew liked to call her a bookworm.</p><p>No time to watch any games today, she thought. She had way too much to do. She returned to her mental list of things to be accomplished before she could head home to her sister\u2019s wedding. Oh God, how she dreaded that. She wished she had another week to get ready for the ordeal; then admitted to herself that no amount of time would prepare her for the whispers and the sympathetic smiles from her friends and family. Who could blame them? After all, her sister Ava was marrying Ellie\u2019s fianc\u00e9. It was going to be a week of mortification, she decided. But, hey, she was tough. She could handle it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And then there was Evan Patterson. Just thinking about him made her stomach hurt. Would he dare show up in Winston Falls? God, she hoped not. But if he did, would she need to get another restraining order, even if she was going to be home for only a few days? She could feel herself getting worked up and had to force herself to calm down. She was an adult now, and she could handle anything that came her way. Even a maniac, she told herself. Besides, she was sure Evan wasn\u2019t back in Winston Falls. If he had returned, her father would have alerted her.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t want to worry about Patterson now, or think about the wedding. Instead, she chose to focus on the task at hand. Just a little more than a half mile to go, then a lovely cold shower. She took her earphones from her pocket and was about to turn on her iPod to listen to a lecture on new thoracotomy procedures when she heard a loud pop.</p><p>Ellie stopped running. Lightning? She looked up at the ominous sky just as another pop echoed, then a third and a fourth in rapid succession. Had lightning hit a transformer? That would explain the bursts . . . except there hadn\u2019t been any lightning.</p><p>Gunshots? Had to be. As many bullets as Ellie had removed from gunshot victims, she\u2019d never actually heard the sound of a gun firing. The noise came from somewhere up ahead. She glanced to the right toward the soccer field. No panic there. The game was still going on, so she had to be wrong. If not gunshots . . . then what?</p><p>No more than five or six seconds had passed since the first popping sound. Ellie reached for her earphones again. Okay, she\u2019d been mistaken.</p><p>Then the screaming started.</p><p>Everything happened so fast. In the span of just a few more seconds, Ellie observed the chaotic scene unfold in front of her as though it were happening in slow motion.</p><p>In the distance, several men, wearing navy blue T-shirts with FBI in bold yellow letters printed on the back, appeared almost out of nowhere and fanned out as they raced toward the trees in the center of the park. People were scattering every which way. Screams mingled with the cheers from the soccer field, the fans and players apparently oblivious to what was happening. A father ran from the playground toward the street with two little boys. The children weren\u2019t able to keep up, so the father scooped them into his arms and kept running. Several people who had been strolling through the park also scrambled to get away, as did three boys who had been tossing a Frisbee. One of the boys ran into the street, directly in front of an ambulance returning to the hospital. The vehicle came to a screeching halt, and the boy rushed around to the open window shouting something to the paramedic as he pointed toward the trees.</p><p>Suddenly, a man and a woman, linked arm in arm, drew her attention. They walked briskly toward her on the running path. There was something off about both of them. The man had a thick mustache. He wore dark glasses, a baseball cap pulled down over his forehead, and a brown, hooded windbreaker zipped up to his neck, a peculiar choice in the ninety-degree weather. Was he all bundled up to keep his clothes dry when the storm broke? The man looked over his shoulder, his neck glistening with sweat. The woman looked directly at Ellie. Her bizarre appearance was startling. A short black wig sat slightly askew on her head with a few long hairs hanging down the side of her neck. Her eyes were such an intense, unnatural shade of green, she looked as though she were wearing novelty contacts, the ones you\u2019d buy for a Halloween party. When the couple was about thirty feet away from Ellie, they veered toward the street.</p><p>Someone shouted a command. Then one of the FBI agents who had run into the trees appeared and headed straight for the pair. The woman let go of the man and began to run as he slowed and pulled something from his coat pocket. When he whirled around to face the agent shouting at him, Ellie saw the gun. Before she could react, he\u2019d fired two shots. The first bullet struck the man in pursuit, the force so great it knocked him back before he crashed to the ground. The second bullet went wild. As Ellie dived to the grass, the shooter spun around and pointed the gun toward her. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but instead ran to the street and jumped into a car that sped away.</p><p>The ambulance had just turned around to go in the direction the boys were pointing, but when the gunshots were fired, it changed course. Sirens on, the ambulance crossed over the curb and swerved to miss the hospital emergency entrance sign. It bounded across the park toward the gunshot victim, weaving in and out of the crowd that was scrambling toward the boulevard.</p><p>Ellie jumped to her feet and ran after it. Her mind was racing. Who were the surgeons on call tonight? Edmonds and Walmer, she remembered, and she\u2019d seen both of them in the hospital. Good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The target had been a good distance away from the shooter, but he\u2019d taken a direct hit to the torso. Ellie had no idea how bad the wound was, but she thought, if she could stabilize him, he\u2019d make it to the OR.</p><p>The ambulance crossed the grassy area of the park in no time and stopped a few feet away from the downed man. Two paramedics leapt to the ground. Ellie recognized them: Mary Lynn Scott and Russell Probst. Russell opened the back doors and pulled out the gurney while Mary Lynn reached for the large, orange trauma bag and rushed forward, sliding to her knees beside the victim. By the time Ellie reached the scene, armed agents had surrounded him. One knelt on the ground talking to the man, trying to keep him calm, while two others stood over him.</p><p>An agent, taller than the other two and much more muscular through the shoulders, blocked her view. He barely glanced at her as he brusquely ordered, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to see this. Go back to your soccer game.\u201d</p><p>Go back to your game? Was he serious? Ellie was about to protest when one of the paramedics looked up, spotted her, and shouted, \u201cOh, thank God. Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p> <p>All three agents looked at her skeptically and then slowly stepped aside so that she could get past. Mary Lynn tossed her a pair of gloves, and Ellie pulled them on as she knelt down beside the man to assess the injury. Blood saturated the man\u2019s shirt. She gently lifted the compress Mary Lynn had pressed to his shoulder, saw the damage, and immediately sought to stem the bleeding. While she gave orders to Russell and Mary Lynn, she kept her voice steady. The patient was conscious, and she didn\u2019t want him to panic.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She made it a point never to lie to a patient. That didn\u2019t mean she had to be brutally honest, however. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, but I\u2019ve seen much worse, much worse.\u201d</p><p>Russell handed her a clamp, and she found the source of the bleeding. The bullet hadn\u2019t gone through but had made quite an entrance.</p><p>Once Mary Lynn had gotten the IV line in, Ellie nodded to her to begin the drip.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked as she began packing the wound.</p><p>\u201cSean . . . Sean . . . ah, hell, I can\u2019t remember my last name.\u201d His eyelids began to flutter as he struggled to stay conscious.</p><p>The agent kneeling behind him said, \u201cGoodman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d Sean said, his voice growing weaker.</p><p>\u201cCan you remember if you\u2019re allergic to anything?\u201d Mary Lynn asked.</p><p>\u201cJust bullets.\u201d Sean stared at Ellie through half-closed eyes. \u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, flashing a smile. She finished packing the wound and leaned back on her heels.</p><p>\u201cDr. Sullivan\u2019s a trauma surgeon,\u201d Russell explained. \u201cIf you had to get shot, she\u2019s the one you want operating on you. She\u2019s the best there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, he\u2019s stable. You can take him,\u201d Ellie said as she peeled off her gloves and dropped them in the plastic container Mary Lynn opened for her.</p><p>Sean suddenly grabbed her arm, his grip surprisingly strong. \u201cWait . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to marry Sara. Am I going to see her again?\u201d</p><p>She leaned over him. \u201cYes, you will,\u201d she said. \u201cBut first you\u2019re going into the OR to get that bullet out. Now sleep. It\u2019s all good. The surgeon will take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s on tonight?\u201d Russell asked.</p> <p>\u201cEdmonds and Walmer,\u201d Mary Lynn answered.</p><p>Sean tightened his hold on Ellie\u2019s arm. \u201cI want you.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to respond but held tight and forced himself to stay awake as he repeated, \u201cHe said you\u2019re the best. I want you to operate.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on top of his and nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>She stood and stepped back to get out of the way so that the paramedics could put Sean into the ambulance but was stopped by something solid. It felt as though she\u2019d just backed into a slab of granite. The agent who had told her to go back to her soccer game was blocking her exit with his warm, hard chest. He put his hands on her shoulders to steady her, then let go. When he still didn\u2019t get out of her way, she stood her ground pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cDr. Sullivan, do you want to ride with us?\u201d Russell called out.</p><p>\u201cNo, go ahead. He\u2019s stable now.\u201d</p><p>Russell swung the doors shut, jumped into the driver\u2019s seat, and the ambulance was on its way.</p><p>Ellie turned to the agent who had been kneeling with Sean. \u201cWas anyone else hurt?\u201d</p><p>The granite wall behind her answered. \u201cNot hurt, dead.\u201d He was very matter-of-fact.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t ours,\u201d another agent explained. \u201cThey were wanted men.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and came face to shoulders with the most intimidating man she\u2019d ever seen, and that was saying something considering the monster chief of surgery she worked under. This man didn\u2019t look anything like him, though. The agent was tall, dark, and scary, with thick black hair and penetrating, steely gray eyes. His firm square jaw was covered with at least one day\u2019s growth of beard, maybe two. He looked as though he hadn\u2019t slept in at least twenty-four hours, a look she knew all too well.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s heart skipped a beat. The man could scare the quills off a porcupine. But, oh God, was he sexy! Ellie gave herself a mental slap. An intimidating man who was built like a monument and could melt iron with his menacing glare\u2014this was what she was attracted to?</p><p>The agent who had been kneeling stepped forward and put out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Agent Tom Bradley. Sean Goodman\u2019s my partner.\u201d He introduced her to the agent on his left and then to the man in front of her. \u201cAgent Max Daniels.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get to the OR.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for permission, but turned and ran back to the hospital.</p><p>Thirty minutes later she was dropping the bullet she\u2019d retrieved from Sean\u2019s shoulder into a small metal pan. \u201cBag it and get it to one of the agents waiting outside. You know the drill.\u201d</p><p>Then the real work of repairing the damage began. Ellie had learned over the years that there was no such thing as a simple bullet wound. Bullets had a way of doing considerable damage before settling, but Agent Goodman was lucky. His bullet hadn\u2019t penetrated any major organs or nerves.</p><p>Once she\u2019d closed, she followed the patient to recovery, wrote orders, and went to talk to the crowd gathered in the surgical waiting room. A dozen people with worried faces sat waiting for the news. Agent Daniels was standing, leaning against the wall with his arms across his chest. His gaze followed her as she entered the room, and her heart began to race. She knew she looked a mess. She pulled off her cap and threaded her fingers through her hair. Why in heaven\u2019s name she wanted to look good for him was beyond her comprehension, and yet she did.</p><p>\u201cThe surgeon\u2019s here,\u201d Daniels announced.</p><p>A petite young woman jumped up and rushed forward, followed by Agent Bradley and a crowd of worried relatives.</p><p>\u201cThe surgery went well,\u201d she began and then explained some of what she had repaired, trying not to be too technical. \u201cI expect him to make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>Sara, his fianc\u00e9e, was crying as she stammered her thank-you. She shook Ellie\u2019s hand and held on to it.</p><p>\u201cYou can see him in about an hour,\u201d Ellie told her. \u201cHe\u2019s heavily sedated and he\u2019s not going to know you\u2019re there,\u201d she warned. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in recovery for a while, then they\u2019ll take him to ICU. Once the nurses in ICU have him settled, they\u2019ll send someone to get you. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>A frazzled-looking nurse appeared in the doorway. \u201cDr. Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind looking at Mrs. Klein for us? She\u2019s Edmond\u2019s patient, but he\u2019s in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>She patted Sara\u2019s hand and pulled free. \u201cAll right then. It\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Agent Daniels smile as she turned to leave. She walked down the corridor and had just turned the corner when he caught up with her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>She turned around.

Who is the most esteemed in God\u2019s eyes?\u201d the student asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t the apostles stand first in God\u2019s good graces?\u201d the second student inquired.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d replied the wise bishop. \u201cThe archangel Gabriel, protector of women and children, our champion of the innocents, stands first above all others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho next then?\u201d the first student asked.</p><p>\u201cAll the other angels, of course,\u201d the bishop answered. \u201cNext stand the apostles, with Peter first among the twelve, and then follow the prophets and miracle workers and those good teachers of God\u2019s word on earth. Last in heaven stand all the other saints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who is the most important here on earth, Bishop Hallwick? Who is most blessed in God\u2019s eyes here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d came the immediate reply. \u201cAnd the highest and most important among men is our holy pope.\u201d</p><p>The two students nodded acceptance of that dictate. Thomas, the elder of the two young men, leaned forward on his perch atop the stone wall outside the sanctuary. His brow was wrinkled with concentration. \u201cNext in God\u2019s love stand the cardinals and then the other ordained men of God,\u201d he interjected.</p><p>\u201cThat is so,\u201d the bishop agreed, pleased with his student\u2019s guess.</p><p>\u201cBut who stands next in importance?\u201d the second student asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy the rulers of kingdoms here on earth,\u201d the bishop explained. He sat down in the center of the wooden bench, spread his ornately decorated black robes, and then added, \u201cThose leaders who fatten the church\u2019s treasury are more loved by God, of course, than those who hoard gold for their own pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Three more young men walked over to listen to their holy leader\u2019s lecture. They settled themselves in a half circle at the bishop\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cDo married and then unmarried men stand next?\u201d Thomas asked.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the bishop replied. \u201cAnd they are of the same position as the merchants and the sheriffs but just above the serfs chained to the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho next, Bishop?\u201d the second student asked.</p><p>\u201cThe animals, starting with the most loyal, man\u2019s dog,\u201d the bishop answered, \u201cand ending with the dull-witted oxen. There, I believe I have given you the full hierarchy to repeat to your students once you have taken your vows and are ordained men of God.\u201d</p><p>Thomas shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten women, Bishop Hallwick. Where do they stand in God\u2019s love?\u201d</p><p>The bishop rubbed his brow while he considered the question. \u201cI have not forgotten women,\u201d he finally said. \u201cThey are last in God\u2019s love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelow dull-witted oxen?\u201d the second student asked.</p><p>\u201cAye, below oxen.\u201d</p><p>The three young men seated on the ground immediately nodded their agreement.</p><p>\u201cBishop?\u201d Thomas asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is it, my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you given us God\u2019s hierarchy or the church\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>The bishop was appalled by the question. It smelled blasphemous to him. \u201cThey are the same, are they not?\u201d</p><p>A great number of men who lived in the early centuries did believe that God\u2019s views were always accurately interpreted by the church.</p> <p>Some women knew better. This is a story about one of them.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>England, 1206</p><p>The news was going to destroy her.</p><p>Kelmet, her faithful steward and senior in charge since Baron Raulf Williamson\u2019s hasty departure from England on the king\u2019s personal business, was given the responsibility of telling his mistress the god-awful news. The servant didn\u2019t put off the dreaded task, for he guessed Lady Johanna would wish to question the two messengers before they returned to London, if his mistress could speak to anyone after she\u2019d heard about her beloved husband.</p> <p>Aye, he needed to tell the gentle lady as soon as possible. Kelmet understood his duty well enough, and though he believed he was anxious to get it done, his feet still dragged as though mired in knee-deep mud as he made his way to the newly built chapel where Lady Johanna was in afternoon prayers.</p><p>Father Peter MacKechnie, a visiting cleric from the Maclaurin holding in the Highlands, was making his way up the steep incline from the lower bailey when Kelmet happened to spot him. The steward let out a quick sigh of relief before shouting a summons to the dour-faced priest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve need of your services, MacKechnie,\u201d Kelmet bellowed over the rising wind.</p><p>The priest nodded, then scowled. He still hadn\u2019t forgiven the steward for his insulting behavior of two days past.</p><p>\u201cAre you wanting me to hear your confession?\u201d the priest shouted back, a hint of mockery in his thick brogue.</p><p>\u201cNay, Father.\u201d</p> <p>MacKechnie shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a black soul, Kelmet.\u201d</p><p>The steward made no response to the barb but patiently waited until the dark-haired Scot had gained his side. He could see the amusement in the priest\u2019s eyes and knew then he was jesting with him.</p><p>\u201cThere is another matter more important than my confession,\u201d Kelmet began. \u201cI\u2019ve just received word . . .\u201d</p><p>The priest wouldn\u2019t let him finish his explanation. \u201cToday\u2019s Good Friday.\u201d he interrupted. \u201cNothing could be more important than that. You won\u2019t be getting communion from me come Easter morning unless you confess your sins today and beg God\u2019s forgiveness. You might begin with the distasteful sin of rudeness, Kelmet. Aye, that would be a proper start.\u201d</p><p>Kelmet held his patience. \u201cI gave you my apology, Father, but I see that you still haven\u2019t forgiven me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The steward frowned. \u201cAs I explained yesterday and the day before, I would not allow you entrance into the keep because I was given specific orders by Baron Raulf not to let anyone inside while he was away. I was told even to deny Lady Johanna\u2019s brother, Nicholas, entry should he come calling. Father, try to understand. I\u2019m the third steward here in less than one year\u2019s time, and I try only to hold onto my position longer than all the others.\u201d</p><p>MacKechnie snorted. He wasn\u2019t quite through baiting the steward. \u201cIf Lady Johanna hadn\u2019t intervened, I\u2019d still be camped outside the walls, wouldn\u2019t I now?\u201d</p> <p>Kelmet nodded. \u201cAye, you would,\u201d he admitted. \u201cUnless you gave up your vigil and returned home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be going anywhere until I\u2019ve spoken to Baron Raulf and set him straight about the havoc his vassal is causing on Maclaurin land. Plain murder of innocents is going on, Kelmet, but I\u2019m praying your baron doesn\u2019t have any idea what an evil, power-hungry man Marshall has turned out to be. I\u2019ve heard it said Baron Raulf\u2019s an honorable man. I hope that praise be true, for he must right this atrocity with all possible haste. Why, even now some of the Maclaurin soldiers are turning to the bastard MacBain for assistance. Once they\u2019ve given him their pledge of loyalty and named him laird, all hell\u2019s going to break free. MacBain will go to war against Marshall and every other Englishman preying on Maclaurin land. The Highland warrior is no stranger to fury or vengeance, and I\u2019d wager my soul even Baron Raulf\u2019s hide will be in jeopardy once MacBain sees for himself the rape of the Maclaurin land by the infidels your baron placed in charge.\u201d</p><p>Kelmet, although not personally involved in the plight of the Scots, was still caught up in the story. There was also the fact that the priest was inadvertently aiding him in putting off his dreaded task. A few more minutes surely wouldn\u2019t hurt, Kelmet thought to himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting this MacBain warrior would come to England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting,\u201d the priest countered. \u201cI\u2019m stating fact. Your baron won\u2019t have the slightest inkling he\u2019s here either until he feels MacBain\u2019s blade at his throat. It will be too late then, of course.\u201d</p><p>The steward shook his head. \u201cBaron Raulf\u2019s soldiers would kill him before he even reached the drawbridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d never get the chance,\u201d MacKechnie announced, his voice firm with conviction.</p><p>\u201cYou make this warrior sound invincible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking he could be. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ve never met another like him. I won\u2019t chill you with the tales I\u2019ve heard about the MacBain. Suffice it to say you don\u2019t want his wrath pouring down on this keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it matters now, Father,\u201d Kelmet whispered, his tone weary.</p><p>\u201cOh, it matters all right,\u201d the priest snapped. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait to see your baron for as long as need be. The matter is too grave for impatience to take hold.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie paused to gather his control. He knew the Maclaurin issue was of no concern to the steward, yet once he started to explain, the anger he\u2019d been carefully guarding inside spilled out and he wasn\u2019t able to keep the fury out of his voice. He forced himself to speak in a much calmer voice when he changed the topic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a sinner, Kelmet, with the soul of an old dog, but you\u2019re an honest man trying to do your duty. God will remember that when you stand before Him on Judgment Day. If you\u2019re not wanting me to hear your confession now, then what service do you require?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your assistance with Lady Johanna, Father. Word has just arrived from King John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d MacKechnie prodded when the steward didn\u2019t immediately continue his explanation.</p><p>\u201cBaron Raulf is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord above, you cannot mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Father.\u201d</p><p>MacKechnie gave a harsh gasp, then hastily made the sign of the cross. He bowed his head, pressed his hands together, and whispered a prayer for the baron\u2019s soul.</p><p>The wind sent the hem of the priest\u2019s black cassock slapping against his legs, but MacKechnie was too intent on his prayers to pay any attention. Kelmet turned his gaze to the sky. The clouds were black, swollen, and being nudged overhead by an insistent, howling wind. The sound of the storm\u2019s advance was eerie, ominous . . . fitting.</p><p>The priest finished his prayer, made another sign of the cross, and then turned his attention to the steward again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me right away? Why did you let me go on and on? You should have interrupted me. Praise God, what will happen to the Maclaurins now?\u201d</p><p>Kelmet shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have any answers for you. Father, regarding the baron\u2019s holding in the Highlands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me right off,\u201d the priest said again, still staggered by the black news.</p><p>\u201cA few more minutes makes no difference,\u201d Kelmet replied. \u201cAnd perhaps I was putting off this task by keeping you in conversation. It is my duty to inform Lady Johanna, you see, and I would greatly appreciate your help. She\u2019s so young, so innocent of treachery. Her heart is going to be broken.\u201d</p><p>MacKechnie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve known your mistress for only two short days, but I\u2019ve already seen she has a gentle nature and a pure heart. I\u2019m not certain I can be of much help though. Your mistress seems to be very frightened of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fears most priests, Father. She has sound reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that reason be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer confessor is Bishop Hallwick.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie frowned. \u201cYou needn\u2019t say another word,\u201d he muttered with disgust. \u201cHallwick\u2019s wicked reputation is well known, even in the Highlands. No wonder the lass is fearful. It\u2019s a wonder she came to my aid and insisted you let me in, Kelmet. That took courage, I\u2019m realizing now. The poor lass,\u201d he added with a sigh. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t deserve the pain of losing her beloved husband at such a tender age. How long has she been married to the baron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been his wife for over three years. Lady Johanna was little more than a child when she was wed. Father, please come with me to the chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>The two men walked side by side. Kelmet\u2019s voice was halting when he next spoke. \u201cI know I won\u2019t have the proper words. I\u2019m not certain . . . how to say . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe direct,\u201d the priest advised. \u201cShe\u2019ll appreciate that. Don\u2019t make her guess by giving her hints. Perhaps it would do us well to fetch a woman to help comfort your mistress. Lady Johanna will surely need another woman\u2019s compassion as well as our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who I would ask,\u201d Kelmet admitted. \u201cJust the day before Baron Raulf left, he replaced the entire household staff yet again. My lady barely knows the servants\u2019 names. There have been so many of them. My mistress keeps to herself these days,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s very kind, Father, but distant from her staff, and she has learned to hold her own council. \u2019Tis the truth she has no confidantes we could bring along with us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has Baron Raulf been away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear to six months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet in all that while, Lady Johanna hasn\u2019t come to depend upon anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Father. She confides in no one, not even her steward,\u201d Kelmet said, referring to himself. \u201cThe baron told us he would only be away for a week or two, and we\u2019ve been living with the expectation of his arrival home each and every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost his footing and fell from a cliff.\u201d The steward shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m certain there\u2019s more to the explanation than I\u2019ve been told, for Baron Raulf wasn\u2019t an awkward man. Perhaps the king will tell Lady Johanna more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA freak accident then,\u201d the priest decided. \u201cGod\u2019s will be done,\u201d he added almost as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been the devil\u2019s work,\u201d Kelmet muttered.</p><p>MacKechnie didn\u2019t remark on that possibility. \u201cLady Johanna will surely marry again,\u201d he announced with a nod. \u201cShe\u2019ll inherit a sizable amount, won\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll gain a third of her husband\u2019s holdings. I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re vast,\u201d Kelmet explained.</p><p>\u201cMight one of those holdings be the Maclaurin land your King John stole away from Scotland\u2019s king and gave to Baron Raulf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Kelmet allowed.</p><p>MacKechnie filed that information away for future use. \u201cWith your lady\u2019s golden-colored hair and handsome blue eyes, I would imagine every unattached baron in England will want to marry her. She\u2019s very beautiful, and though it\u2019s probably sinful of me to admit. I\u2019ll tell you I was quite affected by the sight of her. Her appearance could easily bewitch a man, even without the estate she\u2019ll have to offer. \u201d</p><p>They reached the narrow steps leading up to the chapel doors when the priest finished his remarks.</p><p>\u201cShe is beautiful,\u201d the steward agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen grown men openly gawk at her. Barons will certainly want her,\u201d he added, \u201cbut not in marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat nonsense is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s barren,\u201d Kelmet said.</p><p>The priest\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDear God,\u201d he whispered. He lowered his head, made the sign of the cross, and said a prayer for the dear lady\u2019s burden.</p><p>Lady Johanna was also in prayer. She stood behind the altar and said a prayer for guidance. She was determined to do the right thing. She held a parchment scroll in her hands, and when she finished her plea to God, she wrapped the scroll in linen cloths she had already spread on top of the marble surface.</p><p>She once again considered destroying the damning evidence against her king. Then she shook her head. Someday, someone might find the scroll, and if only one man learned the truth about the evil king who once ruled England, then perhaps a thread of justice might be served.</p><p>Johanna placed the scroll between the two marble slabs below the altar top. She made certain it was hidden from view and protected from damage. Then she said another quick prayer, genuflected, and walked down the aisle. She opened the door to go outside.</p><p>The conversation between Father MacKechnie and Kelmet immediately stopped.</p><p>The sight of Lady Johanna still affected the priest, and he acknowledged the truth without feeling a qualm of guilt. MacKechnie didn\u2019t consider himself caught by the sin of lust because he noticed the shimmer in her hair or stared a bit longer than necessary at her lovely face. In his mind, Johanna was simply one of God\u2019s creatures, a magnificent example, to be sure, of the Lord\u2019s ability to create perfection.</p><p>She was Saxon through and through with her high cheekbones and fair coloring. She was a little shorter in stature than others, for she was of only medium height, but she appeared taller to the priest because of the queenly way she held herself.</p><p>Aye, her appearance pleased the priest, and he was certain she pleased her God as well, as she truly possessed a kind and gentle heart.</p><p>MacKechnie was a compassionate man. He ached over the cruel blow the dear lady had already been given. A barren woman served no purpose in this kingdom. Her very reason for existing had been snatched away. The burden she carried, knowing of her own inferiority, was surely the reason he\u2019d never seen her smile.</p><p>And now they were about to give her another cruel blow. \u201cMight we have a word with you, m\u2019lady?\u201d Kelmet asked.</p><p>The steward\u2019s tone of voice must have alerted her that something was amiss. A guarded look came into her eyes, and her hands became fists at her sides. She nodded and slowly turned to go back inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The two men followed. Lady Johanna turned to face them when she\u2019d reached the center of the aisle between the rows of wooden pews. The altar was directly behind her. Four candles provided the only light inside the chapel. The flames flickered inside their round glass globes spaced a hand\u2019s length apart on top of the long marble altar top.</p><p>Lady Johanna straightened her shoulders, folded her hands together, and kept her gaze firmly on the steward. She seemed to be bracing herself for foul news. Her voice was whisper soft, devoid of all emotion. \u201cHas my husband returned home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, m\u2019lady,\u201d Kelmet answered. He glanced over at the priest, received his encouraging nod, and then blurted out, \u201cTwo messengers have just arrived from London. They bring terrible news. Your husband is dead.\u201d</p><p>A full minute of silence followed the announcement. Kelmet began to clasp and unclasp his hands while he waited for the news to take root. His mistress didn\u2019t show any outward reaction, and he began to think she hadn\u2019t understood what he\u2019d just said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, m\u2019lady. Baron Raulf is dead,\u201d he repeated in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>And still he saw no response. The priest and the steward shared a worried look, then looked back at Lady Johanna.</p><p>Tears suddenly gathered in her eyes. Father MacKechnie almost let out a sigh of relief. She understood the news.</p><p>He waited for her denial next, for in all his considerable years of consoling the bereaved, he\u2019d seen most people use denial in order to cheat the truth a little longer.</p><p>Her own denial was swift and violent. \u201cNo!\u201d she screamed. She shook her head so forcefully her long braid caught over her shoulder. \u201cI will not listen to this lie. I will not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKelmet has spoken the truth,\u201d Father MacKechnie insisted, his voice low and soothing.</p><p>She shook her head at him. \u201cThis must be trickery. He cannot be dead. Kelmet, you must hunt down the truth. Who would tell you such a lie?\u201d</p><p>The priest took a quick step forward to put his arm around the distressed woman. The anguish in her voice made him want to weep himself.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t allow comfort. She backed up a space, gripped her hands together, and demanded, \u201cIs this a cruel trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, m\u2019lady,\u201d Kelmet replied. \u201cThe news came from King John himself. There was a witness. The baron is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod rest his soul,\u201d the priest intoned.</p> <p>Lady Johanna burst into tears. Both men hurried forward. She warded them off by backing up again. They stopped, uncertain now what to do. They watched as the broken-hearted woman turned away. She stumbled to her knees, crossed her arms over her stomach, and doubled over as though she\u2019d just received a hard blow to her middle.</p><p>Her sobs were soul-wrenching. The men let her vent her desolation for long minutes, and when she was finally able to regain a little of her control and her sobs had lessened, the priest placed his hand on her shoulder and whispered words meant to comfort her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t brush his hand away. MacKechnie watched as she slowly regained her dignity. She took a deep calming breath, mopped her face with the linen square he handed her, and then allowed him to assist her to her feet.</p><p>She kept her head bowed when she addressed the men. \u201cI would like to be alone now. I must . . . pray.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for their agreement but turned and walked to the first pew. She knelt down on the leatherpadded kneeler and made the sign of the cross, signaling the beginning of her petitions.</p><p>The priest went outside first. Kelmet followed. He was just pulling the door closed behind him when his mistress called out to him.</p><p>\u201cSwear it, Kelmet. Swear on your father\u2019s grave my husband is truly dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p> <p>The steward waited another minute or two to see if there was anything his mistress wanted from him and then pulled the door completely shut.</p><p>Johanna stared at the altar for a long, long while. Her mind was a riot of thoughts and emotions.</p><p>She was too stunned to think reasonable thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI must pray,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMy husband is dead. I must pray.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, folded her hands together, and finally began her prayer. It was a simple, direct litany that came from her heart.</p><p>\u201cThank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>The Highlands of Scotland, 1207</p><p>The baron obviously had a death wish. The laird was going to accommodate him.</p><p>The MacBain had heard through the intricate gossip vine four days before that Baron Nicholas Sanders was making his way up the last steep, winter-covered hills to the Maclaurin holding. The Englishman wasn\u2019t a stranger and had in fact fought by the MacBain\u2019s side during a fierce battle against the English infidels who\u2019d taken root on Maclaurin land. Once the invigorating fight was finished, MacBain had become laird over both his own followers and the Maclaurin clan; and as their new leader, he made the decision to allow Nicholas to stay on long enough to recover from his rather substantial injuries. MacBain believed he\u2019d been very accommodating then, damned gracious too, but for good reason. As grating as it was to acknowledge, Baron Nicholas had actually saved MacBain\u2019s life during the battle. The laird was a proud man. It was difficult for him to say thank you, actually impossible, and so, in appreciation for saving the laird from an English sword aimed for his back, MacBain didn\u2019t let Nicholas bleed to death. Since they didn\u2019t have anyone experienced in the ways of healing, MacBain personally cleaned and wrapped the baron\u2019s injuries. His generosity hadn\u2019t stopped there, although in his mind he\u2019d repaid the debt sufficiently. When Nicholas was strong enough to travel, the MacBain had let him have his magnificent horse back and gave him one of his own plaids to wear so he would have safe passage on his return to England. No other clan would dare touch a MacBain, so the plaid was actually better protection than chain mail.</p><p>Aye, he\u2019d been hospitable all right, and now the baron was determined to take advantage of his good nature.</p><p>Damn it all, he really was going to have to kill the man.</p><p>There was only one bright thought that kept his mood from going completely sour. He would keep Nicholas\u2019s horse this time.</p><p>\u201cFeed a wolf once, MacBain, and he\u2019s bound to come sniffing around here again for more food.\u201d</p><p>The laird\u2019s first-in-command, a thick-shouldered, blond warrior named Calum, made that remark with a forced sneer in his voice. The sparkle in his eyes indicated he was actually amused by the baron\u2019s arrival.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill him?\u201d</p><p>MacBain thought about the question a long minute before answering. \u201cProbably.\u201d His voice had been deliberately blas\u00e9.</p><p>Calum laughed. \u201cBaron Nicholas is a courageous man to come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot courageous,\u201d MacBain corrected. \u201cFoolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming up the last hill wearing your plaid as pretty as you please, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>Keith, the eldest of the Maclaurin warriors, shouted the announcement as he came strutting through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to bring him inside?\u201d Calum asked.</p><p>\u201cInside?\u201d Keith snorted. \u201cWe\u2019re more out than in, Calum. The roofs gone from fire, and only three of the four walls are standing proud now. I\u2019d say we\u2019re already outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe English did this,\u201d Calum reminded his laird. \u201cNicholas ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came here to rid the Maclaurin land of the infidels,\u201d MacBain reminded his soldier. \u201cNicholas had no part in the destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d He pulled away from the mantel he\u2019d been leaning against, muttered an expletive when a slat of wood crashed to the floor, and then walked outside. Both Calum and Keith fell into step behind him. They took their positions on either side of their leader at the bottom of the steps.</p><p>The MacBain towered over his soldiers. He was a giant of a man, fierce in appearance and temperament with dark black-brown hair and gray-colored eyes. He looked mean. Even his stance was belligerent. His legs were braced apart, his arms were folded across his massive chest, and a scowl was firmly in place.</p><p>Baron Nicholas spotted the laird as soon as his mount crested the hill. MacBain looked furious all right. Nicholas reminded himself that that was a usual condition. Still the scowl was black enough to give the baron second thoughts. \u201cI must be daft,\u201d he muttered to himself. He took a deep breath, then let out a shrill whistle of greeting. He added a smile for good measure and raised one fist in the air as a greeting.</p><p>The MacBain wasn\u2019t impressed with the baron\u2019s manners. He waited until Nicholas had reached the center of the barren courtyard before raising his hand in an unspoken signal to stop.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d been damned specific, Baron. I told you not to come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you did tell me not to come back,\u201d Nicholas agreed. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you also remember I told you I\u2019d have to kill you if you ever set foot on my land again?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve a strong memory for details, MacBain. I remember that threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this not open defiance then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could conclude it is,\u201d Nicholas answered with a negligent shrug.</p><p>The smile on the baron\u2019s face confused the hell out of MacBain. Did Nicholas think they were playing some sort of game? Was he that simpleminded?</p><p>MacBain let out a long sigh. \u201cTake off my plaid, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get your blood on it.\u201d</p><p>His voice shook with fury. Nicholas hoped to God it was all bluster. He believed he was equal in muscle and strength to the laird, and he was certainly every inch as tall. Still he didn\u2019t want to fight the man. If he killed the laird, his plan would fail; and if the laird killed him, he\u2019d never know what the hell the plan was until it was too late. Besides, the MacBain was much quicker in battle. He didn\u2019t fight fair either, a trait, Nicholas decided, he found impressive.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is your plaid,\u201d he shouted to the barbarian. \u201cBut the land, MacBain, well now, that belongs to my sister.\u201d</p><p>MacBain\u2019s scowl intensified. He didn\u2019t like hearing the truth. Taking a step forward, he pulled his sword from its sheath at his side.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Nicholas muttered as he swung his leg over his stallion and dismounted. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever easy with you, is it, MacBain?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect an answer and didn\u2019t get one. He removed the plaid he\u2019d worn draped like a banner across one shoulder and tossed it on the saddle of his horse, then reached for his own sword. One of the Maclaurin warriors rushed forward to lead the horse away. Nicholas paid him little attention and tried as well to ignore the crowd gathering in a circle around the courtyard. His mind was fully focused on his adversary.</p><p>\u201cIt was your brother-in-law who destroyed this holding and half the Maclaurin clan,\u201d MacBain roared. \u201cAnd I have suffered your presence long enough.\u201d</p><p>The two giants matched glares. Nicholas shook his head. \u201cKeep your facts straight, MacBain. It was my sister\u2019s husband, Baron Raulf, who placed the infidel, Marshall, and his sorry men in charge of this holding; but when Raulf died and my sister was freed from his control, she sent me here to rid the land of the traitorous vassals. She owns this holding, MacBain. Your King William the Lion forgot to barter it back from Richard when that good man was king of England and in such desperate need of coins for his crusades, but John never forgot what was passed down to him. He gave his land to his faithful servant Raulf, and now that he\u2019s dead, Johanna inherits. It\u2019s her land all right, like it or not.\u201d</p><p>Dredging up past offenses made both warriors furious. They advanced upon each other like raging bulls; the clash of their mighty swords drew blue sparks and ear-piercing sounds as steel slapped steel. The noise echoed down the hills, drowning out the crowd\u2019s grunts of approval.</p><p>Neither warrior said another word for at least twenty minutes. The fight consumed every ounce of their strength and their concentration. MacBain was the aggressor in this battle, Nicholas, the defender, as he blocked each deadly blow.</p><p>Both the MacBain warriors and the Maclaurin soldiers were thoroughly satisfied with the show. Several muttered approval over the Englishman\u2019s quick moves, for in their minds Nicholas had already shown his superior skill by staying alive for so long.</p><p>MacBain suddenly twisted back and used his foot to trip the baron. Nicholas fell backward, rolled, and was back on his feet as quick as a cat before the laird could take advantage of the opportunity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being damned inhospitable,\u201d Nicholas panted.</p><p>MacBain smiled. He could have ended the battle when Nicholas had fallen backward, but he finally acknowledged to himself that his heart just wasn\u2019t in the fight.</p><p>\u201cMy curiosity is keeping you alive, Nicholas,\u201d MacBain announced, his breathing labored. His brow was covered with sweat even as he swung his sword in a wide, downward arch.</p><p>Nicholas arched his own sword upward, meeting the powerful blow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be related, MacBain, like that or not.\u201d</p><p>It took a few seconds for the statement to penetrate. The laird didn\u2019t let up on his attack when he asked, \u201cHow can that be, Baron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to become your brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>MacBain didn\u2019t try to hide his astonishment over the baron\u2019s outrageous and surely demented announcement. He took a step back and slowly lowered his sword.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone completely daft, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>The baron laughed. He tossed his weapon aside. \u201cYou look as though you just swallowed your sword, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>After giving his observation, he lunged headfirst into the laird\u2019s chest. It felt as though he\u2019d just rammed a stone wall. The ploy hurt like hell, but it proved effective. MacBain let out a low grunt. The two warriors went flying backward. MacBain let go of his sword. Nicholas ended up sprawled on top of the laird. He was too exhausted to move, and in too much pain to want to. MacBain shoved him aside, made it to his knees, and was about to reach for his sword again when he suddenly changed his inclination. He slowly turned to look at Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cMarry an Englishwoman?\u201d</p><p>He sounded horrified. He was out of breath, too. The last observation pleased Nicholas considerably; and just as soon as he was able to draw a deep breath again he would boast over the fact that he had worn the laird out.</p><p>MacBain stood up, then hauled Nicholas to his feet. He shoved him backward so he wouldn\u2019t think the action had been an act of kindness, then folded his arms across his chest and demanded an explanation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd who is it you believe I would marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. \u201cIf you don\u2019t marry her, King John will give her to Baron Williams. He\u2019s a mean son of a bitch,\u201d he added in a gratingly cheerful voice. \u201cGod help you then, MacBain. If Williams marries her, the men he\u2019ll send will make Marshall seem as good and just as the day is long.\u201d</p> <p>The laird didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to that bit of news. Nicholas rubbed the side of his head in an attempt to ease the sting before continuing on. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably kill whoever he sends here,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cDamned right I will,\u201d MacBain snapped.</p><p>\u201cBut Williams will only retaliate by sending more . . . and more . . . and more. Can you afford to risk constant war with England? How many more Maclaurins will die before it\u2019s settled? Look around you, MacBain. Marshall and his men damned near destroyed every building. The Maclaurins turned to you for help and made you their laird. They\u2019re depending on you. If you marry Johanna, the land will legally become yours. King John will leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour king approves of this union?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Nicholas\u2019s voice was emphatic.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not certain. He wants Johanna out of England, that much I know. He made that remark several times. He seemed eager for the marriage and agreed to give you the Maclaurin land the day you wed. I\u2019ll receive title to her holding in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d MacBain demanded again.</p><p>Nicholas sighed. \u201cI believe my sister understands why John wants her settled so far away\u2014he calls this place the ends of the earth\u2014but Johanna won\u2019t tell me what his reasons might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you would also profit from this marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the holding in England.\u201d he said. \u201cIt will only mean more taxes each year, and I already have enough to do rebuilding my own estates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why did you ask for your sister\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cJohn understands greed,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cIf he thought I was only protecting my sister from Baron Williams, he might have declined my suggestion to marry her to you. He did insist upon a large fine, of course, but I\u2019ve already paid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re contradicting yourself, Baron. If John wanted Johanna away from England, why would he consider marrying her to Baron Williams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Williams is extremely loyal to John. Williams is his lapdog. He would keep my sister under control.\u201d Nicholas shook his head then. In a low whisper he said, \u201cMy sister was privy to some damning information, and John doesn\u2019t want his past sins coming back to haunt him. Oh, she could never give testimony in court against any man, not even her king, for she is a woman and, therefore, would not be listened to by any official. Still, there are barons ready to rebel against the king. Johanna could possibly ignite their fervor if she told whatever it is she knows. It\u2019s a puzzle, MacBain, but the more I reflect upon it, the more convinced I become that my king is actually afraid of what Johanna knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what you guess is true, I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t had her killed. Your king is capable of such a foul deed.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas knew he would never gain MacBain\u2019s cooperation unless he was completely honest with him. He nodded once again. \u201cHe is capable of murder. I was with Johanna when she received the summons to go to London. I saw her reaction. I believe she thought she was going to her execution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet she\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king keeps her under close guard. She has private quarters and isn\u2019t allowed guests. She\u2019s living each day in fear. I want her away from England. Marrying you is my answer.\u201d</p> <p>The laird was pleased by the baron\u2019s veracity. He motioned for him to walk with him and started toward the ruins he now called home. Nicholas fell into step beside him.</p><p>MacBain\u2019s voice was low when he remarked, \u201cSo it was you who came up with this clever plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nicholas replied. \u201cAnd just in the breath of time. John was set to marry her to Williams six months ago, but she was able to resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas grinned. \u201cShe demanded an annulment first.\u201d</p><p>MacBain\u2019s surprise was evident. \u201cWhy would she ask for an annulment? Her husband\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a clever stalling tactic,\u201d Nicholas explained. \u201cThere was a witness to her husband\u2019s death, but the body wasn\u2019t recovered. My sister told the king she wouldn\u2019t marry anyone as long as there was a shred of hope Raulf was still alive. He didn\u2019t die in England, you see. He was in a city built on the water, acting as John\u2019s envoy when the accident took place. The king wasn\u2019t going to be denied, of course, but because he\u2019s having so much difficulty with the church these days, he decided to go through proper channels. Johanna just received the papers. The annulment has been granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was this witness to her husband\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious,\u201d MacBain answered. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nicholas answered. \u201cWilliams was the witness.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stored that bit of information away in the back of his mind. \u201cWhy do you prefer me to the English baron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliams is a monster, and I cannot abide the thought of my sister being under his control. You were the lesser of two evils. I know you\u2019ll treat her well . . . if she\u2019ll have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat nonsense is this? It isn\u2019t her decision to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it is,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cJohanna must meet you first and then decide. It was the best I could do. In truth, she wouldn\u2019t marry anyone if she could continue to come up with the coins the king demands to stay unmarried. That is what she believes anyway. I know better. The king will marry her off one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour king is a greedy man,\u201d MacBain said. \u201cOr is this special punishment designed to gain your sister\u2019s cooperation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tax?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>MacBain nodded. \u201cNo,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cJohn can force widows of his tenants in chief to remarry. If they\u2019re determined to remain free or to choose their own husbands, well, then they have to pay him a sizable fine each year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned you already paid the fine. You\u2019re assuming then that Johanna will find me acceptable?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know I paid the fine, and I would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t mention it when you meet her.\u201d</p><p>MacBain clasped his hands behind his back and went inside. Nicholas followed.</p><p>\u201cI must consider this proposal of yours,\u201d the laird announced. \u201cThe thought of marrying an Englishwoman is hard to stomach, and when you add the fact that she is also your sister, it\u2019s almost unthinkable.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas knew he was being insulted. He didn\u2019t mind. The MacBain had proven his character during the battle against Marshall and his cohorts.</p><p>The laird might be a little rough around the edges, but he was also a courageous and honorable man.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else you should consider before you decide,\u201d Nicholas said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna\u2019s barren.\u201d</p><p>MacBain nodded to let Nicholas know he\u2019d heard him but didn\u2019t comment on the news for several minutes.</p><p>Then he shrugged. \u201cI already have a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told at least three men could be his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d MacBain countered. \u201cHis mother was a camp follower. She couldn\u2019t name the man who fathered Alex. She believed it might be me. She died birthing the boy. I claim him as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo any of the other men also claim him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna can\u2019t give you children. Will the fact that Alex is illegitimate matter in future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not matter,\u201d MacBain announced, his voice hard and unbending. \u201cI\u2019m also illegitimate.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas laughed. \u201cDo you mean that, when I called you bastard in the heat of battle against Marshall, I wasn\u2019t being insulting but truthful?\u201d</p><p>MacBain nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve killed others for calling me that name, Nicholas. Count yourself fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the fortunate one if Johanna decides to marry you.\u201d</p><p>MacBain shook his head. \u201cI want what rightfully belongs to me. If getting the land means marrying the shrew, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you believe she\u2019s a shrew?\u201d Nicholas asked, puzzled by MacBain\u2019s conclusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me sufficient clues to her character,\u201d MacBain answered. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously a stubborn woman because she refused to confide in her brother when asked what information she has against her own king. She needs a man who will control her\u2014those were your words to me, Nicholas, so don\u2019t look so surprised\u2014and last, she happens to be barren. She sounds appealing, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she is appealing.\u201d</p><p>MacBain scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t relish my future as her husband, but you are correct, I will treat her kindly. I imagine we\u2019ll find a way to stay out of each other\u2019s paths.\u201d</p><p>The laird poured wine into two silver goblets and handed one to Nicholas. Each raised his drink in a salute and then downed the contents. Nicholas understood proper etiquette in the Highlands. He promptly belched. MacBain nodded approval.</p><p>\u201cI suppose this means you\u2019ll be coming back here whenever the mood strikes you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas laughed. MacBain sounded damned forlorn over the possibility.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need several plaids to take back with me,\u201d he said then. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to your bride, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you more than a few, Nicholas,\u201d MacBain countered. \u201cI want at least thirty men riding escort. Each will wear my colors for protection. You\u2019ll dismiss them when you reach Rush Creek. Only you and your sister will be allowed on our land. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was jesting about the plaids, laird. I can take care of my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do as I order,\u201d MacBain commanded.</p><p>Nicholas gave in. The laird changed the topic then. \u201cHow long was Johanna married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over three years. Johanna would like to remain unmarried,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cBut my sister\u2019s feelings are of no concern to John. He\u2019s kept her under lock and key in London. I\u2019ve only been allowed a short visitation, and John was present all the while. As I told you earlier, my sister\u2019s a loose end he wants taken care of, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>MacBain frowned. Nicholas suddenly smiled. \u201cHow does it rub knowing you\u2019re the answer to King John\u2019s prayer?\u201d</p><p>The laird wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cI get the land,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThat is all that matters.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s attention was turned when MacBain\u2019s giant wolfhound came loping through the entrance. The beast was a fierce-looking thing with a brindle-colored coat and dark eyes. Nicholas thought it weighed almost as much as he did. The hound spotted Nicholas when he rounded the corner and bounded down the steps. He let out a low, menacing growl that made Nicholas\u2019s hair stand on end.</p><p>MacBain snapped a command in Gaelic. His monstrous pet immediately went to his side.</p><p>\u201cA word of advice, MacBain. Hide that ugly gargoyle when I bring Johanna here. She\u2019ll take one look at the two of you and turn right around and go back to England.\u201d</p><p>MacBain laughed. \u201cMark my words. Nicholas. I won\u2019t be denied. She will have me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I won\u2019t have him, Nicholas. You must be out of your mind if you think I would even consider becoming his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearances are deceiving, Johanna,\u201d her brother countered. \u201cWait until we\u2019re closer. You\u2019ll surely notice the kindness in his eyes. MacBain will treat you well.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her hands were shaking so violently she almost dropped the reins to her mount. She tightened her hold on the leather straps and tried not to gape at the huge warrior . . . and the monstrous-looking animal leaning against his side.</p><p>They were nearing the courtyard of the desolate holding. The laird stood on the step leading up to the dilapidated keep. He didn\u2019t look particularly pleased by the sight of her.</p><p>She was sickened by the sight of him. She took a deep breath in an attempt to calm herself, then whispered, \u201cWhat color are his eyes, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>Her brother didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYou saw kindness in his eyes, yet you didn\u2019t notice the color?\u201d</p><p>She had him there and they both knew it. \u201cMen don\u2019t notice such insignificant things,\u201d he defended.</p><p>\u201cYou told me he was a gentle man with a soft voice and a quick smile. He isn\u2019t smiling now, is he, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Johanna . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not lie to you,\u201d he argued. \u201cMacBain saved my life not once but twice during the battle against Marshall and his men, and he refuses to even acknowledge it. He\u2019s a proud man but honorable. You must trust me on this. I wouldn\u2019t suggest you marry him unless I was convinced it would be a sound union.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t answer him. Panic was taking hold. Her gaze kept going back and forth between the huge warrior and the ugly beast.</p><p>Nicholas thought she was getting ready to faint. His mind raced for some clever thing to say to help her calm down.</p><p>\u201cMacBain\u2019s the one on the left, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t amused by his jest. \u201cHe\u2019s a very big man, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Her brother reached over to pat her hand. \u201cHe\u2019s no bigger than I am,\u201d he replied.</p><p>She pushed his hand away. She didn\u2019t want his comfort. She didn\u2019t want him to feel her trembling with cowardly fear either.</p><p>\u201cMost wives would wish to have strong husbands to defend them. MacBain\u2019s size should be a comfort to you and a mark in his favor.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201c \u2019Tis a mark against him,\u201d she announced.</p><p>She continued to stare at the laird. He seemed to be growing right before her eyes. The closer she got, the larger he became.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s handsome.\u201d</p><p>She blurted out her opinion in a voice that sounded like an accusation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you think so,\u201d Nicholas decided to agree.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis another mark against him. I don\u2019t want to be married to a handsome man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t making sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to make sense. I\u2019ve decided. I won\u2019t have him. Take me home, Nicholas. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas jerked on the reins to stop her mount, then forced her to look at him. The fear he saw in her eyes made his heart ache. Only he knew the purgatory she\u2019d endured while married to Raulf, and although she wouldn\u2019t speak of it, he knew what her real terror was now. His voice was low and fervent when he said, \u201cListen to me, Johanna. MacBain will never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain if she believed him or not. \u201cI would never allow him to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The vehemence in her reply made him smile with approval. Raulf hadn\u2019t been able to beat the spirit out of her. Nicholas counted that as a blessing.</p><p>\u201cThink of all the reasons why you should marry him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be away from King John and his cohorts, and they won\u2019t come here after you. You\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that consideration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMacBain hates England and our king.\u201d</p><p>She nibbled on her lower lip. \u201cThat is another sound point in his favor,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cThis place, as bleak as it now looks, will one day be a paradise, and you\u2019ll have helped to rebuild it. You\u2019re needed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would help to rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do long for warm weather. \u2019Tis the truth I only agreed to come here because you convinced me the land is much closer to the sun. I don\u2019t know why I hadn\u2019t realized that before. I must admit not having to wear a heavy cloak more than one month out of the year does have a wonderful appeal. You did say it was odd the weather was so chilly for this time of year.\u201d</p><p>Good God, he\u2019d forgotten that little lie. Johanna hated the cold and knew absolutely nothing about the Highlands. He\u2019d deliberately deceived her in his attempt to get her safely out of England and now felt guilty as hell. He\u2019d corrupted a man of the cloth, too, for he\u2019d begged Father MacKechnie to go along with the fabrication.</p><p>The priest had his own motives for wanting Johanna to marry the MacBain laird and had held his silence each time Johanna mentioned the appeal of such a warm, sunny climate. He had, however, glared at Nicholas whenever the topic came up.</p> <p>Nicholas let out a sigh. He guessed that when Johanna was knee deep in snow, she\u2019d realize he\u2019d lied to her. Hopefully by then her opinion of MacBain would have softened.</p><p>\u201cWill he leave me alone, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him anything about my years with Raulf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I wouldn\u2019t break my word to you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd he knows, for certain, I cannot give him children?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been over that issue at least a dozen times on the journey up the hills. Nicholas didn\u2019t know what more he could say to reassure her. \u201cHe knows, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t it matter to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wanted the land. He\u2019s laird now and has to put his clan above his own concerns. Marrying you was simply a way he could achieve his goal.\u201d</p><p>It was a cold, honest answer. Johanna nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll meet him,\u201d she finally agreed. \u201cBut I won\u2019t promise you I\u2019ll marry him, so you can quit your smile right now, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>MacBain had grown weary of waiting for his bride to come to him. He started down the steps just as she nudged her mount forward. He still hadn\u2019t gotten a proper look at her, as she was completely covered by a black cape and hood. Her smallness, however, surprised him. He\u2019d expected a much larger woman given Nicholas\u2019s size.</p><p>Her appearance wasn\u2019t important to him. The marriage was a practical arrangement, nothing more. He assumed, however, that because she was Nicholas\u2019s sister, she would have the same dark coloring and auburn-colored hair.</p><p>He was mistaken. Nicholas dismounted first. He tossed the reins to one of the soldiers and went over to Johanna\u2019s side to assist her to the ground.</p><p>She was a little bit of a thing. The top of her head only reached her brother\u2019s shoulders. Nicholas had his hands on her arms and was smiling down at her. It was obvious he cared a great deal about his sister. MacBain thought his brotherly devotion a little overdone.</p><p>While Johanna untied the cord holding her cloak together, the soldiers began to line up behind their leader. The Maclaurin men clumped themselves together behind their laird and to the left of the wide steps while the MacBain warriors lined up behind their leader and on the right side. The six steps were filled with curious men in a matter of seconds. They all wanted to see the laird\u2019s bride.</p><p>MacBain heard the low grunts of obvious approval a scant second after Johanna removed her cloak and handed it to her brother. MacBain didn\u2019t think he made a sound, but he wasn\u2019t certain. The sight of her took his breath away.</p><p>Nicholas hadn\u2019t said a word about her appearance, and MacBain hadn\u2019t been interested enough to ask. He now looked at the baron and saw the laughter in his eyes. He knows I\u2019m rattled, he thought to himself. MacBain masked his astonishment and turned his full attention back to the beautiful woman walking toward him.</p><p>Lord, she was a bonny lass. Her waist-length blond curls swayed with each step she took. The woman didn\u2019t seem to have any flaws. There was a light sprinkle of freckles across the bridge of her nose. He liked that. Her eyes were a vivid shade of blue, her complexion was pure, and her mouth, dear God, her mouth could drive a saint to lustful thoughts. He liked that, too.</p><p>Some of the Maclaurin soldiers weren\u2019t as disciplined in their reactions as the MacBain was. The two men standing directly behind their laird let out long, low whistles of appreciation. MacBain took exception to their rude behavior, however. He half-turned, lifted each man by his neck, and sent them both flying like cabers over the side of the steps. The other soldiers had to duck to get out of the way.</p><p>Johanna came to a quick stop, looked at the soldiers sprawled out on the ground, then looked back at their leader. The laird didn\u2019t even seem winded.</p><p>\u201cA gentle man?\u201d she whispered to Nicholas. \u201cThat was a lie, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him a chance, Johanna. You owe him and me that much. \u201d</p><p>She gave her brother a disgruntled look before turning back to the laird.</p><p>MacBain took a step forward. His wolfhound came with him and once again leaned against his master\u2019s side.</p><p>Johanna started praying for enough courage to keep walking. When she was just a foot or two away from the warrior, she stopped and then executed a perfect curtsy.</p><p>Her knees were shaking so hard that she was pleased she didn\u2019t fall over on her face.</p><p>She heard a loud snort and several grunts while her head was bowed. She didn\u2019t know if the noises were sounds of approval or censure.</p><p>The laird was wearing his plaid. He had extremely muscular legs. She tried not to stare at them.</p><p>\u201cGood day, Laird MacBain.\u201d</p><p>Her voice trembled. She was afraid of him. MacBain wasn\u2019t surprised. The sight of him had sent more than one young woman running back to the safety of her father. He\u2019d never considered trying to change their reactions because he hadn\u2019t particularly cared.</p><p>He was caring now, however. He would never get the woman to marry him if he didn\u2019t do something to ease her fear. She kept giving worried glances down at his dog. MacBain assumed the hound also frightened her.</p><p>Nicholas wasn\u2019t being much help. He just stood there grinning like a simpleton.</p><p>MacBain demanded his assistance by glaring at him. He decided he shouldn\u2019t have done that when Johanna took a quick step back.</p><p>\u201cDoes she speak Gaelic?\u201d</p><p>MacBain addressed his question to Nicholas. Johanna answered. \u201cI have been studying your language.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak in Gaelic when she answered. Her hands were folded together in front of her. The knuckles were white from her hard grip.</p><p>Mundane conversation might put her at ease, MacBain decided. \u201cAnd how long have you been studying our language?\u201d</p><p>Her mind went blank. It was his fault, of course. His stare was so intense, unsettling, too, and she couldn\u2019t seem to form a thought. Dear God, she couldn\u2019t even remember what they were talking about.</p><p>He patiently asked her again. \u201cAlmost four weeks,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh. One of the soldiers snorted with amusement, but MacBain\u2019s glare stopped him.</p><p>Nicholas was frowning down at his sister, wondering why she hadn\u2019t told the laird the truth. It had been closer to four months since Father MacKechnie began instructing her. He caught the look of panic in his sister\u2019s eyes when she glanced up at him and he understood then. Johanna was simply too nervous to think straight.</p><p>MacBain decided he didn\u2019t want an audience during this important meeting.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, wait here. Your sister and I are going inside to talk.\u201d</p><p>After giving his command, MacBain moved forward to take hold of Johanna\u2019s arm. The hound came with him. She instinctively backed up, realized what she was doing and how that cowardly retreat must have looked to the laird, and quickly moved forward again.</p><p>The huge beast growled at her. MacBain snapped an order in Gaelic. The hound immediately quit the low, menacing sound.</p><p>Johanna was looking ready to faint again. Nicholas knew she needed a bit of time to get her courage back. He took a step forward. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you allow my men and Father MacKechnie past Rush Creek?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour sister and I must come to terms before the priest is allowed here. Your men won\u2019t ever be allowed on our land, Nicholas. Have you forgotten my terms? We went over the details when you were last here.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas agreed with a nod. He couldn\u2019t think of anything further to ask.</p><p>\u201cFather MacKechnie was very upset over your command to wait below,\u201d Johanna said.</p><p>MacBain didn\u2019t appear to be overly concerned about alienating a man of God. He shrugged. Her eyes widened in reaction. During the three years of her marriage to Raulf, she\u2019d learned to fear priests; the ones she had known were powerful and unforgiving men. Yet MacKechnie wasn\u2019t like the others. He was a kind-hearted man who had risked his life to come to England so that he could plead for the Maclaurins.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have him insulted now. \u201cFather MacKechnie is weary from the long journey, m\u2019lord, and would surely appreciate food and drink. Please show him your hospitality.\u201d</p><p>MacBain nodded. He turned to Calum. \u201cSee to it,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>He thought his agreement over her request would ease her fears about him. He had just proven he could be an accommodating man, after all. Yet she still appeared ready to bolt. Damn but she was a timid thing. His pet wasn\u2019t helping matters much. She kept worriedly glancing down at the dog, and every time she stared at him, the hound growled at her.</p><p>MacBain considered grabbing hold of her, tossing her over his shoulder, and carrying her inside, then changed his mind. The thought amused him, but he didn\u2019t smile. He held his patience, put his hand out to her, and simply waited to see what she would do.</p><p>From the look in his eyes, she knew he had guessed she was afraid of him and that he was finding her timidity amusing, too. She forced herself to take a deep breath, then put her hand in his.</p><p>He was huge everywhere. His hand was at least twice the size of her own, and he certainly must have felt her trembling. He was a laird, however, and she assumed he would never have attained that position of power without gaining a few gentlemanly manners along the way, and she therefore assumed he wouldn\u2019t mention her shameful condition.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you shaking?\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull her hand away. He wouldn\u2019t let go. He had her now, and he wasn\u2019t about to let her get away.</p><p>Before Johanna could come up with a suitable explanation to his question, he turned and pulled her along up the steps and through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your unusual weather,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cOur what?\u201d He looked confused.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, Laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what you meant,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNicholas explained that the weather here is warm all year around . . . I thought he\u2019d told you about his . . .\u201d She started to say lie, then changed her mind. The laird might not understand how amused she\u2019d been over her brother\u2019s outrageous fabrication about the Highlands.</p><p>\u201cHis what?\u201d MacBain asked, curious over her sudden blush.</p><p>\u201cHe said it was unusual to have such cold winds here,\u201d she said.</p><p>MacBain almost burst into laughter. He caught himself in time. The weather was actually unusually warm for this time of year.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even smile. The lass had already shown she had tender feelings, and he didn\u2019t suppose laughing at her na\u00efvet\u00e9 would soften her attitude toward him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe everything your brother tells you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she answered so that he would know she was thoroughly loyal to her brother.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cold is the reason I am trembling,\u201d she said for lack of a better lie to tell.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to lie to him again. She surprised him with the truth. \u201cYes,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of you. I\u2019m afraid of your hound, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour answers please me.\u201d</p><p>He finally let go of her. She was so surprised by his remark she forgot to let go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt pleases you to know I fear you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI already knew you feared me, Johanna. I\u2019m pleased because you admitted it. You could have lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have known I was lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He sounded terribly arrogant, but she wasn\u2019t offended\u2014she expected arrogance in a man as big and ferocious looking as this warrior. She realized she was holding onto him then and immediately let go. Then she turned to look around the entrance. To the right was a wide staircase with an ornately carved wooden railing. A hallway led behind the staircase, and on the left of the entryway was the great hall. It was in ruins. Johanna stood on the top step and stared at the devastation. The walls were charred from fire, and the roof above the hall, what little there was left of it, hung down in a long strip to rest against the blackened sides. The smell of old smoke still lingered in the air.</p><p>Johanna went down the steps and crossed the room. She was so disheartened by the sight of the destruction, she felt like weeping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>MacBain watched the change in her expression as she looked around the room.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s men did this, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. The sadness in her eyes actually pleased him. She was a woman with a conscience.</p> <p>\u201cA terrible injustice was done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have tried to plead with my husband . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt he would have listened to you,\u201d MacBain announced. \u201cTell me something, Johanna. Did he know his vassal was causing such havoc here, or was he ignorant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew what Marshall was capable of,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>MacBain nodded. He clasped his hands behind his back and continued to stare at her. \u201cYou tried to right the injustice,\u201d he remarked. \u201cYou sent your brother here after Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s vassal had become a demigod. He didn\u2019t wish to hear the news that Raulf was dead and he was no longer needed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was never needed here.\u201d MacBain\u2019s voice had taken on a hard edge.</p><p>She nodded agreement. \u201cNo, he was never needed here.\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cMarshall had found power. Very few men can give that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you?\u201d</p> <p>He was surprised by her question. He started to answer yes, of course he could, but he was new to his position as laird and honestly didn\u2019t know if he could step down or not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve yet to be tested,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI would hope, if it was for the good of the clan, I could do whatever was asked of me, but I cannot say for certain until I\u2019m faced with such a challenge.\u201d</p><p>His honesty impressed her, and she smiled. \u201cNicholas was angry with you because Marshall had slipped away and you wouldn\u2019t let him go after him. He said the two of you argued, then you struck him into a sound sleep. When he next opened his eyes, Marshall was in a heap at his feet.\u201d</p><p>MacBain smiled. Nicholas had certainly softened the bloody tale.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to marry me, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>He sounded emphatic. He wasn\u2019t smiling now. Johanna braced herself against his anger and then slowly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cExplain the reason behind your hesitation,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She shook her head at him again. MacBain wasn\u2019t used to being contradicted, but he tried not to let his impatience show. He knew he wasn\u2019t very skilled in conversation with women. He certainly didn\u2019t know how to woo the fairer sex, and he knew he was making a muck out of this discussion.</p> <p>Why in God\u2019s name had Johanna been given the choice in the first place? Nicholas simply should have told her she was going to get married, and that would have been the end of it. This discussion shouldn\u2019t even be taking place. Damn it all, they should be in the middle of their wedding ceremony, exchanging their vows.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like timid women.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s shoulders straightened. \u201cI\u2019m not timid,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to be cautious, m\u2019lord, but I have never, ever been timid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like big men, even handsome ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think me handsome?\u201d</p><p>How had he managed to turn her words into a compliment? He seemed surprised, too, as though he really wasn\u2019t aware of his own appeal. \u201cYou misunderstand, sir,\u201d she told him. \u201cBeing handsome is a mark against you.\u201d She ignored his incredulous expression and repeated, \u201cAnd I especially dislike big men.\u201d</p><p>She knew she sounded ridiculous. She didn\u2019t care. She wasn\u2019t about to back down now. She looked him right in the eye while she folded her arms across her middle and frowned up at him. Her neck was already getting a crick in it from looking up.</p><p>\u201cWhat think you of my opinion, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>The challenge was there in her stance and her tone of voice. She was bravely standing up to him now. He had the sudden urge to laugh again.</p><p>He sighed instead. \u201cThey\u2019re daft opinions,\u201d he told her, being as blunt as possible.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change how I feel.\u201d</p><p>MacBain decided he had wasted enough time on the discussion. It was high time she understood what was going to happen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fact you aren\u2019t leaving here. You\u2019re staying with me, Johanna. We\u2019re going to be married tomorrow. That isn\u2019t an opinion by the way. It\u2019s fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would marry me against my will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>Hell, she looked terrified again. That reaction didn\u2019t sit well with him. He tried to use reason once again to gain her cooperation. He wasn\u2019t an ogre after all. He could be reasonable.</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind in the past few minutes and now want to go back to England? Nicholas told me leaving England appealed to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t changed my mind, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you afford to pay the fine your king demands to stay unwed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Baron Williams? Nicholas mentioned to me that the Englishman wanted to marry you.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to answer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I won\u2019t let you leave. No other man is going to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t prefer Baron Williams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it from the disgust in your voice this baron is also a handsome giant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s handsome only if you find pigs attractive, m\u2019lord, and he\u2019s a small man in size with an even smaller mind. He is completely unacceptable to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d MacBain drawled out. \u201cSo you dislike both large and small men. Have I got that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m making fun of your daft statements. Nicholas is just as big as I am,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but my brother would never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The truth was out. She\u2019d blurted out the words before she could stop herself. MacBain raised one eyebrow in reaction to the telling statement.</p><p>Johanna turned her gaze to the floor but not before he saw her blush.</p><p>\u201cPlease try to understand, Laird. If a pup bit me, I would have a fair chance of surviving, but if a wolf bit me, I don\u2019t believe I would have any chance at all.\u201d</p><p>She was trying so damned hard to be brave and failing miserably. Her terror was real and, MacBain speculated, learned from past experiences.</p><p>Long minutes passed in silence. MacBain stared at her. She stared at the floor.</p><p>\u201cDid your husband . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not talk about him.\u201d</p><p>He had his answer. He took a step toward her. She didn\u2019t back away. He put his hands on her shoulders and commanded her to look up at him. She took her time obeying.</p><p>His voice was a low, gruff whisper when he spoke. \u201cJohanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>They were married the following afternoon. MacBain agreed to wait that long so Father MacKechnie could prepare for the ceremony.</p><p>It was the only issue he was willing to bend on, however. Johanna wanted to return to the campsite and stay the night in her own tent near her brother, the priest, and her loyal men. Laird MacBain wouldn\u2019t hear of it. He ordered her to sleep in one of the newly built cottages along the hill, a tiny one-room affair with a single window and a stone hearth.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t see the laird again until the ceremony, nor did she see her brother until he came to collect her. MacBain had posted two guards outside her door. She was afraid to ask if the soldiers were there to keep outsiders from entering or to keep her from leaving.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get much sleep. Her mind raced from one worry to another. What if MacBain turned out to be like Raulf? Dear God, could she survive purgatory again? The possibility that she could be marrying another monster made her weep with self-pity. She was immediately ashamed of herself. Was she really such a coward after all? Had Raulf been right to ridicule her?</p><p>No, no, she was a strong woman. She could handle anything that came her way. She would not give in to the fear or allow herself to have such low thoughts about herself. She had value, damn it . . . didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Johanna had believed her confidence in herself had returned after Raulf\u2019s death. For the first time in over three years, she lived without fear. Her days were filled with blissful peace. Even after King John had dragged her to his court, he left her alone in her own private chambers. No one bothered her. There was a garden directly outside her door. She spent most of her days there.</p><p>The peaceful interlude was over, however, and she was now being forced into another marriage. She was bound to disappoint the laird. And what would he do then? Would he try to make her feel ignorant and unworthy? By God, she wouldn\u2019t let that happen. Raulf\u2019s attacks had been so cleverly disguised, and she\u2019d been so young and childishly naive, she hadn\u2019t realized until it was almost too late exactly what he was doing. It was a slow, insidious attack upon her character, relentless too, and it went on and on and on until she felt as though he\u2019d sucked the very light out of her.</p><p>She tried to fight back then. And that was when the beatings began.</p><p>Johanna forced herself to block the memories. She fell asleep praying for a miracle.</p><p>Nicholas came to get her during the nooning hour. He took one look at her pale face and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHave you so little faith in your brother\u2019s judgment? I have told you MacBain\u2019s an honorable man,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou have no reason to fear him.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand on her brother\u2019s arm and walked by his side. \u201cI do have faith in your judgment,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her voice lacked conviction, but he wasn\u2019t insulted. He understood her fear. The memory of seeing her battered face when he\u2019d stopped to pay a visit, and Raulf hadn\u2019t had time to hide her away, instantly filled him with rage yet again.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t frown, Nicholas. I\u2019m conquering my fear. It will be all right.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled. He couldn\u2019t believe his sister was actually trying to comfort him now.</p><p>\u201cAye, your marriage will be all right,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know, if you would just look around you, you\u2019d catch a glimpse of your future husband\u2019s character. Where did you sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well where I slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brand-new cottage, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to answer. \u201cI can see three others from here, all looking freshly built. The wood hasn\u2019t weathered yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you\u2019re trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA selfish man would consider his own comforts first, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see a new keep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalum is MacBain\u2019s first-in-command over the MacBain warriors, Johanna, and he told me the cottages are for the elderly in the clan. They come first, for they are most in need of warm fires and roofs over their heads at night. MacBain puts himself last. Think about that, Johanna. I found out there are two bedchambers on the east side above the stairs in the keep proper. Neither was disturbed by fire. Yet MacBain hasn\u2019t spent a single night there. He sleeps outside with the other soldiers. Doesn\u2019t that tell you something about the man\u2019s character?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was all the answer he required.</p><p>The color came back into her face. Nicholas nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>They had almost reached the edge of the courtyard when they stopped to watch the crowd of men and women working to prepare for the ceremony. Since the chapel had been gutted by fire, the wedding would take place in the courtyard. A makeshift altar consisting of a wide, flat wooden board was propped on top of two empty ale barrels. A woman spread a white linen cloth over the board. Father MacKechnie waited until the covering was in place, then put a beautiful golden chalice and plate in the center. Two more women were kneeling on the ground in front of the barrels, arranging bouquets of flowers in front of the wood.</p><p>Johanna started walking forward again. Nicholas took hold of her hand to stop her.</p><p>\u201cThere is something more you need to know,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see the child sitting on the top step?\u201d</p><p>She turned to look. A little boy, surely no more than four or five summers, sat all alone on the top step. His elbows rested on his knees, and his head was propped up by his hands. He was watching the preparations. He looked terribly unhappy.</p><p>\u201cI see him,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cHe looks forlorn, doesn\u2019t he, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>Her brother smiled. \u201cAye, he does,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacBain\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>She almost toppled over. \u201cHis what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLower your voice, Johanna. I don\u2019t want anyone to overhear this conversation. The boy belongs to MacBain. There\u2019s speculation he might not be his son, of course, but MacBain has made it clear he accepts him.\u201d</p><p>She was too astonished to speak.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Alex,\u201d Nicholas remarked for lack of anything better to say. \u201cI can tell I\u2019ve given you a bit of a shock, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer. \u201cHow long was MacBain married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Alex is illegitimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think about that. \u201cThe boy\u2019s mother died during childbirth,\u201d Nicholas added. \u201cYou might as well know it all, sister. The woman was a camp follower. There are at least three other men who could claim the boy.\u201d</p><p>Her heart went out to the little one. She turned to look at him again. He was an adorable child with dark curly hair. From the distance separating them, she couldn\u2019t see the color of his eyes. She wagered they were gray, like his father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, it\u2019s important for you to know MacBain acknowledges the boy as his son.\u201d</p><p>She turned to her brother. \u201cI heard you both the first and the second time you mentioned that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd what, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you accept him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicholas, how can you ask me such a thing? Of course I will accept him. How could I not?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas let out a sigh. His sister didn\u2019t understand the ways of their harsh world. \u201cIt\u2019s a bone of contention among the Maclaurins,\u201d he explained. \u201cMacBain\u2019s father was the Laird Maclaurin. He went to his deathbed without ever acknowledging his son.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen the man I\u2019m marrying is also illegitimate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet the Maclaurins made him their laird?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThey needed his strength. He does carry his father\u2019s blood, and they\u2019ve conveniently forgotten he was born a bastard. The boy, however . . .\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say another word. He would leave the conclusions to her. Johanna shook her head. \u201cDo you suppose the little one\u2019s upset about the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would appear he\u2019s upset about something.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie drew their attention by waving to them. Nicholas took hold of Johanna\u2019s elbow and started forward. She couldn\u2019t take her gaze away from the child. Lord, he looked pitiful and lost.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re ready,\u201d Nicholas announced. \u201cHere comes MacBain.\u201d</p><p>The laird walked across the courtyard and took his place in front of the altar. His hands were at his sides. The priest moved to stand next to him. He again motioned Johanna forward.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this, not without . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered, smiling. \u201cWait here, Nicholas. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>The priest waved to Johanna. She waved back, smiling. Then she turned around and walked away.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, for the love of God . . .\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was muttering to the air. He watched as his sister made her way around the crowd. When she headed for the steps, he finally understood what her errand was.</p> <p>Nicholas turned his gaze to MacBain. His expression revealed nothing of his thoughts.</p><p>The priest craned his neck to watch Johanna, then turned to MacBain and nudged him with his elbow.</p><p>Johanna slowed her pace when she neared the steps, for she didn\u2019t want the little one to run away before she got to him.</p><p>The news that MacBain had a son had filled her with joy and relief. Finally she had her answer to the question that plagued her. MacBain obviously didn\u2019t care she was barren because he already had an heir, illegitimate or not.</p><p>The guilt she\u2019d been carrying dropped away like a heavy cloak from her shoulders.</p><p>MacBain couldn\u2019t contain his frown. Damn, he hadn\u2019t wanted her to find out about the boy until they were married and she couldn\u2019t change her mind. Women were peculiar in their attitudes, he knew, and he was certain he was never going to understand exactly how their minds worked. They seemed to take exception to such odd things. Most, he\u2019d heard, didn\u2019t accept mistresses, and some of the wives of the other warriors he knew didn\u2019t acknowledge bastards. MacBain had every intention of forcing Johanna to acknowledge his son, but he\u2019d hoped to get her settled in first.</p><p>Alex spotted her coming his way and immediately buried his face in his hands. He had skinny knees. They were caked with dirt. When he peeked up to look at her, she saw his eyes. They weren\u2019t gray like his father\u2019s, but blue.</p><p>Johanna paused on the bottom step and spoke to the child. MacBain started to go after his bride, then changed his mind. He folded his arms across his chest and simply waited to see what would happen. He wasn\u2019t the only one watching. Silence filled the courtyard as every MacBain and every Maclaurin turned to look.</p> <p>\u201cDoes the boy understand English?\u201d Father MacKechnie asked.</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d MacBain answered. \u201cShe told me you were instructing her in Gaelic. Has she learned enough to converse a bit with Alex?\u201d</p><p>The priest shrugged. \u201cProbably,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>Johanna talked to the child for several minutes. Then she reached out her hand to him. Alex jumped to his feet, tripped down the stairs, and put his hand in hers. She leaned down, brushed the hair out of his eyes, adjusted his plaid from drooping over his shoulders, and then pulled him along by her side.</p><p>\u201cHe understands that,\u201d MacKechnie whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he understand?\u201d Calum asked.</p><p>The priest smiled. \u201cAcceptance.\u201d</p><p>MacBain nodded. Johanna reached Nicholas\u2019s side and took hold of his arm again. \u201cI\u2019m ready now,\u201d she announced. \u201cAlex, go and stand beside your father,\u201d she instructed. \u201cIt is my duty to come to the two of you.\u201d</p><p>The little boy nodded. He ran down the length of the path and took his place on his father\u2019s left. MacBain glanced down at his son. His expression was contained, and Johanna couldn\u2019t tell if he was pleased or annoyed. His gaze stayed on her, but once she started to walk toward him, he unfolded his arms and reached down to touch the top of his son\u2019s head.</p><p>Nicholas gave her away in marriage. She didn\u2019t resist when he placed her hand in MacBain\u2019s. He was damned proud of his sister. He knew she was nervous, but she didn\u2019t try to cling to his side. She was positioned between the two warriors, with her future husband on her right and her brother on her left. Johanna stood straight, held her head high, and looked straight ahead.</p><p>She was dressed in a white ankle-length chainse and matching knee-length bliaut. The square neckline of her wedding attire was embroidered with pale pink and green threads fashioned into the design of dainty rosebuds.</p><p>She smelled like roses, too. The scent was faint, yet vastly appealing to MacBain. Father MacKechnie took a small bouquet of flowers from the corner of the altar and handed it to her before hurrying around to the other side to begin the mass.</p><p>MacBain kept his gaze on his bride. She was an utterly feminine creature, and God\u2019s truth, he didn\u2019t know what he was going to do with her. His main worry was that she wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to survive such a harsh life. He forced the concern aside. It had become his duty to make certain she survived. He would protect her from danger, and if she needed to be pampered, then by God he would see she was pampered. He didn\u2019t have the faintest idea how, but he was an intelligent man. He would find out. He wouldn\u2019t let her dirty her hands either or do any backbreaking work, and he would demand she rest each and every day. Taking care of her was the very least he could do in appreciation for the land she\u2019d given him, and surely that was the only reason he was worrying about her comforts now.</p><p>The wind blew a strand of hair in her face. She let go of his hand to brush the strand of hair back over her shoulder. It was a dainty, feminine action. The curly mass of gold seemed to float down her back. Her hand shook so hard that the nosegay she held against her waist was rapidly dropping petals.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t take hold of his hand again, he was so bothered that he grabbed her hand and hauled her up close to his side. Nicholas saw the possessive action and smiled.</p><p>The ceremony was going along quite nicely until Father MacKechnie asked her to promise to love, honor, and obey her husband. She considered his request a long minute. Then she shook her head and turned to the groom.</p><p>She motioned for him to lean down and stretched up on tiptoe so that she could whisper in his ear.</p><p>\u201cI will try to love you, m\u2019lord, and I\u2019ll certainly honor you because you\u2019ll be my husband, but I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll obey you much. I\u2019ve found that total submissiveness doesn\u2019t agree with me.\u201d</p><p>She was wringing the petals off the stems of her flowers while she explained her position. She couldn\u2019t look him in the eye either but stared at his chin while she waited for his reaction.</p><p>MacBain was too astonished by what she\u2019d just said to him to notice how worried she was. He had to force himself not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you jesting with me?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t whispered his question. Since he wasn\u2019t overly concerned about their audience overhearing their discussion, she wasn\u2019t going to be concerned either. Her voice was every bit as forceful as his had been when she gave him her answer.</p><p>\u201cJest with you during the middle of our wedding vows? I think not, m\u2019lord. I\u2019m very serious. Those are my conditions. Do you accept them?\u201d</p><p>He did laugh then. He simply couldn\u2019t help himself. Her burst of courage was short-lived. She felt embarrassed and humiliated, but the issue was too important to let pass.</p><p>There was only one course of action left. She straightened her shoulders, jerked her hand away from his, and shoved the bouquet of flowers at him. Then she made a curtsy to the priest, turned around, and walked away.</p><p>The message was clear. Still, there were a few Maclaurin soldiers who were slow to catch on.</p><p>\u201cIs the lass leaving?\u201d Keith, the commander over the Maclaurin soldiers, whispered his question in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting away, MacBain,\u201d another called out.</p><p>\u201cIt appears she is leaving,\u201d Father MacKechnie interjected. \u201cDid I say something to displease her?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas started to go after his sister. MacBain grabbed him by his arm and shook his head at him. He shoved the bouquet at the baron, muttered something under his breath, and then went after his bride.</p><p>She\u2019d almost made it to the edge of the clearing before MacBain caught up with her. He grabbed her by her shoulders and turned her around. She wouldn\u2019t look up at him. He forced her chin up with his hand.</p><p>She braced herself for his anger. He would surely lash out at her. She was a strong woman, she reminded herself. She would withstand his wrath.</p><p>\u201cWill you try to obey?\u201d</p><p>He sounded exasperated. She was so astonished by his attitude she smiled. She wasn\u2019t such a weakling after all, she thought to herself. She had just stood up to the laird and forced him to negotiate. She wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d won much. but she definitely hadn\u2019t lost anything.</p><p>\u201cYes, I will try,\u201d she promised. \u201cUpon occasion,\u201d she hastily added.</p><p>He rolled his eyes heavenward. He\u2019d allowed quite enough time on the topic, he decided. He grabbed hold of her hand and dragged her back to the altar. She had to run to keep up with him.</p><p>Nicholas quit frowning when he spotted his sister\u2019s smile. He was highly curious to find out what the argument had been about, of course, but he thought he\u2019d have to wait until the wedding ceremony was over before he could find out what happened.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait after all. Johanna accepted the bouquet from her brother and turned back to the priest.</p><p>\u201cPlease forgive the interruption, Father,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The priest nodded. He again asked her to love, honor, and obey her husband. He added the word please this time.</p><p>\u201cI will love, honor, and try to obey my husband upon occasion,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Nicholas started laughing. He now understood what the argument had been about. The Maclaurins and the MacBains let out a collective gasp. They were horrified.</p><p>Their laird scanned his audience and glared them into silence. Then he turned his scowl on his bride. \u201cObedience and submissiveness aren\u2019t necessarily the same thing,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI was taught that they were,\u201d she defended.</p><p>\u201cYou were taught wrong.\u201d</p><p>His frown was frightening enough to start her fretting again. Dear God. she really couldn\u2019t go through with this. She didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>She shoved the bouquet of flowers at MacBain again and turned to leave. The laird slammed the flowers into Nicholas\u2019s outstretched hand and grabbed hold of Johanna before she could get away.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going through this again.\u201d</p><p>To prove he meant what he\u2019d just said, he threw his arm around her shoulders and anchored her into his side. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get this done before nightfall, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She felt like a fool. The priest was staring at her with a look on his face that suggested he thought she\u2019d lost her mind. She took a breath, accepted her flowers from her brother again, and then said, \u201cPray forgive me for interrupting you again, Father. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>The priest mopped his brow with his linen square, then turned his attention to the groom. Johanna barely paid attention to the priest\u2019s lecture on the merits of being a good husband. She was too busy trying to get past her embarrassment. She decided she was sick of worrying. Her decision was made, and that was that. She said a quick prayer and made up her mind to put her fears in God\u2019s hands. Let Him do the worrying.</p><p>It was a sound plan, she decided. Still, she wished He would give her a sign that everything really would turn out all right. That notion made her smile. She was being terribly fanciful. She was a woman, and, therefore, last in God\u2019s love, or so she\u2019d been told over and over again by Bishop Hallwick. God certainly didn\u2019t have time to listen to her paltry concerns, and she was probably committing a sin of vanity just by hoping for any kind of sign.</p><p>She let out a little sigh. MacBain heard the sound and turned to look down at her. She smiled weakly up at him.</p><p>It was MacBain\u2019s turn to answer the priest\u2019s questions. He started with his name and title.</p><p>He was called Gabriel.</p><p>God had given her a sign. Johanna\u2019s eyes widened, and she thought her mouth might have dropped open.</p><p>She was quick to regain control of her emotions. Her thoughts weren\u2019t controlled, though. They raced with questions. Had his mother deliberately named him after the highest of angels, the most esteemed in God\u2019s love? Johanna remembered her religion lessons well about the archangel. He was known as the protector of women and children. She remembered the wonderful stories passed down through the generations from mother to child about the most magnificent of all the angels. Her own mother had told her Gabriel would always watch out for her. He was her own special archangel and was to be called upon for aid in the dead of night when nightmares came creeping into her dreams. The archangel was the champion of the innocents and the avenger of evil.</p><p>She shook her head. She was being overly romantic, that was all. There wasn\u2019t anything symbolic about her husband\u2019s name. His mother had probably been in a fanciful mood when he was born. There was also the possibility he was named after a relative, too.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t convince herself. Lack of sleep made her easy prey for such foolish thoughts, she supposed. Still, she had prayed for a miracle last night, and just minutes before she\u2019d wished for a sign of some sort to let her know everything was going to be all right.</p><p>Johanna had seen a drawing a holy man had made in charcoal of Gabriel. She still remembered every detail of the rendering. The archangel had been depicted as a giant warrior with a gleaming sword in his hand. He had wings.</p><p>The man standing beside her didn\u2019t have wings, but he was certainly a giant warrior with his sword at his side.</p><p>And his name was Gabriel. Had God answered her prayer after all?</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>His mama should have named him Lucifer. Johanna came to that conclusion by the end of the day. Barbarian or Savage would have been suitable alternative names, she thought to herself. Her husband had the devil inside him with his arrogant, high-handed orders. The man was also completely devoid of all civilized manners. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Didn\u2019t he know it wasn\u2019t polite to fight on his wedding day?</p><p>Oh, Gabriel started out pleasant enough. As soon as Father MacKechnie gave the final blessing and the mass was over, her new husband turned her to face him. He was handed a beautiful multicolored plaid. It matched the one he was wearing. He draped the long, narrow cloth over her right shoulder. A second plaid made with different tones was draped over her left shoulder. The first, her husband explained, was the MacBain plaid; the second, the Maclaurin. He waited until she nodded understanding, then pulled her into his arms and kissed the breath right out of her.</p><p>She had expected only a quick peck. She got ravaged. MacBain\u2019s mouth was hard and hot. The heat the passionate kiss sparked made her cheeks turn pink. She considered pulling away, then gave up the idea. The kiss became so consuming, she didn\u2019t have the strength or the inclination.</p><p>The laughter in the background finally caught Gabriel\u2019s attention. He abruptly ended the kiss, nodded with satisfaction when he saw the bemused expression on his bride\u2019s face, and then turned his attention to the priest.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t as quick to recover. She sagged into her husband\u2019s side.</p><p>Father MacKechnie hurried around the side of the altar to give his congratulations. \u201cWell now, that was a fine wedding ceremony,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Alex wiggled his way between his father and Johanna. She felt him tugging on her skirts and smiled at the child.</p><p>The priest drew her attention again with a snort of laughter. \u201cFor a minute there, I didn\u2019t believe we\u2019d get it done.\u201d</p><p>Both her husband and the priest looked at Johanna. She smiled back. \u201cI never doubted,\u201d she remarked. \u201cOnce I make up my mind to do something. I get it done.\u201d</p> <p>Neither man looked as though he believed the boast. The priest pulled Alex away from Johanna\u2019s skirts and moved him to stand on his father\u2019s left. \u201cShall we begin the receiving line?\u201d he suggested. \u201cThe clan will want to come forward to offer their good wishes.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel continued to stare at his bride. He acted as though he wanted to tell her something but couldn\u2019t get the words out.</p><p>\u201cDid you wish to say something to me, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that. I dislike the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a fine name.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. She tried not to take exception to that rather barbaric sound. \u201cYou should be proud to have such a grand name.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted again. She gave up. \u201cWhat should I call you?\u201d she asked him, trying to be accommodating.</p><p>\u201cLaird,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look like he was jesting with her. She wasn\u2019t about to agree with his suggestion. It was ridiculous for a husband and wife to use such formal names. She decided to use diplomacy to gain his cooperation, for she didn\u2019t believe defiance would work now.</p><p>\u201cBut when we\u2019re alone?\u201d she asked. \u201cMay I call you Gabriel then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must address me, call me . . . call me MacBain. Aye, that name will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I must address you? Have you any idea how arrogant you sound?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s good of you to say I\u2019m arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He was through discussing the topic. \u201cYou were right to include the boy.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d sounded so gruff and because she was still reacting to the ludicrous suggestion that she call him MacBain, it took a full minute for her to realize he was actually thanking her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain how to respond. She nodded, then said, \u201cHe should have had a proper bath before the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>MacBain tried not to smile. He really shouldn\u2019t let her get away with such open rebukes, but God\u2019s truth, he was so pleased to see she had some spirit inside her, he didn\u2019t chastise her.</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll see that he does.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take any time at all for his barb to hit. The implication that he would marry again wasn\u2019t lost on her.</p><p>\u201cYou like having the last word, don\u2019t you, Laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d he admitted with a grin.</p><p>Alex, his father noticed, was staring up at Johanna with a look of rapture on his face. The priest had moved him to the side for the receiving line, but the boy had already squeezed himself next to Johanna again.</p><p>His bride had won over the boy in a matter of minutes. MacBain found himself wondering how long it would take him to win her affections. It was a foolish thought. Why did he care how she felt about him? The marriage had secured him the land, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>The soldiers from both clans came forward, one by one, to introduce themselves to Johanna and to give their laird their congratulations. The women came forward next. One young red-haired lady who introduced herself as Leila from the Maclaurin clan handed Johanna a beautiful bouquet of purple and white flowers. She thanked the woman for her gift and thought to add the flowers to the nosegay she\u2019d been gripping in her other hand. When she saw the mess she\u2019d made of the flowers Father MacKechnie had given her, she burst into laughter. The flowers were gone. Had she been holding a bouquet of stems throughout the ceremony?</p><p>Alex was fidgety by the time the introductions were finished. The women hurried back and forth across the courtyard with trays of food to put out on the tables the men were assembling. Gabriel was deep in conversation with two Maclaurin soldiers.</p><p>Johanna turned to Calum and Keith. \u201cThere are six horses in the meadow below,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s to be my very own,\u201d Alex blurted out. MacBain heard his son\u2019s comment and turned back to look at Johanna. His smile was devilish. \u201cSo that is how you won him over,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>She ignored her husband and kept her attention on the soldiers. \u201cThey are my wedding gift to my husband . . . and Alex,\u201d she hastily included. \u201cWill you please send someone to fetch them?\u201d</p><p>The soldiers bowed and went to see the task completed. Alex tugged on the hem of Johanna\u2019s bliaut to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cDid Papa give you a gift?\u201d</p><p>His father answered his question. \u201cNay, I didn\u2019t, Alex.\u201d</p><p>She contradicted him. \u201cYes, he did, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he give you?\u201d the little boy asked. MacBain was also curious to hear what she had to say. She was smiling at Alex.</p><p>\u201cHe gave me a son.\u201d</p><p>MacBain was taken aback by her declaration. His son wasn\u2019t certain what she\u2019d meant.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m his son,\u201d he declared. He pointed at his chest so she would be sure to understand.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Johanna answered.</p><p>The boy smiled. \u201cIs a son better than six horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than even a hundred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Alex was convinced of his importance. His chest puffed up with pride.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>He opened his mouth to answer, then closed it again. From the puzzled look on his face, she assumed he didn\u2019t know. She turned to her husband to get her answer. He shrugged. He obviously didn\u2019t know either.</p><p>She was appalled. \u201cYou don\u2019t know your son\u2019s age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s young,\u201d MacBain answered.</p><p>Alex immediately nodded agreement over his father\u2019s announcement. \u201cI\u2019m young,\u201d he repeated. \u201cPapa, could I go look at the horses?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. His son let go of Johanna\u2019s bliaut and went chasing after Calum and Keith.</p><p>Father MacKechnie had witnessed the scene between the child and Johanna. \u201cThe lad\u2019s taken with her, isn\u2019t he?\u201d he remarked to the laird as he watched Alex run across the yard.</p><p>\u201cShe bribed him,\u201d MacBain drawled out.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Johanna agreed.</p><p>\u201cMen aren\u2019t so easily won over,\u201d her husband remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in winning any man over, Laird. Please excuse me. I would like to talk to my brother.\u201d</p><p>It was a wonderful dismissal, yet completely ruined when Gabriel grabbed hold of her hand and pulled her back.</p><p>Nicholas had to come to her. He was surrounded by women, of course, because of his handsome looks and his gift for charm, and Johanna had to wait several minutes before her brother noticed her motioning to him and disengaged himself from his admirers.</p><p>Nicholas addressed MacBain first. \u201cI\u2019ll be sending men here in a month or two to help with the rebuilding.\u201d</p><p>MacBain shook his head. \u201cYou will not send any soldiers here. We\u2019ll kill them the minute they set foot on our land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn man, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much was the fine you paid to your king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fine?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>Both Nicholas and Gabriel ignored her question. Her brother gave MacBain the sum. Gabriel announced he would reimburse the baron for the expense.</p><p>Johanna finally caught on. She turned to her brother. \u201cDo you mean to say our king made you pay a fine? Why, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we chose your husband, Johanna. He agreed . . . for a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d agreed to marry his choice?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cWilliams?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen there wouldn\u2019t have been a fine, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me. You told me you didn\u2019t have enough coins to loan me to pay the tax to John so I could remain free for one more year\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas let out a sigh. \u201cI did lie.\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou were putting off the inevitable, and I was concerned about your safety. Damn it all, you were held prisoner in London. I couldn\u2019t be certain you\u2019d be safe for long, and there was also the worry John might give the Maclaurin land to someone else.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was right. She knew he loved her, too, and was thinking only about her safety. \u201cI forgive you your deception, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home, Baron. Don\u2019t come back. You\u2019ve done your duty. Johanna is my responsibility now.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was stunned by her husband\u2019s rudeness. \u201cNow?\u201d she blurted out. \u201cYou want him to go home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d her husband repeated.</p><p>\u201cMy brother . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t your brother.\u201d</p><p>She was so outraged by his behavior, she felt like screaming. Her husband wasn\u2019t paying her any attention now. His gaze was directed on Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like brother and sister, and when Johanna gave the priest her full name, I realized you weren\u2019t related. Your feelings for her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicholas wouldn\u2019t let MacBain continue. \u201cYou\u2019re very astute,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cJohanna doesn\u2019t have any inkling, Laird. Leave it be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave us, Johanna. This discussion doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>His tone of voice didn\u2019t suggest she argue. She started wringing the petals off the fresh bouquet while she looked at the grim expression on each man\u2019s face.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to make up her mind to leave or stay. Father MacKechnie had heard enough to know a fight was brewing. He took hold of Johanna\u2019s arm, feigned enthusiasm, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be hurting the women\u2019s feelings if you don\u2019t taste their special dishes. Come along now. They\u2019ll fret until they get a wee bit of praise from their new mistress. Do you remember how to say thank you in Gaelic?\u201d</p><p>The priest half-dragged, half-nudged her away from the two men. Johanna kept looking back over her shoulder to see what was happening. Nicholas looked furious. So did MacBain. Her husband, she noticed, was doing most of the talking. Nicholas happened to glance her way, noticed she was watching him, and then said something to MacBain. Her husband nodded. The two men turned and disappeared down the slope.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see either one of them again until the sun was fading from the sky. She let out a loud sigh of relief when she spotted her husband and her brother coming back up the hill. Streaks of orange from the sun\u2019s descent filled the sky behind them. Their silhouettes, made black by the distance and the sun\u2019s trickery, made them appear mystical. They seemed to rise out of the earth like mighty, invincible godlike warriors. They moved with such easy grace.</p><p>They were the fittest warriors she\u2019d ever seen. The archangel Gabriel was surely smiling down at the pair. They were, after all, surely fashioned in his image.</p><p>Johanna smiled over her fanciful thoughts. Then she got a good look at their faces. She let out a horrified gasp. Nicholas had a bloody nose. His right eye was swollen shut. MacBain didn\u2019t appear to be in any better condition. Blood poured down from a cut high on his forehead. There was another cut seeping blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know who to yell at first. She instinctively thought to run to Nicholas and give him holy hell while she measured the extent of his injuries, but by the time she\u2019d lifted the hem of her skirts and started running, she realized she should probably go to Gabriel first. He was her husband now, and he should come first in her thoughts. There was also the fact that, if she was able to soothe his temper, he might be more willing to listen to reason and allow her brother to stay a few more days.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting.\u201d</p><p>She shouted the accusation when she reached her husband. He didn\u2019t believe he needed to agree. It was damned obvious they\u2019d been fighting, and he didn\u2019t particularly care for the anger in her voice.</p><p>Johanna pulled the linen square she kept tucked in the sleeve of her gown and stretched up on tiptoe to pat the blood away from the cut so she could see how deep the injury was. She gently brushed his hair back, out of her way.</p><p>He jerked his head back. He wasn\u2019t used to anyone fretting over him, and he didn\u2019t know how to react.</p><p>\u201cDo stand still, m\u2019lord,\u201d she ordered. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>MacBain stood still and allowed her to fuss over him. Damn, but she pleased him, though not because she was acting concerned about him now. Nay, it was the fact that she\u2019d come to him first.</p><p>\u201cHave you resolved whatever was bothering you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d MacBain answered. He sounded surly.</p><p>She looked over at her brother. \u201cAnd you, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His tone was every bit as irritated as her husband\u2019s.</p><p>She turned back to her husband. \u201cWhy did you deliberately provoke Nicholas? He is my brother, you know,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cMy parents took him in when he was just eight years old. He was there when I was born and has been called brother by me from the moment I could speak. You owe him an apology, husband.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>MacBain ignored her suggestion and grabbed hold of her wrist so she would stop poking at his cut, then turned to Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cSay your good-byes now,\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou won\u2019t see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Johanna cried out. She pulled away from her husband and ran to her brother. She threw herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me the truth about him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a gentle man. He\u2019s hard and cruel. I can\u2019t bear the thought of never seeing you again. I love you. You protected me when no one else would. You believed in me. Nicholas, please take me home with you. I don\u2019t wish to stay here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHush, Johanna. It\u2019s going to be all right. MacBain has good reason for wanting me and my men to stay away from here. Learn to trust him.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas held MacBain\u2019s gaze while he gave his sister his instructions.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he want you to come back?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. His silence told her he wasn\u2019t going to explain. \u201cWhat message would you like me to give Mother? I\u2019ll see her next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home with you.\u201d</p> <p>Her brother\u2019s smile was filled with tenderness. \u201cYou\u2019re married now. This is your home. You have to stay with your husband, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let go of him. Nicholas leaned down, kissed her forehead, and then pulled her hands away from him. He gently nudged her toward her husband.</p><p>\u201cTreat her well, MacBain, or by all that\u2019s holy, I\u2019ll come back here and kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be your right,\u201d MacBain answered. He walked past Johanna to slap his hand against Nicholas\u2019s. \u201cYou and I have come to an understanding. My word is my bond, Baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my word is my bond, Laird.\u201d</p><p>The two men nodded. Johanna stood there with tears streaming down her face as she watched her brother walk away. His mount had already been made ready for him. Nicholas gained his stallion\u2019s back, then rode down the hill and out of sight. He never looked back.</p> <p>Johanna turned around and found that her husband had also left. She was suddenly alone. She stood at the edge of the clearing feeling as bleak and desolate as her surroundings. She didn\u2019t move until the sun had disappeared from the sky. The bone-chilling wind finally gained her attention. She shivered with the cold and rubbed her arms as she slowly made her way back to the courtyard. There wasn\u2019t a Scot in sight, or so she thought, until she reached the center of the clearing. She saw her husband then. He was leaning against the door to the keep, watching her.</p><p>Johanna wiped the tears away from her face, straightened her appearance, and hurried forward. She climbed the steps with only one intention. Childish though it probably was, she was determined to tell him how much she disliked him.</p><p>She never got the chance. MacBain waited until she was close enough, then pulled her into his arms. He held her tight against his chest, dropped his chin to rest on the top of her head, and hugged her.</p><p>The man was actually trying to comfort her. His actions thoroughly confused her. He had been the one, after all, to cause her this upset. Yet now he was trying to soothe her.</p><p>Damn it all, it was working. She knew she was overly exhausted from the long, difficult day, and surely that was the reason she didn\u2019t try to pull away from him. He was wonderfully warm: she told herself she needed his heat to chase away the cold. She was still going to give him hell, but she\u2019d wait until she was warm first.</p><p>Gabriel held her for several minutes while he patiently waited for her to regain her composure.</p><p>She finally pulled away from him. \u201cYour rudeness toward my brother made me most unhappy, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>She hoped for an apology. She realized after a minute of waiting, she wasn\u2019t going to get one.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to go to bed now,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019m very sleepy. Would you please show me the way back to my cottage? I\u2019m not certain where it is in the darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cottage you slept in last night belongs to one of the MacBains. You won\u2019t sleep there again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where do I sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere are two chambers above the stairs. The Maclaurins were able to stop the fire before it reached the steps.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the door wide and motioned for her to go inside. She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask you something, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>She waited for his nod, then said, \u201cSomeday will you explain why you sent my brother away and ordered him never to return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time you\u2019ll understand,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be happy to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be accommodating, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t snort because it wouldn\u2019t have been ladylike. The look in her eyes told him she didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cI released your brother from a burden, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was his burden?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t his burden,\u201d he answered. \u201cGo inside now.\u201d</p><p>She decided to obey his command. The woman who had handed her the fresh bouquet of flowers after the wedding ceremony was standing at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, this is ...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let her husband finish. \u201cLeila,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you again for the beautiful flowers. It was most thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, m\u2019lady,\u201d the woman replied. She had a soft, musical voice and a pleasing smile. Her hair was as red as fire and every bit as mesmerizing. Johanna guessed her age to be near her own.</p><p>\u201cWas it difficult for you to leave your family and friends to come here?\u201d Leila asked.</p><p>\u201cThere were no friends close by,\u201d Johanna answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your staff? Our laird surely would have granted you permission to bring your lady\u2019s maid.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t know how to answer the question. She barely knew her staff. Raulf had changed the household every other month. At first she believed he was just overly demanding. Later she caught on. He wanted to keep her isolated, without anyone to confide in. She was to depend only upon him. After his death, she\u2019d been forced to London and hadn\u2019t formed any attachments while a prisoner in King John\u2019s court.</p><p>\u201cI would not have allowed any other Englishwoman here,\u201d MacBain said when Johanna hesitated in giving her answer.</p><p>\u201cThey were content to stay in England,\u201d Johanna interjected.</p><p>Leila nodded, then turned and started up the steps. Johanna followed her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be happy here?\u201d she asked over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Johanna answered, praying she was right. \u201cI\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d</p><p>MacBain frowned. Johanna had no idea how much that comment said about her past. He stood at the bottom of the steps, watching his bride.</p><p>Leila wasn\u2019t as astute as her laird. \u201cBut I asked you if you\u2019d be happy,\u201d she said with a bit of laughter in her voice. \u201cOf course you\u2019ll be safe here. Our laird will protect you.\u201d</p><p>She could take care of herself, Johanna thought. She didn\u2019t tell Leila that, however, for she didn\u2019t want the woman to think she wasn\u2019t grateful to have the laird\u2019s protection. She turned around to look at her husband.</p><p>\u201cGood night, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>Johanna followed Leila up the rest of the steps. The landing was partially blocked by a stack of wooden crates on the left so no one would pitch over into the great hall or the hallway below. A narrow corridor was on the opposite side. There were candles perched inside bronzed holders braced against the wall to light the way. Leila started telling Johanna about the keep and begged her to ask questions that came to mind. Another woman named Megan waited inside the first chamber with a bath ready for Johanna. She had dark brown hair and hazel eyes and also wore the Maclaurin plaid. Her smile was just as inviting as Leila\u2019s.</p><p>Their easy acceptance of Johanna helped her relax. The bath felt wonderful. She told them how thoughtful they were to think she would enjoy the luxury.</p><p>\u201cOur laird ordered the bath for you,\u201d Megan explained. \u201cSince a MacBain gave up his bed for you last night, it was the Maclaurins\u2019 turn to do something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only fair,\u201d Leila added.</p><p>Before Johanna could ask what she meant by that remark, Megan turned the topic. She wanted to talk about the wedding. \u201cYou looked so beautiful, m\u2019lady. Did you do the embroidery work on your dress? It was quite lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she didn\u2019t do the work herself,\u201d Leila said. \u201cHer maid . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did do the sewing,\u201d Johanna interjected.</p><p>The conversation continued all during her bath. Johanna finally bid the ladies good night and went down the hall to the second chamber.</p><p>The room was warm inside and very appealing. There was a hearth against the outside wall, a huge bed draped with the MacBain plaid along the opposite wall, and a window overlooking the meadow below. A thick fur covering on the window blocked the night winds, and that protection, added to the fire blazing away in the hearth, made the room most inviting.</p><p>The bed all but swallowed her up. She imagined four people could sleep under the covers together side by side without touching each other. Her feet were cold, but that was the only discomfort she felt. She considered getting out of her bed in search of a pair of woolen stockings, then decided the task would require too much effort. She probably should have taken the time to braid her hair, she thought with a loud yawn. It was going to be full of tangles in the morning. She decided she was too tired to care. She closed her eyes, said her prayers, and went to sleep.</p><p>The door opened just as she was drifting off. Her mind didn\u2019t register what was happening until she felt the side of the bed sag. She slowly opened her eyes. It was all right, she told herself. It was Gabriel and not an intruder sitting on the side of the bed.</p><p>He was taking his boots off. She tried not to be alarmed. \u201cWhat are you doing, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was a groggy whisper. He looked over his shoulder to answer her. \u201cI\u2019m getting ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes again. He thought she\u2019d gone back to sleep. MacBain sat there staring down at her for several minutes. She rested on her side, facing him. Her hair, as golden as a sunset, was spread over her shoulders like a coverlet. She looked exquisite to him. Innocent and fragile as well. She was much younger than he\u2019d supposed she would be, and after he and Nicholas had resolved their differences and the baron had wisely decided to obey his commands, he\u2019d asked him exactly how old his sister was. Nicholas couldn\u2019t remember the date of her birth, but he\u2019d said she\u2019d been little more than a child when her parents received the order from King John to marry her to his favored baron.</p><p>Johanna suddenly bolted upright in the bed. \u201cHere? You think to sleep here, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d choked on the question. He nodded, wondering why she looked so panic-stricken.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. She was too stunned to speak. Gabriel stood up, untied the piece of leather holding his plaid in place, then tossed the strip of leather on the nearby chair. His plaid dropped to the floor.</p><p>He was stark naked. She squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cGabriel ...\u201d His name came out in a low whisper.</p><p>She\u2019d closed her eyes, but not before she\u2019d gotten a thorough look at his backside. It was enough to make her feel fainthearted. The man was bronzed from the sun from neck to ankles, and how in heaven\u2019s name was that possible? Did he walk around without a stitch on during the sunlight hours?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to ask him. She felt the covers being pulled back, then felt the sag of the bed again as he stretched out beside her. He started to reach for her.</p><p>She bounded to her knees and turned around to face him. He was on his back and hadn\u2019t bothered to cover himself. She grabbed hold of the blanket and fairly tossed it over his middle. She could feel her face burning with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been tricked, m\u2019lord. Aye, you have!\u201d she blurted out in a near shout.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t know what in God\u2019s name had come over her. She looked terrified. Her eyes filled with tears, and he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if she\u2019d burst into sobs.</p><p>\u201cHow was I tricked?\u201d He\u2019d deliberately kept his voice calm and low. He stacked his hands behind his head and acted as though he had all the time in the world to wait for her answer.</p><p>His casual attitude helped to calm her. She took a deep breath, then said, \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t tell you. He said he had explained . . . Oh, God, I\u2019m so sorry. I should have made certain you knew. When I found out you already had a son, I thought you knew about me and that it didn\u2019t matter. You had an heir. You . . .\u201d</p><p>Gabriel reached up and put his hand over her mouth. Tears were streaming down her face. He kept his voice soothing when he said, \u201cYour brother\u2019s an honorable man.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He removed his hand from her mouth, then gently tugged her down next to him. \u201cYes, Nicholas is an honorable man,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The side of her face rested on his shoulder. He could feel her tears as they dropped on his skin.</p><p>\u201cNicholas wouldn\u2019t trick me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think he would.\u201d She sounded bewildered.</p><p>A long minute passed while he waited for her to tell him what was bothering her.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he forgot to tell you . . . or thought he had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he forget to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot have children.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to continue. \u201cAnd?\u201d he asked when she didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>She\u2019d been holding her breath, waiting for his reaction. She thought he\u2019d be furious. He didn\u2019t appear to be, however. He was casually stroking her arm. An angry man wouldn\u2019t caress. He would strike.</p><p>Johanna decided he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI\u2019m barren,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI thought Nicholas told you. If you want the marriage annulled, I\u2019m sure that Father MacKechnie will see to the petition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas did tell me, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She bolted up in the bed again. \u201cHe told you?\u201d She looked thoroughly confused. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m your husband and this is our wedding night. It\u2019s a usual occurrence to share the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean you wish to sleep here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned right I mean to,\u201d he answered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked incredulous now. \u201cAnd every other night,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m your husband,\u201d he explained.</p><p>He pulled her down next to him again, rolled to his side, and leaned over her. He gently brushed the hair away from the side of her face.</p> <p>His touch was gentle and soothing. \u201cAre you here just to sleep, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you wish to ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, irritated by how horrified she looked now.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>She really didn\u2019t understand. His own observation soothed his pride, but he couldn\u2019t control his exasperation with her. \u201cJohanna, weren\u2019t you married for three years?\u201d</p><p>She was trying not to stare into his eyes. It was a difficult task. They really were quite beautiful. The color was the purest of gray. He had nice high cheekbones, too, and a straight nose. He really was a handsome devil, and even though she tried not to care, her heartbeat reacted to his nearness. It was racing now. His scent was appealing, too. He smelled clean, male. His hair was damp. Gabriel had had a bath before coming to bed.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have thought that was nice. She did, though. She really should get hold of her undisciplined thoughts. What he looked like or how he smelled shouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to answer me before daylight?\u201d</p><p>She remembered his question. \u201cI was married three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how can you ask me if I want to sleep with you?\u201d</p> <p>His confusion didn\u2019t make any sense to her. \u201cFor what purpose? I can\u2019t have your children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned that,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThere\u2019s another reason I want to bed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other reason?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s pleasure in the marriage act. Have you never experienced it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about pleasure, m\u2019lord, but I\u2019m most familiar with disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be disappointed, or do you believe you will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us will be disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you\u2019ll become angry. It\u2019s really for the better if you leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to agree to that suggestion. She acted as though she had everything all figured out. He didn\u2019t need to ask where she\u2019d gotten her opinions. It was apparent to him she\u2019d been sorely mistreated by her first husband. She was so damned innocent and vulnerable. MacBain thought it a pity Raulf was dead. He would have liked to kill him.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t change the past for her, however. All he could do was concentrate on the present and their future together. He leaned down and kissed her brow. He was pleased to see she didn\u2019t flinch or try to turn away.</p><p>\u201cTonight is the first time for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was going to explain that it would be their first time together and that it would be a new beginning for both of them, but Johanna interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not a virgin, m\u2019lord. Raulf came to my bed many times during our first year as man and wife.\u201d</p><p>That statement caught his curiosity. He leaned back to look at her. \u201cAnd after the first year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to other women. He was most disappointed in me. Aren\u2019t there any women you could go to?\u201d</p><p>She sounded enthusiastic over the possibility. He didn\u2019t know if he should be insulted or amused. Most wives didn\u2019t wish to share their husbands. Johanna looked eager enough to run outside and recruit a mistress for him. Hell, she\u2019d probably give up her side of the bed. too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She had the gall to look disgruntled. He was having difficulty believing this bizarre conversation. He grinned and shook his head. \u201cI want you,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s your right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the covers away. She jerked them back in place. \u201cJust one moment please,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to ask you an important question before you begin.\u201d</p><p>He frowned over her request. She turned her gaze to his chin so he wouldn\u2019t see how frightened she was becoming as she waited for his agreement or his denial.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to know what will happen when you\u2019re disappointed.\u201d She dared a quick look up into his eyes, then hastily added, \u201cI would like to prepare myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look as though she believed him.</p><p>\u201cBut when you are?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>He held onto his patience. \u201cThen I will have no one to blame but myself.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a long minute before letting go of her death grip on the covers. While he watched, she folded her hands together on top of her stomach and closed her eyes. The look of resignation on her face made him shake his head in frustration.</p><p>It was inevitable, he supposed. Gabriel was going to get his way, and she was intelligent enough to know it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in a complete panic. She remembered the pain involved in the mating act; and although she certainly wasn\u2019t looking forward to the god-awful discomfort, it wouldn\u2019t be unbearable. It wouldn\u2019t kill her. She had gotten through the ordeal before, she reminded herself; she could get through it again. She would survive.</p><p>\u201cAll right, m\u2019lord. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Lord, she was an exasperating woman. \u201cNay, Johanna,\u201d he countered in a low, gruff whisper.</p><p>He reached for the ribbon holding her gown in place and pulled the string free. \u201cYou aren\u2019t ready yet, but you will be. \u2019Tis my duty to make you want me, and I won\u2019t take you until you do.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to his promise. God\u2019s truth, she looked as though she\u2019d just been placed inside a wooden box. The only thing missing was a flower clutched between her rigid fingers, MacBain decided. Then he\u2019d know for certain she was dead and about to be put in the ground.</p><p>He decided he was going to have to change his approach. His bride was alarmingly pale and as tense as the string on his bow right now. She was on guard against him. That fact didn\u2019t bother him overly much, for he understood her reasons, even if she didn\u2019t. He was going to have to wait until she had calmed down just a little. Then he would begin his gentle attack. His strategy wasn\u2019t complex. He was simply going to overwhelm her. Hopefully she wouldn\u2019t realize what was happening to her until it was too late. Her shields would be down; and once passion ignited, there wouldn\u2019t be much room in her mind for fear.</p><p>He\u2019d already learned his bride was a gentle lady. The expression on her face when she\u2019d been talking to his son before the wedding told him she was a compassionate, caring woman. He didn\u2019t know if she had a passionate nature, however, but he was determined to find out before either one of them left the bed.</p><p>MacBain leaned down, kissed her brow, and then rolled onto his back and closed his eyes.</p><p>Long minutes passed before she realized he was actually going to sleep. She turned to stare at him. Why had she been given this reprieve?</p><p>\u201cHave I already disappointed you, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She continued to watch him, waiting for further explanation. He didn\u2019t say another word to appease her curiosity.</p><p>Not understanding his motives made her worry all the more. \u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTake your shift off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep. I won\u2019t touch you tonight.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were closed, and he, therefore, didn\u2019t see the change in her expression. He heard her sigh though, speculated it was due to relief, and couldn\u2019t help but become a little irritated with the woman. Hell, it was going to be a long, long night before he found satisfaction.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t make any sense out of his order. If he was going to leave her alone, why did he care if she wore a nightgown or not? Perhaps the command was just his way of saving face, she thought to herself. She wasn\u2019t about to argue with him, not now, not after she\u2019d been given this wonderful gift.</p><p>Since his eyes were closed, she didn\u2019t have to concern herself with modesty. She got out of the bed, took her gown off, folded it neatly, then walked around to the other side of the bed to put the garment on the chair next to it. His plaid was on the floor. She picked it up, folded it, and put it on top of her nightgown.</p><p>The air inside the chamber had become frigid, and the floorboards were freezing cold against her bare feet. She hurried to get back under the covers before her toes turned to ice.</p><p>His heat drew her close to his side, but she was careful not to touch him. She turned on her side, giving him her back, and ever so slowly edged closer and closer to him.</p><p>It took her a long time to relax. She was afraid to trust him, yet afraid not to because he was now her husband and deserved her trust, until he\u2019d proven he wasn\u2019t worthy, of course. Nicholas trusted him. Her brother was the most honorable man she\u2019d ever known, save for her father. Nicholas was also an excellent judge of character. He wouldn\u2019t have suggested she marry the laird if he didn\u2019t believe Gabriel was a good, decent man. There was also the telling fact that her husband hadn\u2019t forced himself on her. Why, he was actually being very accommodating.</p><p>The heat from his body radiated against her back. It felt wonderful. She moved just a little bit closer until the backs of her thighs touched the tops of his. She was sound asleep minutes later.</p><p>Gabriel decided he was going to get a high place in heaven no matter how mortal his past sins were and all because of the consideration he\u2019d shown his bride tonight. Anticipation made his forehead break out in a cold sweat. Rolling in hot coals wouldn\u2019t have been as painful as this wait, he decided. He believed he could endure any amount of physical pain, but lying next to her with lustful thoughts raging through his mind now made this night one hell of a challenge. She wasn\u2019t helping matters much. She kept pressing her backside up against his groin. It was the sweetest torture he\u2019d ever experienced and he had to clench his jaw tight against the provocation.</p><p>The fire burned down to embers in the hearth and it was well after midnight before he decided he\u2019d waited long enough. He put his arm around Johanna\u2019s waist and leaned down to nuzzle the side of her neck. She awakened with a start. She went completely rigid, but only for a minute or two, and then she put her hand on top of his where it rested just below her breasts. She tried to push his hand away. He wouldn\u2019t move. She was groggy from sleep, and the wet kisses he placed on her neck were actually making her shiver with heat, not cold. It felt too good to worry about. Just to make certain he didn\u2019t think he was going to be allowed any more liberties, however, she laced her fingers through his to keep his hand from moving.</p><p>He knew what her plan was. He wasn\u2019t deterred. He teased her earlobe with his teeth, then with his tongue while he gently disengaged his hand from her hold and slowly began to caress the undersides of her full br**sts with his knuckles.</p><p>The sensations coursing through her body were extremely pleasant, surprising, too. Odd, but his touch made her restless for just a little more. His breath was sweet and warm against her skin. She instinctively tried to get away from him and yet tried to get closer at the same time. Her body was contradicting her mind. Until she felt the hard evidence of his arousal. A tremor of panic took hold. She turned to him. She was going to demand he keep his word. He had promised he wouldn\u2019t touch her tonight. Surely he hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t touch me tonight.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the frown away from her brow. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . .\u201d</p><p>He kissed the bridge of her nose. Johanna suddenly found herself surrounded by his heat. He\u2019d pinned her to the bed with his body and covered her from head to feet. His hard thighs rested between hers. His arousal was pressed intimately against the soft curls shielding the core of her femininity. The feel of his hard body against hers made her gasp with fear and pleasure.</p><p>\u201cGabriel . . .\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers through her hair and cupped the sides of her face. He leaned down until he was just inches away from her. His gaze was settled on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past midnight, Johanna. I kept my word to you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to protest or panic. He silenced her with a kiss. His mouth was hard and hot as it settled on top of hers. His tongue swept inside to rid her of any argument she might have wanted to make.</p><p>Gabriel wanted her to forget her fears before her mind became ruled by them. No matter how much he wanted her, he knew he would never force himself on her. If Johanna couldn\u2019t get past her apprehensions tonight, then he would wait and try again tomorrow . . . and tomorrow . . . and tomorrow. In time she would surely learn to trust him and then hopefully rid herself of her own inhibitions.</p><p>The kiss wasn\u2019t tender, but ravenous and carnal. She wasn\u2019t resisting him and was, in fact, kissing him just as thoroughly. A low groan of pleasure sounded in the back of his throat when her tongue timidly brushed against his.</p><p>The sexy sound of approval made her a little bolder. She was so overwhelmed by her own reaction to the arousing loveplay, she could barely think. She rubbed her feet against his legs in a restless motion and tried to remember to breathe.</p><p>She tasted as good as he\u2019d fantasized she would. His mouth slanted over hers again and again, and he didn\u2019t let up his assault against her defenses for a long while. He made love to her mouth with his tongue, slowly penetrating and then receding, forcing her to respond with his deliberate teasing.</p><p>He meant to overwhelm her, and overwhelmed she was. Within minutes she was trembling with desire. When his hands moved to her br**sts and his thumbs brushed across her sensitive nipples, she let out a low moan of pleasure. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from arching up against his hands, deliberately trying to get a little more of his sweet torment.</p><p>He had to make her put her arms around him. Her hands were fists at her sides until he dragged his mouth away from hers and told her what he wanted her to do.</p><p>And still she didn\u2019t cooperate. He lifted his head to look at her. He smiled with pure male satisfaction then. Johanna looked dazed by what was happening to her. There was passion in her eyes. He lowered his head again. He gave her another open-mouthed, tongue-dueling kiss just to let her know how pleased he was with her and then took hold of her hands and put them around his neck.</p><p>\u201cHold onto me,\u201d he commanded in a rough whisper. \u201cPull me close.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had the grip of a warrior. Gabriel slowly kissed a path to her chest. He palmed her br**sts with his hands, then leaned down to take one nipple into his mouth. Her nails raked his shoulders in reaction. He grunted with raw pleasure.</p><p>Gabriel had been in complete control of the loveplay; but when his hand slid down her flat, smooth, silky belly and moved lower to touch her intimately, and he began to caress the very heat of her, he lost his own composure. The folds hidden beneath her soft curls were slick, wet, and incredibly hot. His thumb rubbed across the sensitive nub of flesh as his fingers slowly penetrated her.</p><p>She cried out in fear now, for the intensity of the pleasure he forced on her was new, too frightening for her to understand or control. She tried to push his hand away, even as her body contradicted that action to move restlessly against him.</p><p>Dear God, she didn\u2019t know her own mind. \u201cGabriel, what is happening to me?\u201d</p> <p>Her nails dug into his shoulder blades and her head rolled to the side as he continued his lovemaking. He shifted his position so he could soothe her with another kiss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he whispered in a voice that sounded out of breath. \u201cYou like how this feels, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to answer him. His mouth took possession of hers again. His tongue moved inside just as his fingers plunged deep inside her tight sheath.</p><p>She came undone. Passion such as she\u2019d never known before ignited in the pit of her stomach and spread like wildfire through her body. She clung to her husband, whimpering now, demanding with her slow, erotic movements to end the overwhelming bliss.</p><p>And still he held back. The pressure building inside him was almost unbearable. All he wanted to think about was sinking into her beckoning heat. He fought against the raging desire and continued to make love to her with his mouth and his fingers. When she suddenly tightened around him, he knew she was about to find her own release. He immediately shifted positions again so that his arousal was pressed against the opening of her sheath. He braced himself on his elbows, held her jaw with his hand, and demanded that she look at him.</p> <p>\u201cSay my name, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded harsh and angry. The intensity in his expression indicated his restraint.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her quick and hard. He dragged his mouth away, looked down into her eyes, and demanded, \u201cNow and forever. Say the words, wife. Say them now.\u201d</p><p>Every nerve in her body was screaming for release. He gripped her shoulders while he waited for her pledge.</p><p>\u201cNow and forever, Gabriel.\u201d</p> <p>His head dropped to her shoulder. With one powerful surge, he imbedded himself fully inside her. He was surrounded by liquid heat. Dear God, she was tight and so damned hot he could barely stand the sweet agony.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stay still inside her, giving her body time to adjust to his invasion, and in the back of his mind was the worry he might be hurting her, yet he was powerless against the all-consuming demand of his own body now. His thrusts weren\u2019t measured but hard and urgent. She raised her knees to take him deeper inside. She surrounded him, squeezed him. He groaned with pure animal pleasure. It was exquisite agony. She became wild in his arms. She clung to her husband and met his demand by arching up against him. Her thighs tightened around him, and her whimpers, soft and incredibly sexy, drove him wild. He had never experienced such passion before. She held nothing back. Her complete surrender to him quickened his own. He didn\u2019t want it to be over. He slowly withdrew until he\u2019d almost become separate from her, then sank back again.</p><p>Gabriel was mindless now to everything but giving her fulfillment and finding his own. His breathing was harsh and choppy, and when he felt the tremors of her cl**ax and heard her call his name with a mixture of wonder and fear, he couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. He poured his seed into her with a loud, lusty groan.</p><p>Johanna\u2019s body seemed to splinter apart with her orgasm. She thought she\u2019d died. Never in her wildest imaginings could she have thought such bliss was possible. It was the most shattering and wondrous of experiences.</p><p>She had actually allowed herself the freedom to give herself completely to Gabriel, and dear Lord, her reward had been most astonishing. Her husband had held her close and kept her safe during the raging storm, and the sheer beauty of their lovemaking made tears come to her eyes.</p><p>She was too exhausted to weep. He had certainly drained her of her strength. He collapsed on top of her. She thought that she might have taken all of his strength, too. Yet his weight didn\u2019t crush her. She realized then his arms were still braced at her sides. As physically spent as he appeared to be, he still sought to protect her.</p><p>The scent of their lovemaking filled the air around them. Their heartbeats pounded frantic beats.</p><p>Gabriel was the first to recover. His immediate concern was for his wife. God, had he hurt her?</p> <p>\u201cJohanna?\u201d He forced his strength back into his arms and lifted himself up so that he could look at her. The concern in his expression was evident. \u201cDid I ...\u201d</p><p>Her laughter stopped his question. There was such joy in the sound, he couldn\u2019t help but smile in reaction.</p><p>\u201cAye, you did,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The woman was a puzzlement to him. \u201cHow can you laugh and cry at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his fingertips across one cheekbone to wipe the wetness away. \u201cAye, you are crying. Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She slowly shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it could be like this between a man and a woman. It was very beautiful. \u201d</p><p>Those words made him nod with arrogant satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019re a passionate woman, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew I was . . . not until tonight. Gabriel, it was most enjoyable. You made me ...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t come up with the right word to describe how she\u2019d felt. He was happy to supply it for her. \u201cBurn?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize some husbands liked to kiss and caress before mating,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned down, kissed her mouth, and then rolled onto his back, away from her. \u201cIt\u2019s called preparation, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d she whispered with a sigh. Raulf\u2019s idea of preparation was to pull the covers back. Johanna immediately blocked the memory. She didn\u2019t want to mar the beauty of what had just happened with ugly pictures from the past.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want Gabriel to go to sleep. God\u2019s truth, she wanted him to make love to her again. She couldn\u2019t believe her own boldness and had to shake her head over her own surprisingly wanton behavior.</p><p>Johanna pulled the covers up and closed her eyes. An unsettling thought began to nag her. Now that they had mated, shouldn\u2019t one of them leave? Raulf had always come to her bed, and, after he\u2019d finished with her, immediately left. Since Gabriel was acting as though he was going to sleep, she decided it was her duty to leave him.</p><p>She wanted to stay, but the thought of being ordered to leave would sting her pride. It was better not to give him the chance to order her to go, she supposed. Johanna battled with the worry for several minutes.</p><p>Gabriel was having disconcerting thoughts of his own. His cunning plan to overwhelm his bride while her defenses were down had been turned around on him. Hell, she\u2019d overwhelmed him. He\u2019d never lost his discipline so thoroughly with any other woman, never, ever felt this vulnerable, and he began to wonder what she would do if she knew she had such power over him. He scowled just thinking about it.</p><p>Johanna moved to the side of the bed. She reached for her robe before she stood up. She kept her back to her husband while she put the garment on. Her shoes, she remembered, were near the door.</p><p>And still she hesitated to leave. She couldn\u2019t understand her own mind. She felt miserable now and lonely, and she couldn\u2019t imagine why she wanted to weep. Their lovemaking had been wonderful, yet now she was filled with new uncertainty. Nay, she didn\u2019t understand this change in her, but she imagined she would have the rest of the dark hours to think about it. She doubted she would get any sleep, and by morning light she would have worked herself up into a state of exhaustion.</p><p>Gabriel looked as though he\u2019d already gone to sleep. She tried to be as quiet as possible as she made her way to the door. She was just reaching for the latch when he stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cTo the other chamber, m\u2019lord. I assumed that was where you wanted me to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back here, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She slowly walked back to his side of the bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the belt of her robe. His voice sounded only mildly curious when he asked, \u201cWhy do you want to sleep alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>He used the sleeves of her robe to pull the garment off. She was shivering with the cold. That observation amused him. He thought it was damned hot in the chamber. He pulled the cover back then and simply waited for her to get into bed again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. She climbed over her husband. Gabriel put his arms around her and pulled her close. The side of her face rested on his shoulder. He pulled the covers up, let out a loud yawn, and then said, \u201cYou will sleep in this bed with me every night. Do you understand, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>She bumped his chin when she nodded. \u201cIs it usual in the Highlands for husbands and wives to sleep together?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a roundabout answer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be usual for you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Her whispered agreement, given so quickly, pleased him. He tightened his hold on his bride and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>He grunted his reply.</p><p>\u201cAre you pleased you married me?\u201d</p><p>She was sorry she\u2019d asked the question the minute the words were out of her mouth. Now he would know how vulnerable she was feeling and how horribly insecure she really was.</p><p>\u201cThe land belongs to me now. That pleases me.\u201d</p><p>He was a brutally honest man. She thought she should probably admire that trait. She didn\u2019t though, not tonight. She decided she wanted him to lie to her and to tell her he was happy to have her for his wife. God, she was becoming daft. She didn\u2019t want to be married to a man who would blatantly lie to her. No, of course she didn\u2019t.</p><p>She knew she wasn\u2019t making any sense. Surely exhaustion was the reason she was having such foolish, unimportant thoughts. What did she care if he wanted her or not? She had gained exactly what she had set out to gain when she married him. She was free from King John\u2019s tentacles. Yes, she was free . . . and safe.</p><p>She had gotten exactly what she\u2019d bargained for, and so had he. The land now belonged to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too soft. I should have preferred a strong, tough-skinned woman.\u201d</p><p>She was almost asleep when she heard his comment. Since she didn\u2019t know what to say in reply, she kept silent.</p><p>Another minute passed before he spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019re too tender for life here. I doubt you\u2019ll survive a full year. I probably should have preferred a more robust, unemotional woman. Aye, you won\u2019t last a full year here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound particularly disturbed by that possibility. She tried not to take exception. She wasn\u2019t going to try to talk him out of his opinions either. Arguing that she was indeed a very strong woman with every bit as much endurance as any of the Highland women would have been useless. Gabriel had already formed his opinions and only time together would prove to him she wasn\u2019t a summer flower. She really did have stamina. She had already proven to herself she was a survivor. In time she would prove it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a timid lass. I probably should prefer a woman who was more forceful.\u201d</p><p>It took a supreme act of will to keep silent. She had asked him one simple question. A quick yes or no would have been sufficient answer. He seemed to be taking delight in listing her faults though. She could hear the laughter in his voice. Her husband, she was learning, was a bit rude.</p><p>\u201cYou have daft opinions. I should probably prefer a wife who always agreed with me.\u201d</p><p>She started drumming her fingers in irritation on his chest. He put his hand on top of hers to stop the telling action.</p><p>Johanna let out a loud yawn. It was a deliberate hint for him to let her go to sleep. A thoughtful husband would have ceased his litany of insults immediately.</p><p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t particularly thoughtful. \u201cThe least little thing frightens you,\u201d he remarked, remembering the expression on her face when she had first seen his wolfhound. \u201cI should probably prefer a woman my hound would be afraid of,\u201d he added.</p><p>The heat radiating from his body made her drowsy. She draped one of her legs over his thighs and scooted closer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too thin by half,\u201d Gabriel said then. \u201cThe first northern wind will blow you over. I should probably prefer a big, strapping woman.\u201d</p><p>She was too sleepy to debate with her husband. Outrage took too much concentration. Johanna fell asleep listening to her husband as he continued to list her countless flaws.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terribly naive, wife,\u201d he said when he remembered she had told him the year-round warm climate appealed to her. She had believed her brother\u2019s outrageous lie.</p><p>\u201cAye, you\u2019re naive all right,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Long minutes passed before Gabriel decided to finally answer her question.</p><p>\u201cJohanna?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. He leaned down, kissed the top of her head, and then whispered, \u201c\u2019Tis the truth, I am pleased I married you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Johanna awakened to the sound of pounding. A crash followed. She thought the roof had caved in. She bolted up in the bed just as the door opened. Gabriel walked inside. She grabbed hold of the covers and pulled them up to cover her chest.</p><p>She knew she looked a sight. Her hair hung down over her face, obstructing her view. She clutched the covers with one hand and brushed her hair back over her shoulders with her other hand.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Laird MacBain.\u201d</p><p>He found her attempt at modesty amusing, considering the fact that he\u2019d stroked every inch of her body during the night. She was blushing, too.</p><p>\u201cAfter last night, I don\u2019t believe you need to be embarrassed with me, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI will try not to be embarrassed,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Gabriel walked over to the foot of the bed. He clasped his hands behind his back and frowned at her.</p><p>She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t morning,\u201d he announced, \u201cbut afternoon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cI was exhausted,\u201d she blurted out in defense of having slept half the day away. \u201cI\u2019m usually awake at dawn, m\u2019lord, but the journey here was very tiring. What is that pounding noise I\u2019m hearing?\u201d She added the question in an attempt to turn the topic away from her laziness.</p><p>\u201cThe men are working on the new roof above the great hall.\u201d</p><p>He noticed the dark circles under her eyes. Her skin was pale. He was sorry he\u2019d awakened her. Then the hammering started again, and he realized that noise would have shaken her awake anyway. Gabriel decided he shouldn\u2019t have allowed the work on the roof to begin today. His bride needed rest, not distraction.</p><p>\u201cWas there something you wanted, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to give you your instructions.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again, an indication, she hoped, of her willingness to take on whatever duties he wanted to give her.</p><p>\u201cToday you will wear the MacBain plaid. Tomorrow you will switch to the Maclaurin colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistress here over both clans and must try not to slight either faction. It would be an insult if you wore my colors two days in a row. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He believed he\u2019d been very specific. \u201cNay,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Aren\u2019t you laird over both clans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are, therefore, considered everyone\u2019s leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so.\u201d</p> <p>He sounded terribly arrogant. He looked arrogant, too. His presence was . . . commanding. He fairly towered over the bed. And yet he\u2019d been so incredibly gentle last night. The memory of their lovemaking made her sigh.</p><p>\u201cNow do you understand me?\u201d he asked, perplexed by the wide-eyed stare she was giving him.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts. \u201cNo, I still don\u2019t understand,\u201d she confessed. \u201cIf you\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t your place to understand,\u201d he announced.</p><p>She hid her exasperation. He seemed to want her agreement. He wasn\u2019t going to get it. She simply continued to stare at him and wait for his next outrageous remark.</p><p>\u201cThere is one more instruction I would give you,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to concern yourself with work of any kind. I want you to rest.\u201d</p><p>She was certain she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly. \u201cRest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn heaven\u2019s name why?\u201d</p><p>He frowned over her incredulous expression. It was apparent to him why she should rest. Still, if she needed to hear his reason, he would give it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take you time to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecover from what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom your journey here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve already recovered, m\u2019lord. I slept the morning away. I\u2019m fully rested now.\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave. \u201cGabriel?\u201d she called out to stop him.</p><p>\u201cI asked you not to call me by that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night you demanded I say your name,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She immediately started blushing. \u201cWhen we were . . . kissing.\u201d</p><p>He remembered. \u201cThat was different,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was? Kissing me or demanding I say your name?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cGabriel is a fine name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am through discussing this,\u201d he announced.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to make of his behavior. She decided to put the matter of his name aside for the moment. He was reaching for the door latch and she wanted to ask him something before he left. \u201cMay I go hunting this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just explained I want you to rest. Don\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t making any sense at all, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and walked back to the side of the bed. He looked irritated, but only mildly so.</p><p>He didn\u2019t intimidate her. The realization popped into her mind all at once. She smiled in reaction. She didn\u2019t understand why she felt that way, but she did. She was actually speaking her mind. too, and that was a pleasant first in a long, long while. It felt . . . liberating.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already explained I\u2019ve recovered from my journey here,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He clasped her jaw in his hand and tilted her head back so she would have to look into his eyes. He almost smiled when he saw how disgruntled she looked.</p><p>\u201cThere is another reason I want you to rest.\u201d he announced.</p><p>She gently nudged his hand away. She was getting a crick in her neck looking up at him. \u201cAnd what might your reason be, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weak.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou mentioned that opinion last night, husband. It wasn\u2019t true then and it isn\u2019t true now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are weak, Johanna,\u201d he repeated, ignoring her protest. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take you time to build up your strength. I\u2019m aware of your limitations, even if you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to argue over his decision. He leaned down, kissed her, and then left the chamber.</p><p>As soon as the door closed behind him, she threw off the covers and got out of bed.</p><p>How could her husband form such unbending opinions about her character so quickly? He couldn\u2019t possibly know her limitations. He hadn\u2019t known her long enough. It was unreasonable for him to draw any conclusions about her.</p><p>Johanna continued to think about her husband while she washed and dressed. Father MacKechnie had explained what she would be expected to wear underneath the plaid. She put on the Highland dress, a white long-sleeved underblouse and skirt, then donned the MacBain plaid. She fashioned perfect pleats around her waist, tossed one end of the long strip of material over her right shoulder so the plaid would cover her heart, and secured the garment with a narrow brown leather belt.</p><p>She thought about unpacking her bow and arrows and ignoring her husband\u2019s command altogether, then changed her mind. Open defiance probably wouldn\u2019t sit well with Gabriel. She had already learned he was a proud man, and she didn\u2019t believe she could achieve anything by challenging his decision.</p><p>Still, there was always more than one way into a castle. Her mother used to whisper that reminder to Johanna when she argued with her father. Johanna\u2019s mother was a wise woman. She was loyal to her husband, of course, but over the years she had learned how to get around his stubborn moods. Johanna had learned from her mother\u2019s example. The dear woman was full of clever sayings she\u2019d passed down to her daughter. She never tried to manipulate her husband, she explained, for manipulating would be dishonorable, and the end, after all, didn\u2019t always justify the means. She was very clever, though, and usually found a way to placate everyone in her household.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her mother, Johanna\u2019s father frequently took her aside when she was bickering with her mother as well. He too had advice to give regarding the delicate methods he employed to get along with his wife when she was in one of her stubborn moods. Johanna\u2019s mother\u2019s suggestions made far more sense than her father\u2019s recommendations. She learned something more important from her father, however. He loved his wife and would do anything in his power to make her happy. He just didn\u2019t want his wife to know it. The two of them played a game of sorts where both were the victors. Johanna thought their marriage a bit strange, but they had been very happy together, and she thought that was all that mattered.</p><p>Johanna only wanted to live a quiet, peaceful life. In order to achieve her goal, she would simply make certain she stayed out of her husband\u2019s way. She wouldn\u2019t interfere in his affairs, and she would definitely try to get along with him. In return, she expected him to try to get along with her and stay out of her way. After her years with Raulf, Johanna believed with all her heart that being left alone would make her happy.</p><p>She turned her attention to straightening up the chamber. She made the bed, swept the floor, unpacked her clothes and put them away in the chest, and then tucked her three satchels under the bed. She was in a hurry to get outside, for it had turned out to be a glorious day. When she tied the fur covering back from the window, sunlight flooded the chamber. The scent of the Highlands filled the air. The view was breathtaking. The meadow below was as green as emeralds. The hills beyond were thick with giant pine and oak trees. Splashes of color dotted the landscape; red, pink, and purple wildflowers clustered together along a winding path that seemed to lead all the way to heaven.</p><p>After eating a small meal, Johanna decided to take little Alex with her on a walk across the meadow and up the path beyond. She would gather a skirt full of flowers to put on the mantel.</p><p>Finding the little boy turned out to be quite a challenge. She went downstairs and stood at the entrance to the great hall, waiting for one of the soldiers to notice her. There were four men tearing at the far wall and another three high up on the roof, working on the slats.</p><p>Everyone seemed to notice her at once. The pounding stopped. Since they were all staring at her, she made a curtsy in greeting before asking if they knew where Alex might be.</p><p>No one answered her. She was feeling extremely selfconscious. She repeated her question but kept her gaze centered on the soldier standing in front of the hearth. He smiled, scratched his beard, and then shrugged at her.</p><p>Finally Gabriel\u2019s first-in-command explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand you, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>She turned to the soldier and smiled. \u201cThey speak only Gaelic, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey speak only Gaelic. Please, you needn\u2019t call me your lord. I\u2019m only a soldier here. Calum will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Calum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bonny lass, wearing our plaid.\u201d</p><p>He seemed embarrassed giving her that compliment. \u201cThank you,\u201d she answered, wondering what the word bonny meant.</p><p>She turned back to the men watching her and asked them her question in Gaelic. She frowned with concentration. The language was difficult, tongue twisting in fact when she was so nervous inside, but when she\u2019d finished her question, only one of the older men openly winced. The others smiled.</p><p>Still no one answered her. They all turned to stare at the hem of her gown. She looked down to see if something was amiss. Then she turned to Calum, hoping for an explanation. His eyes, she noticed, sparkled with amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou asked them if they\u2019d seen your feet, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to ask if they\u2019d seen Gabriel\u2019s son,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Calum gave her the proper word to use. She again turned and repeated her question.</p><p>The men shook their heads. She thanked them for their attention and turned to leave. Calum hurried ahead of her to open the door.</p><p>\u201cI must work on my accent,\u201d she announced. \u201cI could tell from that one gentleman\u2019s expression I was making a muck of it.\u201d</p><p>Aye, she was making a muck of it, Calum thought to himself. He wasn\u2019t about to agree, however, because he didn\u2019t want to injure her feelings.</p><p>\u201cThe men appreciate the fact that you\u2019re trying, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the burr, Calum,\u201d Johanna decided. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite captured it yet. It\u2019s a very challenging language,\u201d she added. \u201cYou could be a help if you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom this moment on, speak only Gaelic when you address me. I believe I\u2019ll catch on much quicker if your language is all I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Calum agreed in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said certainly, m\u2019lady,\u201d Calum explained.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHave you seen Alex?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe might be down at the stables,\u201d he said. He spoke in Gaelic and pointed in the direction of the stables in an attempt to help her guess what he\u2019d just said.</p><p>Because she was concentrating on interpreting what he was saying to her, she barely paid any attention to what was going on in the courtyard. There were soldiers everywhere, but she didn\u2019t notice what they were doing.</p><p>She finally figured out what Calum had said, blurted out her thank you, and went running across the yard.</p><p>She suddenly found herself in the middle of a sparring exercise. Calum grabbed her by her shoulders and pulled her back just in the nick of time. A lance nearly sliced her down the middle.</p><p>One of the Maclaurin soldiers let out a loud expletive. Gabriel had been watching the sparring from the opposite side of the yard. He saw his wife\u2019s near miss and immediately shouted a halt to the training session.</p><p>Johanna was horrified by her own behavior. Such inattention was shameful. She picked up the lance the soldier had dropped and handed it to the man. His face was flaming red. She didn\u2019t know if he was embarrassed or furious.</p><p>\u201cPray forgive me, sir. I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired soldier gave her a quick nod. Calum still had his hands on her shoulders. He gently tugged her back.</p><p>She turned to thank him for his quickness in coming to her aid. She spotted her husband coming her way. Her smile faltered when she took in the look on his face.</p><p>The soldiers were all staring at her. The MacBain warriors were smiling. The Maclaurins were frowning.</p><p>That mixed reaction confused her. Then Gabriel was standing in front of her, blocking her view. His attention was centered on Calum. He didn\u2019t say a word, just frowned at the soldier. Johanna realized Calum still had hold of her. The minute the soldier released his grip, his laird turned his attention and his scowl on her.</p><p>Her heart started pounding with her fear. She desperately tried to hold onto her composure. She wasn\u2019t about to let him know how frightened she was.</p><p>She decided not to give him time to berate her. \u201cI was very inattentive, m\u2019lord, sinfully so. I could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou could not have been killed. You insult Calum by suggesting he would have allowed you injury.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to argue with her husband. \u201cI meant no insult,\u201d she said. She turned to Calum. \u201cPlease accept my apology. I wished to soften my husband\u2019s anger with me by being the first to acknowledge my foolishness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a problem with your sight?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cThen why in God\u2019s name didn\u2019t you see my men were fighting with weapons?\u201d</p><p>She mistook his exasperation for anger. \u201cI have explained, m\u2019lord. I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her husband didn\u2019t show any reaction to her explanation. He simply continued to stare at her. He was waiting for his temper to calm. Seeing his wife come so close to death had frightened the hell out of him. It was going to take him a long while to get over it.</p><p>A full minute passed in silence. Johanna thought her husband was considering her penance.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for interrupting your important work,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you wish to strike me, please do so now. The wait is becoming unbearable.\u201d</p><p>Calum couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019d just heard. \u201cM\u2019lady . . .\u201d</p> <p>He was stopped from saying more when Gabriel raised his hand for silence.</p><p>The second his hand moved, she backed up. It was a protective action learned from past lessons. She realized what she was doing and immediately moved forward again.</p><p>Her husband had best understand she wasn\u2019t going to let the past repeat itself. \u201cI would warn you, m\u2019lord. I cannot stop you from striking me, but the minute you do I\u2019ll leave this holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you cannot believe our laird would . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of this, Calum.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel gave his command in a hard voice. He was furious over the insult his wife had just given him, but damn it all, the fear was real. He had to remind himself that she didn\u2019t know him well and, therefore, had only jumped to the wrong conclusions.</p><p>He took hold of Johanna\u2019s hand, started up the steps, then heard the pounding and immediately changed directions. He wanted privacy for this important discussion.</p><p>She tripped over the step when her husband turned, righted herself, and hurried to keep up. Calum shook his head as he watched his laird drag his mistress behind him. It wasn\u2019t Lady Johanna\u2019s awkwardness that caused him to frown but the paleness that had come over her complexion. Did she believe her laird was going to take her someplace private so he could beat her without an audience?</p><p>Keith, the red-haired leader of the Maclaurin soldiers, walked over to stand next to Calum. \u201cWhat has you frowning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLady Johanna,\u201d Calum answered. \u201cSomeone has filled her head with dark tales about our laird. I believe she\u2019s afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>Keith snorted. \u201cSome of the women are already saying she\u2019s afraid of her own shadow. They\u2019ve given her a nickname,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter just one look at her, they\u2019re calling her Courageous. \u2019Tis a pity, their mockery, for they\u2019re judging her without giving her a fair chance.\u201d</p> <p>Calum was furious. In calling her Courageous, they, of course, meant just the opposite\u2014they believed her to be a coward. \u201cMacBain better not hear of this,\u201d he warned. \u201cWho started this blasphemy?\u201d</p><p>Keith wasn\u2019t about to give him the name. The woman was a Maclaurin. \u201cWho it was isn\u2019t important,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe name caught on. The way Lady Johanna trembled at the sight of the laird\u2019s hound started some of the women smirking, and the frightened look in her eyes each time MacBain spoke to her made them conclude she was . . .\u201d</p><p>Calum interrupted him. \u201cShe\u2019s timid, perhaps, but certainly not a coward. You\u2019d best put the fear of God in your women, Keith. They think they\u2019re so damned clever with their game. If I hear the name from any Maclaurin, I\u2019ll retaliate. \u201d</p><p>Keith nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for you to accept her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Maclaurins aren\u2019t so forgiving. Remember, it was her first husband who destroyed all we\u2019d worked so hard to build. It\u2019s going to take time for them to forget.\u201d</p><p>Calum shook his head. \u201cA Highlander never forgets. You know that as well as I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen to forgive,\u201d Keith suggested.</p><p>\u201cShe had nothing to do with the atrocity done here. She doesn\u2019t require anyone\u2019s forgiveness. Remind the women of that important truth.\u201d</p><p>Keith nodded agreement. He didn\u2019t believe his reminder would make much difference, however. The women were set against her, and he couldn\u2019t imagine what he could say to change their opinions.</p> <p>Both warriors kept their gazes on their laird and his bride and watched until they disappeared down the hill.</p><p>Gabriel and Johanna were quite alone now, but he still didn\u2019t stop. He continued walking until they reached the meadow. He wanted to rid himself of his anger before he talked to her.</p><p>He finally stopped. Then he turned to look at her. She wouldn\u2019t look at him. She tried to tug her hand away from his, but he wouldn\u2019t let go of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me a grave insult by suggesting I would harm you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. He sounded furious enough to kill someone. Yet he felt injured that she thought he would strike her.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say to me, wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI interrupted your training session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost caused a soldier to harm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you appeared to be very angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was angry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel? Why are you shouting?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cI like to shout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had thought that in time you would learn to trust me. I have changed my mind. You will trust me,\u201d he commanded. \u201cStarting now, this minute.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound so simple. \u201cI do not know if that is possible, m\u2019lord. Trust must be earned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen decide now that I\u2019ve earned it,\u201d he ordered. \u201cTell me you trust me, and mean it, damn it.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was asking the impossible. He sighed again. \u201cNo man is allowed to beat his wife here. Only a coward would mistreat a woman, Johanna. None of my men are cowards. You have nothing to fear from me or anyone else here. I will forgive you your insult because you didn\u2019t understand. I will not be as tolerant in future. You would do well to remember that.\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes. \u201cBut if I do insult you in future? What would you do?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the faintest idea, but he wasn\u2019t about to admit it. \u201cIt will not happen again.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. She started to turn around to go back to the courtyard, then changed her mind.</p><p>Her husband deserved an apology. \u201cSometimes I react before I have had time to think it through. Do you understand, m\u2019lord? It seems to be instinctive. I really will try to trust you, and I thank you for your patience.\u201d</p><p>He could tell from the way she was wringing her hands together that her confession was difficult for her. Her head was bowed and her voice sounded with bewilderment when she added, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I expect the worst. I never would have married you if I\u2019d believed you would mistreat me, yet there seems to be a tiny part of me that has difficulty believing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou please me, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled over the surprise in her voice. \u201cYou do,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI know the confession was difficult for you. Where did you think you were going when you tried to run through a lance?\u201d He added the question in an effort to change the subject. His wife looked like she might start weeping at any moment and he wanted to help her calm her emotions.</p><p>\u201cTo find Alex. I thought we could take a walk to look over the holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered you to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to take a restful walk. Gabriel, there\u2019s a man crawling on all fours behind you.\u201d</p><p>She whispered the news and moved closer to her husband. He didn\u2019t turn around to look. He didn\u2019t need to. \u201cThat\u2019s Auggie,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Johanna moved to stand next to her husband so she could get a closer look at the man. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigging holes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe uses his staff to hit stones into the holes. It\u2019s a game he enjoys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he daft?\u201d she whispered, lest the old man overhear her.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t harm you. Leave him be. He has earned his leisure.\u201d</p><p>Her husband took hold of her hand and started back up the hill. Johanna kept glancing back over her shoulder to get a better look at the man crawling his way across the meadow. \u201cHe\u2019s a MacBain,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing your plaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur plaid,\u201d her husband corrected. \u201cAuggie\u2019s one of us,\u201d he added. \u201cJohanna, Alex isn\u2019t here. He was taken back to his mother\u2019s brother\u2019s family early this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will he be away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the wall is finished. When the holding is secure, Alex will come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long will that be?\u201d she asked. \u201cA son needs his father, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of my duties, wife. You needn\u2019t instruct me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I may give my opinion,\u201d she countered.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHave you begun work on your wall?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s half done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how long before . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few more months,\u201d he answered. \u201cI don\u2019t want you walking in the hills without a proper escort,\u201d he added with a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too dangerous for all the women or just for me?\u201d He kept silent. She had her answer then. She held her exasperation. \u201cExplain these dangers to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the time. Simply obey my commands and we\u2019ll get along quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll get along if I obey your every command,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHonestly, Gabriel, I don\u2019t believe ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe horses are sound.\u201d</p><p>His interruption turned her concentration. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe six horses you gave me are sound.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re through discussing obedience, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we are.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou should do that more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the edge of the courtyard. Gabriel\u2019s manner underwent a radical change. His expression hardened. She thought the serious look was for the benefit of his audience. Every soldier was watching.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He sounded impatient.</p><p>\u201cMay I offer an opinion now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s daft to use the courtyard for your training session as well as dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dangerous until this morning. I want you to promise me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever threaten to leave me.\u201d</p><p>The intensity in his demand surprised her. \u201cI promise,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Gabriel nodded, then started to walk away. \u201cI won\u2019t ever let you go. You do understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect an answer. Johanna stood there for several minutes watching as her husband rejoined the training session. Gabriel was proving to be a complex man. Nicholas had told her the laird would marry her to secure the land. Yet Gabriel acted as though perhaps she were important to him, too.</p><p>She found herself hoping her guess was true. They would get along much better if he liked her.</p><p>She noticed Gabriel talking to Calum. The soldier glanced her way, nodded, and then started walking toward her. She didn\u2019t wait to find out what order her husband had given his first-in-command. She turned around and ran down the hill to the meadow. The MacBain soldier named Auggie intrigued her. She wanted to find out what game it was that required digging holes in the ground.</p><p>The elderly man had a stock of white hair. He stood up when she called out to him. Deep lines around his mouth and eyes made her guess him to be at least fifty years old, perhaps even older. He had beautiful white teeth, handsome brown eyes, and a warm, inviting smile.</p><p>Until she spoke to him. Johanna made a quick curtsy, then introduced herself in Gaelic.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut and grimaced as though in acute pain. \u201cYou\u2019re slaughtering our beautiful language, girl,\u201d he announced.</p><p>He spoke so fast, his words tripped together, and his brogue was as thick as her mama\u2019s stew. Johanna didn\u2019t understand a word he\u2019d said. Auggie was forced to repeat his insult three times before she gained the meaning.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me, sir, which words I\u2019m mispronouncing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a fair job ruining all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to learn this language,\u201d she persisted, ignoring his comical expression of horror over her accent.</p><p>\u201cIt would take too much discipline for an Englishwoman to become fluent,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would have to concentrate. I don\u2019t believe you English have that ability.\u201d</p><p>Johanna couldn\u2019t understand much of what he said. Auggie dramatically slapped his forehead. \u201cBy all that\u2019s holy, you\u2019re taking the fun out of my insults, girl. You aren\u2019t understanding a word I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and spoke again, though this time in French. His command of the language was impressive, and his accent, impeccable. Johanna was impressed. Auggie was an educated man.</p><p>\u201cI can see I\u2019ve surprised you. Did you judge me simpleminded?\u201d</p><p>She started to shake her head, then stopped herself. \u201cYou were crawling about on your knees, digging holes. I did jump to the conclusion you were a bit . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazed?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI apologize, sir. When did you learn to speak . . .\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her. \u201c \u2019Twas years and years ago,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow what was it you wanted, interrupting me in the middle of my game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering what your game was,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you dig holes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one will dig them for me.\u201d</p><p>He snorted with laughter after giving her his jest.</p><p>\u201cBut your reason?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cThe game I play requires holes to catch my stones if my aim is true. I use my staff as my club and round pebbles I strike forward. Would you like to have a try, lass? The game\u2019s in my blood. Perhaps you\u2019ll catch the fever, too.\u201d</p><p>Auggie took her arm and pulled her along to where he\u2019d left his staff. He showed her how he wanted her to hold onto the wooden pole, and when she\u2019d braced her shoulders and her legs just the way he believed she should, he stepped back to give her further instruction.</p><p>\u201cGive it a good whack now. Aim for the hole straight ahead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt ridiculous. Auggie really was a little daft. But he was also a gentle man, and her interest in what he was doing seemed to please him. She wasn\u2019t about to hurt his feelings.</p><p>She hit the round stone. It rolled to the edge of the hole, teetered, and then dropped in.</p><p>She immediately wanted to try again. Auggie beamed with pleasure. \u201cYou\u2019ve caught the fever,\u201d he announced with a nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this game called?\u201d she asked as she knelt to retrieve her pebble. She retraced her steps to her original position, tried to remember the correct stance, and then waited for Auggie to answer.</p> <p>\u201cThe game doesn\u2019t have a name, but it dates back to olden days. Once you\u2019ve mastered my short holes, lass, I\u2019ll take you along to the ridge with me, and you can try for distance. You\u2019ll have to do your part, though, and find your own stones. The rounder the better, of course.\u201d</p><p>Johanna missed on her second try. Auggie told her she wasn\u2019t paying attention. She had to try again, of course. She was so intent on pleasing him and hitting the hole, she didn\u2019t even realize they were now speaking Gaelic.</p><p>She spent a large part of the afternoon with Auggie. Calum had obviously been given the duty of watching out for her. He appeared at the top of the hill every now and then to make certain she was still there. And staying out of mischief, she supposed. After a few hours Auggie called a halt to the game and motioned her over to the opposite side of the meadow where he\u2019d left his supplies. He took hold of her arm and let out a grunt when he lowered himself to the ground. Then he motioned her to sit beside him. He handed her a leather pouch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to have a treat, lass,\u201d he announced. \u201cIt\u2019s uisgebreatha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreath of life,\u201d she translated.</p> <p>\u201cNay, water of life, girl. I\u2019ve got my own brewing kettle, fashioned it myself after the one I studied at the MacKay holding. Our laird let me bring it along when we came to the Maclaurins. We\u2019re all castouts, you know, every one of us. I was a Maclead before I pledged myself to the MacBain.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was intrigued. \u201cCast out? I don\u2019t understand what you mean, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us were tossed out of our own clans for one reason or another. Your husband\u2019s fate was decided the day he was born a bastard. When he\u2019d grown into manhood, he gathered us together and trained the younger ones to become fine warriors. Each of us has a talent, of course. You\u2019ll be tasting mine if you\u2019ll quit your lingering. I\u2019m wanting a wee taste myself.\u201d</p><p>It would have been rude to decline the invitation. Johanna lifted the pouch, flipped the cork off, and took a sip of the liquid.</p><p>She thought she\u2019d swallowed liquid fire. She let out a gasp, then started coughing. Auggie delighted in her reaction. He slapped his knee first, then pounded her between her shoulder blades to get her breathing properly again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a fair bite to it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>She could only nod agreement. \u201cGet on home now, lass,\u201d he ordered. \u201cLaird MacBain will be wondering where you are.\u201d</p><p>Johanna stood up, then put her hand down to assist Auggie. \u201cThank you for a lovely afternoon, Auggie.\u201d</p><p>The old man smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken on my burr, lass. That pleases me. You\u2019re a clever one, aren\u2019t you now? You must have a spot of Highland blood running in your veins.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was teasing her. She bowed and turned to leave. \u201cWould you be wanting to go to the ridge tomorrow, Auggie?\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d he called back.</p><p>\u201cWill you take me with you if you do?\u201d</p><p>Johanna couldn\u2019t quit smiling. The day had turned out to be quite wonderful. Granted, she\u2019d started out by pricking her husband\u2019s temper, but that little incident hadn\u2019t been horrible, and the rest of the afternoon had been lovely. She\u2019d learned something important about her husband, too. He could control his temper. Anger didn\u2019t control him.</p><p>That was a revelation. Johanna pondered the significance on her way back up the hill. Calum was waiting for her. He bowed his head in greeting, then walked by her side back to the keep.</p> <p>\u201cI noticed you were playing Auggie\u2019s game,\u201d the soldier remarked.</p><p>\u201cIt was most amusing.\u201d Johanna replied. \u201cDo you know, Calum, I believe Auggie\u2019s one of the most interesting men I\u2019ve ever known, save for my father, of course.\u201d</p><p>Calum smiled over her enthusiasm. \u201cAuggie reminds me of my father, too. He tells the same kind of spicy tales about times past, and he laces his truths with legends like my father always did.\u201d Thinking to compliment her, Calum added, \u201cAuggie would be pleased to be compared to your father.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHe\u2019d be insulted,\u201d she guessed. \u201cMy father was English, Calum. Auggie wouldn\u2019t get past that fact.\u201d She changed the subject then. \u201cYou have more important duties, I\u2019m certain, than keeping your eye on me. Will my husband expect you to follow me around every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no duty more important than protecting my mistress, m\u2019lady,\u201d the soldier answered. \u201cTomorrow, however, Keith will be assigned the duty of watching out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeith is the first-in-command over the Maclaurin soldiers, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so. He answers only to our laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are first-in-command over the MacBain soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there just one commander over both the MacBain and the Maclaurin soldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you might ask your husband that question,\u201d Calum suggested. \u201cHe has sound reasons for allowing the Maclaurins their own leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will ask him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in learning all I can about the land and the people here. Where is my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting,\u201d Calum answered. \u201cHe should be back any time now. Do you realize, m\u2019lady, we\u2019ve been speaking Gaelic? Your grasp of our language is quite impressive given the fact you\u2019ve only had a few short weeks of instruction before you came here.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNay, Calum, it was closer to four months of intense study under Father MacKechnie\u2019s supervision. I was a little nervous when I first met your laird, though I doubt you noticed for I\u2019m very good at hiding my reactions. When he asked me how long I\u2019d been studying Gaelic, I was a bit nervous and the answer flew out of my mind. I can tell from your occasional grimace I still haven\u2019t mastered the burr.\u201d</p><p>Odd, but as soon as Calum made the mention that she was speaking Gaelic, she started tripping over her words and mispronouncing something fierce.</p><p>They\u2019d just crossed the courtyard when Calum spotted his laird.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your husband now, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Johanna turned to greet Gabriel. She hurried to straighten her appearance. She brushed a strand of hair back over her shoulder, pinched her cheeks for color, and adjusted the folds in her plaid. She noticed the condition of her hands then. They were caked with dirt from spending the afternoon digging with Auggie. Since there wasn\u2019t time to wash now, she hid them behind her back.</p><p>The ground fairly trembled as the band of warriors rode their mounts up the last slope. Gabriel led the soldiers. He was riding one of the horses she\u2019d given him as a wedding gift. The mare he\u2019d chosen was the most temperamental of the lot. She was also the prettiest in Johanna\u2019s estimation. Her coat was as white as fresh snow with nary a mark on her. She was much bigger than the other horses, thicker in muscle as well, and certainly carried Gabriel\u2019s weight easily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s riding my favorite horse,\u201d Johanna told Calum.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows it, too,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cRachel\u2019s terribly vain. She likes to prance. It\u2019s her way of showing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s showing off because she\u2019s proud to carry our important laird,\u201d Calum announced.</p><p>She thought he was jesting with her. She burst into laughter, then noticed Calum wasn\u2019t even chuckling. She realized he was serious.</p><p>Calum didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d found amusing. He turned to ask her, saw the smudges of dirt she\u2019d brushed on her cheeks, and smiled in reaction.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s hound came running toward his master from around the corner of the keep. The huge beast frightened the mare. Rachel tried to rear up and bolt at the same time. Gabriel forced her under control and dismounted. One of the soldiers led the horse away.</p><p>The hound rushed forward. With one leap, he planted his front paws on Gabriel\u2019s shoulders. The dog was almost as tall as his master now and just as ferocious looking. Johanna\u2019s knees went weak watching the two of them. Thankfully the dog held great affection for his master. He was diligently trying to lick Gabriel\u2019s face. Her husband turned away before his pet could bathe him. He gave him a sound slap of affection. Dust flew from the hound\u2019s thick gray coat. Gabriel finally pushed the dog down and turned to his wife.</p><p>He motioned her forward. She wondered if he expected her to plant her hands on his shoulders and kiss him in greeting. The thought amused her. She took a step forward, then came to a quick stop when the animal started growling at her.</p><p>Gabriel was going to have to come to her. She kept the hound in her sights, wary now, as her husband walked forward. The dog, she noticed, attached himself to Gabriel\u2019s side and came with him.</p><p>Gabriel was amused by her timidity. The dog obviously intimidated her. He couldn\u2019t imagine why. He heard the low growling. So did his wife. She backed up a step. Gabriel ordered his hound to quit his shew of bluster.</p><p>Some of the Maclaurin soldiers were still seated atop their mounts, watching their laird and his wife. A few grinned when they saw her fear of the dog. Others shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cDid your hunt go well, m\u2019lord?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there enough grain to be taken?\u201d Calum asked.</p><p>\u201cMore than enough,\u201d Gabriel answered.</p><p>\u201cYou went hunting for grain?\u201d Johanna asked, trying to understand.</p><p>\u201cAnd a few other necessary items,\u201d her husband explained. \u201cThere\u2019s dirt on your face, wife. What have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>She tried to wipe the dirt away. Gabriel grabbed hold of her hands and looked at them.</p><p>\u201cI was helping Auggie dig holes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want my wife to dirty her hands.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as though he was giving her an important commandment. Her husband appeared to be more than just a little irritated with her.</p><p>\u201cBut I have just explained . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife does not do common tasks.\u201d</p><p>She was exasperated. \u201cHave you more than one, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than one what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it would appear that your wife does indeed get her hands dirty,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if that displeases you, though I really can\u2019t imagine why it does. I can tell you I\u2019m certain to get them dirty again.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d tried to use logic to soothe him. but he wasn\u2019t in the mood to be reasonable. He shook his head and scowled at her. \u201cYou will not,\u201d he commanded. \u201cYou\u2019re mistress here, Johanna. You will not lower yourself to such tasks.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she should laugh or frown. She settled on a sigh instead. The man had the oddest notions.</p><p>He seemed to want some sort of answer. She decided to try to placate him. \u201cAs you wish, m\u2019lord,\u201d she whispered, determined not to let her sudden irritation show.</p><p>She was trying to be submissive, Gabriel decided. He thought it was probably killing her. She had a murderous look in her eyes, but she held onto her serene smile, and her voice sounded humble.</p><p>Johanna turned to Calum. She ignored the grin on his face. \u201cWhere do the women wash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a well behind the keep, m\u2019lady, but most bathe in Rush Creek.\u201d</p><p>Calum was going to escort her. Gabriel took over the task. He grabbed hold of her hand and pulled her along.</p><p>\u201cIn future, water will be carried to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn future, I would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t treat me like a child.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe the anger he heard in her voice. Johanna wasn\u2019t quite so timid after all.</p><p>\u201cI would also appreciate it if you didn\u2019t berate me in front of your soldiers.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His quick agreement eased her irritation.</p><p>Her husband had a long-legged stride. They rounded the corner and started down the slope. Huts lined the hill, and more were clustered in a wide circle at the base. The well was in the center. Several of the Maclaurin women were standing in line with their buckets, waiting their turn to fetch fresh water. Several called out greetings to their laird. He nodded and continued on.</p><p>The wall was just beyond the line of huts. Johanna wanted to stop to look at it. Gabriel wouldn\u2019t let her. They passed through the opening of the mammoth structure and continued on.</p><p>Johanna had to run to keep up with her husband. By the time they reached the second slope, she was out of breath. \u201cDo slow down, Gabriel. My legs aren\u2019t as long as yours.\u201d</p><p>He immediately slowed his pace. He didn\u2019t let go of her hand, however. She didn\u2019t try to pull away. She heard the women\u2019s laughter in the background and wondered what they found amusing.</p><p>Rush Creek was a wide, deep stream. It ran the length of the mountain, her husband explained, from the top to a pool at the bottom where their land bordered with the Gillevrey territory. Trees lined the sides of the waterway, and wildflowers were so abundant they seemed to be growing out of the water as well as along the banks. The area was breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>Johanna knelt on the bank, leaned forward, and washed her hands. The water was clear enough for her to see the bottom. Gabriel knelt beside her, cupped a handful of the frigid water, and poured it over the back of his neck. Her husband\u2019s pet appeared out of the woods, moved to her side, growled once, and then began to drink from the creek.</p><p>Johanna wet her linen cloth and washed her face. Gabriel leaned back to watch her. Her every movement was graceful. She was a mystery to him, and he assumed his curiosity and his fascination were both due to the fact that he\u2019d never spent any significant amount of time with any woman.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t paying any attention to her husband. She spotted what appeared to be a perfectly round stone at the bottom of the stream, decided Auggie could use it for his game, and reached down to get it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The creek was much deeper than she\u2019d judged it to be. She would have gone in headfirst if her husband hadn\u2019t grabbed hold of her and hauled her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usual to take your clothes off before you bathe,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI lost my balance. I was trying to get a stone that caught my eye. Will you fetch it for me?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to look. \u201cThere are at least a hundred stones, wife. Which do you fancy?\u201d</p> <p>She pointed. \u201cThe perfectly round one,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Gabriel reached down, lifted the stone, and handed it to her. She smiled in appreciation. \u201cAuggie will like this one,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Johanna moved further back on the grassy slope, tucked her feet under her plaid and dropped the stone into her lap. A light breeze brushed through the trees. The scent of pine and early heather filled the air. The area was secluded and peaceful.</p><p>\u201cScotland is very beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot Scotland,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThe Highlands are beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel didn\u2019t seem inclined to hurry back to his duties. He leaned his back against the trunk of a pine tree, crossed one ankle over the other, and adjusted the sword at his side so it wouldn\u2019t be scratched. His dog moved to his other side and stretched out next to him.</p><p>Johanna stared at her husband for several minutes before speaking again. The man had the ability to mesmerize her. She thought the reaction was due to the fact that there was so much of him. He was certainly as tall as Nicholas but far more muscular. At least she thought he was.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019s command jarred her. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Nicholas without a tunic on. That\u2019s what I was thinking. I believe you\u2019re more muscular than my brother, but since I haven\u2019t seen him . . . They were foolish thoughts, husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, they are foolish thoughts.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t take exception to his agreement. His slow grin told her he was teasing. Gabriel looked very content with his eyes closed and the soft smile on his face. He really was a dashing man.</p> <p>Johanna noticed his pet nudge Gabriel\u2019s hand and was immediately rewarded with a quick pat.</p><p>Her husband wasn\u2019t such a worry to her any longer. Not only could he control his temper, but he also had a gentle streak in his nature. The way his hound responded to him told her that much about his character.</p><p>Gabriel caught her staring at him. She blushed with embarrassment and turned her gaze to her lap. She didn\u2019t want to leave just yet. She was enjoying this peaceful interlude with her husband. She decided to draw him into further conversation before he could suggest they go back.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t Scotland and the Highlands the same, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are and they aren\u2019t,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider ourselves Scots as you English are so inclined to call us. We\u2019re either Highlanders or Lowlanders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the tone of your voice when you said Lowlanders, I assume you don\u2019t particularly like those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve forgotten who they are,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve become English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m English.\u201d She blurted out the reminder before she could stop herself.</p><p>She sounded worried. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you are,\u201d she agreed. \u201cPerhaps, in time, you\u2019ll forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis highly doubtful.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he was jesting with her or not. She decided to turn the topic to a less sensitive one.</p><p>\u201cAuggie isn\u2019t daft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. The Maclaurins believe that nonsense, not the MacBains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually very clever, husband. The game he made up is most amusing. You must try it sometime. It requires skill.\u201d</p><p>He nodded agreement just to placate her. He found her defense of the old man admirable. \u201cAuggie didn\u2019t invent the game. It\u2019s been around for long years. In the old days, stones were used, but the men also carved balls out of wooden blocks. Some even fashioned leather balls and filled them with wet feathers.\u201d</p><p>Johanna stored the information away for future use. Perhaps she could make a few of the leather balls for Auggie.</p><p>\u201cHe says I\u2019ve caught the fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod help us,\u201d Gabriel drawled out. \u201cAuggie plays the game all day, every day, rain or shine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you irritated over a little speck of dirt on my face and hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already explained my position. You\u2019re my wife now. You must behave accordingly. There\u2019s rivalry between the MacBains and the Maclaurins; and until the clans become accustomed to living together in peace, I must show only strength, not vulnerability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I make you vulnerable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I want to understand,\u201d she told him. \u201cWas it the dirt or was it the fact that I was spending the afternoon with Auggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you down on your knees, Johanna. You must act with proper decorum at all times. My wife will not do common work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already mentioned that opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t an opinion,\u201d he countered. \u201cIt\u2019s a command.\u201d She tried not to let him see how disgruntled she was becoming. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019m surprised you concern yourself with appearances. You don\u2019t seem the sort to care what other people think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about other people\u2019s opinions,\u201d he countered, irritated by her conclusion. \u201cI do care about keeping you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does my safety have to do with my behavior?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cYou should have married a Maclaurin. That would have solved your problem uniting the clans, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. I married you. We\u2019ll both have to make the best of it, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>He sounded resigned. He was still in an agreeable mood and she decided to change the topic again with a question that surely wouldn\u2019t prick his temper.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your wolfhound like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you\u2019re afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue over that truth. \u201cWhat is he called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumfries.\u201d</p><p>The dog\u2019s ears picked up when his master spoke his name. Johanna smiled in reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a peculiar name,\u201d she remarked. \u201cHow did you come by it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the dog near the Dumfries\u2019 holding. He was caught in mire. I pulled him out,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s been with me ever since.\u201d</p><p>Johanna moved closer to Gabriel\u2019s side. She slowly reached over to pat the animal. The dog watched her out of the corner of his eye; when she was about to touch him, he let out a menacing unearthly sound. She quickly pulled her hand back. Gabriel took hold of her arm and forced her to touch the hound. The dog kept up the horrid noise but didn\u2019t try to bite her hand off.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you last night?\u201d</p><p>The switch in topics made her blink. She bowed her head so he wouldn\u2019t see her quick blush, then whispered, \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me. You asked me after we ...\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nudged her chin up with his hand. The look in her eyes made him smile. He found her embarrassment amusing.</p><p>The look in his eyes made her heartbeat race. She thought he might want to kiss her. She found herself hoping he would.</p><p>\u201cWill you want to make love to me again, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you want me to?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stared into his eyes a long minute before giving him her answer. She wasn\u2019t going to try to be coy or clever. She\u2019d only make a muck of it, she decided, because she\u2019d never learned the fine art of flirting like the other young ladies had while they lived the high, courtly life in London.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, grimacing inside over the shiver in her voice. \u201cI would like you to make love to me again. It wasn\u2019t half bad, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed over her jest. Her blush, he noticed, was now as red as fire. Her embarrassment hadn\u2019t stopped her from telling him the truth, however. He pulled away from the tree trunk and bent down to kiss her. His mouth brushed over hers in a tender caress. She sighed into his mouth and put her hands on his shoulders.</p><p>It was all the encouragement he needed. Before he realized his intent, he lifted her onto his lap, wrapped his arms around her waist, and kissed her again. His mouth covered hers and his tongue swept inside to taste, stroke, and drive her wild. She went weak in his arms. She clung to him and kissed him just as thoroughly. Johanna was a little stunned by how quickly her entire body responded to her husband. Her heartbeat became frantic; her arms and legs began to tingle, and she kept forgetting to breathe.</p><p>Gabriel was shaken by his own reaction to his wife. She wasn\u2019t able to hold a part of herself back. She trusted him to keep her safe, he believed, or she wouldn\u2019t have allowed herself to be so uninhibited. Her passionate response ignited his own, and God help him, he couldn\u2019t seem to gather enough control to hold back either.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d take her here and now if he didn\u2019t put a stop to the sweet torment. He abruptly pulled back. He shouldn\u2019t have looked into her eyes. They were cloudy with passion. Damn, he had to kiss her again.</p><p>They were both shaken when he finally called a halt to the lovemaking. His breathing was labored. So was hers.</p><p>\u201cYou make me forget myself, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>He took that as a compliment. He lifted her off his lap, then stood up. Johanna was still rattled. Her face was flushed, and her hands trembled when she smoothed the hair back into her braid. He watched her try to right her appearance with vast amusement.</p><p>Women flustered easily, he decided. This one quicker than most.</p><p>\u201cMy hair\u2019s a sight,\u201d she stammered out when she caught his smile. \u201cI\u2019ve a mind to cut it . . . with your permission, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you do with your hair is no concern to me. You don\u2019t need my permission. I have more important matters to think about.\u201d</p><p>He softened his rebuke with a quick kiss. Then he bent down, picked up the stone she wanted to give to Auggie, and handed it to her. He had to put the pebble in her hand. Aye, she was flustered all right, and damn, that fact pleased him.</p><p>He winked at his wife and turned to walk back up the hill.</p><p>Johanna straightened the pleats of her plaid and then hurried to catch up with him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quit smiling. He knew his kisses had made mush out of her mind, she decided, because the look on his face was one of pure male satisfaction. She didn\u2019t mind his arrogance though.</p><p>Everything was going to be all right. Johanna did a lot of sighing on the way back up the hill. Yes, she thought to herself, she had made the right decision when she\u2019d agreed to marry Gabriel.</p><p>Johanna was in such high spirits she barely minded Dumfries\u2019s bluster of growls each time she moved closer to Gabriel\u2019s side. Even the mighty beast wasn\u2019t going to ruin her good mood.</p><p>She brushed her hand against her husband\u2019s. He didn\u2019t take the hint. She nudged him again, and still he didn\u2019t catch on. She gave up trying to be subtle and took hold of his hand.</p><p>He acted as though she wasn\u2019t even there. His gaze was directed on the top of the hill, and she assumed his mind was already turned to thoughts of duties ahead. She didn\u2019t mind his inattention; and when they reached the cluster of workmen\u2019s huts, she pulled her hand away. She didn\u2019t think he would want to show affection in front of the clan. Gabriel surprised her by grabbing hold of her hand again. He gave her fingers a gentle squeeze, then increased his stride until she was once again running to keep up.</p><p>Lord, she was happy. Aye, she\u2019d done the right thing. She\u2019d married a good-hearted man.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth she was married to a gargoyle.</p><p>Johanna came to this depressing conclusion after living with her husband for three long months. Gabriel was downright mean-hearted. He was outrageously stubborn, horribly set in his ways. and completely unreasonable with his orders. Those were his better qualities. He treated her like an invalid. She wasn\u2019t allowed to lift a finger, was waited on hand and foot, and was always followed around by one of his men. She put up with the nonsense for a good two months before her irritation got the better of her. She did protest then, but to no avail. Gabriel wouldn\u2019t listen. His ideas about marriage were most bizarre. He wanted her protected under lock and key, and God\u2019s truth, whenever she went outside for a breath of fresh air, he tried to chase her back inside.</p><p>Dinners were insufferable. She was expected to maintain her dignity throughout the meal, while chaos ruled around her. None of the men she dined with had any manners. They were loud, rude, and made horrid, disgusting noises.</p><p>And those were their better qualities. Johanna didn\u2019t criticize the soldiers. She felt it would be better if she continued to maintain her separation from the clan whenever possible. In her mind, uninvolvement meant peace, and that was the one goal she longed to gain.</p><p>Since Gabriel still wouldn\u2019t let her go hunting, she spent most of the daylight hours alone. Her husband believed she was too fragile for the strenuous exercise of lifting a bow and arrow, she supposed, and how in God\u2019s name did one debate that ludicrous opinion? To keep her skill from becoming rusty, she fashioned a target on a tree trunk at the base of the hill and practiced there with her bow and arrows. She really was quite good with the weapon and was proud to boast she\u2019d actually bested Nicholas a time or two in target games.</p><p>No one bothered her while she was at her task. The women ignored her most of the time. The Maclaurins were openly hostile. Several young women followed the example set by their unspoken leader, a tall, robust woman with ruddy cheeks and white-blond hair named Glynis. She did a lot of unladylike snorting whenever Johanna walked past. Johanna didn\u2019t believe Glynis was an evil woman, though. She just didn\u2019t have any use for her mistress. If her guess was true, Johanna decided she couldn\u2019t fault the woman. While Glynis was working from early morning until nightfall in the fields beyond the line of trees with the other women, tending the fertile fields and nurturing their crops, Johanna was leisurely strolling around the holding, giving the appearance, she was sure, of a lazy queen of the manor.</p><p>No, Johanna didn\u2019t blame the women for resenting her. Gabriel was in part responsible for their opinion of her because he wouldn\u2019t allow her to interact with any of them, but Johanna was honest enough with herself to acknowledge she\u2019d allowed the separation and hadn\u2019t done anything to change the women\u2019s opinions of her. She hadn\u2019t tried to be friendly with any of them, following old habits without taking the time to question her own motives. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t had any close friends in England because her husband wouldn\u2019t have allowed it. Everything was different in the Highlands, she reminded herself. The clan wasn\u2019t going to vanish or move away.</p><p>After three months of solitude, she had to admit that, though her life was peaceful, it was also lonely and boring. She wanted to fit in. Just as important, she wanted to help rebuild what her first husband had destroyed. Gabriel was too busy with the reorganization to worry about her problems. She wasn\u2019t about to complain to her husband anyway. The problem was hers to solve.</p><p>Once Johanna named the dilemma, she set about solving it. She no longer wanted to separate herself from the clan and tried to join in whenever possible. She was shy by nature, almost painfully so, but she still forced herself to call a greeting whenever she spotted one of the women hurrying by. The MacBains always responded with a smile or a kind word; most of the Maclaurins pretended they hadn\u2019t heard her. There were some exceptions, of course. Leila and Megan, the two Maclaurin women who\u2019d assisted with her bath on her wedding night, seemed to like her, but the others refused her every offer of friendship.</p><p>She was confused by their attitude. She didn\u2019t know what she could do to change their minds about her. On Tuesday, when Keith was assigned the duty of looking out for her. she put the question to him.</p> <p>\u201cI would like your opinion. Keith, on a matter worrying me. I can\u2019t seem to find a way to gain acceptance from the Maclaurin women. Do you have a suggestion to offer?\u201d</p><p>Keith scratched his jaw while he listened to her. He could tell she was upset by his clan\u2019s behavior toward her, yet hesitated to explain the reason because he knew he would hurt her feelings. After several days spent protecting her, his own attitude had softened. She was still somewhat timid, but she certainly wasn\u2019t a coward as some of the Maclaurin women believed.</p><p>Johanna noticed his hesitation. She thought he didn\u2019t want to talk about the problem because they were within hearing distance of some of his clansmen.</p><p>\u201cWill you walk with me up the hill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p> <p>Neither one said another word until they were well away from the courtyard. Keith finally broke the silence. \u201cThe Highlanders have long memories. Lady Johanna. If a warrior goes to his death without avenging some slight, he still dies in peace because he knows that someday his son or grandson will right the wrong. The feuds are never forgotten, the sins never forgiven.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what he was talking about. He looked terribly earnest though. \u201cAnd not forgetting is important, Keith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>He acted as though he\u2019d finished his explanation. She shook her head in frustration. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand what it is you\u2019re trying to tell me. Please try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d the soldier responded. \u201cThe Maclaurins haven\u2019t forgotten what your first husband\u2019s men did here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they blame me, is that it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of them do blame you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about retaliation,\u201d he hastily added. \u201cRevenge is a man\u2019s game. The Highlanders leave the women and children alone. There is also the fact that your husband would kill anyone who dared to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about my safety,\u201d she replied. \u201cI can take care of myself. I can\u2019t fight memories though. I can\u2019t change what happened here. You needn\u2019t look so bleak, Keith. I believe I\u2019ve won a few of the women over. I heard one of them call me courageous. She wouldn\u2019t have given me that high praise if she disliked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe praise isn\u2019t praise at all,\u201d Keith announced, anger lacing his brogue. \u201cI cannot allow you to believe it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what are you trying to tell me?\u201d she asked in frustration.</p><p>Getting a straight answer out of the Maclaurin soldier was proving to be a difficult task. Johanna held onto her patience while she waited for him to sort out in his mind whatever was worrying him.</p><p>Keith let out a loud sigh. \u201cThey call Auggie clever.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAuggie is very clever,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThey believe he\u2019s daft.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why in heaven\u2019s name do they call him clever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The expression on her face told him she still hadn\u2019t caught on. \u201cThey call your husband merciful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir laird would be pleased to hear such praise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, m\u2019lady, he would not be pleased.\u201d</p><p>And still she didn\u2019t understand. Keith believed it would be a cruel disservice to let her remain ignorant. \u201cYour husband would be furious if he thought the Maclaurins truly believed he was a merciful man. The women, you see, gave the name that least fits. It\u2019s a foolish game they play. They actually believe their laird is ruthless. \u2019Tis the reason they admire him,\u201d he added with a nod. \u201cA leader doesn\u2019t wish to be known as merciful or kind-hearted. He would see it as a weakness.\u201d</p><p>She slowly straightened her spine. She was starting to grasp the meaning behind the women\u2019s game.</p><p>\u201cAnd so, if what you say is true, then they consider Auggie to be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDull-witted.\u201d</p><p>She finally understood. Keith saw the tears gather in her eyes before she turned away from him. \u201cThen I\u2019m not courageous in their minds. I\u2019m a coward. Now I understand. Thank you for taking the time to explain, Keith. I know it was difficult for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady, please give me the name of the woman you heard call you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not,\u201d she said as she shook her head. She couldn\u2019t look at the soldier. She felt embarrassed . . . and ashamed. \u201cWill you excuse me please? I believe I\u2019ll go back inside now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait to gain his permission but turned and hurried down the hill. She suddenly stopped and turned back to the soldier. \u201cI would appreciate it if you wouldn\u2019t mention this conversation to my husband. He doesn\u2019t need to be concerned about such unimportant matters as foolish games some women play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not mention it,\u201d Keith agreed. He was a little relieved she didn\u2019t want him to repeat the conversation to his laird, for he knew there would be hell to pay if the MacBain found out about the insult. The fact that the cruel behavior came from the Maclaurin women infuriated the soldier. As their leader, he felt the heavy burden of conflicting duties. He had pledged his loyalty to the MacBain, of course, and would give his life to keep his laird safe. That pledge spilled over to his wife. He would do whatever was demanded of him to protect Lady Johanna from harm.</p><p>Yet, he was also leader over his own clan members and, as such, felt that the Maclaurin problems should be solved by Maclaurins, not the MacBains. Telling his laird about the women\u2019s cruelty toward Lady Johanna made him feel traitorous. Keith knew it was Glynis and her cohorts causing all the mischief. He decided to take the time to have a firm talk with the women. He would order them to show their mistress the respect her position dictated.</p><p>Johanna went up to her bedroom and stayed there the rest of the afternoon. She alternated between anger and self-pity. She was certainly suffering from hurt feelings because of the women\u2019s cruelty, but that wasn\u2019t the true reason she wept. Nay, what really bothered Johanna was the possibility they were right. Was she really a coward?</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any answers. She wanted to hide in her chamber, but she forced herself to go down to dinner. Gabriel would be home from his hunt, and Keith would be there as well, and she didn\u2019t want either one of them to guess she was having any difficulties.</p><p>The hall was crowded with soldiers. Most were already seated at the two long tables adjacent to each other on the right side of the room. The scent of new wood and fresh pine-scented rushes on the floor mingled with the hearty aromas of the food being carried into the hall on giant trenchers made from two-day-old black bread.</p><p>No one stood when she entered the hall. That oversight bothered her. She didn\u2019t believe the men were being deliberately rude, however. Several waved when they spotted her. The soldiers simply didn\u2019t realize they were supposed to stand when a lady walked into the room.</p><p>She wondered what would make these two groups of proud, good men really feel like one clan. They worked so hard to keep separate. When one of the Maclaurin soldiers told a jest, only the other Maclaurin soldiers laughed. None of the MacBains even smiled.</p><p>They sat at separate tables, too. Gabriel was seated at the head of one table, and every other stool, except for the one on his right reserved for her, was taken up with a MacBain soldier. The Maclaurins all sat together at the other table.</p><p>Tonight, Gabriel barely acknowledged her. He held a parchment scroll in his hands and was frowning while he read the message it contained.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t interrupt her husband. His men weren\u2019t as thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the Gillevrey want?\u201d Calum asked his laird.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady, he\u2019s laird of the clan south of us,\u201d Keith explained in a shout from the other table. \u201cThe message came from him,\u201d he added. He turned his attention to his laird then. \u201cWhat does the old man want?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel finished reading the message and then rolled the scroll back. \u201cThe message is for Johanna.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cFor me?\u201d she asked as she reached for the scroll.</p><p>\u201cYou can read?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d she answered. \u201cI insisted upon learning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d her husband asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cBecause it was forbidden,\u201d she whispered. She didn\u2019t tell him that Raulf had taunted her over and over again, saying she was too ignorant to learn anything of value and that she had felt compelled to prove him wrong. It had been a silent defiance on her part, for Raulf never knew she had conquered the difficult task of reading and writing. Her teacher had been too frightened of Raulf to tell him.</p><p>Gabriel wouldn\u2019t let Johanna have the scroll. His frown was fierce when he asked, \u201cDo you know a baron by the name of Randolph Goode?\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze in midair. In the space of a heartbeat, the color left her face. She felt faint and took a quick breath to try to calm herself.</p><p>\u201cJohanna?\u201d he prodded when she didn\u2019t immediately answer him.</p><p>\u201cI know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message comes from Goode,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cGillevrey won\u2019t let him cross his border unless I give permission for him to come here. Who is this man and what does he want?\u201d</p><p>Johanna could barely hide her agitation. She wanted more than anything to get up and run but refused to give in to the cowardly urge.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to speak to him.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leaned back in his chair. He could see her fear and feel her panic. Her reaction to the news didn\u2019t sit well with him. Didn\u2019t she realize she was safe? Damn it all, he wasn\u2019t about to let anything happen to her.</p><p>He let out a sigh. She obviously didn\u2019t know, he realized. In time she would learn that he and his men would protect her from harm. She\u2019d learn to trust him, too, and then messages from England wouldn\u2019t make her fearful at all.</p><p>Gabriel knew he was being arrogant. He didn\u2019t care. Right now he wanted most of all to soothe his wife. He didn\u2019t like seeing her frightened. He had one other motive as well. He wanted to get to the truth.</p><p>\u201cHas this baron offended you in some way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t speak to him,\u201d she said again. Her voice shook with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI want to know . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped his question when she shook her head at him. He reached over and captured her chin with his hand to force her to stop denying him.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he commanded. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to see him or speak to him.\u201d</p><p>He gave her his promise in a low, fervent voice.</p><p>She looked wary now, and uncertain. \u201cDo you mean it? You won\u2019t let him come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>She visibly relaxed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel let go of her and leaned back in his chair again. \u201cNow answer my question,\u201d he ordered again. \u201cWho in thunder is Baron Goode?\u201d</p><p>Every soldier in the hall was silent now, watching and listening. It was obvious to all of them their mistress was frightened. They were curious to find out why.</p><p>\u201cBaron Goode is a powerful man in England,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSome say he\u2019s as powerful as King John.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel waited for her to continue. Long minutes passed before he realized she wasn\u2019t going to tell him more.</p><p>\u201cIs he a favored baron with the king?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cHe hates John. There are many other barons who share Goode\u2019s opinion of their overlord. They\u2019ve joined together, and some say Goode is their leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak of insurrection, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and turned her gaze to her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet rebellion, m\u2019lord. England is in turmoil now, and there are many barons who believe Arthur should have been named king. He was John\u2019s nephew. His father, Geoffrey, was John\u2019s older brother. He died a few months before the birth of his son.\u201d</p><p>Calum had tried to follow the explanation. He frowned in confusion now. \u201cM\u2019lady, do you mean to tell us that when King Richard died, Geoffrey should have become king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeoffrey was older than John,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe was next in line, for Richard didn\u2019t have sons, you see. But Geoffrey had already died. Some believe his son should have been the rightful heir. They even rallied behind Arthur and his cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the barons fight over the question of the crown?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel made the statement. Johanna nodded. \u201cThe barons prod their king whenever they\u2019re given the opportunity. John\u2019s made many enemies over the last several years. Nicholas believes one day there will be a full rebellion. Goode and the others are looking for a sound reason to rid the land of John now. They don\u2019t want to wait. John has proven to be a terrible king,\u201d she added in a whisper. \u201cHe has no conscience, not even toward the members of his own family. Do you know he turned against his own father and joined with France\u2019s king during the trouble? Henry died of a broken heart, for he had always believed that of all his children, John was most loyal to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you learn all this?\u201d Calum asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom my brother, Nicholas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t explained why Goode would want to speak to you,\u201d Gabriel reminded her.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he thinks I could aid his cause to unseat John.

I don\u2019t concern myself with England\u2019s political games. I can\u2019t imagine why Baron Goode would want to talk to me. I don\u2019t know anything that would aid his cause to unseat John.\u201d</p><p>She was lying. Gabriel didn\u2019t have any doubt about that fact. She was obviously terrified, too.</p><p>\u201cGoode wants to ask you some questions,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Calum asked when his mistress remained silent.</p> <p>Gabriel kept his gaze on his wife when he gave his answer. \u201cArthur,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s now convinced the king\u2019s nephew was indeed murdered.\u201d</p><p>Johanna started to stand up. Gabriel caught hold of her hand and forced her to stay where she was. He could feel her trembling.</p><p>\u201cI will not talk to Goode,\u201d she cried out. \u201cArthur disappeared over four years ago. I don\u2019t understand the baron\u2019s renewed interest in the whereabouts of the king\u2019s nephew. I have nothing to say to him.\u201d</p><p>She had already told him more than she intended. When she\u2019d spoken of Arthur, she used revealing words, such as was and wanted.</p><p>Johanna already knew the king\u2019s nephew was dead. Gabriel thought she might also know how Arthur had died and who had done the foul deed. He considered all the ramifications if his guess proved true, then shook his head. \u201cEngland is a world away from us,\u201d he announced. \u201cI will not allow any barons to come here. I never break my word, Johanna. You will not speak to any of them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Calum started to ask another question, but his laird\u2019s glare stopped him.</p> <p>\u201cWe are finished discussing this matter,\u201d he commanded. \u201cGive me your report on the progress of the wall, Calum.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was too upset to listen to the conversation. Her stomach was queasy, and she could barely swallow a bite of cheese. There was boar for the offering and leftover salted salmon, but she knew she\u2019d gag if she tried to eat anything more.</p><p>She stared at the food, wondering how long she would have to sit there before she could be excused from the table.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat something,\u201d Gabriel told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m not used to eating such large meals close to bedtime, m\u2019lord,\u201d she explained as her excuse. \u201cIn England, dinner was usually served between ten and noon, and a lighter fare was offered later in the day. It\u2019s going to take time to get accustomed to the change. Will you excuse me now? I would like to go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded permission. Since Calum was staring at her, she bid him good night, then got up and walked toward the entrance. She spotted Dumfries lounging on the left of the steps and immediately altered her path to make a wide half circle around the beast. She kept her gaze on the hound until she had gotten past him, then hurried on.</p><p>She took her time getting ready for bed. Going through such simple, uncomplicated rituals made her feel calmer and more in control of her fear. She forced herself to concentrate on each little task. She added two logs to the fire in the hearth, washed, and then sat down to brush her hair. She hated the chore. It seemed to take forever to get all the tangles out. Her scalp ached from the weight of the heavy mass, and by the time she was finished, she was too tired to braid it.</p><p>Johanna had run out of chores, and so she tried to think about other mundane things, for she believed that if she could block her fear, it would eventually go away.</p> <p>\u201cGabriel\u2019s right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cEngland is a world away from here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m safe, she thought to herself, and Nicholas and Mama will continue to be safe in England as long as I remain silent.</p><p>Johanna put her brush down and made the sign of the cross. She prayed for courage first and divine guidance next, and last of all she said a prayer for the man who should have been king. She prayed for Arthur.</p><p>Gabriel came into the room just as she was finishing her petitions. He found his wife sitting on the side of the bed staring at the flames in the fireplace. He bolted the door, pulled off his boots, and then walked over to the opposite side of the bed. She stood up and turned around to face him.</p><p>She looked so damned sad to him.</p><p>\u201cNicholas told me King John is afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to the floor. \u201cWhere did he get that notion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually you will tell me what you know. I won\u2019t demand. I\u2019ll wait. When you\u2019re ready to confide in me, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me what\u2019s scaring the hell out of you.\u201d</p><p>She thought about protesting, then changed her mind. She didn\u2019t want to lie to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cWe are married now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just your duty to protect me, Gabriel. It is also my duty to keep you safe whenever I can.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she meant by the outrageous remark. Keep him safe? Hell, she had it all backward in her mind. He was supposed to protect her and watch his own back. He would make certain he stayed alive long years so he could take care of her and Alex.</p><p>\u201cWives do not protect their husbands,\u201d he decided aloud.</p><p>\u201cThis wife does,\u201d she countered.</p><p>He was about to argue with her, but she turned his attention. She didn\u2019t say a word. She simply untied the belt to her robe and took the garment off. She wasn\u2019t wearing anything underneath.</p><p>His breath caught in the back of his throat. Dear God, she was beautiful. The firelight behind her cast a golden glow to her skin. There wasn\u2019t a single flaw to mar her appeal. Her br**sts were full, her waist was narrow, and her legs were long.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t remember taking his clothes off. He held her stare for long, silent minutes, until his heart was slamming inside his chest and his breathing was harsh with his arousal.</p><p>Johanna fought her embarrassment. She knew she was blushing because she could feel the heat in her face.</p><p>They both reached for the covers at the same time. Then they reached for each other. Johanna was still on her knees when Gabriel pulled her into his arms. He rolled her onto her back, covered her with his body, and kissed her.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and held him close. She was desperate for his touch. She wanted him tonight. She needed his comfort and his acceptance.</p><p>He needed satisfaction. His hands roughly caressed her shoulders, her back, her thighs. The feel of her silky skin inflamed him.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t need to be coaxed into responding. She couldn\u2019t stop stroking him. His body was so hard, his skin so wonderfully hot, and the way he made love to her with his mouth and hands aroused her to a fevered state in bare minutes.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible to be inhibited with Gabriel. He was a demanding lover, rough and gentle at the same time. He stroked the fires inside her with his intimate caresses, and when his fingers penetrated her and his thumb rubbed against the most sensitive nub hidden beneath her sleak folds, she became wild.</p><p>He took her hand and put it on his hard arousal. She squeezed him; he growled low in his throat. He whispered erotic praise and instructions of how he wanted her to caress him.</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t stand the sweet agony for very long. He roughly pulled her hands away from him, lifted her thighs, and thrust deep inside her. She cried out with pleasure. Her nails raked his shoulders, and she arched up against him to take more of him inside. He almost spilled his seed then and there. It took every ounce of discipline he possessed to hold back. His hand moved down between their joined bodies, and he stroked her with his fingers until she found her fulfillment. Then he allowed his own.</p><p>His orgasm consumed him. He groaned with raw pleasure as he poured his hot seed into her. She kept calling his name, and he called God\u2019s.</p><p>Gabriel collapsed on top of his wife with a loud, satisfied grunt. He stayed inside her, unwilling to let go of the bliss he\u2019d just experienced.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t want to let go of her husband just yet. She felt cherished when she was being held by him. She felt safe too . . . and almost loved.</p><p>His weight soon became crushing. She finally had to ask him to move so she could draw a proper breath.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he had enough strength. That thought amused him. He rolled to his side, taking her with him, then pulled the covers up and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. She poked him in the chest to gain his attention. He grunted in response.</p><p>\u201cYou were right. I am weak.\u201d</p><p>She waited to hear his agreement. He said nothing. \u201cA northern wind could probably blow me over,\u201d she said, repeating the words he\u2019d spoken on their first night as man and wife.</p><p>He remained silent. \u201cI might even be a little timid.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed before she spoke again. \u201cBut the other things, they aren\u2019t true. I won\u2019t let them be true.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and said her prayers. Gabriel thought she\u2019d fallen asleep. He was about to do the same. Then her voice, whisper-soft, yet filled with conviction, reached him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a coward.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Who dared to call you a coward?\u201d</p><p>Johanna was jarred out of a sound sleep by her husband\u2019s booming voice. She opened her eyes and looked at him. Gabriel was standing at the side of the bed, glaring down at her. He was fully dressed and looked furious.</p><p>He needed to be appeased, she decided with a yawn. She sat up in bed and shook her head at him. \u201cNo one called me a coward,\u201d she told him in a sleepy voice.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you say . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you needed to know.\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I needed to say the words.\u201d</p><p>He lost the edge of his anger. She tossed the covers back and started to get out of bed. Gabriel stopped her by pulling the covers up and ordering her to go back to sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou will rest today,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cI have rested long enough, m\u2019lord. It\u2019s time for me to begin my duties as your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest.\u201d</p><p>Lord, he was stubborn. The set of his jaw told her it would be pointless to argue with him. She didn\u2019t have any intention of lounging in bed all day, but she wasn\u2019t going to debate the issue with her husband.</p><p>He turned to leave. She stopped him with her question.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for this fine day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going hunting for more supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike grain?\u201d she asked. She got out of bed and reached for her robe.</p><p>\u201cLike grain,\u201d Gabriel agreed.</p><p>Johanna put her robe on and tied the belt at her waist. He watched her lift her hair from underneath the collar. The action was feminine and graceful.</p><p>\u201cHow does one hunt for crops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe steal them.\u201d</p><p>She let out a loud gasp. \u201cBut that\u2019s a sin,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Gabriel was vastly amused by the look of horror on his wife\u2019s face. Stealing seemed to upset her. He couldn\u2019t imagine why.</p><p>\u201cIf Father MacKechnie gets wind of this, he\u2019ll have your hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKechnie\u2019s not back yet. By then all my sins will have been committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m most serious, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, you aren\u2019t just committing the sin of theft,\u201d she instructed. \u201cYou\u2019re also committing the sin of contemplation.\u201d</p><p>She looked like she expected some sort of answer. He shrugged. She shook her head at him.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t your place to censure me, wife.\u201d</p><p>He expected an apology. He got a contradiction instead. \u201cOh, yes, it is my place to censure you, m\u2019lord, when the topic is your soul. It is my place to instruct you, sir, for I am your wife, and I, therefore, must worry about your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She gasped again. He almost laughed but stopped himself in time. \u201cYou think it ridiculous that I worry about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are beginning to have affection for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, m\u2019lord. You turn my words on me. I worry about your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not need your worry or your lectures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wife is allowed to give her opinions, is she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhen asked for her opinions, of course.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his qualification. \u201cIt is my opinion that you should barter for what you need.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t control his exasperation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything of value to trade,\u201d he told her. \u201cBesides, if the other clans can\u2019t protect what they own, they deserve to have their supplies taken. It\u2019s our way, wife. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>He was finished discussing the topic. She wasn\u2019t. \u201cSuch justification ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest,\u201d Gabriel ordered as he pulled the door closed behind him.</p><p>She was married to a stubborn man. Johanna decided not to bring up the topic of stealing again. Gabriel was right. It wasn\u2019t her place to instruct him or any of the other clansmen. If they all wanted to spend their eternities in hell, so be it. What did she care?</p><p>Johanna spent the morning practicing with her bow and arrows and spent the afternoon playing Auggie\u2019s senseless, yet vastly enjoyable, game.</p><p>Auggie had become her only real friend. He spoke only Gaelic to her, and she found the more relaxed she was, the less difficult the language became. The older man was patient and understanding with her and answered every question she put to him.</p><p>She told him how upsetting she found Gabriel\u2019s thievery. Auggie wasn\u2019t sympathetic and, in fact, championed his laird\u2019s cunning.</p><p>They were standing on the ridge, striking long shots while they discussed her worry. Most of the stones shattered from the force of the blow.</p><p>\u201cThe English destroyed our reserves. Our laird will make certain the clan doesn\u2019t go hungry this winter,\u201d he announced. \u201cHow can you call that a sin, lass?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s stealing,\u201d she countered.</p><p>Auggie shook his head. \u201cGod will understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one way into a castle, Auggie. Gabriel should find another way to feed the clan.\u201d</p><p>The old man positioned his staff against the round stone, braced his legs apart, and gave a swing. He squinted against the sunlight to see how far he\u2019d hit the stone, nodded with satisfaction, and turned back to his mistress.</p> <p>\u201cMy stone traveled thrice the distance of an arrow. Beat that one, little worrier. See if you can\u2019t put your stone right next to mine.\u201d</p><p>Johanna turned her attention to the game. She surprised a whoop of laughter out of Auggie when she matched his distance. Her stone came to rest just inches away from his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a knack for the game, lass,\u201d Auggie praised. \u201cWe\u2019d best go back now. I\u2019ve kept you from your duties longer than I had a right</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have duties,\u201d she blurted out. She tucked her staff under her arm and turned to her friend. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to take over the running of the household, but no one listens to me. The MacBains are more polite though. They smile while I instruct them, then go about their business without paying any heed to what I\u2019ve said. The Maclaurin servants are far more rude, embarrassingly so. They completely ignore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does our laird have to say about this behavior?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told him. I\u2019m not going to either, Auggie. This is my dilemma to solve, not his.\u201d</p><p>Auggie took hold of Johanna\u2019s arm and started down the steep hill. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here how long now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost twelve weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were content for a time, weren\u2019t you now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>She was surprised by his question. She shrugged. \u201cComing here made me . . . free. And safe,\u201d she hastily added.</p><p>\u201cYou were like a dove with a broken wing,\u201d Auggie said. He patted her hand before continuing. \u201cAnd as timid as I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not timid now,\u201d she countered. \u201cAt least not when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the changes in you. The others haven\u2019t. In time I imagine they will notice you\u2019ve got a bit of gumption.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d just been given a setdown or praise. \u201cBut the stealing, Auggie. What should I do about my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it be for now,\u201d he suggested. \u201d \u2019Tis the truth I can\u2019t get riled up about a little thieving. My laird promised to bring me barley, and I\u2019m anxious to have it, sin or not. It\u2019s for the making of my brew,\u201d he added with a nod. \u201cThe English drank all of my reserves, lass.\u201d He snorted with laughter, leaned closer to her side, and whispered, \u201cThey didn\u2019t get to the barrels of liquid gold though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are barrels of liquid gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the break in the pines beyond the ridge?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cave directly behind,\u201d he announced. \u201cIt\u2019s full of oak barrels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s inside the barrels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe water of life,\u201d he answered. \u201cBrew as old as ten, even fifteen, years now. It should be tasting like gold I\u2019ll wager. One of these days I\u2019ll take you there to have a look for yourself. The only reason it\u2019s stayed untouched is because the English didn\u2019t know it was there for the taking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes my husband know about the cave?\u201d</p><p>Auggie thought about the question a long while before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t recall telling him,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the only one who remembers when the old Maclaurin chieftains stored the barrels there. They weren\u2019t telling, of course, but I followed them one afternoon without their knowing. I can be quiet when I set my mind to the task,\u201d he added with a nod.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last go inside the cave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few years back,\u201d Auggie told her. \u201cDo you notice, Johanna, that when you wear the MacBain plaid you play a fair game, but when you\u2019re wearing the Maclaurin colors, you can\u2019t hit a thing?\u201d</p><p>He was talking nonsense, of course. He liked to tease her. She thought it was just his way of showing affection.</p><p>As soon as they reached the courtyard, Auggie took off down the hill. She spotted Keith, bowed to him, and then hurried past. She\u2019d felt uncomfortable around the Maclaurin soldier ever since he\u2019d explained the real meaning behind the nickname the Maclaurin women had given her.</p><p>She also wanted to wash her hands before her husband came home and noticed how dirty they were. He could be very unreasonable about her appearance; but since he demanded little enough from her, she tried to please him whenever possible.</p><p>Johanna was just starting up the steps to her home when a shout sounded behind her. She turned and saw soldiers running toward her. Several had their swords drawn.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what all the fuss was about. \u201cGet inside, m\u2019lady. Pull the door closed behind you.\u201d Keith shouted his instruction. Johanna wasn\u2019t going to argue with the soldier or question him now. She assumed they were under attack by intruders and hurried to do as she was ordered.</p><p>Then she heard the low, menacing growl. She turned around again. She spotted her husband\u2019s pet slowly making his way across the courtyard. She cried out at the sight of the beast. Dumfries was covered with blood. From the distance she could see his left hindquarter had been ripped to shreds.</p><p>The hound was trying to come home to die. Johanna\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she watched Dumfries struggle.</p><p>The soldiers made a wide circle around the dog. \u201cGo inside, Lady Johanna.\u201d Keith bellowed his order. She suddenly understood what they meant to do. They were going to kill the wolfhound to put him out of his misery. The way they warily moved toward the hound told her they believed he might turn on one of them.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t about to let any more harm come to the dog. One soldier started to move forward with his sword raised to strike.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone.\u201d</p><p>The fury in her shout gained every soldier\u2019s attention. They turned to look at her, their surprise most evident in their gaping expressions.</p><p>A few of the Maclaurin soldiers actually backed away from the dog. The MacBain warriors didn\u2019t move from their positions, however.</p><p>Keith rushed up the steps. He grabbed hold of Johanna\u2019s arm. \u201cYou needn\u2019t witness this,\u201d he announced. \u201cPlease go inside.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her arm away from the soldier\u2019s hold. \u201cDumfries wants to come inside. He sleeps by the fire. That\u2019s where he\u2019s going. Hold the doors open, Keith. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>She shouted the last of her command before turning back to the other soldiers. She didn\u2019t believe Dumfries would allow any of the men to assist him. She knew the dog must be in terrible pain, for his gait faltered again and again as he slowly made his way over to the steps.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady, at least get out of his range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the men to let him come inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut m\u2019lady ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as I\u2019ve ordered,\u201d she commanded. \u201cIf anyone touches Dumfries, he\u2019ll answer to me.\u201d</p><p>The tone of her voice told Keith it was pointless to argue with her. He gave the command. then grabbed his mistress\u2019s arm again and tried to drag her back through the entrance.</p><p>\u201cThe doors, Keith. Keep them open.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t take her gaze off the dog when she gave the order. Leila and Megan, the two Maclaurin women assigned the duty of cleaning the great hall and the chambers above, came running to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Megan whispered. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back, m\u2019lady,\u201d Leila cried out. \u201cPoor Dumfries. He can\u2019t make it up the steps. They\u2019ll have to kill him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s touching him,\u201d Johanna snapped. \u201cMegan, fetch my needle and threads. Leila, there\u2019s a satchel under my bed filled with jars of herbs and medicines. Get it for me.\u201d</p><p>Dumfries collapsed on the third step. He let out a whimper and tried to stand up again. He alternated between yelps and growls now. Johanna couldn\u2019t stand the sight of his agony a moment longer. She\u2019d hoped to approach the hound inside by the fire while he was at rest but knew he wouldn\u2019t make it inside without her.</p><p>She pulled away from Keith and ran to help. The dog let out a loud growl when she approached him. She slowed her pace, put her hand out, and began to whisper words meant to soothe the beast.</p><p>Keith once again tried to drag her back. The hound let out an even louder growl when the soldier touched her.</p><p>She ordered Keith back. She looked up and saw that two MacBain soldiers had their arrows notched to their bows. They were protecting her whether she wished it or not. If the hound tried to snap at her, their arrows would kill him before real damage was done.</p><p>Johanna\u2019s compassion for the wounded animal warred with her fear. Aye, she was terrified; and when she slowly bent down to put her arms around the beast, she couldn\u2019t control her own whimpers.</p><p>The hound didn\u2019t let up his growling, but he allowed her assistance.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t realize her own strength. The dog leaned into her side. She almost toppled over from the weight, righted herself, and once again wrapped her arms around him. She held him behind his front legs. Bent as she was to her task, the side of her face was pressed against his neck. She kept up a steady stream of encouraging words and half-dragged the dog up the rest of the steps. It was backbreaking work, but when they\u2019d cleared the last step, the dog found new strength and pulled away from her. He growled again and went in through the opening.</p><p>Dumfries paused at the top of the steps leading down into the great hall. Johanna again came to his assistance and half-carried him down the stairs.</p><p>Men putting the finishing touches on the mantel with their brushes quickly moved out of the way as Dumfries walked toward them. The dog circled the area in front of the hearth twice, then began to whimper. He was obviously in too much pain now to lie down.</p><p>Megan came running with the supplies Johanna had requested. Her mistress sent her back with the order to get the blanket off the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a fresh one from the chest, m\u2019lady,\u201d Megan called out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cTake the one from my bed. Megan. Dumfries will be comforted by my husband\u2019s scent.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later Megan tossed the blanket to her mistress. Johanna knelt down on the floor and made a bed for the dog. When she was finished, she patted the cover and ordered the dog down.</p><p>Dumfries circled once again, then collapsed on his side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten the beast inside, m\u2019lady.\u201d Keith whispered from behind her. \u201cThat was quite an accomplishment.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat was easy,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat comes next is a little more challenging. I\u2019m going to sew him up. \u2019Tis the truth I dread the duty. Dumfries isn\u2019t going to understand.\u201d</p><p>She patted the side of Dumfries\u2019s neck again before leaning forward on her knees to look at the deep gash in his left flank.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, m\u2019lady. The hound will kill you if you touch his injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sincerely hope not,\u201d Johanna replied.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re afraid of him.\u201d The soldier blurted out the reminder.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed, \u201cI am afraid. It doesn\u2019t change anything though, does it? Dumfries still has an injury and I still have to sew him up. Leila? Have you found the jars of medicines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Johanna turned and spotted Leila and Megan standing side by side on the top step. Megan held up the needle and ball of white thread, and Leila clutched her mistress\u2019s gray satchel in her arms.</p><p>\u201cBring them to me, please, and put them on the blanket.\u201d</p><p>Leila and Megan didn\u2019t move from the top of the steps. They started toward her when she motioned to them but stopped suddenly. Dumfries was at it again, growling low in his throat. The sound he made was very like what Johanna imagined a demon let loose from hell would make. It was quite chilling.</p><p>The women were afraid to come any closer. The realization astonished Johanna. She thought she was the only one who found the hound intimidating. She took sympathy on the women and went over to collect her supplies from them.</p><p>\u201cDo be careful, m\u2019lady,\u201d Leila whispered.</p><p>Johanna nodded. She was ready to begin her work a few minutes later. Keith wasn\u2019t about to let her take the chance of being bitten by the hound while she worked on him. He knelt down behind Dumfries and positioned himself so that he could easily grab hold of the dog\u2019s neck and pin him down if he tried to harm his mistress.</p><p>The dog amazed both Johanna and the soldier. He never made a sound all the while she prodded at him. Johanna made enough noise for the two of them. She whispered apologies and moaned every time she touched the injury with the linen square she\u2019d soaked in the cleaning salve. She knew the medicine burned, and so she blew on each spot after she\u2019d applied the thick liquid.</p><p>Into the chaos came Gabriel. Johanna had just threaded the needle when she heard her husband\u2019s voice behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Johanna let out a little sigh of relief. She turned on her knees to look up at her husband. Lord, she had never been so relieved to see him. She watched as he walked across the hall to stand ever her. His big hands were settled on his hips. His gaze was directed on his hound.</p><p>Keith immediately stood up. The other soldiers who\u2019d followed him into the great hall moved back to give Keith room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wager Dumfries met up with a wolf or two,\u201d Keith speculated.</p><p>\u201cThink he found our pet?\u201d Calum asked the question. He walked over to stand next to Keith.</p><p>Johanna went back to her task. She tied the knot in her thread, then put the needle down and reached for the second jar of medicine.</p><p>\u201cYou have another pet, m\u2019lord?\u201d she asked while she gently dabbed the yellow ointment on the cut. She used another linen square to smooth the healing salve along the jagged edges.</p><p>\u201cThe Maclaurins call one particular wolf Pet. Your hand\u2019s shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog terrifies me.\u201d</p><p>Johanna finished dabbing the medicine on the injury. The salve would protect the cut from infection. It also had a side benefit of numbing the area. Dumfries would barely feel the sting of her needle.</p><p>\u201cYet she\u2019s tending him, Laird.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can see she is, Keith,\u201d Gabriel replied.</p><p>\u201cThe difficult part\u2019s over,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cDumfries shouldn\u2019t feel the rest of my prodding. Besides . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides what?\u201d</p><p>She whispered her explanation, but Gabriel couldn\u2019t make out the words. He knelt down beside his wife. He placed his hand on the dog\u2019s neck. Dumfries immediately tried to lick his fingers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he asked his wife while he stroked his hound.</p><p>\u201cI said, you\u2019re here now,\u201d she whispered. She glanced over, saw his arrogant expression, and immediately added, \u201cDumfries will be comforted. He has great affection for you, m\u2019lord. I imagine he knows you\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it too, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She knew he expected her agreement. She decided his arrogance would get completely out of hand if she admitted she did feel safe when he was near, and so she remained silent.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her any time at all to sew the injury closed. Gabriel helped her wrap wide cotton strips around and around the dog. He tied the ends together.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t leave this alone for long,\u201d her husband predicted.</p><p>She nodded. She was suddenly overwhelmed with fatigue. Fear had drained her of her strength, she supposed.</p><p>She collected her supplies and stood up. A crowd of curious men and women stood behind her. Johanna spotted Glynis in the group and immediately turned her gaze away.</p><p>\u201cShe carried your dog inside, MacBain. Aye, she did.\u201d</p><p>As Keith told a somewhat exaggerated version, Johanna continued through the crowd. She hurried up the steps and down the hall to her chamber. She put her supplies away, washed her hands again, and then took off her shoes so she could stretch out on the bed. She planned to rest for just a few minutes and then return to the hall for dinner.</p><p>She fell asleep a few minutes later. Gabriel came up to the room twice during the evening to look in on her. He finally came to bed around midnight after making certain Dumfries was resting comfortably.</p> <p>Johanna barely moved while her husband took off her clothes. She opened her eyes once, frowned up at him, and then promptly fell asleep again. Gabriel took a fresh blanket from the chest and covered his wife before he stripped out of his own clothes and got into bed beside her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to reach for her. The minute he was settled, she rolled over into his embrace. He pulled her closer. She tucked her head under his chin.</p><p>Gabriel recounted in his mind the story Keith had related to him. He tried to picture his wife wrapping her arms around Dumfries and dragging the hound up the steps.</p><p>The courage his wife had shown pleased him. Still, he didn\u2019t want her to take such chances in future. Dumfries had been in pain, and a wounded animal, no matter how loyal, wasn\u2019t to be trusted.</p><p>Tomorrow he would order her never to take such risks again. Gabriel fell asleep worrying about his delicate little bride.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Gabriel knew, before he\u2019d even opened his eyes the following morning, that his wife wasn\u2019t in bed with him.</p><p>Hell, it was just a little past dawn, and he as laird and husband should have been the first to leave the bed. His irritation softened, however, with the thought that she was probably downstairs waiting for him in the great hall. She had looked worried about Dumfries the night before, he remembered, and she was no doubt still fretting over the animal.</p> <p>The Maclaurin plaid was draped over a chair. Johanna had gotten her days mixed up, for she had obviously dressed in the MacBain colors two days in a row. The Maclaurins were sure to kick up a fuss, and damn it all, he didn\u2019t have time for such puny, inconsequential matters.</p><p>Both Keith and Calum were already waiting for him in the hall. They bowed to their laird when he appeared at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my wife?\u201d</p><p>Calum and Keith exchanged a worried look, then Calum stepped forward to answer. \u201cWe thought she was above the stairs with you, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where is she?\u201d Calum asked.</p><p>Gabriel glared at the soldier. \u201c \u2019Twas the question I just put to you,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Dumfries lifted his head at the sound of his master\u2019s voice. His tail thumped against the rushes. Gabriel went over to the hound, bent down on one knee, and pounded the side of the dog\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to carry you outside, Dumfries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Johanna has already taken your pet outside, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Leila called out the news from the entrance. She hurried down the steps, smiled at Calum and Keith, and then turned to her laird. \u201cShe gave him food and water, too. She declared your pet\u2019s feeling much better today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would she know so soon he\u2019s better?\u201d Keith asked.</p><p>Leila smiled. \u201cI asked her the very same question, and she told me his growl is a little stronger today. That was how she knew he had improved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Gabriel demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe went riding,\u201d Leila answered. \u201cShe declared it was too fine a day to stay inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife went riding alone?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t wait for an answer. He muttered a dark blasphemy as he left the hall. Keith and Calum started after him.</p><p>\u201cI take full responsibility should anything happen to our mistress,\u201d Keith announced. \u201cI should have gotten here sooner. Today\u2019s my day to protect her,\u201d he added as explanation. \u201cDamn but I wish she\u2019d stay where she\u2019s put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was wearing the MacBain plaid,\u201d Leila called out.</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Keith said.</p><p>\u201cBut she is, sir.\u201d</p><p>Calum scratched his jaw. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten her days mixed up,\u201d he decided aloud. He winked at Leila when he passed her, then increased his stride to catch up with Keith.</p><p>Gabriel controlled his worry by getting angry. He\u2019d been most specific with his wife during the past several weeks. She was to rest, damn it. Riding out alone in the hills infested with wolves wasn\u2019t his idea of a rest. Did he have to keep her under lock and key? By God, he\u2019d ask her that question just as soon as he found her.</p><p>Sean, the stable master, spotted his laird coming his way and immediately prepared his stallion for the day\u2019s hunt. He was just leading the black beauty out when Gabriel reached him. He snapped the reins out of Sean\u2019s hands, grunted a response to the stable master\u2019s greeting, and gained his stallion\u2019s back in one fluid motion. The horse was in a full gallop by the time he\u2019d crossed the meadow.</p><p>Auggie heard the pounding of hooves and lifted his head. He was down on his knees measuring the distance from one hole he\u2019d just dug to the next. He hurried to stand up and bowed when his laird stopped his mount a scant foot away.</p><p>\u201cGood day to you, Laird MacBain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood day to you, Auggie,\u201d Gabriel responded. He scanned the meadow, then turned his gaze back to the old warrior. \u201cHave you seen my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing her now, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>Auggie motioned with his hand. Gabriel turned in his saddle and looked up. He spotted Johanna immediately. She was on the north ridge, seated atop her mount.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is she doing?\u201d he muttered to himself.</p><p>\u201cContemplating her circumstances,\u201d Auggie answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be knowing, MacBain. I\u2019m just repeating her words to me. She\u2019s been up there over an hour. I\u2019d wager she\u2019s worked it all out in her mind by now.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. He goaded his mount into a full run. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine day to ride,\u201d Auggie shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a finer day to stay inside,\u201d Gabriel muttered in reply.</p><p>Johanna was just about to ride back down to the meadow when she noticed her husband coming up the ridge. She waved in greeting, then folded her hands together on top of the reins and waited for him to come to her.</p><p>She was more than ready to take him on, she decided. She took a deep breath in anticipation. It was time for her to put her new plan into action. She was a little nervous, but that was to be expected. She wasn\u2019t used to taking charge. That wasn\u2019t going to stop her though. By God, she was responsible for her destiny, she thought to herself. She needed to explain that fact to her husband.</p><p>Johanna had awakened a full hour before dawn and had spent the time thinking about all the changes she wanted to make. Most involved her own behavior, but there were also a few changes she planned to help her husband make.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s pet had actually started her thinking. Johanna had learned something very revealing when she\u2019d taken care of the dog\u2019s injury. First came the observation that his growl was all bluster, a sign of affection really. Second came the realization she didn\u2019t need to fear the beast. A firm pat and a kind word had won her Dumfries\u2019s loyalty. This morning, when she\u2019d fed the wolfhound, he\u2019d growled with affection while he licked her hand.</p><p>Not unlike his master.</p><p>Her husband\u2019s scowls no longer worried her. Johanna had to remind herself of that fact when he reached her side.</p><p>\u201cYou were ordered to rest,\u201d he snapped, his voice hard with anger.</p><p>She ignored his hostile greeting. \u201cGood morning, husband. Did you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was so close to her, his right leg pressed against her left thigh. Johanna couldn\u2019t suffer his frown long and turned her gaze to her lap. She didn\u2019t want his glare to bother her concentration. She had quite a bit to say to her husband, and it was important she remembered every one of her thoughts.</p><p>He noticed his wife had her bow and arrows in a leather carrier strapped to her back. Bringing the weapon along showed good sense, he decided, providing she was accurate in the event of an attack. Practicing with a target pinned to a tree was one thing, but the real proof in her ability would be shown on a moving target . . . such as a hungry wolf or an angered, charging boar. Those thoughts led to the reminder of the dangers lurking in the hills beyond. His scowl immediately intensified.</p><p>\u201cYou blatantly disregarded my instructions, Johanna. You are not allowed . . .\u201d</p><p>She leaned to the side of her saddle, reached up, and gently stroked the side of his neck with her fingertips. The caress had been butterfly light, and over before he even had time to react, but it still managed to break his concentration.</p><p>Her touch stunned him. Johanna sat back, folded her hands together, and smiled up at him.</p><p>He had to shake his head to clear his thoughts. Then he started over again.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea of the dangers . . .\u201d</p><p>She did it again. Damned if she didn\u2019t deliberately break his concentration by stroking the side of his neck. He grabbed hold of her hand before she could pull away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatting you.\u201d</p><p>He started to say something, then changed his mind. He stared at her a long minute, trying to understand what had come over her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he finally demanded, his expression wary.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to show you affection, m\u2019lord. Does my touch displease you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He grabbed hold of her chin with his hand and leaned down. His mouth covered hers in a long, hard kiss.</p><p>She melted against his side, put her arms around his neck, and clung to him as the kiss deepened.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t know how it happened; but when her husband finally pulled back, she was seated on his lap.</p><p>He held her close. She collapsed against his chest, let out a little sigh, and smiled with satisfaction.</p><p>She wanted to laugh. Dear God, it really worked. She had just proven a most important theory. Gabriel and his hound were actually very much alike. Her husband liked to bluster as much as his pet did.</p><p>\u201cIt is permitted for a wife to show her husband affection.\u201d</p><p>He was giving her his approval, she supposed. And Lord, did he sound arrogant. She leaned away from him so she could look up at him.</p><p>\u201cIs it permitted for a husband to take his wife riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. A husband can do anything he wishes to do.\u201d</p><p>So can a wife, she thought to herself. \u201cWhy are you always so serious, m\u2019lord? \u2019Tis the truth you don\u2019t smile enough to suit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a warrior, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>From the look on his face she assumed he believed he\u2019d given her a full and logical explanation.</p><p>He lifted her back on her mount. \u201cYou rarely smile,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a warrior\u2019s wife, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>She smiled after giving him her tart answer. He couldn\u2019t help but grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very handsome when you smile, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you dislike handsome men, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. I was trying to compliment you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. \u201cWhat were you doing up here all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>She answered his question with one of her own. \u201cCould you spare an hour and ride with me? I\u2019m on a hunt to find a cave Auggie told me about. There\u2019s a treasure inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is this treasure?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to help me find the cave first. Then I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s inside. I know how busy you are, but surely one hour won\u2019t matter, will it?\u201d</p><p>He frowned while he considered her request. He did have important duties set aside for today and they should come first, of course. Riding for sheer pleasure didn\u2019t make any sense at all to him. It wasn\u2019t . . . productive.</p><p>Yet the idea of spending a few minutes, and that was surely all he could spare, with his beautiful wife did appeal to him.</p><p>\u201cYou may lead the way, Johanna. I\u2019ll follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>She looked overwhelmed with gratitude. His gentle little wife derived such joy from little pleasures. Gabriel suddenly felt like an ogre because he had taken time to consider her request.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t about to give him time to change his mind. She wanted to get him away from his holding . . . and his responsibilities so that she could have a long talk in private with him. She grabbed the reins and goaded her mount into a full run down the hill.</p><p>She was a skilled rider. The realization surprised him. She seemed too delicate for any outdoor skills.</p><p>Gabriel was content to stay behind her until they reached the forest. Then he took over the lead.</p><p>They criss-crossed back and forth while they looked for the entrance to the cave. After an hour\u2019s search, Johanna was ready to give up. \u201cNext time we must ask Auggie to ride with us. He\u2019ll point the way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They broke through the trees and stopped in a narrow clearing next to the stream overlooking the valley.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go back?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you first, m\u2019lord, and if I weren\u2019t so hungry, I would beg you to stay here the rest of the day. It\u2019s so lovely. Do you notice how green and lush your valley is?\u201d Her eyes sparkled with mischief when she added, \u201cAnd to think you have such a mild climate all year long. I count myself fortunate each and every day. Aye, I do.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel found her enthusiasm refreshing. He\u2019d never seen her in such a lighthearted mood before. It warmed his heart. God\u2019s truth, he was reluctant to leave, too.</p> <p>\u201cI can take care of satisfying your hunger, wife.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cWill you hunt for food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. I carry everything we\u2019ll need.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dismounted, then assisted her to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re too thin, Johanna. You barely weigh two stones.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his criticism. \u201cWhere is this food you boast of, husband? Will it appear like manna from the sky, do you suppose?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. She watched as he lifted the flap of his saddle and removed a flat metal plate. Behind the saddle was a bag tied with a string.</p><p>He motioned her to walk over to the clearing. He tied the reins of both their mounts to one of the branches before he joined her.</p><p>\u201cTake off your plaid, Johanna. We\u2019ll use it for a blanket. Spread it on the ground near the pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably isn\u2019t decent.\u201d</p><p>The sassy tone of her voice told him she didn\u2019t mind if she was decent or not. Her lighthearted mood puzzled him and made him determined to find out what had caused this change. Johanna was usually very reserved.</p><p>A few minutes later, she was seated on her plaid watching Gabriel prepare their food. He\u2019d started a fire with peat and twigs, then placed the metal plate in the center of the flames. He then sprinkled oatmeal from the pouch into one cupped hand, added water he\u2019d gathered from the stream, and quickly formed a thick oat cake. He dropped the mixture on the plate, and while it cooked, he made another.</p> <p>The oatmeal cake tasted like baked sticks mixed with dust to Johanna, but because her husband had taken the time and trouble to prepare the food, she didn\u2019t let him know how horrid it tasted.</p><p>Gabriel thought the expression on her face while she nibbled on the oatmeal was comical. She made several trips to the stream for drinks of water to wash the food down, and she could only eat half the cake before she declared she was quite full.</p><p>\u201cIt was thoughtful of you to bring the food along,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cEvery warrior always carries his food on his back, Johanna.\u201d He sat down beside her, leaned back against the tree trunk, and added, \u201cWe take everything we need for a hunt or a war. Highlanders are self-sufficient. We don\u2019t have need for bread or wine or carts loaded down with pots and caldrons like the pampered English soldiers. Our plaids are our tents or our blankets, and what other food we want, we take from the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr steal from the other clans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to take without permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our way,\u201d he explained once again.</p> <p>\u201cDo the other clans steal from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything they would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they all steal from each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s most barbaric,\u201d she decided aloud. \u201cDon\u2019t any of the lairds ever barter for what they need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d Gabriel answered. \u201cTwice a year council meetings are held near the Moray Firth. Clans not feuding attend. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a fair amount of bartering done then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard? Then you\u2019ve never attended any of these meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She waited for further explanation. He remained silent. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been invited?\u201d</p><p>She sounded incensed over the possible insult. \u201cEvery laird is invited, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why in heaven\u2019s name haven\u2019t you attended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had the time or the inclination. Besides, as I\u2019ve already explained to you several times now, we don\u2019t have anything to barter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you did?\u201d she asked. \u201cWould you attend the council meeting?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his answer.</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cWhat does Father MacKechnie have to say about stealing?\u201d</p><p>His wife seemed obsessed with her worry about the priest\u2019s opinion. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t criticize us if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. He knows it would be pointless to argue. Survival comes before paltry concerns such as venial sins.\u201d</p><p>She was quite astonished by her husband\u2019s attitude. Damned envious, too. It would be nice not to worry about sinning all the time.</p><p>\u201cFather MacKechnie is an unusual priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very kind. That makes him unusual.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned over her comment. \u201cWhat are the priests in England like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel.\u201d She blurted out her belief and immediately felt guilty because she\u2019d lumped all the men of God in with the few mean-hearted ones-she\u2019d known. \u201cSome are probably kind-hearted,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cI\u2019m certain some are very good men who don\u2019t believe women come last in God\u2019s love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen are what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast in God\u2019s love,\u201d she explained. She straightened up but kept her head bowed. \u201cYou might as well know I\u2019m not in good standing with the church, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>She acted as though she was giving him a dark confession. \u201cAnd why is that, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a rebel,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He smiled. She thought he might think she was jesting. \u201cI am a rebel,\u201d she said again. \u201cI don\u2019t believe everything the church teaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe God loves women less than he loves oxen.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel had never heard of anything so preposterous. \u201cWho told you . . .\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cBishop Hallwick liked to list God\u2019s hierarchy as a reminder to me of my insignificance. He said that unless I learned true humility and submissiveness, I would never sleep with the angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis bishop was your confessor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a time,\u201d she answered. \u201cBecause of Raulf\u2019s important position, the bishop was his advisor and his confessor. He dictated many penances.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel could all but taste her fear. He leaned forward and put his hand on her shoulder. She flinched in reaction.</p><p>\u201cExplain these penances,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She shook her head. She was sorry she\u2019d brought up the topic. \u201cWhen will Alex come home?\u201d</p><p>He knew she was deliberately changing the subject. He decided to let her have her way. His wife was full of strange worries; and from the way she was gripping her hands together now, he assumed Bishop Hallwiek was at the top of her list of concerns.</p><p>\u201cAlex will come home when the wall is finished,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou asked me the very same question yesterday. Did you forget my answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably ask you again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA son should live with his father. Is he content to wait? Is he happy with his mother\u2019s family? Do you trust the people looking out for his welfare? A child as young as Alex needs his father\u2019s attention,\u201d she ended.</p><p>She was actually insulting him by asking such questions. Did she believe he would leave his son in the hands of infidels?</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t believe she was trying to be insolent. The worried look on her face showed how concerned she was about the boy.</p><p>\u201cAlex would tell me if he was unhappy or unfairly treated. \u201d</p><p>She shook her head vehemently. \u201cNay, he might not tell you. He might be suffering in silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would he suffer in silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he would be ashamed, of course. He\u2019d believe he\u2019d done something wrong to merit such cruel treatment. Bring him home, Gabriel. He belongs with us.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hauled her onto his lap and nudged her chin up. He stared down at her a long minute, trying to understand what was going on inside her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him home for a visitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him then if he\u2019s unhappy or mistreated.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved to cover her mouth so she wouldn\u2019t interrupt him. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added in a firmer voice when she dared to shake her head, \u201che\u2019ll tell me the truth. Now I would like for you to answer a question for me, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hand away, waited for her nod, and then asked, \u201cHow long did you suffer in silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a wonderful childhood. My parents were gentle, loving people. Father died three years ago. I still miss him something fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all alone now. Do you know, I never would have agreed to come here if it weren\u2019t for Nicholas\u2019s promise to look out for her. He\u2019s a devoted son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably saw your parents often while you were married to the baron, but the distance from this holding to your mother\u2019s home is simply too great to allow more than one visitation a year, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would let me go to my mother?\u201d</p><p>She looked astonished. \u201cI would take you,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut only once a year. You can\u2019t expect to see your family as often as you did when you were married to the Englishman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never saw my mother or father then.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to look astonished. \u201cDidn\u2019t your husband allow visitations?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see them . . . not then. Shouldn\u2019t we go back now? It\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019ve kept you from your important duties long enough.\u201d</p><p>He frowned with irritation. Johanna wasn\u2019t making any sense at all to him. She\u2019d looked elated when he told her she could return to her mother\u2019s home once a year, yet contradicted herself with the mention that she\u2019d chosen not to see her relatives during the years she\u2019d been married to the baron.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t like half answers. He was going to demand she give him a full explanation now.</p><p>\u201cJohanna,\u201d he began, his voice a low growl. \u201cYou contradict yourself. I don\u2019t like puzzles . . .\u201d</p><p>She unfolded her hands from her lap and reached up to stroke the side of his neck. Her action caught him by surprise, but he refused to be distracted. He took hold of her hand so she wouldn\u2019t interrupt him again and continued, \u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t like . . .\u201d</p><p>She patted the opposite side of his neck with her other hand.</p><p>Gabriel was distracted. He let out a sigh over his own lack of discipline, grabbed her other hand, pulled her close, and kissed her.</p><p>He thought only to taste her, but her enthusiastic response made him hungry for more. He became more demanding. His mouth slanted over hers, and his tongue warred with hers in mock loveplay.</p><p>She wanted more. She pulled her hands away from his grasp and wrapped them around his neck. Her fingers threaded through his hair, and she moved restlessly against him, trying to get closer.</p><p>Her sweet response to his touch made him want to forget himself. It took extreme strength of will to pull back. He closed his eyes so he wouldn\u2019t be tempted by her sexy mouth and let out a loud growl of frustration.</p><p>\u201cNow is not the time, wife.\u201d His voice was hard.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Her voice was whisper soft.</p><p>\u201cThe dangers here . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the dangers . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must think me shameless to try to pull you away from your important responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you are,\u201d he agreed with a grin.</p><p>The man was driving her to distraction. His hand was caressing the side of her thigh as he listed all the reasons why they should immediately return to the holding.</p><p>She was having difficulty paying attention to what he was saying to her. Little things kept getting in the way. His clean male scent for one. Gabriel smelled like the outdoors. It was most appealing.</p><p>So was his voice. It was deep and vibrant. She wasn\u2019t intimidated by the gruffness in his tone. \u2019Twas the truth she found it arousing.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>His hand moved up higher on her thigh. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you about important decisions I\u2019d made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may tell me later, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAre there wolves here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe horses will give us sufficient warning. Your skin feels like silk.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back just a little so she could kiss his chin. His hand moved to the junction of her thighs. She instinctively parted them. He cupped her softness and began to stroke her while his kiss turned wet and hot.</p><p>Disrobing was awkward and frustrating as well because it took so long, and the ties holding her skirts together knotted when she tugged on them. Gabriel took over the task. He was just as inept, but stronger. He tore the satin slip apart.</p><p>Gabriel suddenly became impatient. He couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He forced her to straddle his hips, lifted her up, and then made himself stop.</p><p>\u201cTake me inside,\u201d he commanded, his voice a hoarse whisper. He wanted to shout now but said instead, \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, wife.\u201d</p><p>She gripped her husband\u2019s shoulders with her hands and slowly lowered herself on top of him. They stared into each other\u2019s eyes until Gabriel was fully imbedded inside her.</p><p>The pleasure was almost unbearable. She squeezed her eyes shut and let out a little whimper. When she moved forward to kiss him, she felt a hot rush of ecstasy. She deliberately moved again.</p><p>God, her slow, teasing motions drove him wild. He grabbed hold of her h*ps and showed her what he wanted her to do. Their lovemaking became frantic. Both lost control. Gabriel found fulfillment before she did but helped her gain her own when he slipped his hand down between their joined bodies and stroked her. She tightened all around him and buried her face in the crook of his neck. She whispered his name with a sob as her orgasm consumed her.</p><p>Gabriel held her close for several minutes, then nudged her chin up and kissed her hard. His tongue mated with hers in a lazy fashion. And then he pulled away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t give her much time to recover. He kissed her once again and told her to get dressed. The day, he declared, was wasting away.</p><p>She tried not to be hurt by his attitude. She wanted to linger but knew his duties still waited for him.</p><p>They washed in the stream, dressed, and walked side by side to their mounts.</p><p>\u201cYou will not go out alone again, Johanna. I forbid it.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t agree or disagree with that instruction. He gave her a hard look before lifting her onto her horse. Johanna adjusted the strap of her carrier on her shoulders, slipped the bow over her arm, and then took the reins from his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhen we return to the holding, you will rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have told you to,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood to argue with him. She wasn\u2019t about to let him leave in such a brittle mood either. \u201cGabriel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy our time together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask me such a question? It should be obvious to you I enjoyed touching you.\u201d</p><p>After giving her that backhanded bit of praise, he walked over to his mount and gained the saddle.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t obvious,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cIt should be,\u201d he countered.</p> <p>She wanted compliments, he supposed. His mind immediately went blank. He wasn\u2019t any good at small talk or wooing. Still, the forlorn look on her face told him she was in need of more praise. He didn\u2019t want their interlude to end with her looking dejected.</p><p>\u201cYou made me forget my duties.\u201d</p><p>There, that statement of fact would surely convince her how tempting she was to him.</p><p>It sounded like an accusation to her. \u201cI apologize, Gabriel. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was giving you a compliment, you daft woman.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>Apparently she didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cOf course it was a compliment. A laird doesn\u2019t often forget his duties. Such ill discipline would cause havoc, and so, you see, I was indeed giving you a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost compliments aren\u2019t given in a roar, m\u2019lord. That may have been the reason I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted. She didn\u2019t know what that rude sound was supposed to mean. The discussion was over, however. Gabriel slapped her horse\u2019s left flank to get her moving.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak to her again until they reached the stables. Then he reminded her he wanted her to rest.</p><p>\u201cWhy must I rest? I\u2019m not decrepit, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish you to become ill.\u201d</p><p>The set of his jaw told her it was pointless to argue with him. She was too irritated to let the topic go, however. \u201cYou\u2019re being unreasonable. I don\u2019t wish to stay in bed all day. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted her to the ground, then took hold of her hand and dragged her back toward the keep. \u201cI would allow you to sit by the fire in the hall. You may even sew if you\u2019re so inclined.\u201d</p><p>The picture he painted in his mind appealed to him. He smiled just thinking about Johanna doing such feminine things.</p><p>She was glaring up at him. He was so surprised by her reaction to his suggestion, he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou have very specific ideas about how I should spend my days, m\u2019lord. I wonder where you came up with them. Did your mother often sit by the fire and sew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did she fill her days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith backbreaking work. She died when I was very young.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face and his tone of voice told her he didn\u2019t want her to pursue the topic. He was obviously sensitive about his childhood. The simple comment had told her quite a bit about how his mind worked, however. Backbreaking work had killed his mother . . . and wasn\u2019t that the reason Gabriel wanted her to rest her days away?</p><p>She knew she shouldn\u2019t question him further, but curiosity overrode caution. \u201cDid you love your mother?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. She tried a different question. \u201cWho raised you after she died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one and everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d increased his stride as though trying to run away from her inquisition. He stopped suddenly and turned to her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to understand. Go inside, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>Her husband could be very rude when he wanted to be. He dismissed her from his thoughts without a single glance back to see if she was going to obey his orders.</p><p>Johanna stood on the steps for several minutes thinking about her husband. She wanted to understand him. She was his wife now. and it was therefore important that she know what made him happy and what pricked his temper. Once she\u2019d established those facts, she would know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cWhat has you frowning so, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>Johanna jumped a foot, then turned to smile at Keith. \u201cYou startled me,\u201d she admitted, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d the Maclaurin warrior replied. \u201cI noticed you looked upset, and I wondered if I could do something to improve your mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about your laird,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe\u2019s a complicated man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he is,\u201d Keith agreed.</p><p>\u201cI would like to understand how his mind works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cDirect questions don\u2019t work,\u201d she remarked. \u201cStill, there\u2019s more than one way into a castle.\u201d</p><p>Keith misunderstood. \u201cAye, there are two entrances, three if you count the pathway through the cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to this holding.\u201d she explained. \u201cI meant that there is always more than one way to get what you want. Do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are still just two entrances to the keep, m\u2019lady,\u201d Keith stubbornly insisted.</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cNever mind, Keith.\u201d</p><p>The soldier turned the topic. \u201cWill you go walking with Auggie this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she replied. She hurried up the steps to go inside. Keith rushed ahead of her to pull the doors open.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s Thursday, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d blurted out the reminder. She smiled. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d she agreed. \u201cPlease excuse me. I want to check on Dumfries,\u201d she added when the soldier stayed by her side. She assumed he wanted to know what her plans were. She really needed to find a way to convince Gabriel she didn\u2019t need an escort. Both Keith and Calum were driving her daft following her around. She\u2019d had to resort to sneakery in order to go riding this morning, but she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to pull that trick again. They were on to her now. Besides, using deceit to get what she wanted wasn\u2019t very honorable.</p><p>Johanna removed her carrier from her back and put the pouch with her bow and arrows in the corner by the steps.</p><p>\u201cThen you knew it was Thursday all the while?\u201d Keith asked.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it, sir. Is it important?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou should be wearing the Maclaurin colors today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should. But yesterday . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wore the MacBain plaid, m\u2019lady. I specifically remember.\u201d</p><p>She could tell the soldier found her error distressing. \u201cIt\u2019s important I remember, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to insult either clan, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019ll try to remember in future, and I do thank you for pointing out my mistake. I shall go upstairs immediately and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the day\u2019s half done, m\u2019lady. You might as well keep the MacBain plaid on. You could wear the Maclaurin colors tomorrow and the day after. That would right the insult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should wear the MacBain colors every other day, Keith. It\u2019s unacceptable for MacBain\u2019s wife to wear your colors two days in a row.\u201d</p><p>Calum made that announcement from the doorway. Johanna started to agree with his suggestion, but Keith\u2019s expression changed her mind. Since he looked more irritated than Calum, she decided to agree with him.</p><p>Neither soldier was particularly interested in her opinion or agreement however.</p><p>\u201cCalum, I believe Keith is correct when he ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will not wear your clan\u2019s colors two days in a row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d Keith countered with a glare. \u201cShe wants to get along, Calum. You would do well to follow her example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a change of heart, isn\u2019t it? You said not an hour ago you wished she\u2019d stay where she was put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant no insult. It would make my task easier if she would let me know where she . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is looking after one woman, a tiny one at that, a difficult task? And while I\u2019m thinking about it, since when do you decide where she stays? I believe, since she\u2019s a MacBain now, it\u2019s my duty to put her where . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to put me anywhere.\u201d</p><p>The soldiers ignored her protest. They were fully involved in their heated argument. She\u2019d started out with the thought to placate the men. Now she wanted to throttle both of them.</p><p>Johanna reminded herself that she had vowed to get along with everyone in the clan, even mule-headed commanders. Since they were ignoring her, she slowly backed away. They didn\u2019t notice. She turned then and hurried down the steps and went over to the hearth where Dumfries was resting.</p><p>\u201cThe Highlanders have peculiar notions about everything, Dumfries,\u201d she whispered. She knelt down and patted the dog. \u201cWhy would grown men care what their women wore? I can see you don\u2019t have any answers. Quit your growling. I\u2019m going to look under your bandages to make certain you\u2019re healing properly. I won\u2019t hurt you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The injury was healing nicely. Dumfries was thumping his tail by the time she\u2019d finished readjusting his bandage and giving him a bit of praise.</p><p>Keith and Calum had taken their argument outside. Johanna went upstairs, changed into the Maclaurin plaid, and then returned to the great hall to help with the preparations for dinner. Fortunately Leila and Megan were assigned the duty today. The other women wouldn\u2019t listen to her. Janice, a pretty woman with reddish blond hair, was the worst offender. She would turn her back on Johanna in the middle of her request and walk away. Kathleen was another Maclaurin with a negative attitude toward her mistress. Johanna wasn\u2019t certain how she was going to change the women\u2019s behavior, but she was determined to try.</p><p>Leila and Megan were exceptions to the Maclaurins\u2019 united rule of ignoring her. They seemed eager to assist her. Their acceptance of her as their mistress made her like them all the more.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you wish done, m\u2019lady?\u201d Leila asked.</p><p>\u201cI would like you to fetch a skirt full of wildflowers for the tables,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cMegan, you and I will put linens on the tables and put the trenchers out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hall\u2019s looking fit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Megan remarked.</p><p>Johanna agreed. It smelled clean, too. The scent of pine mingled with the fresh outdoors aroma of the rushes on the floor. The hall was large enough to hold at least fifty warriors. It was sparsely furnished, though. She was just noticing that fact when two soldiers came down the stairs carrying two tall-backed chairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019ll be putting those?\u201d Megan demanded.</p><p>\u201cBy the hearth,\u201d one of the men replied. \u201cWe\u2019re following our laird\u2019s directions.\u201d</p><p>Megan frowned. She flipped the white linen cloth over the table and bent to smooth the material. \u201cI wonder why . . .\u201d</p><p>Johanna interrupted. She took hold of the other end of the cloth and pulled it down to the opposite end of the long table. \u201cHe wants me to sew by the fire,\u201d she explained. She let out a sigh then. The soldiers carried the chairs across the room. Dumfries started growling. The men were both young, and both were obviously a little intimidated by the hound\u2019s bluster. They altered their directions to make a wider path around the dog.</p><p>Johanna was sympathetic to their fear. She considered telling them Dumfries wouldn\u2019t hurt them, then changed her mind. The soldiers would be embarrassed if she let them know she was aware of their discomfort. She pretended to be too busy adjusting the cloth to notice.</p><p>The chairs were placed at an angle in front of the fireplace. The men bowed to their mistress after she\u2019d thanked them and hurried out of the hall.</p><p>The chairs had plump seat and back cushions. One chair, she noticed, was covered with the MacBain plaid; the other, the Maclaurin.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, do you suppose I\u2019ll have to alternate chairs the way I do the plaids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, m\u2019lady?\u201d Megan paused in her task of putting the stack of bread trenchers on the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite make out what you were saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just muttering to myself,\u201d Johanna explained. She took half the stack from Megan and went to set the other table.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it thoughtful of our laird to think about your comforts? As busy as he is, he still thought to have chairs carried in for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Johanna hurriedly agreed, lest Megan think she wasn\u2019t appreciative of her husband\u2019s consideration. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll work on my tapestry tonight. That should please my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good wife to want to please him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Megan, I\u2019m not a very good wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course you are,\u201d Megan countered.</p><p>Gabriel walked inside in time to hear the Maclaurin woman\u2019s remark. He paused at the top step, waiting for his wife to turn around and notice him. She was busy placing trenchers on the table in front of each stool.</p><p>\u201cA good wife is a submissive wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs being submissive a bad thing?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to agree with me,\u201d Johanna replied, trying to make light of the painful topic.</p><p>\u201cYou seem very submissive to me,\u201d Megan announced. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed you ever disagreeing with anyone, m\u2019lady, especially your husband.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cI have tried to do his bidding because he has proven to be considerate of my feelings. It will please him to have me sit by the fire and work on my sewing, and since I do enjoy the task, I will accommodate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good of you, wife.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel drawled out his opinion. Johanna turned around to look at her husband. She blushed with embarrassment. She felt as though she\u2019d just been caught doing something sinful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t being disrespectful, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe you were.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a long minute trying to guess what he was thinking. His expression was contained, and she couldn\u2019t tell if he was angry or amused with her.</p><p>She was a fair sight to him with her face all flushed pink with her embarrassment. She looked worried. For that reason he didn\u2019t smile. It occurred to him that his wife had come a long way since they were married. In just a little under three months, she\u2019d conquered her fear of him. She no longer trembled at the sight of him. She was still too damned timid to suit him, but he hoped, with time and patience, she\u2019d outgrow that flaw.</p> <p>\u201cWas there something you wanted, husband?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a healer here, Johanna. Since you\u2019ve proven handy with a needle and thread, I want you to sew up Calum. He got his arm sliced through by an inexperienced soldier he was trying to train.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was already hurrying toward the steps to fetch her supplies. \u201cI would be happy to help. I\u2019ll just collect the things I\u2019ll need and come right back down. Poor Calum. He must be in terrible pain.\u201d</p><p>Her prediction proved false. When Johanna returned to the great hall, Calum was waiting for her. He was seated on one of the stools and was being bathed in attention by the women surrounding him.</p><p>Leila, Johanna noticed, was most upset by Calum\u2019s condition. She stood on the opposite side of the table pretending to be arranging the flowers she\u2019d collected. Her eyes were misty, and she kept glancing over to look at the soldier. Calum was ignoring her.</p> <p>The Maclaurin woman obviously held affection for the MacBain soldier. She was trying hard not to let her feelings show. Johanna wondered if it was because Calum hadn\u2019t shown any interest in her or if Leila hid her true feelings because she was a Maclaurin and Calum was a MacBain. One thing was certain. Leila was miserable. Johanna knew it wasn\u2019t her place to interfere; but Leila was such a dear woman, she really wanted to try to help.</p><p>Suddenly, another Maclaurin woman came rushing past Johanna.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to sew you up, Calum,\u201d Glynis called out. The woman who\u2019d given Johanna the nickname Courageous was smiling at the soldier. \u201cIt won\u2019t matter to me that you\u2019re a MacBain. I\u2019ll do a fair job all the same.\u201d</p><p>Johanna stiffened her spine and hurried across the room. \u201cPlease move aside,\u201d she ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Calum. Leila? Bring me a stool.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel came back into the hall, saw the crowd, and immediately dismissed them.</p><p>Johanna studied the injury. It was a long, narrow cut that started at Calum\u2019s left shoulder and ended just above his elbow. It was deep enough to require threads to hold it together so it would heal.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it pain you, Calum?\u201d she asked, her voice filled with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cNay, m\u2019lady, not at all.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him. She put her supplies on the table and sat down on the stool next to the soldier. \u201cThen why are you grimacing, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have displeased my laird,\u201d Calum explained in a low whisper. \u201cThe paltry cut is proof to him I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>After giving her his explanation, he glanced back over his shoulder to frown at Leila. She immediately lowered her gaze. Johanna wondered if the soldier held the Maclaurin woman responsible for his inattention.</p><p>Calum didn\u2019t even flinch while she worked on his injury. It took her a long time to clean the cut, but stitching it up didn\u2019t take much time at all. Leila assisted her by tearing long strips of white cotton material to use as a bandage.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Johanna declared when she was finished. \u201cYou\u2019re as good as new, Calum. Don\u2019t get the bandage wet, and please don\u2019t put any strain on my threads by lifting anything heavy. I\u2019ll change the bandage every morning,\u201d she added with a nod.</p><p>\u201cHe can take care of that chore.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel walked over to the hearth. He knelt down on one knee to greet his pet.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to change the bandages, m\u2019lord,\u201d Johanna called out. She moved back so Calum could stand up, then walked around to the other side of the table. Leila had left the flowers in a clutter on the tabletop. Johanna was going to put them in the porcelain vase of water before they started wilting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t contradict my orders, wife.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood up and turned to his soldier. His voice was filled with anger when he ordered him to leave the hall. \u201cGet back to your duties, Calum. You\u2019ve wasted enough time. Leila, stay put. I want to have a word with you before you leave.\u201d</p><p>The harshness in her husband\u2019s voice astonished Johanna. He was obviously furious with the soldier, and some of his anger was spilling over to Leila. The Maclaurin woman looked stricken. Johanna\u2019s heart went out to the woman. She wanted to defend her. She decided she would have to find out what Leila had done to displease her laird first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just instructed Calum not to lift anything heavy, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be working on the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean carrying rock?\u201d She sounded horrified.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He sounded mean.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a flower and stuffed it into the vase. She wasn\u2019t paying any attention to what she was doing. She was fully occupied glaring at her husband.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t being fair, she decided. Her husband just didn\u2019t realize how severe Calum\u2019s injury was. \u201cThe cut was quite deep, m\u2019lord. He shouldn\u2019t be doing any work at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he lost his arm, wife. He will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tear my stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can use one hand or kick the stones for all I care. Leila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird MacBain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not distract my soldiers when they\u2019re at work. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cYes, Laird MacBain. I understand. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that it doesn\u2019t. You may leave now.\u201d</p><p>Leila made a quick curtsy and turned to leave. \u201cDo you wish me to return tomorrow to help your mistress?\u201d</p><p>Johanna was about to say yes. Gabriel beat her with his answer. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary. One of the MacBain women will take over your chores.\u201d</p><p>Leila went running out of the hall. Johanna was infuriated with her husband. She rammed another flower into the vase and shook her head at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve crushed her feelings, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer feelings won\u2019t get her killed,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, Dumfries. It\u2019s time to go outside.\u201d</p><p>Johanna shoved the rest of the flowers into the vase and then hurried over to block her husband\u2019s exit. She stopped just a foot away from him.</p><p>Her hands were settled on her h*ps and her head was tilted all the way back so she could look him in the eye.</p><p>His wife wasn\u2019t acting timid now. God\u2019s truth, there was fire in her eyes. Gabriel was so pleased by the gumption his wife was showing, he felt like grinning.</p><p>He scowled instead. \u201cAre you questioning my motives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I am, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t permitted.\u201d</p><p>She changed her approach. \u201cGiving my opinion is permitted,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my opinion you embarrassed Leila with your criticism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll survive,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>It was difficult but she didn\u2019t back away from his glare. \u201cA good wife would probably let the matter drop,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye, she would.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I\u2019m a very good wife then, Gabriel. I still want to know what Leila did to make you angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe damned near got my soldier killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely not on purpose,\u201d she defended.</p><p>He leaned down until his face was just inches away from hers. \u201cCalum is at fault. He seems to have caught your affliction, wife. He wasn\u2019t paying attention to what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>She straightened her spine. \u201cAre you referring to that little incident I was involved in, husband, when I accidentally walked into the middle of your training session?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rude of you to bring that up,\u201d she announced.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look like he cared if he was being rude or not. \u201cStaying alive is more important than hurt feelings,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>Dumfries interrupted with a loud bark. Gabriel turned, called to his pet, and left the room without sparing his wife a backward glance.</p><p>Johanna thought about the conversation the rest of the afternoon. She knew she probably shouldn\u2019t have interfered in her husband\u2019s decisions regarding his clanspeople. She hadn\u2019t been able to stop herself, though. In the few months she\u2019d been married, she\u2019d grown quite fond of both Calum and Leila.</p><p>In truth, she was surprised by her own behavior. In the past she\u2019d learned not to form any attachments because involvement led to caring, and then her first husband would have yet another weapon to use against her. Her affection for her staff put them in jeopardy.</p><p>Chelsea had been Johanna\u2019s first lesson. She was the cook\u2019s assistant, just about Johanna\u2019s own age, and a very sweet-tempered girl. Raulf knew Johanna enjoyed helping in the kitchens. She mentioned to him how she liked being around Chelsea because the girl had such a quick wit and found pleasure in everything she did.</p><p>Chelsea broke an egg one morning. Cook reported the loss to Raulf. He broke Chelsea\u2019s leg that afternoon. Bishop Hallwick had advised the punishment for such a grievous offense was adequate penance.</p><p>Things were as different as night and day here, however. She could have friends here and not worry about their safety.</p><p>Father MacKechnie joined them for dinner. He looked weary from his journey to and from the Lowlands but was full of news he wanted to share about the latest happenings in England.</p><p>The soldiers were all talking at once, and it was difficult to hear what the priest had to say.</p><p>\u201cPope Innocent is surely going to excommunicate King John,\u201d Father MacKechnie reported in a near shout so he\u2019d be heard. \u201cThe country will soon be put under an interdict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has he done to warrant such harsh treatment?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cJohn was determined to put his own man in the position as archbishop of Canterbury. Our pope wouldn\u2019t have his interference. He announced his choice, an outsider to England, I understand; and John, furious over the selection, gave the order not to allow the man into England.\u201d</p><p>One of the Maclaurin soldiers made a quick jest the other soldiers found vastly amusing. Johanna had to wait until the howling coming from the second table had calmed before speaking again.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen if the country is placed under an interdict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe subjects will suffer, of course. Most of the priests will have to flee from England. No masses will be said, no confessions heard, no marriages performed. The only sacraments Pope Innocent will allow will be baptisms for the innocent newborns and extreme unction for the dying, providing the family can find a priest to administer the sacrament in time. It\u2019s a sorry state of affairs, Lady Johanna, but the king doesn\u2019t seem too upset by such dire circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll probably rob from the churches as a method of getting even.\u201d Gabriel made that speculation. Johanna agreed.</p><p>Father MacKechnie was appalled by the possibility. \u201cHe\u2019ll burn in hell if he does,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cHis soul\u2019s already lost, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot know for certain, lass.\u201d</p><p>Johanna lowered her gaze. \u201cNo, I cannot know for certain.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie changed the subject. \u201cPrince Arthur\u2019s dead,\u201d he announced. \u201cSome think he died at Eastertime four years ago.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie paused. \u201cThere\u2019s talk the prince was murdered.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was watching Johanna now. He noticed her complexion had turned as pale as milk.</p><p>\u201cHe probably was murdered,\u201d Calum said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but the question plaguing the barons is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho killed him,\u201d Calum supplied.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d the priest agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the current speculation?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cMost of the barons believe King John had Arthur killed. He\u2019s denying any knowledge of his nephew\u2019s fate, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king is the only one with a strong motive,\u201d Calum said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Father MacKechnie agreed.</p><p>\u201cA toast to a fair day\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>The shout came from Keith. The Maclaurin soldiers all stood with their goblets in their hands. The MacBain soldiers followed. They met between the two tables, struck their goblets against each other\u2019s, and then downed what was left of the dark ale. Most of the drink had spilled to the floor.</p><p>Johanna excused herself from the table. She went upstairs to collect her bag with her half-completed tapestry, needle, and threads and then returned to the hall. She sat down in one of the chairs and began to work.</p><p>She had just pulled the first stitch through the burlap when she was asked to move.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sitting in the MacBain chair, m\u2019lady,\u201d Keith advised. He stood in front of Johanna with his hands clasped behind his back. Three other Maclaurin soldiers stood behind their commander. They blocked her light, and every one of them looked terribly concerned over what they obviously considered to be a serious slight.</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cIt matters where I sit, doesn\u2019t it, Keith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, m\u2019lady. You\u2019re wearing the Maclaurin colors tonight. You should be sitting on the Maclaurin cushion.\u201d</p><p>The three soldiers flanking their leader immediately nodded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she wanted to laugh at the disgruntled-looking soldiers or shout at them. A hush descended over the group as they waited to see what she would do.</p><p>\u201cLet her sit where she wants to sit.\u201d a MacBain soldier shouted.</p><p>Johanna found the entire situation ludicrous. She peeked around the soldiers to look at her husband, hoping for a bit of guidance. Gabriel was watching her, but he didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to what was going on. He was leaving the decision to her, she supposed.</p><p>She decided to placate the Maclaurins. It was still Thursday, after all. \u201cThank you for your instruction, Keith, and for being so patient with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to sound sincere. She couldn\u2019t quite keep the amusement out of her voice though. The men moved back when she stood up. One even bent down to move her bag of threads for her.</p><p>Johanna walked to the other side of the hearth and sat down in the Maclaurin chair. She adjusted her skirts, tucked in a loose pleat, and then picked up her tapestry again and went back to work.</p><p>Her head was bent to her task. She pretended intense concentration, for the Maclaurins were still watching her. When she heard several grunts that she assumed were rude noises of approval, she had to bite her lower lip so she wouldn\u2019t start laughing.</p><p>Father MacKechnie stayed by Gabriel\u2019s side throughout the rest of the evening. He was catching his laird up on all the latest happenings with the other clans. Johanna found the discussion fascinating. The topic was feuding, and it seemed to her that every clan in the Highlands was currently involved in some sort of an argument. The reasons the priest gave for the warring were even more astonishing to her. Why, the slightest breach or insult set tempers boiling. Sneezing seemed to be enough of a reason to go into battle.</p> <p>\u201cThe Highlanders like to fight, don\u2019t they, Father?\u201d Johanna didn\u2019t look up from her tapestry when she called out her question.</p><p>Father MacKechnie waited until the Maclaurin soldiers had filed out of the hall before answering her. Johanna was pleased to see the men leave. They were so loud and rambunctious, and it was difficult to discuss anything without shouting every word.</p><p>It was blissfully quiet once the men had taken their leave. None of them had bothered to bow to their mistress. She tried not to take offense, for at least they had given her husband that bit of respect.</p><p>She repeated her question to the priest. \u201cAye, they do like to fight,\u201d Father MacKechnie agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that, do you suppose?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s considered honorable,\u201d the priest explained.</p><p>Johanna missed a stitch, frowned, and set about righting the damage. She kept her gaze on her task when she asked her husband if he agreed with the priest.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is honorable,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>She found their opinions daft. \u201cBanging heads together is considered honorable? I can\u2019t imagine why, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled. Johanna\u2019s choice of words, added to her exasperated tone of voice, amused him.</p><p>\u201cFighting lets the Highlanders show off those qualities they most admire, lass,\u201d the priest explained. \u201cCourage, loyalty to their leader, and endurance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo warrior wishes to die in his bed,\u201d Gabriel interjected.</p><p>\u201cThey consider it a sin,\u201d the priest advised.</p><p>She dropped her needle and looked up at the men. She was certain they were jesting with her. They both looked sincere, however. She still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cWhich sin would that be?\u201d she asked, her suspicion apparent.</p><p>\u201cSloth,\u201d Gabriel told her.</p><p>She almost snorted. She caught herself in time. \u201cYou must think me naive to believe that tall tale,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAye, you are naive, Johanna, but we aren\u2019t jesting with you. We do consider it a sin to die in our beds.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head so he\u2019d know she wasn\u2019t believing any of his nonsense, then went back to sewing. The priest continued with his news. Gabriel was having difficulty paying attention. His gaze kept returning to his wife.</p><p>She enchanted him. Contentment such as he\u2019d never known before swelled inside his chest. When he was very young and foolish and all alone, he would fall asleep each night thinking about his future. He made up dreams about the family he would have. His wife and his children would belong only to him, and they would, of course, live in his castle. Gabriel often pictured his wife sitting by the fire doing some feminine task . . . such as sewing.</p> <p>The images he\u2019d conjured up in his mind as a little boy kept the harsh reality of his stark life from overwhelming him. The fantasies helped him survive.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d been terribly young and tender back then. Time and training had toughened him, however, and he\u2019d outgrown the need for such foolish dreams. He no longer felt the need to belong. He\u2019d learned to depend solely upon himself. Dreams were for the weak. Aye, he thought to himself, he was strong now and his dreams were all but forgotten.</p><p>Until now. The memories came flooding back as he stared at his wife.</p><p>Reality was a hell of a lot better than fantasies, Gabriel decided. He\u2019d never imagined having a wife as beautiful as Johanna. He hadn\u2019t known what contentment was or how he would feel or how fierce his need would become to protect her.</p><p>Johanna happened to look up and caught her husband staring at her. His expression puzzled her. He seemed to be staring through her as though he was lost in some important thought. Aye, he must be thinking about something troublesome, she guessed, because his frown had become ferocious.</p><p>\u201cI could use a spot of uisgebreatha,\u201d Father MacKechnie announced. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be looking for my bed. Lord, I\u2019m weary tonight.\u201d</p><p>Johanna immediately got up to serve the priest. A jug filled with Highland brew was kept on the chest against the wall behind Gabriel. She carried the jug over to the table and filled the priest\u2019s goblet.</p><p>She turned to serve her husband next. Gabriel declined the drink with a shake of his head.</p><p>Father MacKechnie took a long swallow and promptly grimaced. \u201cI\u2019d wager this hasn\u2019t aged more than a week at most,\u201d he complained. \u201cIt tastes like sour swill.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to complain to Auggie. The drink came from his kettles.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s curiosity was captured by the priest\u2019s remark about aging. \u201cIs it important how long the drink waits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ages, lass,\u201d the priest corrected. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t wait. And yes, it\u2019s important. The longer, the better, some experts say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWhy, as long as ten or twelve years in the oak barrels,\u201d Father MacKechnie speculated. \u201cIt takes a patient man to wait that long for a taste, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the drink more valuable then?\u201d</p><p>Johanna put the jug down on the table. She stood next to her husband\u2019s side while she waited for the priest to finish his drink and answer her.</p><p>She put her hand on Gabriel\u2019s shoulder. Her gaze was intent upon the priest, and Gabriel doubted she was even aware she was touching him. The unconscious show of affection pleased him considerably, for it was proof to him that she\u2019d completely conquered her fear of him. And that, he decided, was an important first step. He was out to gain her trust. Oh, he remembered demanding she give him her trust, but he\u2019d realized right after giving her that high-handed order that trust would have to be earned. Gabriel believed he was a patient man. He would wait. In time she would realize her good fortune and value his protection. She would learn to trust him, and with that trust came loyalty.</p><p>A man couldn\u2019t ask for anything more from his wife.</p><p>The priest pulled him away from his thoughts when he said, \u201cThe drink is very valuable once it\u2019s been allowed to age. Men would kill for pure uisgebreatha. The Highlanders, you see, take their drinking seriously. \u2019Tis the reason they call it the water of life, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould they barter for goods if aged brew was offered in trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna, why does this topic interest you?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>She shrugged. She didn\u2019t want to tell him about the barrels of liquid gold Auggie had mentioned to her. She would have to gain permission from her friend first. She also wanted to see for herself that the barrels were still inside the cave. Besides, it would be a nice surprise for Gabriel; and if the value was as high as Johanna guessed, her husband would have something to barter with for supplies.</p><p>\u201cFather, would you honor us by taking over the vacant chamber upstairs tonight?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>The priest turned his gaze to his laird. He waited for him to extend his invitation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a comfortable bed, Father,\u201d Gabriel remarked.</p><p>Father MacKechnie smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s most hospitable of you to open your home to me.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie stood up, bowed to his laird, and then went to collect his things. Johanna walked back over to her chair, gathered her tapestry and needle and put them back inside her bag. Gabriel waited for her near the entrance.</p><p>\u201cYou may leave your sewing on the chair, wife. No one will bother it.\u201d</p><p>Dumfries came back into the hall, passed Johanna on her way to the stairs, and growled at her. She patted the hound before continuing on.</p><p>Gabriel followed Johanna up the stairs. She seemed preoccupied with her thoughts while she prepared for bed. He added a log to the fire, then stood up, leaned against the mantel, and watched her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis and that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a proper answer, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about my life here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made the transition without much difficulty,\u201d he remarked. \u201cYou should be happy.\u201d</p><p>Johanna tied the belt to her robe and turned to her husband. \u201cI haven\u2019t made any transition, Gabriel. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ve been living in limbo. I\u2019ve been caught between two worlds,\u201d she added with a nod.</p><p>Her husband sat down on the side of the bed and pulled his boots off.</p><p>\u201cI meant to talk to you about this topic earlier today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there didn\u2019t seem to be enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what is it you\u2019re trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and all the others have been treating me like a visitor, Gabriel. Worse, I\u2019ve been acting like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna, you aren\u2019t making any sense. I don\u2019t take strangers to my bed. You\u2019re my wife, not a visitor.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to the fire. She was thoroughly disgusted with herself. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019ve realized? In my bid to protect myself, I\u2019ve become completely self-consumed. I\u2019ll have to go to confession tomorrow and beg God\u2019s forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no need to worry about protecting yourself. It\u2019s my duty to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled in spite of her irritation. Gabriel sounded insulted.</p><p>\u201cNo, it is my duty to take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like hearing her opinion. His scowl was as hot as the fire. \u201cDo you deliberately try to rile me by suggesting I can\u2019t take care of you?\u201d</p><p>She hurried to soothe him. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to have your protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou contradict yourself, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to confuse you, Gabriel. I\u2019m just trying to sort things out in my mind. When someone\u2019s hungry and there isn\u2019t any food, well then that someone is consumed day and night with the worry of finding something to eat. Isn\u2019t that true, husband?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cI would imagine so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a long time I\u2019ve been consumed with fear. I lived with it for so long, it seemed to take control of me, but now that I\u2019m safe, I\u2019ve had time to think about other matters. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. He didn\u2019t like seeing her frown either. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, you please me. You needn\u2019t be worried.\u201d</p><p>She was exasperated. Since she was turned away from her husband, she felt it safe to smile. \u201cGabriel, as surprising as this may be for you to hear, I\u2019m not overly concerned about pleasing you.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised all right as well as irritated. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIt is therefore your duty to want to please me.\u201d</p><p>Johanna let out a sigh. She knew her husband didn\u2019t understand what she was trying to explain. She couldn\u2019t fault him. She barely understood herself.</p><p>\u201cI meant no insult, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>She sounded sincere. Gabriel was appeased. He came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. Then he leaned down to kiss the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed now. I want you, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, too, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and smiled at her husband. He lifted her into his arms and carried her to bed.</p><p>They made slow, sweet love to each other, and when they each had found their fulfillment, they held each other close.</p><p>\u201cYou do please me, woman.\u201d His voice was gruff with affection.</p><p>\u201cRemember your praise, m\u2019lord, for I\u2019m certain there will be times in future when I don\u2019t please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a worry or a prophecy?\u201d</p><p>She leaned up on her elbow and gently stroked the side of his neck. \u201cNay, I give you only the truth.\u201d</p><p>She turned his attention with her question about his intentions for tomorrow. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to discussing his plans with anyone, but he was in the mood to make her happy and so he went into detail about the hunt he planned and the items he and his men planned to steal.</p><p>She vowed not to lecture him. She couldn\u2019t keep silent more than a few minutes, though, and hurled herself into a speech about the merits of probity. She mentioned the wrath of God on Judgment Day. Gabriel wasn\u2019t impressed with her speech about fire and brimstone. He yawned in the middle of it.</p><p>\u201cHusband, it\u2019s my duty to help you lead a good, honest life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll get to heaven, of course.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. She gave up. She fell asleep worrying about her husband\u2019s soul.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>The first thing Johanna noticed when she came downstairs the following morning was her tapestry. The half-completed wall hanging had been ripped to shreds. Her bag wasn\u2019t intact either. The culprit was busy chewing on one of the burlap straps. He\u2019d already devoured the other one.</p><p>Dumfries knew he\u2019d gotten into mischief. He tried to crawl under one of the chairs when she shouted his name and started toward him. The chair went crashing to the ground; Dumfries started howling, and Megan came running from the buttery.</p><p>The dog sounded like a demon let out of hell. The frightening sound he made was loud enough to shake the rafters. The noise terrified Megan. Even though the hound wasn\u2019t paying her any attention, she was still extremely cautious when she bent to pick up the tapestry.</p><p>Keith and Calum both heard the commotion and came running inside. They came to a dead stop on the top step. Gabriel was right behind them. He shoved the soldiers out of the way and started down the steps.</p><p>Johanna was involved in a tug of war with Dumfries. The dog was winning. She was trying to get her bag out of his mouth. She was concerned the hound would choke on the strap he was trying to swallow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood God, Megan, what have you done to your lady\u2019s tapestry?\u201d Keith demanded when he finally figured out what she was holding in her hands. He scowled at the Maclaurin woman and shook his head.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t take her attention away from the hound when she called out to Keith. \u201cSir, you do honestly believe Megan ate the thing?\u201d</p><p>Calum started laughing. Johanna lost her footing and went flying backward. Gabriel caught her. He lifted her out of his way and turned to his pet. Johanna ran around her husband to stand in front of the hound.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, don\u2019t you dare strike your dog.\u201d</p> <p>She shouted her command so she\u2019d be heard over Calum\u2019s laughter. Gabriel looked like he wanted to shout at her.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of striking him. Get out of my way, woman, and quit wringing your hands. I\u2019m not going to hurt him. Dumfries, quit that damned howling.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t move. Gabriel lifted her out of his way, then knelt down on one knee and forced the dog\u2019s mouth open so he could pull the strap free. Dumfries didn\u2019t want to let go. He yelped in protest before he gave in.</p><p>Gabriel wouldn\u2019t let her comfort the dog. He stood up, grabbed her by the shoulders, and demanded she kiss him good-bye.</p><p>\u201cIn front of your men?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He nodded. She started to blush. His mouth captured hers in a long, lingering kiss. She sighed then. She was a bit rattled when he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, wife. You should rest.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel made the remark on his way to the doors. She chased after him.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be serious, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always serious, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I only just got out of bed. Surely you don\u2019t expect me to take a nap now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do expect you to rest,\u201d he called over his shoulder. \u201cAnd change your plaid, Johanna. You\u2019re wearing the wrong one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Friday, m\u2019lady.\u201d Calum added the reminder.</p><p>She let out a loud, unladylike sigh. Megan waited until the men had left, then hurried over to her mistress. \u201cDo go inside and sit down, Lady Johanna. You don\u2019t want to overdo.\u201d</p><p>Johanna felt like screaming. She resisted the urge. \u201cFor the love of . . . Megan, do I look ill to you?\u201d</p><p>The Maclaurin woman studied her closely before shaking her head. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth you look fit to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to sit down and rest?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d Megan answered. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Johanna muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s high time I took an interest in the running of this household. I\u2019ve been entirely too self-consumed. All that\u2019s going to change, however. Starting now.\u201d</p> <p>Megan had never seen her mistress sound so commanding. \u201cBut, m\u2019lady, your husband has ordered you to rest.\u201d</p><p>Johanna shook her head. She rattled off the list of chores she wanted to complete by nightfall, gave Megan permission to enlist the help of two more servants, and then announced she was going to speak to Cook about dinner.</p><p>\u201cPlease fetch my bow and arrows from my chamber,\u201d Johanna requested. She started toward the back of the keep. \u201cIf Cook\u2019s in an accommodating mood, we\u2019ll have rabbit stew for dinner. I\u2019m certain I can cajole Auggie into doing a spot of hunting with me. I\u2019ll be back before the nooning hour, Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go hunting, m\u2019lady. Your husband forbade you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d Johanna countered. \u201cHe merely suggested I rest. He never once mentioned hunting, now did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he meant . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to second-guess your laird. And quit your worrying. I promise I\u2019ll be back before I\u2019m missed.\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t get ten paces outside before you\u2019re spotted by Keith . . . or is it Calum responsible for looking out for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m praying each believes the other has that duty.\u201d</p><p>She hurried out the back door, turned left, and crossed the courtyard to the building housing the kitchen. She introduced herself to Cook and added an apology for taking so long to make her acquaintance. Cook\u2019s name was Hilda. She was an older woman with streaks of gray in her red hair. She wore the MacBain plaid. She seemed appreciative of Johanna\u2019s interest in her duties and took her on a tour of the pantry.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m lucky on my hunt and snare some rabbits, would you be willing to prepare them for our dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>Hilda nodded. \u201cI make a fine rabbit stew,\u201d Hilda boasted. \u201cBut I\u2019ll need at least ten, unless they\u2019re plump. Then nine will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish me good hunting then,\u201d Johanna called out. She hurried back to the great hall, took her bow and arrows from Megan, and then left by the back door again.</p><p>She took the long way around to the stables. Sean didn\u2019t want to saddle her horse for her. She coaxed him into the duty with a smile and a promise not to leave the meadow. She implied she had Gabriel\u2019s permission. It wasn\u2019t an outright lie, just a little fabrication, but she still felt guilty.</p><p>She had another mare made ready for Auggie. It was presumptuous on her part to assume he would agree to ride with her, she supposed, but she didn\u2019t want to waste any time. If Auggie did go with her, she didn\u2019t want to have to go back to the stables. Keith or Calum would surely try to stop her then.</p><p>Auggie was lining up his shot in the center of the meadow when Johanna interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to go hunting for rabbits.\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be more agreeable.\u201d Johanna countered. \u201cAnd while we were looking for our rabbits, I thought you might be inclined to show me exactly where the cave is hidden. I couldn\u2019t find it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Auggie shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll ride as far as the ridge with you, girl, and point the direction once again, but that\u2019s as much time as I\u2019m willing to take away from my game.\u201d</p><p>Auggie climbed up on the horse, took the reins from Johanna, and led the way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like your permission to tell my husband about the barrels of liquid gold,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt weren\u2019t a secret I was keeping, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to share the brew with your laird? He could use it to barter for supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drink belongs to my laird. I owe my life to MacBain, but you wouldn\u2019t be knowing about that. Most of the MacBains pledged their loyalty for good reason. He gave them their pride back. I won\u2019t be denying him anything, least of all Highland brew. Why, I\u2019d even quit my game if he asked me to,\u201d he added with a dramatic nod.</p><p>Auggie stopped at the top of the ridge and pointed to the line of trees angling down the north side. He told Johanna to start counting the trees, starting at the base of the hill with the crooked pine and working her way back up. She reached the number twelve when he stopped her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the break you\u2019re looking for, between those trees,\u201d he instructed. \u201cYou were taking the wider path higher up when you went looking, weren\u2019t you, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she replied. \u201cWill you please reconsider and come along with me?\u201d</p><p>Auggie declined her invitation a second time. \u201cLet the younger soldiers trail you, Johanna. And don\u2019t be telling the Maclaurins about the liquid gold. Let our laird decide what he wants to do with the treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the Maclaurins are part of our clan now, Auggie,\u201d she argued.</p><p>The old MacBain warrior snorted. \u201cThey keep their noses up in the air around us,\u201d he said. \u201cThink they\u2019re so high and mighty, they do. None of them were cast out, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Johanna countered. \u201cI was told they begged my husband to give them aid against the English and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Auggie interrupted. \u201cHis father was the Laird Maclaurin. \u2019Course he never acknowledged his bastard son, not even when death was waiting on his last breath. The Maclaurins have conveniently forgotten MacBain\u2019s a bastard. They know he\u2019s got Maclaurin blood in him, I suppose. Still, they don\u2019t have any use for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Johanna shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll wager the MacBain soldiers fought by their leader\u2019s side during the battle to save the Maclaurins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d win a fair amount then, for it\u2019s true, we did fight with our laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the Maclaurins forgotten that fact?\u201d</p><p>She was getting riled over the Maclaurins\u2019 attitude and trying not to let it show. Auggie smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re outraged for the MacBains, aren\u2019t you, girl? You\u2019re making yourself one of us.\u201d</p><p>The sparkle in Auggie\u2019s handsome eyes made her smile. His praise and his opinion of her were both important. In the short time she\u2019d known him, she\u2019d come to value his friendship . . . and his guidance. Auggie took the time to listen to her. \u2019Twas the truth no one else did. He never told her to rest either, she thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cNow what has you scowling?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was just considering my circumstances,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cAgain? You\u2019ll give yourself a pounding headache thinking about your circumstances all the time. Good hunting, Johanna,\u201d he added with a nod. He turned his mount and headed back to his meadow.</p><p>Johanna rode in the opposite direction. She\u2019d almost reached the path Auggie had shown her when a whitehaired rabbit came racing into the clearing. She tucked the reins under her left knee, reached for an arrow, secured it in her bow and took aim. The rabbit went down just as another came loping across her path.</p><p>Something must have spooked the animals into leaving their hiding places, for in less than twenty minutes, she\u2019d collected eight plump ones and one rather scrawny one. She stopped at the stream, washed her arrows, and put them back in her pouch. The rabbits were tied by a string to the back of her saddle.</p><p>Three Maclaurin soldiers caught up with her just as she was heading back for home. They were young warriors and probably still in training, she supposed, because none of them had any scars on his face or arms. Two of the men had blond hair. The third soldier was dark haired with clear green eyes.</p><p>\u201cOur laird will be unhappy to know you\u2019re riding alone, m\u2019lady,\u201d said one of the fair-haired soldiers. Johanna pretended she hadn\u2019t heard him. She untied the string from her saddle and handed the rabbits to the soldier.</p><p>\u201cWill you please take these back to Cook? She\u2019ll be waiting for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiall,\u201d the soldier answered. He motioned to the other blond young man and said, \u201cHe\u2019s called Lindsay. Michael\u2019s behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet all of you,\u201d Johanna announced. \u201cDo excuse me now. I\u2019m intent on following this trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for something,\u201d Johanna said, deliberately giving the soldier only a half answer. \u201cI won\u2019t be gone long. \u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes our laird know what you\u2019re about?\u201d Michael asked her the question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember if I mentioned my plan or not,\u201d she blatantly lied.</p><p>Niall turned to his companions. \u201cStay with our mistress while I take her bounty back to the keep.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was happy for their escort. She turned her attention back to her task and led the way through the forest. The trail narrowed and then became broken bits with bushes barring her way. Sunlight filtered through the limbs of branches arched above her like a lush canopy. The young soldiers smiled over her whispered praise of the beauty surrounding her.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t in church, m\u2019lady,\u201d Michael shouted. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any need to lower your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what is it you\u2019re looking for?\u201d Lindsay asked.</p><p>\u201cA cave\u201d Johanna answered.</p><p>The path split into two directions. Johanna turned her mount to the left, then ordered the soldiers to take the other direction. Neither soldier would leave her side, however.</p><p>\u201cThen please mark this spot so that when we backtrack, we\u2019ll remember which direction we haven\u2019t taken yet.\u201d</p><p>She untied the ribbon holding her braid together and handed it to Michael. The soldier was in the process of securing the blue strip to one of the low-hanging branches when Johanna\u2019s mare started misbehaving. Rachel\u2019s ears flattened, and she let out a loud snort as she pranced to the side of the path. Johanna tightened her hold on her reins and ordered the mare to behave.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s frightening her,\u201d she remarked. She glanced back over her shoulder to see what might have startled her mare. Then Michael\u2019s horse caught Rachel\u2019s frenzy and reared up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best get back to the clearing,\u201d Lindsay suggested. He was diligently struggling to keep his own horse under control.</p><p>Johanna was in agreement with the suggestion. She nudged Rachael with her knees and tried to get the mare to turn.</p><p>Rachael suddenly bolted. Johanna only had enough time to duck her head when her horse broke through the bushes. The mare wouldn\u2019t be calmed. Johanna had her hands full trying to control the animal and block the branches at the same time.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine what had caused the sudden tantrum. One of the soldiers shouted to her. She couldn\u2019t make out the words, however. Rachael veered to the left and continued on, in a full gallop now. She heard another shout, turned to look back over her shoulder but couldn\u2019t see the soldiers. She turned around again and put her hand in front of her face to block yet another branch. She wasn\u2019t able to push the obstacle aside. Johanna was literally plucked from her saddle. She went flying to the side and ended up underneath a leafy bush. The breath was knocked out of her. She let out a low groan and sat up. Part of the bush sprang away from her leg and slapped her in the face. She muttered an unladylike expletive and stood up. She tried to rub the sting out of her backside.</p><p>She kept expecting Lindsay and Michael to come to her assistance. Her mare was nowhere in sight. The forest was quiet now, eerily so, and she assumed the soldiers had taken a different turn. They were probably still chasing after her horse. She would have to wait until they caught up with Rachael and realized their mistress was missing. Then they would surely backtrack to look for her.</p><p>Johanna collected her bow and arrows and went over to sit on a low boulder to wait for the soldiers. The musty scent of peat and fresh pine needles filled the air. Johanna waited a long while before deciding she was going to have to walk back to the clearing. She wasn\u2019t quite certain of the direction, for her horse had turned several times during her run. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably walk in circles for the rest of the day,\u201d Johanna muttered.</p><p>Gabriel was going to be furious with her, too. She couldn\u2019t fault him, she supposed. It wasn\u2019t safe to go strolling through the forest, especially with wild animals roaming about.</p><p>She notched an arrow to her bow just as a precaution and started walking. A good fifteen minutes later, she thought she was back where she\u2019d started. Then she changed her mind. The boulder in front of her was much larger than the one she\u2019d sat on. She believed she was going in the right direction after all and started walking again.</p><p>She found the cave quite by accident. She had stopped in front of another large boulder blocking her path and was trying to decide if she would go to the left or the right. The opening was on her left and was as tall as she was. It was flanked on both sides by tall, narrow trees.</p> <p>Johanna was so excited about her find, she forgot caution. She literally ran inside. The corridor was lit by sunlight filtering through the cracks in the ceiling. When she reached the end of the pathway, the cave opened into a room the size of the great hall at the keep. On her left were narrow shelves of rock protruding from the wall that resembled broken steps. On her right were the barrels. There were at least twenty of the round casks, perhaps more. The chieftains who\u2019d stored them inside had placed them on their sides. The bottom ones rested on rock. The barrels formed a pyramid that reached the top of the cavern.</p><p>Time hadn\u2019t rotted the oak. It was actually quite dry inside the cavern.</p><p>Johanna was thrilled with the find. She wanted to run all the way back to the keep and demand that Gabriel come and see the treasure.</p><p>She\u2019d have to wait until her husband returned from his day of hunting, she remembered. She let out a sigh then. \u201cCall a dog a dog, Gabriel,\u201d she muttered to herself. He wasn\u2019t hunting. He was stealing. Aye, it was a day of thievery, she thought to herself, but certainly his last, for come hell or heaven she was going to make him learn the fine art of bartering.</p><p>Aye, she was going to save his sorry soul whether he wanted her to or not.</p> <p>Johanna went back outside to wait for the soldiers to fetch her. She walked over to the boulder and climbed up on top. She leaned against the trunk of a giant tree, folded her arms across her middle, and waited.</p><p>The soldiers were certainly taking their time. A good hour passed before her impatience got the better of her. She guessed she was going to have to find her owr way back home.</p><p>Johanna pulled away from the tree, adjusted her bow on her shoulder, and was just about to jump down from the boulder when she heard a snarling sound coming from the bushes directly in front of her. She froze. The noise intensified. The horrid sound reminded her of Dumfries, but she knew it wasn\u2019t Gabriel\u2019s pet. He was at the keep. It had to be a wolf making all the commotion.</p><p>Then she saw the eyes staring up at her. They were yellow. Johanna didn\u2019t scream. Dear God, she wanted to. She wanted to run, too, but she didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>Another rustling sound came from across the tiny clearing ... another pair of murky yellow eyes staring at her. The snarling echoed around her now. She heard a movement behind her and knew then she was surrounded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any idea how many wolves were there, waiting to prey upon her. She didn\u2019t panic. There simply wasn\u2019t time for that frivolity.</p> <p>She found out something amazing about herself. too. She could fly. God\u2019s truth, she was certain she flew up the branches of the tree. She certainly didn\u2019t remember climbing. She\u2019d almost made it to safety, too, when one clever wolf caught hold of the hem of her plaid. He was in a frenzy to pull her back. His jaws were locked on the material, his head shaking back and forth with his determination. Johanna was draped over a branch, holding her hand over the top of her carrier so her arrows wouldn\u2019t spill to the ground and clutching the tree with her other hand. It was a precarious position. Her feet were only inches above the wolf\u2019s teeth.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare look down. She wrapped her legs around the branch and tried to undo her belt so she wouldn\u2019t be trapped by the plaid. It took her long minutes and when she was finished, she let the material drop down to the wolves.</p><p>She was finally free. She kept climbing, whimpering now, and when she was finally high enough up to convince herself she was safe, she settled herself in the crook of a heavy branch and the tree\u2019s trunk.</p><p>She finally gathered enough courage to look down. Her heart felt as though it had just dropped to the pit of her stomach. Dear God, there were at least six of the beasts. They circled the tree, growling and snapping up at her and at each other, and there was one, perhaps their leader, who made Dumfries look like a pup. She shook her head, denying what she was seeing. Wolves didn\u2019t get that large. Did they?</p><p>They couldn\u2019t climb trees either . . . or could they? The giant wolf started butting his head against the tree trunk She thought that was an extremely ignorant thing to do. Two of the other wolves were shredding her plaid. They seemed to be in a frenzy, too.</p><p>They didn\u2019t look like they had any intention of leaving her alone. Johanna worried over her circumstances a long while. When she finally accepted the fact that she was indeed safe, she started worrying about Michael and Lindsay. She didn\u2019t want them to ride into a pack of wolves and she didn\u2019t know if the monsters would leave when they heard the horses coming. Aye, they were monsters all right, and they didn\u2019t look like they would run from anything or anyone.</p><p>Johanna\u2019s attention was turned when she caught a movement to her left. One wolf had climbed to the top of the rocked entrance of the cave. The animal looked as though he was getting ready to spring at her. Johanna didn\u2019t know if the wolf would make the distance or not. She wasn\u2019t going to wait to find out, however. She slipped her bow from her shoulder, pulled out an arrow, then shifted her position ever so slightly and took aim.</p><p>She caught the wolf in midflight. The arrow went through one eye. The animal crashed down to the ground and landed just a foot away from the others. They immediately turned on the dead animal.</p> <p>In the next twenty minutes or so, Johanna killed three more. She\u2019d heard that wolves were clever animals. These weren\u2019t. They were safe from her arrows as long as they stayed below her, for the branches obstructed her aim, but one after another climbed up on the rock and tried to leap into the tree to get her. They were slow to catch on, she decided, when the fourth wolf followed the same path the first three had taken.</p><p>Her fingers ached from holding her arrow against the string of her bow. She wanted to get the giant wolf in her sights. In her mind, he was surely the one who had injured Dumfries. She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d come to that conclusion. Perhaps it was the dried black blood on the animal\u2019s fangs when he bared his teeth at her. He seemed to be more demon than animal. His eyes never left her. He was such an evil-looking beast. Johanna shivered with disgust and fear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one they call Pet, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t expect an answer, of course. She began to wonder if her worrisome situation had made her mind snap. She was, after all, talking to demons now. She sighed over her own behavior.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t the wolf leave? And where in heaven\u2019s name were Michael and Lindsay? They surely hadn\u2019t forgotten her, had they?</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t believe her day could get much worse.</p><p>She was wrong. She hadn\u2019t counted on the rain. She\u2019d been too busy to notice the sunlight had disappeared, and God only knew she didn\u2019t have time to look up at the sky and see rain clouds. She was so intent on protecting herself from the wolves, she didn\u2019t have time to think about anything else. It didn\u2019t matter, she supposed. Knowing ahead of time wouldn\u2019t have changed anything. She still got drenched.</p><p>Lightning crackled through the trees. A torrential downpour followed. The branches became slick, as though they\u2019d been greased with lard instead of water. Johanna couldn\u2019t get her arm all the way around the trunk. She was afraid to adjust her position, fearing she\u2019d slide down.</p><p>The monster still waited at the base of the tree. Johanna\u2019s hands were shaking from holding her bow and arrow. Her fingers cramped.</p><p>She heard her name being shouted. She whispered a prayer of thank you to her Maker before shouting back. Odd, but she thought she heard her husband\u2019s voice. That couldn\u2019t be possible, of course. He was hunting.</p><p>The pounding of horses coming her way finally encouraged the wolf to leave. Johanna was ready. As soon as the streak of lightning moved away from the tree, she dispatched her arrow. She missed her mark. She\u2019d aimed for his middle, but the arrow caught him in the backside. The wolf let out a howl of distress and circled back toward her. Johanna hurried to put the beast out of his misery. She grabbed another arrow from her carrier, sighted it to her bow, and took aim again.</p><p>She had little liking for the kill. Even though he looked very like something the devil had let out of hell, the wolf was still one of God\u2019s creatures. He served a purpose more holy than her own, or so she\u2019d been told, and though she didn\u2019t have a clue as to what the purpose was, she still felt guilty.</p><p>The MacBain soldiers came riding around the curve in the path just as Johanna\u2019s arrow sliced down through the air and killed the wolf. The animal was lifted back and up by the force of the arrow, then collapsed in a heap on the ground in front of the warriors\u2019 horses.</p><p>Johanna leaned back against the trunk and let go of her bow. She clenched and unclenched her hands in an effort to get the cramps out of her fingers. She suddenly felt nauseated. She took a deep breath and peeked around the branch to look at the soldiers below.</p><p>As soon as she regained a bit of strength, she was going to give the men hell for making her wait so long. Then, after they offered her their apologies, she was going to make them give her their pledge not to mention this shameful incident to their laird. By God, she\u2019d nag that promise out of every one of them.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see the soldiers\u2019 faces. She recognized Calum\u2019s voice though.</p><p>\u201cYes, Calum,\u201d she called back. \u201cI\u2019m quite all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t sound all right,\u201d said Keith. In a near shout, he added, \u201cYou killed our pet.\u201d</p><p>The Maclaurin soldier sounded stunned. Johanna felt an explanation was necessary. She didn\u2019t want any of the soldiers to think she had derived any sort of malicious satisfaction or pleasure from killing the beasts.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t how it looks,\u201d she shouted down.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey look like her arrows,\u201d Keith remarked.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t leave me alone, sir. I had to kill them. Please don\u2019t tell anyone, especially our laird. He\u2019s too busy to be bothered by such an insignificant incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut m\u2019lady ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalum, don\u2019t argue with me. I\u2019m not in the mood to be polite. I\u2019ve had a trying morning. Just give me your word you\u2019ll keep my secret.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s skirt was caught on the branch. While she worked at tugging it free, she waited for the soldiers to give her their pledges. She wasn\u2019t going to get down from her perch until they did.</p><p>Gabriel would be furious. Just thinking about his reaction gave her goosebumps.</p><p>The men still hadn\u2019t given her their promise. \u201cIt\u2019s little enough to ask,\u201d she muttered to herself.</p><p>Calum started laughing. It didn\u2019t take her any time at all to understand why.</p><p>Gabriel already knew.</p><p>\u201cCome down here. Now.\u201d</p><p>The fury in her husband\u2019s voice almost shook her out of the tree. Johanna grimaced. She leaned back against the crook in the tree, hoping to hide from her husband . . . and his wrath. She quickly realized what she was doing, muttered an unladylike expletive under her breath, and then leaned forward. She pushed a limb out of her way and looked down. She wished she hadn\u2019t. She spotted Gabriel right away. He was looking up at her. His hands rested on the pommel of his saddle and he appeared to be only mildly irritated.</p><p>She knew better. Her husband hadn\u2019t been able to keep the anger out of his voice when he\u2019d rudely bellowed his command.</p><p>His mount was between Keith\u2019s and Calum\u2019s. Johanna let go of the branch and leaned back against the trunk of the tree. She could feel her face heat up with embarrassment. Gabriel had obviously been there all the while she was demanding his soldiers keep her secret from him.</p><p>Some sort of explanation was probably due now, she supposed, and given enough time, she could surely come up with something plausible. Johanna decided she wasn\u2019t going to move until she did.</p><p>It was taking all of Gabriel\u2019s concentration to keep his anger under control. He turned his gaze to the ground and once again counted the number of dead wolves, just to make certain his eyes hadn\u2019t deceived him. Then he looked back up at her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t moved to do his bidding. God\u2019s truth, she couldn\u2019t. The threat of the wolves wasn\u2019t over yet. There was still one down below, waiting to pounce on her.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, get down here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t appreciate his surly tone of voice. She would have told him so, too, but she didn\u2019t believe her opinion would matter much to him. She guessed she\u2019d better try to accommodate him.</p><p>Unfortunately, her legs refused to accommodate her. She\u2019d been gripping the branch with her thighs for so long, they seemed to turn to jelly when she tried to scoot down the trunk.</p><p>In the end, Gabriel had to come up and fetch her. He had to peel her hands away from the branch. She couldn\u2019t seem to let go.</p><p>He placed her arms around his neck, then pulled her up against him. His one arm was spanning her waist, his other was draped over the branch to keep the two of them from slipping.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move for a long minute. Johanna hadn\u2019t realized how cold she was until the heat from his body began to warm her. She was shaking now.</p><p>So was he, she noticed. Was he so furious with her, he was shaking with rage?</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>The fear he heard in her voice was his undoing. \u201cYou will cease being afraid of me, damn it,\u201d he told her in a low, furious whisper. \u201cGod\u2019s truth, I would like to throttle some sense into you, woman, but I won\u2019t ever harm you.\u201d</p><p>His rebuke stung. She hadn\u2019t done anything to cause his displeasure . . . except perhaps ignoring his ridiculous order to rest. Aye, she thought to herself, she did disregard his suggestion.</p><p>\u201cI have already ceased being afraid of you, damn it,\u201d she muttered against the side of his neck. She let out a sigh then. Gabriel was partial to honesty, and she supposed she\u2019d only prick his anger further if she didn\u2019t give him the full truth now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man looked ready to throttle something all right. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you most of the time,\u201d she added in a rush. \u201cWhy are you so angry with me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her question. He couldn\u2019t. He was still in jeopardy of bellowing at her. He would wait until he had his temper under control before explaining she\u2019d taken a good twenty years off his life by giving him such a scare.</p><p>Her husband tightened his hold on her. Her question had obviously upset him. She couldn\u2019t imagine why. She wasn\u2019t a mind reader, after all. She thought about mentioning that fact, then changed her mind. It wouldn\u2019t do her any good at all to incite his fury. She was his wife and therefore should try to soothe him.</p><p>She decided to change the topic. She\u2019d start with praise, thinking to please him. \u201cYou were right, husband. The woods are infested with wolves.\u201d</p> <p>It was the wrong thing to say to him. She came to that conclusion when his grip tightened and he let out a loud, shuddering breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you all wet, m\u2019lord.\u201d she blurted out, trying to turn his attention away from her unfortunate mention of wolves.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaked through.\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re going to catch a fever and be dead in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019ll change into dry clothing and be as fit as ever. You\u2019re squeezing the breath out of me, husband. Do let up on your hold.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel ignored her request. He let out an expletive, then suddenly moved. She tightened her hold on his neck and closed her eyes. She\u2019d let him worry about keeping the branches out of her face on the way down.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t let her walk. He carried her over to his mount, lifted her up higher, and then dropped her onto the saddle. He wasn\u2019t overly gentle about the task.</p><p>She immediately tried to straighten her underskirts. The material was stuck to her skin. She knew she didn\u2019t look like a decent lady now, glanced down, and let out a gasp of dismay when she saw how her clothing was clinging to her breasts. She quickly threaded her fingers through her hair and pulled it forward to cover her chest.</p><p>Thankfully the soldiers weren\u2019t paying her any attention. Gabriel stood with his back to her and ordered the removal of the wolves. Calum and Keith jumped down from their mounts to tie ropes around the wolves\u2019 necks.</p><p>\u201cDrag them back to the ridge and burn them,\u201d Gabriel commanded. He tossed the reins to Johanna\u2019s mare in Lindsay\u2019s direction and ordered him and the other soldiers to return to the keep.</p><p>He wanted a moment alone with his wife.</p><p>Calum gave her a sympathetic look before taking his leave. He obviously believed she was going to catch hell. So did Keith, if his dour expression was an indicator.</p> <p>She held her head high, folded her hands together, and pretended to be composed.</p><p>Gabriel waited until his soldiers had left before turning back to her. He put his hand on her thigh to get her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say to me, wife?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He waited. \u201cWell?\u201d he finally demanded.</p><p>\u201cI wish you would get over your anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on top of his. \u201cYou expect an apology, don\u2019t you? Very well, then. I\u2019m sorry I ignored your suggestion to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggestion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t bellow at me, husband. It\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why he needed to repeat what she\u2019d just said. He didn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t hysterical over her encounter with the wolves. Didn\u2019t she understand what could have happened? Dear God, he couldn\u2019t quit thinking about it. She could have been torn apart by the wild beasts.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, I want you to promise me you\u2019ll never again leave the keep without a proper escort.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded hoarse. She thought it might be due to the fact that he was trying to keep himself from shouting at her. If that deduction was true, then her husband was actually being considerate of her feelings.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lord, I don\u2019t want to become a prisoner in your home,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ve already had to resort to trickery just so I could do a spot of hunting. I should be able to come and go as I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith an escort then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, woman, that\u2019s just what I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suggest. I demanded a promise from you.\u201d She patted his hand. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to be soothed, however. He motioned to the ground beneath the tree where her shredded plaid lay. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize you could have been torn apart as quickly and as easily as your plaid?\u201d</p><p>The truth had been slow to dawn on her. Her eyes widened in surprise. He thought she was finally beginning to understand her jeopardy. He nodded. \u201cAye, you could have been killed, wife.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It wasn\u2019t the reaction he\u2019d hoped to gain. How could he ever teach her caution if she didn\u2019t understand the dangers all around her?</p><p>He scowled with frustration. \u201cI have been trying to get used to having a wife, Johanna. You make the adjustment difficult. Why in God\u2019s name are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have only just realized, m\u2019lord, that your anger is due to my near miss. I believed you were upset because I disregarded your suggestion to rest. Now I understand,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth you\u2019re beginning to care for me. Your heart has softened, hasn\u2019t it, husband?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to let her jump to such foolish conclusions. He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife and I will always protect you. That is my duty, Johanna. But I\u2019m a warrior, first and always. You seem to have forgotten that important fact.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what in heaven\u2019s name he was talking about. \u201cWhat does being a warrior have to do with your attitude toward me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatters of the heart do not concern me,\u201d he explained.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders. \u201cThey don\u2019t concern me either,\u201d she replied, lest he believe she\u2019d been hurt by his opinion. \u201cAnd I, too, thought only to get used to having you around.\u201d</p><p>He could tell from the look in her eyes he\u2019d somehow injured her feelings. He reached up, cupped the back of her neck with his hand, and pulled her toward him. He kissed her long and hard. She put her arms around his neck and kissed him back. When he pulled away, she almost slumped off her mount. He put his hands on her waist to keep her from falling.</p><p>\u201cGive me your promise before we leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Her immediate agreement improved his mood. It didn\u2019t last long. Damned if she didn\u2019t deliberately provoke his temper again.</p><p>\u201cExactly what did I just promise, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised not to leave the keep without a proper escort!\u201d</p><p>He really hadn\u2019t meant to shout, but Lord, she made him crazed. What had they been discussing for the past ten minutes?</p><p>Johanna trailed her fingers down the side of his neck. His frown was intense, and she thought only to soothe him. She added a little praise to her caress of affection.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth you make me forget everything when you kiss me. That is the reason I forgot what I promised you, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fault her for admitting the truth. There were times when he was also affected by her kisses. Certainly not as often as his wife, of course, he qualified to himself.</p><p>Johanna swung her leg over the saddle and tried to get down. Gabriel tightened his hold on her waist to keep her from moving.</p><p>\u201cI would like to show you something,\u201d she announced. \u201cI had thought to wait until tomorrow, for I judged it would take you that long to forget about today\u2019s little incident, but I\u2019ve changed my mind. Gabriel. I want to show you now. My surprise will surely improve your mood. Do let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to forget about today\u2019s incident,\u201d he muttered. He kept up his scowl while he assisted her to the ground, then caught hold of her hand when she tried to walk away from him.</p><p>He reached up to retrieve her bow from the back of the saddle, then followed her into the cave. He had difficulty getting through the entrance. He had to squeeze his way through and keep his head tucked; but once he\u2019d reached the cavern proper and saw the barrels, he quit his muttering over the inconveniences his wife forced on him.</p><p>Her enthusiasm over the find was more pleasing to him than the treasure itself.</p><p>\u201cNow you will have something of value to barter,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll have no need to steal again. What say you to that, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Johanna, you take the joy out of my hunts,\u201d he replied.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like hearing that. \u201cIt is my duty to save your soul, husband, and by God, I\u2019m going to try, with or without your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. The sound echoed throughout the cavern, bouncing from stone to stone.</p><p>Gabriel was able to maintain his cheerful mood until it dawned on him that his wife had gone inside alone to find the treasure.</p><p>\u201cYou could have walked into their lair!\u201d he suddenly bellowed.</p><p>The swift change in his behavior caught her by surprise. She took a step back away from her husband. He immediately softened his tone. \u201cWhat would you have done if wolves had followed you in here?\u201d</p><p>She could tell he was struggling to control his temper. Gabriel really was a kind-hearted man. He knew she didn\u2019t like it when he shouted and was, therefore, trying to accommodate her.</p><p>From the look in his eyes, she guessed it was killing him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare smile. He\u2019d think she wasn\u2019t taking the topic seriously.</p><p>\u201cIt is true, m\u2019lord, I didn\u2019t consider that possibility. I was so excited when I found the cave, I forgot to be cautious. Still,\u201d she added in a rush when he appeared ready to interrupt her, \u201cI believe I would have been all right. Yes, I would have,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cWhy, I probably would have flown up those barrels. \u2019Tis the truth I flew up the tree to get away from the horrid beasts. I almost didn\u2019t make it. One grabbed hold of the hem of my plaid and I . . .\u201d</p><p>The expression on her husband\u2019s face told her she shouldn\u2019t have gone into such explicit detail. Gabriel was getting all riled up again.</p><p>She knew he was beginning to care about her all right. His heart was softening toward her whether he wanted to admit it or not. He wouldn\u2019t be this upset if he didn\u2019t care, would he?</p><p>Johanna was pleased with this proof of her husband\u2019s affections until she realized how much it mattered to her. Then she began to worry. Why did she care how he felt about her? Was she also softening in her feelings toward him? Good God, was she beginning to love the barbarian?</p><p>The possibility appalled her. She shook her head in denial. She wasn\u2019t about to allow herself to become so vulnerable.</p><p>Gabriel was relieved to see her frown. She\u2019d gone pale, too. He nodded with satisfaction. The woman was finally understanding what could have happened to her.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to believe you were completely lacking in common sense,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of common sense,\u201d she boasted in reply.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to argue with her. He dragged her back outside. While she waited, he blocked the entrance with stones so the animals couldn\u2019t get inside.</p><p>She rode on his lap back to the keep. The sun was shining again by the time they reached the ridge.</p><p>Johanna forced herself to put her worries aside. She could certainly control her own emotions, after all; and if she didn\u2019t wish to love Gabriel, then, by God, she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as tense as the string on your bow, wife. I can understand why, of course. You\u2019ve finally realized how close you came to death today. Lean back against me and close your eyes. You should rest.\u201d</p><p>She did as he suggested. She thought to have the last word on the topic, however. \u201cNever once did I believe I was going to die, m\u2019lord. I knew that eventually you or the other soldiers would find me. I was safe in the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were still worried,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOf course I was worried. There were wild wolves circling below me.\u201d</p><p>She was getting tense again. He squeezed her. \u201cYou were also worried because you believed you disappointed me,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes heavenward. Her husband certainly had an ego. \u201cYou think I believed I disappointed you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned over the laughter he heard in her voice. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did I believe I disappointed you?\u201d</p><p>He let out a long sigh. \u201cYou realized you caused me needless concern,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cSo you admit you were worried about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. woman, I just said I was.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Gabriel sounded surly again. She didn\u2019t turn around to look at his face, but she knew he was scowling. She patted his arm in an attempt to soothe him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to know you were concerned about me, even if you thought it was a needless inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was that, all right.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his rebuke. \u201cStill, you should learn to have faith in me, m\u2019lord. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for one of your jests, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t jesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you were.\u201d</p><p>She quit trying to argue with him. After thinking about the topic for several minutes, she decided she really couldn\u2019t fault her husband for believing she couldn\u2019t take care of herself. She\u2019d acted like a coward when she\u2019d first met him, and she\u2019d been very timid ever since. No, she couldn\u2019t blame him for believing she needed watching over. In time, however, she hoped to change his mind. She didn\u2019t want her husband to continue to think she was a weakling.</p><p>\u201cJohanna. I don\u2019t want you to mention the barrels in the cave to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, husband. Do you know what you\u2019ll do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later, after supper,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She nodded. Then she turned the topic. \u201cHow did you find me? I thought you went hunting for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a change in plans,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe MacInnes laird and ten of his soldiers were spotted crossing our border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they coming to your home, do you suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out when they get here,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd when will that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill they stay for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be rude not to invite them to eat with you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. She wasn\u2019t deterred by his lack of interest. As his wife, she felt it was her duty to instill some manners in her husband.</p><p>\u201cI shall instruct the servants to prepare places at your tables for your guests,\u201d she announced.</p> <p>She waited for him to argue with her and was pleasantly surprised when he remained silent.</p><p>Johanna turned her attention to planning the menu. A sudden thought occurred to her. She let out a gasp. \u201cGood Lord, Gabriel, you didn\u2019t steal from the MacInnes clan, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, smiling over the outrage in her voice.</p><p>She relaxed against him again. \u201cThen we don\u2019t have to worry they\u2019re coming here to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFight with only ten soldiers? No, that isn\u2019t a concern.\u201d he drawled out.</p><p>The amusement in his voice made her smile. Her husband was feeling more cheerful now. Perhaps his good mood was due to the fact that he was going to have company.</p> <p>She would make certain the evening went well. There wouldn\u2019t be enough rabbit stew to go around unless she went hunting for more. She discarded that idea. The rabbits would have to simmer for several hours or be too tough to eat, and there wasn\u2019t time for that, anyway. Johanna decided she would change her clothes, then go to Cook and discuss the problem. Hilda would know how to stretch the meal, and Johanna would, of course, offer to help with the preparations.</p><p>She wished she could get rid of the Maclaurin soldiers for the night. They were so terribly loud, disruptive, and horribly rude. Why, the way they tried to outbelch each other was downright disgusting.</p><p>Still, she didn\u2019t want to hurt their feelings. They were part of Gabriel\u2019s clan now and would, therefore, have to be included.</p><p>They reached the courtyard. Gabriel dismounted first, then turned to assist her. He held her longer than necessary. She smiled up at her husband while she waited for him to let go of her.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, you will not get into further mischief. I want you to go inside and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, m\u2019lord,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cYou want me to rest, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Lord, she was fetching when she was disgruntled. \u201cAye, I do want you to rest.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down, kissed her, and then turned to lead his mount back to the stables.</p> <p>Johanna shook her head over her husband\u2019s ridiculous orders. How could she take the time to rest when they had company coming for dinner?</p><p>She hurried inside, propped her bow and carrier against the wall at the bottom of the steps, and then went up to her chamber. It didn\u2019t take her long to change into dry clothes. Her hair was still too wet to properly braid. She tied it with a ribbon behind her neck, then hurried downstairs again.</p><p>Megan was standing by the doors, peeking outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Megan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe MacInnes soldiers are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Johanna asked. She went over to stand beside Megan. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we open the doors and welcome them inside?\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. She moved out of the way so her mistress could look outside, then whispered, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, m\u2019lady. Look at the way they\u2019re all frowning. They\u2019ve carried along an offering for our laird though. Do you see the burlap draped over the laird\u2019s lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me have a look.\u201d Father MacKechnie whispered his request from behind the two women.</p><p>Johanna bumped into the priest when she turned around. She begged his forgiveness over her clumsiness, then explained why she\u2019d been caught peeking at their company.</p><p>\u201cTheir behavior is most contradictory,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re all scowling, but it\u2019s apparent they\u2019ve carried along a gift for your laird. Perhaps their frowns are all for show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, that can\u2019t be,\u201d Father MacKechnie replied. \u201cThe Highlanders aren\u2019t at all like the English, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Father? Men are men, regardless of how they dress.\u201d</p><p>The priest let the door close before answering her. \u201cIn my experiences with the English, I\u2019ve noticed a peculiar trait. They always seem to have a hidden motive behind their actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Highlanders?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Father MacKechnie smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re a simple group, we are. What you see is what you have. Do you understand? We don\u2019t have time for secret motives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe MacInnes soldiers are frowning because they\u2019re angry about something,\u201d Megan interjected. \u201cThey aren\u2019t clever enough to use trickery.\u201d</p><p>The priest nodded agreement. \u201cWe have no use for subterfuge. Laird MacInnes looks as mad as a hornet someone just tried to swat. He\u2019s in a snit all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will have to do our best to soothe him. He is company, after all,\u201d she reasoned. \u201cMegan, please go and tell Cook we\u2019ll be having eleven more for supper. Be sure to offer our assistance with the preparations. I\u2019ll be along in just a minute.\u201d</p><p>Megan hurried to do her mistress\u2019s bidding. \u201cCook won\u2019t mind the inconvenience,\u201d she called over her shoulder as she started down the hallway to the back door. \u201cShe\u2019s a MacBain, after all. She knows better than to complain.\u201d</p><p>Johanna frowned over that puzzling remark. Why did it matter if Cook was a MacBain or a Maclaurin? Megan had already disappeared, and so Johanna decided she\u2019d have to wait until later to ask her for a proper explanation.</p><p>The priest turned her attention then when he pulled the door open. She stood behind him. \u201cWhich one is the laird?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cThe old man with the bulging eyes seated atop the speckled mount,\u201d Father MacKechnie answered. \u201cYou\u2019d best stay here, lass, until your husband has decided if he\u2019s going to let them come inside or not. I\u2019ll go out and speak to them.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded agreement. She stayed behind the door but peeked out to watch the priest. Father MacKechnie went down the steps and shouted his greeting.</p><p>The Maclnnes soldiers ignored the priest. Their expressions seemed to be set in stone. Johanna found their behavior sinful. None of the men bothered to dismount either. Didn\u2019t they realize how offending their conduct was?</p><p>Johanna turned her attention to their laird. Father MacKechnie had been right, she decided. The man did have bulging eyes. He was old, too, with wrinkled skin and thick eyebrows. His gaze was directed on Gabriel. Johanna spotted her husband walking across the clearing. He stopped when he was several feet away from the MacInnes soldiers.</p><p>The laird said something that clearly infuriated Gabriel. Her husband\u2019s expression turned dark, chilling. Johanna had never seen that look before. She shivered in reaction. Gabriel looked ready to do battle.</p><p>The MacBain warriors walked over to stand behind their laird. The Maclaurins joined them.</p><p>The MacInnes laird motioned to one of his men. The soldier quickly dismounted and strutted over to his leader\u2019s side. He looked like his laird, and Johanna thought he might be his son. She watched as he lifted the long burlap bag from his laird\u2019s lap. He adjusted the weight in his arms, turned, and walked around the front of the speckled mount. He stopped just a few feet away from Gabriel, lifted the sack, and threw it to the ground.</p><p>The bag tore open. Dust flew up in the air; and when it cleared, Johanna saw what the laird\u2019s gift was. A woman, so bloody and bruised her face was barely recognizable, spilled out and rolled onto her side. She was naked, and there wasn\u2019t a spot on her body left unmarked.</p><p>Johanna staggered back away from the door. She whimpered low in her throat. She thought she was going to throw up. She was so sickened by the sight of the broken woman, she wanted to weep with shame . . . and scream with fury.</p><p>She didn\u2019t do either. She reached for her bow and arrows instead.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Johanna\u2019s hands shook, and all she could think about was being accurate with her aim when she killed the bastards who had committed this foul act.</p><p>Gabriel was shaking with his own fury. His hand moved to the tilt of his sword. He couldn\u2019t believe a Highlander would disgrace himself so thoroughly with such cowardly behavior. Yet the proof was on the ground in front of him.</p><p>Laird MacInnes looked smug now. Gabriel decided he would kill him first.</p><p>\u201cAre you responsible for beating this woman to death?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t asked the question; he\u2019d roared it.</p><p>The MacInnes leader frowned in reaction. \u201cShe ain\u2019t dead. She\u2019s breathing still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you responsible?\u201d Gabriel demanded again.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d the laird shouted back. \u201cI surely am.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like a boast to Gabriel, who started to pull his sword free. Laird MacInnes noticed the action and suddenly realized his tenuous position. He hurried to explain his reasons for beating the woman.</p><p>\u201cClare MacKay was placed in my household by her father,\u201d he shouted. \u201cShe was pledged to marry my eldest son, Robert.\u201d He paused to nod at the soldier standing next to his mount before continuing on. \u201cI was going to unite our two clans and become a power to be reckoned with, but the bitch was soiled three months past, MacBain, and by one of your own. It be no use denying the truth, for your plaid was spotted by three of my men. Clare MacKay spent a full night with the man. At first she lied and claimed she stayed the night with her cousins. I was fool enough to believe her. Once she discovered she was carrying, she had the gall to boast about her sin. Isn\u2019t that the way of it, Robert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it is,\u201d his son answered. \u201cI won\u2019t marry a whore,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cA MacBain ruined her, a MacBain can have her.\u201d</p><p>After rendering his judgment, he turned his gaze to the woman. He spit at the ground near her, then moved forward to stand over the unconscious woman with his hands on his h*ps and a leer on his face.</p><p>He drew his booted foot back, then started to bring it forward, intent on giving the woman a hard kick.</p><p>An arrow stopped him cold. Robert let out a screech of pain and staggered back. The arrow was imbedded in his thigh. His hands moved to his leg as he turned, shouting still, to see who had injured him.</p><p>Johanna stood on the top step in front of the keep. Her gaze was fully directed on the soldier. She notched another arrow to the string of her bow and kept the man in her sights.</p><p>She waited for an excuse to kill him.</p><p>Everyone was watching her now. Gabriel had moved to intervene when Robert swung his leg back to kick the woman. The arrow struck the soldier before he could. He turned, saw the look on his wife\u2019s face, and immediately started toward her.</p><p>None of the others moved for a long minute. The Maclaurins were clearly stunned by what they\u2019d just witnessed. The MacBains were just as surprised and certainly just as impressed.</p><p>The soldier she\u2019d injured moved close to the woman. Johanna thought he was going to try to hurt her again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let that happen. \u201cTry to kick her again, and by God, I\u2019ll put an arrow through your black heart.\u201d</p><p>The fury in her voice washed over the group of soldiers. Robert immediately backed away. The priest hurried forward and knelt down beside the woman. He made the sign of the cross and whispered a blessing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s daft,\u201d Robert whispered.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s followers heard his remark. Three of the MacBain soldiers started forward. Calum waved them back with a motion of his hand.</p><p>\u201cOur laird will decide what\u2019s to be done,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Keith stood beside Calum. He couldn\u2019t restrain himself. \u201cShe isn\u2019t daft,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be certain to let our laird know your opinion of his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son wasn\u2019t being insulting,\u201d Laird MacInnes defended. \u201cJust speaking the truth. Look at her eyes. She\u2019s gone crazed all right. And over what, I ask you? \u2019Tis just a whore on the ground.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t paying any attention to anyone but his wife now. He reached the steps but didn\u2019t touch her. He moved to stand next to her side.</p><p>Johanna ignored her husband. She slowly turned until she had Laird MacInnes in her sights.</p><p>She was pleased to notice his ugly face turn stark white. His thick lips pinched into a pucker of worry.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you beat this woman?\u201d</p><p>The laird didn\u2019t answer her. He turned his gaze to his left and then to his right. It was as though he was looking for a means of escape.</p><p>\u201cYou may not kill him.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave his command in a low whisper only she could hear. Johanna didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to his order.</p><p>He repeated his command. She shook her head. She kept the laird in her sights when she spoke to her husband.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe the woman deserved this treatment? Do you think she\u2019s less important than dull-witted oxen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better than to ask me such questions,\u201d he countered. \u201cGive me your bow and arrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what they did!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>The agony in her voice made his heart ache. His wife was close to completely losing her composure. He couldn\u2019t allow that to happen.</p><p>\u201cDo not let them see your distress,\u201d he ordered. \u201cThat would be a victory for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. Her hands started shaking, and she let out a low whimper.</p><p>\u201cThe longer we stand here, the longer the lass goes without proper care. Give me your weapon.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let go. \u201cI can\u2019t let them hurt her anymore. I can\u2019t. Don\u2019t you see? I have to help her. I prayed for someone to help me. No one would. But I can help her. I have to ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let them hurt her,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She shook her head again. Gabriel decided to take a different approach. It seemed as though an hour had passed since he\u2019d joined her on the steps, yet he knew less than a few minutes had actually gone by. The length of time didn\u2019t matter to him. He didn\u2019t care how long it took for her to regain her control. The bastard MacInnes soldiers would have to wait. Gabriel could have taken the weapon away from her, of course. He didn\u2019t want to. He wanted her to give it to him.</p><p>\u201cVery well then,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll order my men to kill every one of them. Will that suit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t mask his surprise. He let out a sigh, then turned to give the order. He wasn\u2019t one to bluff. If she wanted him to kill the infidels, then he would accommodate her. Hell, he\u2019d been looking for an excuse anyway. Pleasing his wife would do well enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCalum,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cAye, MacBain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Johanna blurted out.</p><p>Gabriel turned to her. \u201cNo?\u201d</p> <p>Tears gathered in her eyes. \u201cWe can\u2019t kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we can.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt would make us no better than they if we let our anger control our actions. Make them go away. They turn my stomach.\u201d</p><p>The strength was back in her voice. Gabriel nodded, satisfied. \u201cGive me your bow and arrow first.\u201d</p><p>She slowly lowered her arms. What happened next so surprised her, she didn\u2019t even have time to react. Gabriel snatched her weapon out of her hands, half-turned, took aim, and dispatched the arrow with incredible speed and accuracy.</p> <p>A howl of pain followed. The arrow found its target in the shoulder of the same Maclnnes soldier she\u2019d injured. Robert, the laird\u2019s son, had slipped his dagger from his belt and was just about to hurl the weapon when Gabriel spotted the movement. Neither Calum nor Keith had even had time to shout a warning.</p><p>Laird Maclnnes went into a rage on his son\u2019s behalf. Gabriel\u2019s fury was far worse. He shoved Johanna behind his back, tossed the bow to the ground, and reached for his sword.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell off my land, MacInnes, or I\u2019ll kill you now.\u201d</p><p>The MacInnes soldiers didn\u2019t waste time leaving. Gabriel wouldn\u2019t let Johanna move until the courtyard was clear.</p><p>\u201cKeith, send ten Maclaurin soldiers to follow them to our border,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, MacBain,\u201d Keith shouted back.</p> <p>The minute her husband moved, Johanna skirted her way around him and ran down the steps. She crossed the clearing, untying her belt as she ran. She had her plaid off before she knelt down next to the battered woman and used the material to cover her. She placed her hand on the side of the woman\u2019s neck, felt the pulse beating there, and almost wept with relief.</p><p>Father MacKechnie put his hand on Johanna\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019d best get her inside,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Calum bent down on one knee and leaned forward to lift the woman. Johanna screamed at the soldier. \u201cDon\u2019t touch her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t stay here, m\u2019lady,\u201d Calum argued, trying to reason with his distraught mistress. \u201cLet me carry her inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel will carry her,\u201d Johanna decided. She took a deep breath in an attempt to calm herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to shout at you, Calum. Please forgive me. You shouldn\u2019t be lifting her anyway. You\u2019ll tear your stitches.\u201d</p><p>Calum nodded. He was surprised and pleased his mistress had offered him an apology.</p><p>\u201cIs she dead?\u201d Keith asked.</p><p>Johanna shook her head. Gabriel pulled her to her feet then and bent down to lift the MacKay woman into his arms.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful with her,\u201d Johanna whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me to put her?\u201d Gabriel asked. He stood up, cradling the sleeping woman in his arms.</p><p>\u201cGive her my room,\u201d Father MacKechnie suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll find another bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll live?\u201d Calum asked as he followed his laird across the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do I know?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll survive,\u201d Johanna announced, praying she was right.</p><p>Calum ran ahead to open the doors. Johanna followed her husband through the entrance. Hilda was just coming down the hallway from the back door. She spotted her mistress and called out to her.</p><p>\u201cMight I have a word with you about our menu for tonight\u2019s dinner guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t having guests,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cI would rather eat my supper with the devil or King John himself than suffer the MacInnes\u2019 company.\u201d</p><p>Hilda\u2019s eyes widened. Johanna started up the steps after her husband, then stopped. \u201cI seem to be snapping at everyone, Hilda. Please forgive me. I\u2019m not myself today.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for Hilda to accept her apology but hurried on up the steps. A few minutes later, their guest was settled in bed. Gabriel stood by his wife\u2019s side while she checked for broken bones.</p><p>\u201cShe appears to be intact,\u201d Johanna whispered. \u201cThe blows to her head worry me. Look at the swelling above her temple, Gabriel. I don\u2019t know how severe the damage is. She might not ever wake up.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d started crying until her husband ordered her to stop. \u201cIt won\u2019t do her any good if you fall apart. She needs your help, not your tears.\u201d</p><p>He was right, of course. Johanna mopped the wetness away from her cheeks with the backs of her hands. \u201cWhy did they cut her hair like that?\u201d</p><p>She reached down and touched the side of the woman\u2019s head. Clare MacKay had thick, dark brown hair. It hung straight down but barely covered her ears. The MacInnes men hadn\u2019t used scissors. The edges were too jagged. They\u2019d used a knife instead.</p><p>Humiliation, Johanna decided. Aye, that was their reason behind the foul deed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle she\u2019s still breathing,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cDo what you can, Johanna. I\u2019m going to let Father MacKechnie come inside now. He\u2019ll want to give her the last rites.\u201d</p><p>Johanna wanted to shout a denial. The sacrament of extreme unction was given only to those poor souls hovering at death\u2019s door. Reason told Johanna it was the logical thing to do. Yet the woman was breathing, damn it all. and Johanna didn\u2019t want to consider the possibility she wouldn\u2019t recover.</p><p>\u201cJust as a precaution.\u201d Gabriel insisted to gain her cooperation.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, \u201cjust as a precaution.\u201d She straightened up. \u201cI\u2019m going to make her more comfortable.\u201d she announced then. She crossed the room to fetch the pitcher of water and the bowl from the chest and carried them back to the bed. She was going to put them on the floor near her feet, but Gabriel thoughtfully moved the chest close to her. He started for the door as she hurried across the room again to collect a stack of linen cloths.</p><p>Gabriel reached for the latch, then suddenly stopped. He turned around to look at his wife. She wasn\u2019t paying him any attention now. She hurried back to the bed, sat down on the side, and dipped one of the cloths into the bowl of water she\u2019d just poured.</p><p>\u201cAnswer a question for me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ever beaten like this?\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t look up at her husband when she gave her answer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been holding his breath. He let it out after she gave him her reply.</p><p>Then she qualified her answer. \u201cHe rarely struck my face or my head. Once, though, he was less careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest of your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClothing hid those bruises,\u201d she answered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any idea how her explanation affected him. Gabriel was shaken. It was a wonder to him she\u2019d ever agreed to marry again. Hell, he\u2019d demanded she trust him. He felt like a complete fool now. If he were in her position, he sure as certain wouldn\u2019t have trusted anyone ever again.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t have scars,\u201d Johanna whispered. \u201cMost of the blood on her face is from her nosebleed. It\u2019s a wonder they didn\u2019t break it. She\u2019s a pretty woman, isn\u2019t she, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer face is too swollen to tell what she looks like,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have cut her hair.\u201d</p><p>She seemed obsessed over that minor punishment. \u201cCutting her hair was the least of their offenses, Johanna. They shouldn\u2019t have beaten her. Dogs receive better treatment.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. And oxen, she thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I married you.\u201d</p><p>She was too embarrassed to look at her husband when she told him how she felt, and so she pretended great interest in wringing every drop of water out of her cloth.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know you are, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>His arrogance was really getting out of hand. It warmed her heart, though. She shook her head, then went back to her task and began to clean the blood away from Clare MacKay\u2019s face. She whispered words of comfort while she worked. She doubted Clare could hear her, but it made Johanna feel better to tell her over and over again that she was safe now. She added the promise that no one would ever hurt her again.</p><p>Gabriel pulled the door open and found the hallway crowded with women. They all wore the MacBain plaid.</p><p>Hilda stood in front of the group. \u201cWe would like to offer to help with the care of the woman.\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFather MacKechnie must give her the last rites before you go inside,\u201d Gabriel ordered.</p><p>The priest was waiting at the back of the crowd. He heard his laird\u2019s announcement and immediately pushed his way through the women, begging their indulgence. He went inside the chamber, hurried to the foot of the bed where he\u2019d left his satchel, and pulled out a long, narrow purple stole. He kissed each fringed end, whispered his prayers, and draped the material over his neck.</p><p>Gabriel pulled the door closed. He went downstairs. Calum and Keith were waiting for him at the bottom of the steps.</p><p>They followed their laird into the great hall.</p><p>Gabriel spotted the plaid on the floor in front of the hearth. His dog was missing. \u201cWhere the hell is Dumfries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut prowling,\u201d Calum suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe took off early this morning,\u201d Keith added.</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. Johanna would pitch a fit if she noticed the dog was gone. She\u2019d fret about his stitches.</p><p>He forced his mind back to more important matters. \u201cCalum, call all the MacBain soldiers together,\u201d he commanded then. \u201cI want each man to tell me he didn\u2019t touch Clare MacKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will believe . . .\u201d</p><p>Keith quit his question when his laird scowled at him. \u201cNone of my warriors will lie to me, Keith,\u201d Gabriel snapped.</p><p>\u201cBut if one admits he did in fact spend the night with the woman? What will you do then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t your concern, Keith. I want you to ride to Laird MacKay and tell him what took place here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I tell him his daughter is dying or do I soften the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him she\u2019s been given the last rites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do I tell him a MacBain ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them exactly what Laird MacInnes charged,\u201d Gabriel commanded, his impatience evident. \u201cDamn, I wish I\u2019d killed the bastards when I had the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have a war on your hands if you did, MacBain,\u201d Keith pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWar has already been declared,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThink I will so easily forget the fact that the laird\u2019s son tried to kill my wife?\u201d</p><p>He was shouting by the time he finished his question. The Maclaurin warrior shook his head. \u201cNay, Laird,\u201d he rushed out. \u201cYou will not forget, and I stand beside you on this issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned right you do,\u201d Gabriel countered.</p><p>Calum took a step forward then. \u201cThe MacKays might also wage war if they believe a MacBain did in fact compromise Clare MacKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of my men would act so dishonorably,\u201d Gabriel snapped.</p><p>Calum nodded agreement. Keith wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cMacInnes said your plaid was spotted,\u201d he reminded his laird.</p><p>\u201cHe was lying to us,\u201d Calum argued.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacInnes also said Clare MacKay admitted she spent the night with a MacBain,\u201d Keith said.</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s lying,\u201d Calum replied.</p><p>Gabriel turned his back on his soldiers. \u201cI have given both of you your duties. See them completed.\u201d</p><p>The soldiers immediately left the hall. Gabriel stood by the hearth a long while.</p><p>He had one hell of a problem on his hands. He knew, without a doubt, that none of his men was responsible for disgracing Clare MacKay.</p><p>Yet the MacBain plaid had been spotted . . . three months ago.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Gabriel muttered to himself. If Laird MacInnes was telling the truth, there could only be one answer, only one man responsible for the damnable mess.</p><p>Nicholas.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Clare MacKay didn\u2019t wake up until the following morning. Johanna stayed with the woman most of the night until Gabriel came into the chamber and literally dragged her away. Hilda was happy to take over the watch for her mistress.</p><p>Johanna had only just returned to the room and settled herself in a chair by the side of Clare\u2019s bed when the woman opened her eyes and spoke to her.</p><p>\u201cI heard you whispering to me.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was given quite a start. She jumped up and went over to Clare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d she whispered, her relief almost overwhelming.</p><p>Clare nodded. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cI ache from my head to my toes.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cYou have bruises from your head to your toes,\u201d she replied. \u201cDoes your throat hurt, too? You sound hoarse.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth I did a lot of screaming,\u201d Clare said. \u201cMay I have a drink of water?\u201d</p><p>Johanna hurried to fetch the goblet. She helped Clare sit up. She tried to be as gentle as possible, but the woman still grimaced in pain. Her hand shook when she reached for the goblet.</p><p>\u201cWas there a priest here? I thought I heard someone praying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather MacKechnie gave you the last rites,\u201d Johanna explained. She put the goblet on the chest and sat down in her chair again. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if you would survive or not. It was just a precaution,\u201d she added in a rush.</p><p>Clare smiled. She had beautiful white teeth and dark brown eyes. Her face was still terribly swollen, of course, and Johanna could tell from the way she tried not to move she was still in terrible pain.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d</p><p>Clare closed her eyes. She avoided answering the question by asking one of her own. \u201cLast night . . . you said I was safe. I remember hearing you whisper those words to me. Were you telling the truth? Am I safe here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is here?\u201d</p><p>Johanna hurried to introduce herself and then explained what had happened. She deliberately left out the mention about the arrow she\u2019d put in Robert MacInnes\u2019s thigh and the arrow her husband put in his shoulder. By the time she was finished with her explanation, Clare was falling asleep again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d she promised. \u201cSleep now, Clare. You may stay with us for as long as you wish. Hilda will bring you something to eat in just a little while. You\u2019ll . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Johanna quit talking when she realized Clare MacKay was sound asleep. She tucked the covers around the woman, moved her chair back, and left the room.</p><p>Gabriel was reaching for his boots when Johanna walked into their chamber.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, m\u2019lord,\u201d she said in greeting. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>He frowned in reaction. Johanna went over to the window and pulled the furs back. From the yellow cast in the sky, she guessed it was only a few minutes past dawn.</p> <p>\u201cYou were told to stay in bed,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you wait until I fell asleep and then leave again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His frown intensified. She decided to try to placate him. \u201cI thought I would rest for a few minutes before going downstairs. I am weary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look half dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy appearance isn\u2019t important,\u201d she announced even as her hands flew to her hair and she tried to tuck the curls back into her braid.</p> <p>\u201cCome here, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>She walked across the room to stand in front of him. He reached down to untie the belt holding her plaid in place.</p><p>\u201cYou will stay where you\u2019re put,\u201d he announced.</p><p>She tried to slap his hands away. \u201cI\u2019m not a piece of jewelry or a trinket only to be taken off a shelf when the mood strikes you, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel caught hold of her chin and leaned down to kiss her. He thought only to get her to quit frowning, but her lips were so damned soft and appealing, he forgot his reason. He put his arms around his wife and hauled her up against him.</p><p>His kisses made her weak-kneed and dizzy. She put her arms around her husband\u2019s waist and held tight. She decided it was quite all right to allow him to rob her of her every thought. He was her husband, after all. Besides, when he was kissing her, he couldn\u2019t scowl . . . or lecture.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t remember undressing or getting into bed. Gabriel must have carried her there. He\u2019d taken his clothes off, too. He covered her with his body, captured the sides of her face with his hands, and gave her a seering kiss. His tongue moved inside her mouth to rub against hers.</p><p>She loved to touch him, to feel his hot skin under her fingertips, to caress the splay of hard muscle along his upper arms and shoulders. When she wrapped her arms around her husband, she felt as though she\u2019d captured his strength and his power.</p><p>He was a wonder to her, a revelation. Gabriel was as strong as the fittest of warriors, and yet so incredibly gentle whenever he touched her.</p><p>She loved the fact that she could make him lose his control. She didn\u2019t have to guess that might be true either; Gabriel told her. She felt . . . free with him, and completely uninhibited as well, for her husband seemed to like whatever she wanted to do.</p><p>He made her lose her own control, of course. She wasn\u2019t one to scream her demands, but by the time he quit his teasing and moved to mate with her, she was wild to make him end this sweet torment.</p><p>She cried out when he entered her, and he immediately stopped. \u201cGod, Johanna, I didn\u2019t mean to ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I hope you did mean to,\u201d she whispered. Her nails dug into his shoulder blades. She wrapped her legs around his thighs and squeezed him tight inside her. \u201cGabriel, I don\u2019t wish you to stop now. I want you to move.\u201d</p><p>He thought he\u2019d died and gone to heaven. He ignored her command and leaned up on his elbows to look into her eyes. He saw the passion there and almost lost all his control then. Dear Lord, she was beautiful . . . and so damned giving.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lustful wench.\u201d He was trying to tease her, but his voice sounded gruff. \u201cI like that,\u201d he added with a groan when she moved so restlessly against him.</p><p>Gabriel had made her burn for him and now refused to give her fulfillment or take his own.</p><p>\u201cHusband, this activity requires your participation,\u201d she cried out, her frustration beyond reason now.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d drive you daft first,\u201d he told her in a husky whisper.</p><p>It turned out to be an empty boast, for Gabriel felt as though he was the one who lost his mind when she dragged him down for a long, passionate kiss and moved against him so provocatively. His discipline deserted him. His movements became forceful and demanding, though surely no more demanding than his wife\u2019s.</p><p>They found fulfillment together. Johanna held onto her husband as wave after wave of ecstasy washed over her. She felt safe in his strong arms, certainly sated, and almost loved. It was more than she\u2019d ever had before or ever dreamed was possible.</p><p>She fell asleep sighing.</p><p>Gabriel thought he might have crushed her to death. She went completely limp in his arms. He rolled onto his side and whispered her name. She didn\u2019t answer him. She was breathing though. Had passion sent her into a dead faint? Gabriel smiled, for that possibility did appeal to him. He knew the true reason, of course. Johanna was exhausted. She\u2019d spent most of the night watching over their new charge.</p><p>He leaned down, kissed her brow, and got out of bed. \u201cYou will rest,\u201d he whispered. He smiled then. The little woman was actually obeying him. Of course she hadn\u2019t heard his order; she was already sound asleep, but it still made him feel damned happy to give a command he knew would be obeyed.</p><p>Gabriel covered his wife, got dressed, and quietly left the chamber.</p><p>The day started out pleasant enough, but it soured fast. Calum was waiting for his laird in the great hall with the announcement that another petition had arrived from Baron Goode requesting an audience with Lady Johanna. The messenger who delivered the request came from Laird Gillevrey again and waited by Calum\u2019s side to hear Gabriel\u2019s reply.</p><p>\u201cIs the baron waiting at the border of your land?\u201d he asked the soldier.</p><p>\u201cNay, Laird. He sent a representative. His goal is to convince Lady Johanna to meet with Baron Goode near England\u2019s border.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cMy wife isn\u2019t going anywhere. She doesn\u2019t want to speak to Baron Goode. England is a part of her past now, and she looks only to her future here. Tell your laird I thank him for acting as mediary. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s been inconvenienced by the English. I\u2019ll find a way to repay him for his efforts in keeping the baron and his vassals away from my holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you wish me to tell the representative?\u201d the soldier asked. \u201cI\u2019ll memorize every word, Laird MacBain, and recount just as you\u2019ve spoken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him my wife will not speak to any barons and that it would be foolish indeed if they continue to pester her.\u201d</p><p>The messenger bowed and left the hall. Gabriel turned to Calum. \u201cYou will not mention this to my wife. She doesn\u2019t need to know the baron is again trying to get to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. He tried to put the irritant of the English baron behind him, but his day still didn\u2019t improve. The Maclaurins weren\u2019t getting any of their duties done, and there were three accidents before noon. The soldiers were preoccupied; they acted as though they\u2019d been given a grave insult and couldn\u2019t stand the thought of working side by side with the MacBain soldiers. It was apparent they blamed the MacBains for the mess they believed they were in.</p><p>Odd but the Maclaurins didn\u2019t like warring much. Gabriel found their attitude puzzling. He thought they might have lost their zest for battle after they lost almost all they owned when last under siege by the English. Still, Gabriel found their attitude a shameful trait. Highlanders should embrace war, not abhor it.</p><p>The merging of the two clans was taking longer than he\u2019d anticipated. He had wanted to give each clansman time to adjust to all the changes, but he now realized he had been too damned accommodating. All that was going to stop. His followers would either put their differences aside or suffer his displeasure.</p><p>Work on the wall was going at a snail\u2019s pace. On a usual day, one MacBain soldier could do the work of three Maclaurins. Today didn\u2019t qualify as usual, however. The Maclaurins were muttering like old men. Their concentration certainly wasn\u2019t on their work, and nothing significant was getting done.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s patience was at an end. He was about to challenge a few of the blatant offenders when Calum chased him down with the report that yet another messenger had arrived.</p><p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t in the mood for another interruption. He much preferred the idea of bashing a few Maclaurin heads together. He didn\u2019t particularly care for the news he was given either. The news was sure to please his wife, however, he supposed.</p><p>He wanted Johanna to be happy. He wasn\u2019t certain why it mattered to him, but he was honest enough to admit her happiness was important.</p><p>Hell, he was getting soft. The messenger was shaking in his boots by the time Gabriel gave him permission to leave. He made him repeat the message he wanted taken back to England, for the man\u2019s attention was interrupted when Dumfries came running into the hall. The dog growled; the man bolted, and Gabriel found his first smile since early morning.</p><p>Johanna\u2019s reaction to the news wasn\u2019t what he expected. He was going to wait until dinner to tell her, but she came down the stairs just as the messenger was trying to run through the closed doors and wanted to know what the stranger wanted.</p><p>Dumfries was snapping at the man\u2019s heels. Johanna was appalled by the treatment their visitor was receiving. She pushed the dog out of the way, then opened the doors for the man. She bid him good day, but she didn\u2019t think he heard her. He was halfway across the courtyard, running like a madman, and Gabriel\u2019s laughter surely drowned out her words.</p><p>She shut the doors and walked over to the steps. Her husband stood by the hearth, grinning like a well-gifted man on Christmas morn. She shook her head at him.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t polite to frighten our guests, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s English, Johanna,\u201d he explained. He believed he had just given her an adequate excuse for his conduct.</p><p>She looked worried. She hurried down the steps and walked over to her husband. \u201cHe was a messenger, wasn\u2019t he? Who did he bring news from? Was it King John? Or did Baron Goode send another request?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d gone from worry to terror in less than a minute\u2019s time. Gabriel shook his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bring bad news, wife. The message came from your mother.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed hold of Gabriel\u2019s hand. \u201cIs she ill?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hurried to soothe her. He hated seeing her frightened. \u201cShe isn\u2019t ill,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I don\u2019t believe she is,\u201d he added. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be coming here if she was sick, would she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama\u2019s coming here?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d shouted the question. He was astonished. Johanna looked ready to swoon. Her reaction wasn\u2019t at all what he expected.</p><p>\u201cThis news does not please you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to sit down.\u201d</p><p>She collapsed into one of the chairs. Gabriel walked over to stand in front of her. \u201cAnswer me, wife. If the news doesn\u2019t make you happy, I\u2019ll have Calum catch the messenger and tell him to deny the request.\u201d</p><p>She bounded to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing. I want to see my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what in God\u2019s name is the matter with you? Why are you acting as though you\u2019ve just received foul news?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t paying any attention to her husband. Her mind raced from one thought to another. She was going to have to get her house organized. Aye, that duty came first. Dumfries would have to have a bath. Was there time to teach the hound some manners? Johanna wasn\u2019t about to let the dog growl at her mama.</p><p>Gabriel grabbed hold of his wife by her shoulders and demanded she answer him. She asked him to repeat his question.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t this good news, wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d she countered. She added a look that suggested she thought he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Mama in over four years, Gabriel. It will be a joyful reunion. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why in God\u2019s name do you look so ill?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged his hands away from her shoulders and started pacing in front of the hearth. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to do before she gets here,\u201d she explained. \u201cDumfries will need to be bathed. The keep must be cleaned from top to bottom. I won\u2019t have your pet growling at my mama, Gabriel. I\u2019ll have to teach him some manners. Oh God, manners.\u201d She whirled around to look at her husband. \u201cThe Maclaurins don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wailed out her last remark. Gabriel didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or frown over her rattled behavior.</p><p>He ended up smiling. She frowned in reaction. \u201cI won\u2019t have my mama insulted,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to insult her, wife.\u201d</p><p>She snorted with disbelief. \u201cI won\u2019t have her disappointed either. She trained me to be a good wife.\u201d She put her hands on her h*ps and waited. Her husband didn\u2019t have anything to say. \u201cWell?\u201d she demanded when he stubbornly remained silent.</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cWell, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to tell me I\u2019m a good wife,\u201d she cried out, her frustration evident.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he soothed. \u201cYou\u2019re a good wife.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He rolled his eyes heavenward. He didn\u2019t know what she expected from him. He guessed she\u2019d tell him when she got herself under control, and he patiently waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been remiss in my duties. All that\u2019s in the past, however. I shall start teaching your men proper manners at dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Johanna,\u201d he began, a warning in his voice. \u201cThe men are . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you interfere, Gabriel. You needn\u2019t worry. Your soldiers will listen to my instructions. Do you think you\u2019ll be home by dinner?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was confused by the question. He was home now, damn it all, and dinner would be served in just a few minutes. Still, she was rattled now, he reminded himself. Perhaps she didn\u2019t realize what time it was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home now,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAnd dinner . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cYou have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo and get Alex, husband. I\u2019ve been very patient with you,\u201d she added when he started frowning. \u201cYour son should be home when Mama gets here. Alex will probably need a bath, too. I\u2019ll put him in the creek with Dumfries. God only knows what manners your son\u2019s been taught. Probably none.\u201d She paused to sigh. \u201cGo and fetch him.\u201d</p><p>She tried to leave the hall after giving him that order. He caught hold of her and forced her to turn around to look at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do not give me commands, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you take this opportunity to become surly, husband. I don\u2019t have time to placate you today. I have important duties to see to,\u201d she added. \u201cI want Alex home. Do you want to shame me in front of my mama?\u201d</p><p>She seemed appalled by that possibility. Gabriel let out a loud sigh. He barely remembered his own mother and therefore couldn\u2019t imagine why Johanna would become so agitated over a visitation. It was obviously important that all go well, however.</p><p>And he did want his wife to be happy. He decided to tell her the true reason.</p> <p>\u201cAlex stays with his relatives until . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wall\u2019s taking forever,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cThere is another reason, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him here until the Maclaurins and the MacBains have put their differences aside. I don\u2019t want Alex to suffer any . . . slights.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d been struggling to get away from his grasp until he gave her that explanation. Then she went completely still. Her expression was incredulous.</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone slight Alex? He\u2019s your son, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou claim him. You can\u2019t change your mind now. Alex believes you\u2019re his father, Gabriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put his hand over her mouth to get her to cease her instructions to him. His smile was filled with tenderness, for it occurred to him that his gentle wife had never once considered denying Alex\u2019s rightful place in their household. Hell, she was demanding fair treatment.</p><p>She deserved to understand his motives for keeping the boy away. Gabriel dragged her over to a chair. He sat down, then pulled her onto his lap.</p> <p>She immediately turned timid. She wasn\u2019t used to sitting on her husband\u2019s lap. Anyone could walk in and see them together. She worried over that possibility for a moment or two, then pushed the concern aside. What did she care what others thought? Gabriel was her husband, after all. It was his right. Besides, she liked being held by him.</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth she was beginning to like him more than she\u2019d ever thought was possible.</p><p>\u201cQuit daydreaming,\u201d Gabriel ordered when he saw the look on her face. She did look as though she was dreaming as she stared off into space. \u201cI want to explain something to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, husband?\u201d</p><p>She put her arm around his neck and began to stroke his skin. He told her to stop, but she ignored his command. He frowned in reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhen the Maclaurins were in such desperate need of a leader to battle the English, they sent a contingent to me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, frowning now for she couldn\u2019t imagine why Gabriel wanted to tell her what she already knew. She didn\u2019t interrupt him, however. He looked intense, and it would have been rude for her to interrupt him with the news that she already knew the reason why he was now laird. Nicholas had explained the situation to her, and Father MacKechnie had been happy to give her more details.</p><p>There was also the fact that this was the first time Gabriel was taking the time to share his concerns with her. Whether he realized it or not, he was making her feel involved in his life and important.</p> <p>\u201cPlease continue,\u201d she requested.</p><p>\u201cAfter the battle was finished and the English were no longer a threat, the Maclaurins were content to have me for their leader. Of course, they weren\u2019t given the option,\u201d he added with a nod. \u201cThey weren\u2019t as receptive to my followers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the MacBain soldiers fight with the Maclaurins against the English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t the Maclaurins thankful now? Have they forgotten?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cNot all of the MacBains could fight. Auggie is one example. He\u2019s too old for battle now. I thought, given time, the Maclaurins and the MacBains would learn to adjust, but now I realize that isn\u2019t going to happen. My patience is at an end, wife. The men will either get along and work together or suffer my displeasure.\u201d</p><p>He was growling just like Dumfries by the time he finished his explanation. She stroked the side of his neck. \u201cWhat happens when you\u2019re displeased?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI usually kill someone.\u201d</p><p>She was certain he was jesting with her. She smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t allow fights in my house, husband. You\u2019ll have to do your killing somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>He was too stunned by what she\u2019d just said to take exception to her command. Johanna had just called the keep her house. It was a first, for until this moment, she\u2019d always referred to everything as his. Gabriel hadn\u2019t realized how much her separation, deliberate or not, had bothered him.</p><p>\u201cIs this your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cJohanna, I want you to be happy here.\u201d</p><p>He sounded puzzled by his own admission. She couldn\u2019t help but become a little disgruntled over that notice.</p><p>\u201cYou sound surprised,\u201d she said. Lord, he had beautiful eyes. She thought she could be content to look at her husband all day long and not grow bored. He really was a handsome devil.</p><p>\u201cI am surprised,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>He suddenly wanted to kiss her. Her mouth was so damned appealing to him. So were her eyes. They were the clearest color of blue he\u2019d ever seen. Hell, he even liked the way she frowned at him. He had to shake his head over that foolish realization. Wives should never let their husbands see their displeasure . . . should they?</p><p>\u201cSome husbands want their wives to be happy,\u201d Johanna decided aloud. \u201cMy father certainly wanted Mama to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did your mother want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo love my father,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t about to tell him she wanted to love him. Such a declaration would make her vulnerable . . . wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cI know what you want,\u201d she blurted out in an attempt to take the attention away from her feelings. \u201cYou want me to sit by the fire and sew at night and rest my days away. That\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d become almost rigid in his arms. She wasn\u2019t stroking his neck now either. She was pulling his hair. He reached up, took hold of her hand, and put it in her lap.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot one last thing,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cYou\u2019d like me to stay where you put me, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jest with me, wife. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t jesting with him, but she didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea to tell him so. She didn\u2019t want to goad his temper. She wanted him to stay in a good mood so he would let her have her way.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to skin a fish,\u201d she announced.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what the hell she was talking about. He didn\u2019t think she did either. For that reason he didn\u2019t ask her to explain.</p><p>\u201cI believed, given time, that we would get used to each other,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou make us sound like the Maclaurins and the MacBains,\u201d she countered. \u201cAre you getting used to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s taking longer than I expected,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He was deliberately getting her riled. Johanna was trying not to let him see how upset she was becoming. The proof was in her eyes, however. They were now the color of blue fire. Aye, she was irritated all right.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had much experience with marriage,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou weren\u2019t married. You were in bondage. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fault his reasoning. She had been in bondage. However, she didn\u2019t want to dwell on her past. \u201cAnd just what does my first marriage have to do with the topic under discussion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is the topic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she stammered out. \u201cI was explaining to you that there is always more than one way to skin a fish. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in God\u2019s name would I understand? No one skins fish here.\u201d</p><p>She thought he was being deliberately obtuse. He certainly didn\u2019t appreciate clever sayings. \u201cI meant that there is always more than one way to attain a goal.\u201d she explained. \u201cI won\u2019t have to use force to get the Maclaurins to behave. I\u2019ll use other methods.\u201d</p><p>She could tell he was finally considering the matter. She pressed her advantage. \u201cYou told me I should trust you.\u2019Tis the truth you ordered me to,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cNow I will give you the same command. Trust me to take care of Alex. Please bring him home.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny her. \u201cVery well,\u201d he agreed with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll get him tomorrow, but he\u2019ll only come here for a short visitation. If all goes well, then he\u2019ll stay. Otherwise . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have him put in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>She tried to get off his lap. He stopped her by grabbing hold of her.</p><p>\u201cJohanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes for a long minute. He believed she was thinking the question over before she gave her answer. The possibility chafed. They\u2019d been married for over three months now, and that was surely time enough for her to learn to trust him.</p><p>\u201cYour hesitation irritates me,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem particularly bothered by that fact. She touched the side of his face with her hand. \u201cI can tell it does,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes, Gabriel, I trust you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed him. The wonder in her voice, added to the show of affection, made him smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed until he realized she was being serious. \u201cA warrior doesn\u2019t trust anyone, Johanna, but his laird, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusbands should trust wives, shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary.\u201d He rubbed his jaw, then added, \u201cNay, it would be foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me want to tear my hair out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegging your pardon, mistress,\u201d Hilda called out from the doorway. \u201cMay I have a moment of your time?\u201d</p><p>Johanna jumped off her husband\u2019s lap. She was blushing by the time she turned to the cook and bid her enter the hall.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s sitting with Clare?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFather MacKechnie\u2019s with her now,\u201d Hilda answered. \u201cShe wanted to speak to him.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. Gabriel stood up. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me she was awake?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to answer but started for the steps. Johanna hurried after him. \u201cI promised her she could stay here,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Her husband didn\u2019t answer her. She pushed Dumfries out of her way and chased her husband up the steps.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking to do?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to talk to her, Johanna. You needn\u2019t worry. \u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t up to a long conversation, husband, and Father MacKechnie might be hearing her confession now. You shouldn\u2019t interrupt.\u201d</p><p>The priest was just opening the door to come out when Gabriel reached the chamber. He nodded to Father MacKechnie as he passed him. Johanna was right behind her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou will wait here while I talk to her,\u201d Gabriel commanded.</p><p>\u201cBut she might be afraid of you, husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll have to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>He shut the door in his wife\u2019s face. Johanna didn\u2019t have time to be outraged over his rudeness. She was too worried about Clare MacKay.</p><p>She put her ear to the door and tried to listen. Father MacKechnie shook his head and pulled her away.</p><p>\u201cLet your husband have his privacy,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYou should know by now our laird would never hurt a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do know that,\u201d Johanna rushed out. \u201cStill, Clare MacKay wouldn\u2019t know, would she?\u201d</p><p>The priest didn\u2019t have an answer for her. She turned the topic then. \u201cDid you hear Clare\u2019s confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s shoulders slumped. Father MacKechnie thought that was an odd reaction. \u201cConfession\u2019s a sacrament.\u201d he reminded his mistress. \u201cShe wanted absolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what price?\u201d Johanna asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not understanding your question, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe penance,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cIt was severe, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I cannot discuss the penance,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBishop Hallwick liked to boast about his penances,\u201d Johanna blurted out.</p><p>The priest demanded several examples. The one that most repelled her she saved for last. \u201cOne leg for one egg,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bishop laughed after he suggested that punishment to my first husband to inflict upon a serving girl.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie plied her with questions, and when she\u2019d given him her answers, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ashamed to hear this,\u201d he admitted, \u201cfor I would like to believe all priests are good men doing God\u2019s important work here. Bishop Hallwick will have his day of reckoning when he stands before his Maker and tries to explain away his deliberate cruelty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Father, the church stands behind the bishop. He takes his penances from the good book. Why, even the length of the stick is given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What stick?\u201d the priest asked, thoroughly confused.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. \u201cThe church dictates how a husband and wife should behave,\u201d she told him. \u201cA submissive wife is a good and holy wife. The church approves beating women and, in fact, recommends such punishment because women will try to rule their husbands if they\u2019re not kept submissive.\u201d</p><p>She paused to take a breath. Discussing the topic was upsetting to her, but she didn\u2019t want the priest to see her distress. He might ask her why she was distraught, and then she\u2019d have to confess a dark and surely mortal sin.</p><p>\u201cThe church frowns on murder, of course. A husband shouldn\u2019t beat his wife to death. A stick is preferred over a fist. It should be wooden, not metal, and no more than this long.\u201d</p><p>She held her hands out to show him the measurement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere did you hear these rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBishop Hallwick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone in the church believes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re supposed to believe,\u201d she interrupted, her agitation apparent now. She was wringing her hands together and trying not to let the priest see how close she was to losing her composure.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is that, lass?\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he understand? He was a priest, after all, and should be most familiar with the rules governing women.</p><p>\u201cBecause women are last in God\u2019s love,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Father MacKechnie kept his expression contained. He took hold of Johanna\u2019s arm and led her down the hallway. He didn\u2019t want his laird to come outside and see his wife in such a distressed state.</p><p>There was a bench against the wall adjacent to the steps. The priest sat down, then patted the spot next to him. She immediately sat down. Her head was bowed, and she pretended great interest in straightening the pleats of her plaid.</p> <p>Father MacKechnie waited another minute or two for his mistress to regain her composure before he asked her to explain her last remark.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know women are last in God\u2019s love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hierarchy,\u201d she answered. She repeated from memory what she\u2019d been taught, her head bowed all the while. When she was finished, she still refused to look at the priest.</p><p>He leaned back against the wall. \u201cWell, now,\u201d he began. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me quite a list to mull over in my mind. Tell me this, Johanna. Do you truly believe dim-witted oxen . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dull-witted, Father,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAll right then,\u201d he agreed. \u201cDo you believe dull-witted oxen will have a higher place in heaven than women?\u201d</p> <p>Father MacKechnie was such a good man. She didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. She wasn\u2019t going to lie to the priest though, no matter what the consequences.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. She glanced up to see how her denial affected the priest. He didn\u2019t look horrified. She took a breath and then blurted out, \u201cI don\u2019t believe any of it. I\u2019m a heretic. Father, and will surely burn in hell.\u201d</p><p>The priest shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it either,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense made up by frightened men.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back now. She was clearly astonished by Father MacKechnie\u2019s attitude. \u201cBut the church\u2019s teachings ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe teachings are interpreted by men, Johanna. Don\u2019t be forgetting that important fact.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of her hand. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a heretic,\u201d he announced. \u201cAnd now I want you to listen to what I have to say. There is but one God. Johanna, but two ways of looking at Him. There\u2019s the English way and the Highlander\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the English pray to a vengeful God,\u201d Father MacKechnie explained. \u201cThe children are raised to fear Him. They are taught not to sin because of the terrible retaliation in the next life, you see. The Highlanders are different, though certainly no less loved by God. Do you know what the word clan means?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChildren.\u201d she answered.</p><p>The priest nodded. \u201cWe teach our children to love God, not fear Him. He is compared to a kind, good-hearted father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if a Highlander sins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he is repentant, he will be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>She thought about his explanation a long while before she spoke again. \u201cThen I am not damned because I don\u2019t believe God loves women least of all?\u201d</p><p>The priest smiled. \u201cNo. you are not damned,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou have as much value as any man. To tell you the truth, lass, I don\u2019t believe God keeps a list or hierarchy.\u201d</p><p>She was so relieved to hear she wasn\u2019t alone in her opinions and that she wasn\u2019t a heretic because she refused to believe Bishop Hallwick\u2019s dictates, she wanted to weep. \u201cI don\u2019t believe God wants women beaten into submission,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t understand why the church has so many cruel rules against women.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie let out a sigh. \u201cFrightened men came up with these rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would they be afraid of. Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen, of course. Now don\u2019t go repeating this to anyone, Johanna, but there are actually some men of God who believe women are superior. They don\u2019t want them to get the upper hand. They believe, too, that women use their bodies to get what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome women probably do,\u201d Johanna agreed. \u201cBut only some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the priest said. \u201cWomen are certainly stronger. No one can dispute that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t stronger,\u201d Johanna protested, smiling now for she was certain the priest was jesting with her.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Father MacKechnie countered. Her smile proved contagious, and he couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cThink many men would have more than one child if they were the ones suffering through childbirth?\u201d</p><p>Johanna laughed. The priest had painted an outrageous picture.</p><p>\u201cWomen have been given a harsh lot in this life,\u201d Father MacKechnie continued. \u201cYet they survive and, in fact, find ways to flourish in such a restrictive setting. They certainly have to be more clever than men, lass, to get their voices heard.\u201d</p><p>The door opened to Clare MacKay\u2019s chamber, and Gabriel came out. He turned to pull the door closed behind him.</p><p>Both Johanna and Father MacKechnie stood up. \u201cThank you, Father,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve helped me sort out a difficult problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the look on your husband\u2019s face, I would wager he could use a little help sorting out his problem.\u201d He\u2019d whispered his remark, then raised his voice when he turned to his laird. \u201cDid your conference go well, Laird MacBain?\u201d</p><p>The scowl on Gabriel\u2019s face should have been proof enough to the priest that the conference hadn\u2019t gone well. Johanna decided Father MacKechnie was just trying to be diplomatic.</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cShe refuses to name the man responsible,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she didn\u2019t know his name,\u201d Johanna suggested, instinctively coming to Clare MacKay\u2019s defense.</p><p>\u201cShe told me she spent a full night with the soldier, Johanna. Do you honestly believe she didn\u2019t bother getting his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, you needn\u2019t raise your voice to me.\u201d</p><p>After giving her husband a good frown, she tried to walk around him so she could go to Clare\u2019s room. Her husband grabbed hold of her arm.</p><p>\u201cLet her rest,\u201d he commanded. \u201cShe fell asleep during my questions.\u201d He turned his attention to the priest and added, \u201cIf her face wasn\u2019t distorted from the beating, I would have each one of my men come up here and look at her. Perhaps seeing her would nudge their memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you believe a MacBain ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe one of my own is responsible.\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cMy men are honorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Clare say it was a MacBain?\u201d Johanna asked. He shook his head. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t answer that question either,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMacBain, Keith\u2019s back from the MacKay holding!\u201d</p><p>Calum shouted the announcement from the entryway. Gabriel nodded to the priest, let go of his wife\u2019s arm, and went downstairs. He fairly ripped the doors off their hinges and went outside. Calum hurried to keep up with his laird. The doors slammed shut behind the two warriors.</p><p>Johanna spent the next hour wrestling with Dumfries while she removed his stitches. He carried on like a baby; and when she was finally finished poking at him, she spent a long while soothing him. She was sitting on the floor. Dumfries obviously didn\u2019t realize how big he was, for he tried to climb onto her lap.</p><p>She was certain she smelled as horrid as the dog and decided it was high time Dumfries had a proper bath. Megan fetched her a rope. Johanna looped one end around the dog\u2019s neck, collected her container of rose-scented soap, and dragged the hound out the back door and down the hill.</p><p>She ran into Glynis at the water well. Johanna was already a bit out of sorts. The constant worry about Clare MacKay preyed on her mind, and Dumfries\u2019s shameful behavior was draining her strength. Her arms ached from dragging him along. Johanna believed she would have been able to control her anger if she\u2019d been in a better frame of mind.</p><p>Glynis was polite enough to call out a proper greeting to her mistress before asking about Clare MacKay. \u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking of letting that whore sleep under the same roof with our laird, are you?\u201d</p><p>Johanna came to a dead stop. She slowly turned to look at the Maclaurin woman. \u201cClare MacKay isn\u2019t a whore!\u201d she shouted at the woman. She was about to add a forceful thought or two about the rewards Glynis would receive in the next life if she showed compassion now but changed her mind. Glynis deserved a good kick in her backside. Johanna resisted the impulse and decided to give her a kick in her arrogance instead.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to raise my voice to you, Glynis, for it isn\u2019t your fault you were led to believe Clare MacKay was a whore. Still, given your nickname, I would think you above all others would reserve judgment until you had all the facts. The Maclaurins wouldn\u2019t have given you such a name if you weren\u2019t worthy, now would they?\u201d she asked. She nodded to the other women lined up at the wall.</p><p>Glynis shook her head. She looked confused and wary. Johanna sweetened her smile. \u201cWe have only Laird MacInnes\u2019s word that Clare didn\u2019t act honorably, and we aren\u2019t about to believe anything that man tells us, are we now? Clare\u2019s a welcomed guest in my house. I expect her to be treated with dignity and respect. Do excuse me now. Dumfries and I are going to Rush Creek. Good day, Glynis.\u201d</p><p>Johanna tightened her hold on her rope and walked away. She started counting. She could hear the women whispering among themselves behind her. She doubted Glynis would be able to contain her curiosity for more than a minute or two.</p><p>She was wrong. The Maclaurin woman called out to her before Johanna had even reached the number ten.</p><p>\u201cWhat nickname have you heard, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>Johanna slowly turned around. \u201cWhy, Glynis, I thought you knew. They call you Pure.\u201d</p><p>Glynis let out a little gasp and she visibly blanched. Johanna should have felt guilty over her lie. She didn\u2019t, though. The Maclaurin woman thought she was so terribly clever with her backhanded insults. She didn\u2019t know Johanna understood the names were actually the opposite of what they really meant.</p><p>\u201cDumfries,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwe\u2019re going to let her simmer until tomorrow. By then Glynis will have realized how cruel her game is. Then I\u2019ll tell her I made up the name.\u201d</p><p>Guilt wouldn\u2019t allow Johanna to wait that long. By the time she\u2019d bathed the dog, she was feeling miserable. She was certain that if she was struck by lightning at that very moment, she\u2019d go straight to hell.</p><p>She decided to go to Glynis\u2019s cottage and confess her sin. She was drenched from head to shoes, thanks to Dumfries\u2019s misbehaving in the creek, and she was given several stares on her way back to the well.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady, what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Leila asked her the question. She backed away from the dog and kept her gaze on the hound while she waited for her mistress to answer her.</p><p>\u201cI gave Dumfries a bath. He pushed me in the creek,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cTwice as a matter of fact. Where does Glynis live? I wish to have a word with her.\u201d</p><p>Leila pointed out the cottage. Johanna dragged the dog along by her side, muttering over his stubbornness. She reached the cottage, hesitated for only a minute while she pushed her hair out of her face, and then pounded on the door.</p><p>Glynis pulled the door open. Her eyes widened when she saw her mistress. Johanna noticed Glynis\u2019s eyes looked teary. Lord, had her cruel remark made her cry? Johanna\u2019s guilt intensified. She was a little surprised, too, for Glynis was such a big, strapping woman, almost manly in her build, she didn\u2019t think she was the sort to ever weep.</p><p>She spotted Glynis\u2019s husband sitting at the table then. She didn\u2019t want him to overhear what she was going to say.</p><p>\u201cCould you spare me a moment of your time, Glynis? I would like to speak to you in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Glynis answered. She glanced over her shoulder, then turned back to her mistress. She had a worried expression now. Johanna guessed she didn\u2019t want her husband listening in either.</p><p>Introductions were made. Glynis\u2019s husband was a head shorter than his wife. He had red hair, freckles on his face and arms, and handsome white teeth. His smile seemed sincere.</p><p>Johanna was invited inside. She declined as graciously as possible, using her sorry condition as her excuse.</p><p>She asked Glynis to please step outside instead. When the Maclaurin woman had closed the door behind her, Johanna motioned her close.</p><p>Glynis started to walk forward, then stopped. Dumfries\u2019s low growl obviously intimidated her.</p><p>Johanna ordered the dog to quit his bluster before she gave her apology.</p><p>\u201cI came here to tell you I made up the nickname. No one calls you Pure,\u201d she announced. \u201cI did it out of spite, Glynis, and I\u2019m sorry for my sin. I caused you needless worry, but in my defense I will tell you I was thinking to teach you a lesson. It stings to have the tables turned on you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Glynis didn\u2019t answer her question, but her face turned pale. Johanna nodded. \u201cI know you\u2019re the one who came up with the name for me. I also know that when you call me Courageous, you\u2019re really meaning I\u2019m a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before, m\u2019lady,\u201d Glynis stammered out.</p><p>\u201cBefore what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we knew you well and realized you weren\u2019t a coward at all.\u201d</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t going to be swayed by that bit of praise. She was certain Glynis was only trying to ease her way out of an awkward situation.</p><p>\u201cI do not care for your foolish games,\u201d she announced with a nod. \u201cFather MacKechnie boasted that the Highlanders never hide their feelings. They don\u2019t use subterfuge.\u201d</p><p>She had to take the time to explain what that word meant before continuing. \u201cI find I admire that trait, Glynis. If you think I\u2019m a coward, then have the courage to say it to my face. Don\u2019t make up silly games. They\u2019re hurtful . . . and very like something the English would do.\u201d</p><p>If Glynis nodded any more vehemently, Johanna thought her neck would snap.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell our laird?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Johanna shook her head. \u201cThis matter doesn\u2019t concern him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will stop giving nicknames, m\u2019lady,\u201d Glynis said then. \u201cAnd I apologize if you were hurt by my cruelty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you hurt by mine?\u201d</p><p>Glynis didn\u2019t answer for a long minute. Then she nodded. \u201cI was,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cThen we are even. Auggie isn\u2019t daft,\u201d she added. \u201cHe really is clever. If you spent any time at all with him, you\u2019d realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Johanna announced. \u201cWe\u2019ve settled this problem. Good day to you, Glynis.\u201d</p><p>She made a curtsy and turned to leave. Glynis followed her to the edge of the path. \u201cWe only called you Courageous until you put Dumfries back together with your threads, m\u2019lady. Then we changed your name.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was determined not to ask, but curiosity won out. \u201cAnd what did you change my name to?\u201d</p> <p>She braced herself for the insult she knew was coming.</p><p>\u201cTimid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, m\u2019lady. We call you Timid.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was suddenly in a fit mood again. She smiled all the way home.</p><p>They called her Timid. It was a fair start.</p> <p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t see her husband until dinner. The men were already seated at the two tables when she walked down the steps into the great hall. No one stood up. Gabriel wasn\u2019t there yet. Both Father MacKechnie and Keith were also absent. The servants were busy putting oblong platters of meat on the table. The aroma of the mutton filled the air. A wave of nausea caught Johanna by surprise. She thought the soldiers\u2019 behavior was the reason she was suddenly feeling ill. They were grabbing handfuls of food before the trenchers were even placed in front of them. They weren\u2019t waiting for their laird to join them or for the priest to give the blessing before dinner.</p><p>Enough was enough. Mama would have heart failure if she witnessed such shameful behavior at her dinner table. Johanna wasn\u2019t about to be shamed in front of her dear mother. She\u2019d die first. Or kill a couple of the Maclaurins, she thought to herself. They were the worse offenders, though the MacBain soldiers were certainly trying to keep up.</p><p>Megan noticed her mistress standing by the entrance. She called out to her, realized Johanna couldn\u2019t hear her over the noise the men were making, and walked across the hall to speak to her.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to have your supper?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady, you don\u2019t look well. Are you feeling all right? You\u2019re as pale as flour, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Johanna lied. She took a deep breath in an attempt to get her queasy stomach under control. \u201cPlease fetch me a large bowl. Bring one that\u2019s cracked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever for, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have to break it.\u201d</p><p>Megan thought she\u2019d misunderstood her mistress. She asked her to repeat her explanation. Johanna shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand soon enough,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Megan ran to the buttery, grabbed a heavy porcelain bowl from the shelf, and hurried back to her mistress.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s chipped,\u201d she announced. \u201cWill it do?\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cStand back, Megan. Sparks are about to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are?\u201d</p><p>Johanna called out to the soldiers first. She knew they wouldn\u2019t hear her over all the racket, but she thought she should at least attempt ladylike conduct at first. She tried clapping her hands together next. Finally she whistled. Not one of the soldiers looked up.</p><p>She gave up trying to be diplomatic. She lifted the bowl and hurled it across the room. Megan let out a loud gasp. The bowl crashed into the stone hearth and splintered to the floor.</p><p>The effect was just as she\u2019d hoped. Every man in the hall turned to look at her. They were silent, looking incredulous, and she couldn\u2019t have been more pleased.</p><p>\u201cNow that I have your attention, I have several instructions to give you.\u201d</p><p>Several mouths dropped open. Calum started to stand up. She told him to stay where he was.</p><p>\u201cYou meant to throw the bowl?\u201d Lindsay asked her that question.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cPlease listen to me,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis is my house and I would therefore appreciate it if you would follow my rules. First, and most important, none of you will eat until your laird has been seated and served. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>Most of the soldiers nodded. A few of the Maclaurins looked irritated. She ignored their frowns. Calum, she noticed, was smiling. She ignored him, too.</p><p>\u201cBut what if our laird doesn\u2019t come in for supper?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll wait until your mistress has been seated and served before you eat,\u201d she answered.</p><p>There was a considerable amount of grumbling over her dictate. Johanna held onto her patience.</p><p>The men turned back to their trenchers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished giving you my instructions,\u201d Johanna called out.</p><p>Her voice was drowned out by the clatter again. \u201cMegan, fetch me another bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut m\u2019lady . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Less than a minute passed before Megan handed her mistress a second bowl. Johanna immediately hurled it at the hearth. The loud crash turned everyone\u2019s attention again. Several of the Maclaurin soldiers were giving her surly looks now. She decided a threat or two would be appropriate retaliation.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t throw the next bowl at the hearth,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019ll throw it at one of your heads if you don\u2019t pay attention to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to eat, m\u2019lady,\u201d another soldier shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wanting your attention first,\u201d she replied. \u201cListen carefully. When a lady enters the room, the men stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou interrupted our supper to tell us that?\u201d Lindsay shouted. He added a nervous laugh and nudged his neighbor\u2019s side with his elbow.</p><p>She put her hands on her h*ps and repeated her dictate. Then she waited. She was pleased to see every soldier finally stand up.</p><p>She smiled, satisfied. \u201cYou may sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just told us to stand up,\u201d another Maclaurin muttered.</p><p>Lord, they were dense. She tried to hide her exasperation. \u201cYou stand when a lady enters, and you sit when she gives you permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do when she comes in and then goes right back out again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stand, then sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a nuisance to me,\u201d another Maclaurin remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you manners even if it kills you,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Calum started laughing, but her glare stopped him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Niall asked. \u201cWhat do we need manners for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo please me,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any more belching at my tables,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t belch?\u201d Calum asked, looking astonished.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t!\u201d she said in a near shout. \u201cYou can\u2019t make any other rude noises either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a compliment, m\u2019lady,\u201d Niall explained. \u201cIf the food and drink are good, a belch is due praise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you enjoy your food, you\u2019ll simply tell your host it was a fine meal,\u201d she instructed. \u201cAnd while we\u2019re on the topic of food. I\u2019ll tell you I find it gravely offensive when I see one of you ripping food from your neighbor\u2019s trencher. That\u2019s going to stop right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut m\u2019lady\u2014\u201d Lindsay began.</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to slam your goblets together when you give a toast,\u201d she announced. \u201cThe ale spills everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do it on purpose,\u201d Calum explained.</p><p>Her eyes widened over that admission. Niall hurried to tell her why. \u201cWhen we toast, we make certain some of our ale spills into the other goblets. That way, if there\u2019s poison in one, everyone will die. Don\u2019t you see, m\u2019lady? We do it to ensure no one will try trickery.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. Were the Maclaurins and the MacBains that suspicious of each other?</p><p>The Maclaurins dared to turn their backs on her again. Johanna was infuriated by their rudeness. They were being deliberately loud now in their bid to drown out her voice.</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fetching it, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Johanna lifted the pitcher in the air, turned toward the Maclaurin table, and was just about to throw the thing when it was snatched out of her hand. She turned around and found Gabriel standing right behind her. Keith and Father MacKechnie flanked his sides.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any idea how long they\u2019d been standing there, but the stunned look on Father MacKechnie\u2019s face indicated it had been long enough.</p><p>She could feel herself blushing. No wife wished to be caught screaming like a shrew or throwing things to get attention. Johanna wasn\u2019t about to let her embarrassment deter her, however. She\u2019d started this and by God she was going to finish it.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you doing, wife?\u201d</p><p>His deep tone of voice, added to his frown, made her wince. She took a deep breath, then said, \u201cDo stay out of this. I\u2019m in the middle of giving my instructions to the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one seems to be paying you any attention, m\u2019lady,\u201d Keith pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDid you just tell me you want me to stay out . . .\u201d Gabriel was too flabbergasted to continue.</p><p>She caught the gist of what he wanted to say. \u201cYes, I do want you to stay out of this,\u201d she agreed before turning her attention to Keith. \u201cThey will pay attention or suffer my displeasure,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when you\u2019re displeased?\u201d the Maclaurin soldier asked.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think of a suitable answer. Then she remembered what Gabriel had said he\u2019d do when he was displeased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably kill someone,\u201d she boasted.</p><p>She was certain she\u2019d impressed the Maclaurin soldier with that announcement. She added a nod so he wouldn\u2019t know she was bluffing and waited for his reaction.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what she expected. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing the wrong plaid, m\u2019lady. Today\u2019s Saturday.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly wanted to strangle Keith. A loud belch sounded behind her. She reacted as though she\u2019d just been stabbed in the back. She let out a loud gasp, snatched the pitcher out of her husband\u2019s hand, and turned to the men.</p><p>Gabriel caught her before she could do any damage. He tossed the pitcher to Keith, then turned her around to face him.</p><p>\u201cI asked you not to interfere,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cJohanna . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this my home or isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you thanking me?\u201d he asked, wary now. She was up to something all right. The glint in her eyes told him so.</p><p>\u201cYou just agreed to help me,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is my home, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we back to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I would like a free hand in the running of my household. Please?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He let out a sigh. Damn but it was impossible for him to deny her anything. He wasn\u2019t even certain what he was agreeing to, but he still nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow many more bowls and pitchers will you throw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs many as it takes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She turned around and hurried over to stand at the head of the Maclaurin table.</p><p>\u201cKeith, if you\u2019ll take one end, and Father, if you would be so good as to lift the other end, I\u2019ll run ahead and hold the doors open. Gentlemen,\u201d she added, her gaze directed on the soldiers seated at the table now, \u201cplease help by carrying your stools. This shouldn\u2019t take us any time at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking to do?\u201d Keith asked.</p><p>\u201cMoving the table outside, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make the Maclaurins happy,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey\u2019re part of my clan now and I believe they should be content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t want to move outside,\u201d Lindsay blurted out. \u201cWhy would you think we would? I only just got the honor of eating with my laird. I want to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Johanna countered. She smiled just to confuse the warrior.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll all be much more content outside because you won\u2019t have to follow any of the rules of my household then.\u2019Tis the truth you all eat like animals. You might as well eat with them. Dumfries will be happy for the company.\u201d</p><p>All of the Maclaurins looked at Keith. He looked at his laird, received his nod, and then cleared his throat. It was up to him to set his mistress straight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you understand the situation here, m\u2019lady. This keep has belonged to the Maclaurin clan for as long as anyone can remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, m\u2019lady ...\u201d Keith began.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she mean when she says our land belongs to her?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>Johanna folded her hands together. Gabriel walked over to stand next to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to explain, but only once, so please try to follow along,\u201d she said. \u201cYour king bartered this land away. Is everyone here in agreement with that fact?\u201d</p><p>She waited until the soldiers nodded. \u201cKing John gave the holding to me. Does everyone agree with that fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Keith agreed. \u201cBut you see . . .\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cPray forgive me for interrupting you, but I\u2019m anxious to finish this explanation.\u201d</p><p>She turned her attention back to the soldiers. \u201cNow then\u2014and do pay attention, please, for I hate repeating myself\u2014when I married your laird, the land became his. Do you see how simple it is?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze settled on Lindsay. He nodded to make her happy. She smiled. The room suddenly started to spin. She blinked, trying to bring everyone back into focus. She grabbed hold of the edge of the table to balance herself. A wave of nausea washed over her, then just as rapidly disappeared. It was the meat, she thought to herself. The awful smell was making her sick.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying, lass?\u201d Father MacKechnie prodded, beaming with satisfaction over the gumption his mistress was showing in front of the men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got her so riled, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t know who asked that question. It came from the MacBain table. She turned her gaze to those men and answered.</p><p>\u201cMegan said something the other day that took me by surprise,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve mulled it over in my mind, and I still don\u2019t understand why she would make such a comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Megan asked. She hurried over to stand on the opposite side of the Maclaurin table so she could face her mistress.</p> <p>\u201cYou told me Cook would be happy to do anything I asked because she was a MacBain and knew better than to complain. I wondered what you meant, of course, but now I think I understand. You actually believe Hilda should be thankful she\u2019s allowed to live here. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth she should be thankful.\u201d</p><p>The Maclaurin soldiers all nodded in unison.</p><p>Johanna shook her head at them. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve all got it backward,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Maclaurins don\u2019t have any claim to this keep or this land, and that, gentlemen, is also fact. My husband happens to be a MacBain. Have you forgotten that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father was laird over the Maclaurins,\u201d Keith interjected.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s still a MacBain,\u201d she pointed out again. \u201cHe\u2019s been very accommodating. He\u2019s more patient than I am,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cRegardless, I believe the MacBains have graciously allowed all of you Maclaurins to stay on. I really hate to bring this prickly topic up now, but I\u2019ve received important news, you see, and I really must get my household in order. It would sadden me to see you leave, but if the rules are too difficult for you to follow, and if you can\u2019t get along with the MacBains, then I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s much choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the MacBains are the outsiders,\u201d Lindsay stammered out.</p><p>\u201cAye, they are,\u201d Keith agreed.</p><p>\u201cThey were,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t now. Do you see?\u201d</p><p>No one did see. Johanna wondered if they were just being incredibly stubborn or just plain ignorant. She decided to try to make them understand one last time.</p><p>Gabriel wouldn\u2019t let her. He pulled her back and took a step forward.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m laird here,\u201d he reminded the soldiers. \u201cI decide who stays and who goes.\u201d</p><p>Keith immediately nodded agreement. \u201cAre we allowed to speak freely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Gabriel replied.</p><p>\u201cEvery one of us has pledged our loyalty to you,\u201d he began. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t particularly loyal to your followers. We\u2019re weary of war and want to rebuild before we go into battle again. Yet one of the MacBains has instigated war with the MacInnes clan and now refuses to come forward and admit his transgression. Such behavior is cowardly.\u201d</p><p>Calum jumped to his feet. \u201cYou dare call us cowards?\u201d</p><p>Dear God, what had she started? Johanna was feeling sick again. She was certainly sorry she\u2019d said anything. Two of the Maclaurins stood up. A fight was brewing all right, and it was all her doing. Gabriel didn\u2019t seem inclined to put a stop to it either. He looked completely unaffected by the threatening atmosphere, almost bored in fact.</p><p>A confrontation was finally taking place, and Gabriel was damned happy about it. He would let each warrior vent his anger, then explain what was going to happen. Those who didn\u2019t wish to go along with his decisions could leave.</p><p>Unfortunately Johanna looked upset over what was happening. Her face was stark white now, and she was gripping her hands together. Gabriel decided to take the argument outside. He was just about to give that command when his wife stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cCalum, Keith didn\u2019t call you a coward,\u201d she cried out. She turned her gaze to the Maclaurin soldier then. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, sir, for you had already left on your errand to speak to Clare MacKay\u2019s father,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cYou see, my husband asked each one of his followers if he had . . . involved himself with Clare, and each man denied any knowledge of the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut did each man tell the truth?\u201d Keith challenged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you a question in answer,\u201d she countered. \u201cIf Laird MacInnes blamed a Maclaurin and every one of you gave your laird your denial, would you expect him to believe you?\u201d</p><p>Keith was clever enough to know where she was going with the question. He reluctantly nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I both have complete faith in his followers. If the men say they didn\u2019t touch Clare MacKay, then they didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand you, sir. How can you take the word of a mean-hearted MacInnes over one of your own?\u201d</p><p>No one had a quick answer to that question. Johanna shook her head again. She was feeling terribly ill now. Her face felt as though it was on fire, yet her arms were covered with goosebumps. She wanted to lean against her husband, but held back, for she didn\u2019t want him to know she wasn\u2019t feeling well. She didn\u2019t want to upset him. She also didn\u2019t want to spend the next year in bed; and knowing Gabriel\u2019s obsession with rest, she was certain that\u2019s what would happen.</p><p>Johanna decided to go up to her chamber and wash her face. Surely cold water would help revive her.</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate it if everyone of you would consider what I\u2019ve just explained,\u201d she requested. \u201cI can\u2019t have bickering in my home. If you\u2019ll excuse me now. I\u2019ll go up to my chamber.\u201d</p><p>She turned to leave. Then she stopped and turned around again. \u201cWhen a lady leaves the room, the men stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go again,\u201d a Maclaurin whispered loud enough for her to hear.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The men stood. She smiled, satisfied. Then she turned to leave. The room suddenly started spinning. She didn\u2019t have anything to hold onto until everything settled back where it was supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cYou did call me a coward, Keith,\u201d Calum muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to believe I did, then do so, Calum,\u201d Keith replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the important news m\u2019lady said she just received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d Johanna\u2019s voice was weak, but he still heard her.</p><p>He turned around. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>He caught her before she hit the floor. Everyone started shouting at the same time. Father MacKechnie thought he might faint when he saw how ill his mistress looked.</p><p>\u201cClear the table,\u201d he shouted. \u201cWe\u2019ll put her there.\u201d</p><p>Niall and Lindsay swept their arms across the linen cloth. Trenchers and food went flying. Megan pulled the linen cloth off.</p><p>\u201cSomeone fetch a healer for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Niall bellowed. \u201cM\u2019lady needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our healer,\u201d Calum snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat made her swoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking we did,\u201d Lindsay decided. \u201cWe got her all riled up. It was too much for her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was the only one who didn\u2019t seem overly concerned about his wife. Her face did look pale to him, but he didn\u2019t think she was really sick.</p><p>He\u2019d noticed how upset she became when the men started shouting at each other. She had an aversion to fighting, he knew, and he therefore concluded her faint was just a clever ploy to turn the men\u2019s attention away from their argument.</p><p>She\u2019d gone a little overboard, of course, and he\u2019d tell her just that when they were alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all our fault, all right, making her throw bowls to get our attention,\u201d Niall said. \u201cShe wants us to have some manners. I can\u2019t figure out why, but I\u2019m thinking we\u2019d best be more cooperative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d another Maclaurin named Michael agreed. \u201cWe can\u2019t have her swooning all the time. Laird MacBain might not be close enough to catch her next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove back, men,\u201d Father MacKechnie ordered. \u201cGive the lass some room to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is breathing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Calum, she\u2019s breathing,\u201d the priest answered. \u201cYour concern for your mistress is praiseworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our mistress today,\u201d Lindsay commented. \u201cShe\u2019s wearing our plaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s Saturday,\u201d Keith interjected. \u201cShe\u2019s wearing the wrong plaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t seem to get it right, can she?\u201d Calum asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you hesitating, MacBain? Put the lass on the table,\u201d Father MacKechnie said. \u201cMen, get out of your laird\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>The men immediately moved back. As soon as Gabriel placed his wife on the table, they all moved forward again. At least twenty faces loomed over her. Everyone was frowning with concern for Johanna.</p><p>Gabriel felt like smiling. The soldiers had their differences, of course, but they were united now in their worry about their mistress. Johanna was neither a Maclaurin nor a MacBain by birth. She was English. If the men could give her their loyalty, they could damned well learn to get along with each other.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t she open her eyes?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t appear to be finished with her faint just yet,\u201d the priest replied.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give her the last rites, Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we do something?\u201d Calum asked the question and added a frown in his laird\u2019s direction. It was apparent he expected Gabriel to fix whatever was ailing his wife.</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019ll wake up in a minute or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have upset her,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she suddenly get a bee up her . . . arm?\u201d Lindsay quickly substituted the last word for the one he was going to use when he caught the priest\u2019s frown.</p><p>\u201cIt was our manners that set her off,\u201d Bryan reminded the group.</p><p>\u201cBut why now, I\u2019m wondering,\u201d Lindsay blurted out. \u201cM\u2019lady didn\u2019t seem to mind what we were doing until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mother\u2019s coming for a visitation.\u201d</p><p>Their laird gave them the announcement. There was a collective and drawn-out \u201cAh\u201d over the revelation.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder she\u2019s wanting us to have some manners,\u201d Michael said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cPoor lass,\u201d Keith whispered. \u201cShe must be worried we\u2019ll shame her in front of her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense to me,\u201d Calum agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best get some manners then,\u201d Lindsay suggested. He let out a sigh. \u201cShe did kill Pet, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd three more,\u201d Keith reminded the soldier. Gabriel was beginning to wonder how long Johanna was going to drag out her swoon when she suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p>She almost let out a scream but stopped herself in time, letting out a loud gasp instead. She stared up at all the soldiers staring down at her while she struggled to get over her startle.</p><p>It took her a minute or two to realize she was stretched out on top of the dinner table. She couldn\u2019t imagine how she\u2019d gotten there.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I on the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was closer than your bed, m\u2019lady,\u201d Calum answered.</p><p>\u201cYou swooned,\u201d Keith added in case she\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us your mother was coming for a visitation?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>Johanna tried to sit up before answering the question. Father MacKechnie put his hand on her shoulder to hold her down. \u201cYou\u2019d best stay right where you are, lass. Your husband will be happy to carry you up to bed. Are you feeling better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d she answered. \u201cI really fainted? I\u2019ve never, ever fainted before. I can\u2019t imagine why . . .\u201d</p><p>Lindsay decided to give her his explanation before she asked for it. \u201cIt was our manners that set you off, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was?\u201d</p><p>The soldier nodded. \u201cShe should stay in bed a week at least,\u201d Keith recommended.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go to bed,\u201d Johanna argued.</p><p>No one paid any attention to her protest. \u201cI\u2019m saying she should stay in bed two weeks,\u201d Calum announced. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to be certain she\u2019ll regain her strength. She\u2019s puny if you\u2019ll remember,\u201d he advised.</p><p>The men nodded. Johanna was outraged. \u201cI\u2019m not puny,\u201d she announced in a near shout. \u201cFather, do let me up. I can\u2019t go to bed. I have to take my turn sitting with Clare MacKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to sit with her,\u201d Megan offered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fair letting only MacBain women tend to her. You don\u2019t want the Maclaurin women bickering over the slight, do you now, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, now isn\u2019t the time to bring up that concern,\u201d Keith muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe MacBain women were the only ones who offered to help with Clare,\u201d Johanna explained.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m offering now,\u201d Megan insisted.</p><p>\u201cThen I thank you and will certainly appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>Megan smiled. She was obviously satisfied with her mistress\u2019s gratitude.</p><p>Johanna put the matter aside and turned her attention to her husband. She\u2019d been deliberately avoiding looking at him, for she knew he\u2019d be frowning and surely getting ready to pounce on her with his I-told-you-you-were-weak reminder. She mentally braced herself and turned her gaze. Gabriel was easy to find in the crowd as he towered over his soldiers. He stood to the left of the table, behind Calum.</p><p>Her husband was smiling, which fairly stunned Johanna. She was certain he\u2019d be furious or worried at the very least. She should have been relieved over his obviously cheerful mood, but she wasn\u2019t. She had fainted after all, and Gabriel had proven to be quite a worrier about her well-being in the past. Yet he looked . . . happy now. Did he find her faint amusing?</p><p>She gave Gabriel a disgruntled look, and he winked back, which confused her.</p><p>\u201cWhen is your mother coming here?\u201d Keith asked her then.</p><p>She didn\u2019t take her gaze off her husband when she gave the Maclaurin soldier her answer. \u201cIn two or three months,\u201d she guessed. She smiled up at Father MacKechnie then and gently removed his hand from her shoulder so she could sit up.</p><p>Calum tried to lift her into his arms. Keith tried to assist her from the other side of the table. Johanna was suddenly being pulled every which way.</p><p>Gabriel finally intervened. He pushed Calum out of his way and took his wife into his arms.</p><p>\u201cRest your head on my shoulder,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t quick enough, so he shoved her head there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He carried her out of the hall and up the stairs. She protested most of the way. \u201cI\u2019m feeling fine now,\u201d she argued. \u201cI can walk, husband. Do put me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to carry you,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do after all the trouble you went to convincing my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he answered.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have any idea what he was talking about. His smile was even more confusing to her. \u201cYou act as though my faint amused you,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Gabriel opened the door to their bedchamber and carried her inside. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth you did amuse me,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cBut you\u2019re usually overly concerned about me, nagging me to rest all day long. Why this sudden change in your attitude, I\u2019m wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t nag. Old women nag, not warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to nag,\u201d she countered. She couldn\u2019t help but become a little irritated. Her husband\u2019s callous attitude bothered her. A husband should be a little concerned when his wife fainted, shouldn\u2019t he?</p> <p>\u201cYour ploy worked,\u201d he said. \u201cMy men forgot their argument. That was the reason you pretended to faint, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He all but tossed her on the bed. She bounced twice before settling.</p><p>She felt like laughing now. She was certainly filled with relief. Gabriel wasn\u2019t such an unfeeling clout after all. He really believed she\u2019d pretended to swoon.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t want to lie to her husband, but she didn\u2019t particularly want to set him straight either. If he realized she hadn\u2019t been pretending, he\u2019d probably force her to stay in bed until next spring.</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree or disagree with her husband. If he decided to take her silence as agreement over his own conclusion, so be it.</p><p>He\u2019d turned her attention anyway. He was taking his boots off.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to boast over your cleverness?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He tossed his boots to the floor and began to untie the knot in his belt. He kept his gaze on her all the while.</p><p>\u201cOld men boast, m\u2019lord,\u201d she answered. Her gaze was on his waist. \u201cNot warriors\u2019 wives.\u201d</p><p>Lord, how she pleased him. He liked the way she turned his own words back on him. Johanna was becoming downright sassy. Such behavior was proof enough she\u2019d conquered her fear of him.</p><p>She still blushed quite easily. She was blushing now. She obviously guessed what he intended to do. He decided to tell her anyway just to further her embarrassment. She\u2019d get all flustered then, and Lord, how he liked that feminine trait.</p><p>He stood by the side of the bed and told her in explicit detail exactly what he planned to do to her. The pictures he painted with his erotic words made her face burn, and the way he wanted to make love to her made her think she was going to faint again.</p><p>The dark and incredibly arousing look on his face made her think he wasn\u2019t jesting with her. Still, she needed to be sure.</p><p>\u201cDo men and women really make love in such a way?\u201d</p> <p>She sounded breathless, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Her heart was slamming a wild beat, and she was fighting her own arousal while she tried to decide if such a thing was possible. The thoughts Gabriel had deliberately planted in her mind both appalled and excited her.</p><p>He pulled her to her feet and began to take her clothes off her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jesting with me, aren\u2019t you, husband?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen husbands and wives really . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to,\u201d he answered, his voice a rough whisper.</p><p>She shivered. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ve never heard of such a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you like it,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cWill you like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will I ...\u201d</p><p>His wife was having difficulty finishing her sentences. She was obviously shaken. So was he, he realized. He was certainly aroused. His movements were damned awkward as he fought the tiny ribbons holding her undergarments together.</p><p>He let out a sigh of satisfaction when he finally got rid of the last of her clothes and then roughly pulled her up against him. He lifted her up so his hard arousal could press against the junction of her thighs.</p><p>She instinctively moved until she was cuddling him. He grunted with pleasure.</p><p>They fell into bed together. Gabriel rolled on top of her. He braced his weight with his elbows on either side of her and leaned down to capture her mouth for a long, drugging kiss. Their tongues dueled and stroked each other; and when he finally moved to kiss a path down the side of her silky neck, he could feel her trembling with pleasure.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t quite finished plying him with questions. She was a worrier, he supposed, and that was surely the reason she wanted a full explanation.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, you really think to use your mouth to kiss me .. there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he whispered against her ear. His breath, so sweet and warm against her sensitive skin, made her tremble with desire.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to . . . you know . . . kiss you . . . there.\u201d</p><p>He went completely still. She began to worry. A scant second later he slowly lifted his head to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d drawled out the word, and God, he was such a sexy man. She felt as though she\u2019d already pleased him. She reached up to stroke the side of his face. He leaned into her hand.</p><p>He liked her to touch him. He needed her to, she realized . . . almost as much as she needed him now to stroke her.</p><p>She let out a sigh and put her arms around her husband\u2019s neck. She tried to pull him down for a long kiss, but he resisted.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, you don\u2019t have to ...\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll make you like it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His head dropped to the crook in her shoulder. He leaned up, bit her earlobe, and then said, \u201cI know I\u2019ll like it, but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll . . .\u201d</p><p>Now he was having trouble finishing his sentences. It was all his wife\u2019s fault. She reached down and gently stroked his arousal. He was too busy shuddering to think coherent thoughts.</p><p>He\u2019d been worried she wouldn\u2019t like tasting him. She started out timid, but she got over being shy soon enough and became damned enthusiastic.</p><p>She made him crazy. His heart felt as though it had stopped when she took his arousal into her mouth. She was wild now, completely uninhibited as she stroked him with her mouth, her tongue, and dear God, she made him just as wild to please her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand the ecstasy for very long. He came before she did, but once he\u2019d recovered from the spasms that racked his body, and he could think again, he turned his full attention to pleasuring his wife.</p><p>Her whimpers soon turned to shouts. The intensity of her own orgasm made her forget to breathe. She demanded he stop his wonderful agony even as she clung to him and pressed herself against him in a contradictory plea for more.</p><p>The taste of her made him hard and throbbing in scant minutes. He was suddenly desperate to be inside her. He moved, pinned her to the bed, and knelt between her thighs. His hands cupped her backside and he lifted her up at the same instant he thrust deep inside.</p><p>He felt as though he\u2019d died and gone to heaven. She was so damned tight, so incredibly sweet and giving, and he knew he would never be able to get enough of her.</p><p>The bed squeaked from their forceful movements. Their breathing was harsh and choppy, and when she found fulfillment again, her scream made his ears ring.</p><p>He was thoroughly satisfied. He collapsed on top of his wife and let out a loud groan.</p><p>He could hear her heart hammering inside her chest. He was arrogantly pleased and satisfied. He\u2019d made her completely forget herself.</p><p>She\u2019d done the same to him. He frowned over the acknowledgment. It had become impossible to distance himself from his wife, he realized. He couldn\u2019t simply make love to her and then go back to his duties and put her out of his thoughts. She had become more than simply a woman to mate with during the dark hours of the night. She was his wife, and damn it all, she was even more than that.</p><p>She was the love of his life.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>He muttered the expletive, then lifted his head to look at her. She was sound asleep. He was relieved, for he wouldn\u2019t have to explain the appalled look he was certain he had on his face or the blasphemy he\u2019d just uttered.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to make himself leave her. He stared down at her for long minutes. She was so beautiful to him. Yet her appearance wasn\u2019t the reason he\u2019d lost his mind and fallen in love with her, God help him. Nay, it was her character that wooed him into forgetting his shields. Looks faded with age, but the beauty in Johanna\u2019s heart and in her soul seemed to grow more wonderful with each new day.</p><p>She\u2019d snared him all right, blindsided him she had, and now it was too late to do anything about protecting himself from her.</p><p>There was only one course of action left to him. Johanna was going to have to love him. By God, he wasn\u2019t about to let himself become this vulnerable without gaining equal measure.</p><p>Gabriel felt better. The plan made sound sense to him. He wasn\u2019t certain how he\u2019d get her to fall in love with him, but he was an intelligent man. He\u2019d think of something.</p><p>He leaned down, kissed her brow, and then got out of bed. Their lovemaking had worn her out, he supposed, as he reached for his plaid. That possibility made him smile until he yawned. He realized then she\u2019d worn him out, too.</p><p>He stared down at her all the while he dressed; and when he was finished, he took time to cover her up. Then, damned if he didn\u2019t have to kiss her one last time before he left the chamber. He was becoming appalled again by his own shameful behavior. Loving was a tricky affair, he decided. Perhaps, in time, he\u2019d get the hang of it. He started to forcefully pull the door closed, caught himself in time, and shut it as quietly as possible.</p><p>Hell, he was becoming considerate. He had to shake his head over that disgusting trait. He wondered what other surprises were going to come his way now that he\u2019d acknowledged to himself the fact that he did indeed love his wife. The future worried him. If he turned into a doting husband, he swore he\u2019d have to kill someone.</p><p>Aye, loving was a tricky affair.</p><p>Johanna slept through the night. Gabriel left the chamber before she awakened. She was thankful for her privacy. She felt so sick, she could barely breathe without gagging. She tried to get out of bed twice, but each time the room would begin to spin and her stomach would lurch in protest of the movement. She took deep, gulping breaths to try to calm her nausea. It didn\u2019t help. She made it over to the washstand and slapped a wet cloth against her forehead, but that didn\u2019t help either. Johanna finally quit fighting the inevitable and ended up kneeling over the chamber pot, wretching until she was certain she was going to faint again.</p><p>While she\u2019d been throwing up, she thought she was surely going to die; yet after she was finished, she felt surprisingly fit again. Whatever sickness had claimed her had either ended abruptly or had strange symptoms. Until she knew what was ailing her, she couldn\u2019t treat herself.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t one to pamper herself, yet she couldn\u2019t help but be worried. She\u2019d believed her faint the night before was due to an empty stomach mixed with the unpleasant aroma of cooked meat. But she\u2019d almost fainted again this morning and the only aroma in the chamber was the scent of the outdoors coming through the opened window.</p><p>She tried not to think about being sick. She\u2019d missed Mass and knew she would have to take Father aside later and explain that she\u2019d been indisposed. The color had come back to her face by the time she dressed. She braided her hair, straightened the chamber, and then went to look in on Clare MacKay.</p><p>Hilda opened the door for her. Johanna smiled when she saw Clare was sitting up in bed. Her face was still horribly swollen, of course, and the left side of her face was black and blue from bruises, but her eyes looked clear, not murky, and Johanna surmised the blow to the head hadn\u2019t done irreparable damage.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling this morning, Clare?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter, thank you,\u201d the MacKay woman answered in a weak, pitiful voice.</p><p>\u201cShe barely ate a morsel of the food I carried up,\u201d Hilda interjected. \u201cSays her throat pains her too much. I\u2019m going back to the kitchens to mix a tonic for her.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. She kept her gaze on Clare. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to eat in order to regain your strength.\u201d</p><p>Clare shrugged in answer. Johanna shut the door behind Hilda and went over to sit down on the side of the bed next to her patient.</p><p>\u201cYou do want to get better, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Clare stared at Johanna a long minute before answering. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to,\u201d she whispered. She deliberately tried to turn the topic then. \u201cIt was good of you to take me in, Lady Johanna. I haven\u2019t properly thanked you yet. I\u2019m most appreciative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t thank me,\u201d Johanna protested. \u201cWhy did you sound so sad when you said you would probably have to get better?\u201d</p><p>The MacKay woman didn\u2019t answer her. She was obviously nervous, for she was twisting the end of the blanket into a knot.</p><p>\u201cIs my father going to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Johanna answered. She reached over and placed her hand on top of Clare\u2019s. \u201cWill you be happy to see him if he does come to see you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Clare rushed out.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound very sincere. Johanna was determined to gain some answers, but she wasn\u2019t going to demand anything from the battered woman. She would use patience and understanding. Eventually Clare would tell her why she was so worried.</p><p>She decided to soothe her now. \u201cYou needn\u2019t be afraid, you know. You\u2019re safe here. No one\u2019s going to hurt you. After your baby\u2019s born and you\u2019ve regained your strength, my husband and I will help you decide what\u2019s to be done. You may stay with us for as long as you wish. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>Clare\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m very weary now. I would like to rest.\u201d</p><p>Johanna immediately stood up. She tucked the covers around the woman, acting like a concerned mother now. She put her hand to Clare\u2019s forehead to make certain she didn\u2019t have fever, then went over to check the pitcher to make sure her patient had enough water to drink.</p><p>Clare appeared to be sound asleep by the time Johanna left the chamber. Hilda went back inside to take over the watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Johanna tried to talk to Clare later in the morning; but as soon as she started asking questions, Clare became weary and fell asleep again.</p><p>Megan took a turn sitting with Clare that afternoon so Hilda could supervise the preparations for dinner. Johanna thought to try and question her patient once again, but she was waylaid when her husband came striding into the great hall with his son at his side.</p><p>Johanna had just finished removing Calum\u2019s stitches. She was trying to make him pay attention to her while she gave him instructions. He was like a fidgety child, anxious to get back outside.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving until you promise to apply this salve every morning and night for a week\u2019s time, Calum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promise,\u201d the soldier replied. He jumped to his feet and went hurrying across the room, leaving the jar of salve on the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>Alex bellowed his important announcement and spread his arms wide in a gesture so dramatic his father couldn\u2019t help but smile. The boy certainly didn\u2019t have a problem with his own self-worth. Of course Gabriel had assured him several times on the way back home that Johanna was anxious to see him.</p><p>His wife\u2019s reaction was just as amusing to Gabriel. She let out a loud gasp, picked up her skirts, and ran across the hall to greet Alex.</p><p>The little boy threw himself into her arms. She hugged him tight. The top of his head only reached her waist. He was such an adorable little boy, and she was so happy to have him home, her eyes filled with tears.</p> <p>Gabriel left the two of them and went upstairs to try to talk to Clare MacKay once again. He was determined to find out the name of the warrior who had disgraced the woman. He also wanted to give her the news that her father would be arriving tomorrow to take her back home, providing of course that she was strong enough.</p><p>Gabriel came back downstairs a few minutes later. Clare was still too ill to answer his questions. Why, she was so exhausted, she fell asleep a scant minute after he\u2019d explained his reason for the audience.</p><p>Johanna and Alex were waiting for him at the bottom of the steps.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, husband?\u201d she asked when she spotted the frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I try to talk to the MacKay woman, she falls asleep. How long do you think it will be before she\u2019s strong enough to answer my questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Gabriel,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou saw what she looked like the day she came here. It\u2019s going to take time for her to mend. Be patient with her.\u201d she suggested with a nod. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle she\u2019s alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose it is,\u201d he agreed. \u201cJohanna, her father\u2019s coming here tomorrow to take her back home.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like hearing that news. She shook her head. \u201cClare\u2019s in no condition to go anywhere. Her father\u2019s going to have to understand.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t in the mood to argue with his wife. The joy he\u2019d seen on her face when Alex had run to her had filled him with such pleasure and contentment. He didn\u2019t want to mar the reunion with important talk now. Tonight would be soon enough to discuss Clare\u2019s future.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Alex outside, wife. It\u2019s too fine a day to stay inside.\u201d</p><p>His attention was centered on his son now. Alex was holding Johanna\u2019s hand and staring up at her in true wonder. It suddenly occurred to Gabriel that the boy was in desperate need of a mother. Just as revealing was the fact that Johanna needed Alex almost as much.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is a fine day.\u201d Johanna said. A look of tenderness had come into Gabriel\u2019s eyes. He was being very unguarded now. The love he felt for his son was most apparent.</p><p>Lord, she was feeling emotional today. She knew she was about to burst into tears and turned so that her husband wouldn\u2019t see her distress. He wouldn\u2019t understand of course. Men believed women only wept when they were unhappy or in pain, or so Johanna believed, but her tears were simply an emotional response to the wonderful feeling of happiness and contentment she was feeling. God had blessed her. She was barren, yet now had a son to love. Aye, she would love Alex, for it simply wasn\u2019t possible for her to steel her heart against such an innocent child.</p><p>\u201cCould we go and see the horses, Mama?\u201d</p> <p>She burst into tears. Both Gabriel and his son were horrified. \u201cJohanna, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Her husband\u2019s concern sharpened his voice to a near bellow.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to see the horses,\u201d Alex blurted out, thinking he might be the cause of her distress.</p><p>Johanna tried to regain her control. She dabbed at the corners of her eyes with the hem of her plaid before trying to explain.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told her husband. \u201cAlex called me mama. He took me by surprise, you see, and I seem to be very emotional today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa said I should call you mama,\u201d Alex . said. \u201cHe said you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>The little boy\u2019s face was puckered in a frown. He was obviously fretting. Johanna hurried to soothe him. \u201cYour father was correct. You should call me mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you crying like a baby?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBecause you make me happy,\u201d she answered. \u201cAlex, it\u2019s too fine a day to stay inside. Let\u2019s go and see the horses.\u201d</p><p>She tried to leave. Gabriel reached out and grabbed her by her shoulders. \u201cFirst you\u2019ll tell me thank you for bringing your son home,\u201d he announced.</p><p>He wanted praise, she supposed. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you later, m\u2019lord, when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She stretched up on tiptoe and kissed him. She heard Alex make a gagging sound and burst into laughter. Gabriel smiled. He watched his wife and his son go outside. Then he followed them and stood on the top step. He continued to watch his wife and his son until they disappeared down the hill.</p><p>\u201cWhat has you smiling so, Laird?\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie climbed up the steps and stopped by his laird\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI was watching my family,\u201d Gabriel answered.</p><p>Father MacKechnie nodded. \u201cA handsome family you have, son. God\u2019s blessed the three of you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t consider himself a religious man, yet he found he had to agree with the priest\u2019s evaluation. When he was young and foolish, he\u2019d prayed for a family. Now he had Alex and Johanna to call his own. Fair was fair, he decided, and he guessed he\u2019d have to give his Maker his due. He had answered his prayer after all.</p><p>Johanna\u2019s laughter echoed across the courtyard then, interrupting Gabriel\u2019s thoughts. He instinctively smiled. Damn but he liked the sound of her joy.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t have any idea her husband was listening to her. Alex was so filled with enthusiasm and excitement to be outside he couldn\u2019t maintain a slow pace. He ran so fast the heels of his feet smacked his backside. She could barely keep up with him.</p><p>They spent the afternoon together. They looked over the horses first, then made their way down to the meadow to visit Auggie. The old warrior had just returned from the ridge and looked like he was in a foul mood.</p><p>\u201cWhat has you scowling, Auggie?\u201d Johanna called out.</p><p>Alex saw the soldier\u2019s glare and immediately edged behind Johanna\u2019s skirts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Alex,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAuggie likes to grumble, but he has a kind heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Papa?\u201d</p><p>Johanna smiled. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered, thinking what a clever child Alex was. He was perceptive, too.</p><p>Auggie waited until the pair reached him before giving an answer for his frown. \u201cI\u2019m ready to give up my game,\u201d he announced with a dramatic nod. \u201cIt\u2019s no use hitting the stones any distance. Most crumble from the force of the whack I give them. They splinter in the air. No point to it then, is there now? Who\u2019s that hiding behind you, peeking up at me with such wide blue eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Alex,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cDo you remember Gabriel\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember the lad,\u201d Auggie answered. \u201cBut I\u2019m in the middle of a sour mood, Johanna. I\u2019m not fit for company today. Go away and leave me to my pout.\u201d</p><p>Johanna tried not to laugh. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you spare a few minutes to show Alex how to strike the stones into the holes here in the meadow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t spare a few minutes,\u201d Auggie muttered even as he motioned the little boy over to his side. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a child\u2019s game. How old are you, boy?\u201d</p><p>Alex had a death grip on Johanna\u2019s hand. He wasn\u2019t about to leave her side. She had to walk with him over to Auggie.</p><p>\u201cAlex doesn\u2019t know how old he is,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cI\u2019m thinking he\u2019s four or five summers.\u201d</p><p>Auggie rubbed his jaw with concentration. \u201cOpen your mouth, boy. Let me have a look at your teeth. I can tell you how old you are.\u201d</p><p>Johanna burst into laughter. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a horse,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to teeth, they could be the same, at least with the young ones.\u201d</p><p>Alex tilted his head up and opened his mouth. Auggie nodded with approval. \u201cYou\u2019ve been taking good care of your teeth, haven\u2019t you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa showed me how to rub them with green haze! and wipe them with a woolen cloth,\u201d Alex answered. \u201cI only forget some of the time.\u201d</p><p>Auggie squinted against the sunlight as he bent down to have a good look.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s close to five, I\u2019m guessing. He couldn\u2019t be any older. His first teeth are still nice and tight,\u201d he explained after he\u2019d reached in and tried to wiggle Alex\u2019s two top front teeth. \u201cToo snug for six and two big for three. Aye, he\u2019s going on five. I\u2019d wager my game on it.\u201d</p><p>Alex was finally allowed to close his mouth. He turned his gaze up to Johanna. \u201cI\u2019m five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she answered. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to choose a day and give you a proper birthday celebration, Alex. Then you\u2019ll officially become five.\u201d</p><p>Alex had gotten over his fear of the leathery-looking warrior and now begged to play the game. Auggie spent close to two hours supervising the child. Alex didn\u2019t understand the word concentrate and he talked nonstop all the while. Auggie was extremely patient with the boy, but he did cast several glares in Johanna\u2019s direction every now and again. Alex couldn\u2019t seem to remember he was to keep quiet when Auggie was about to strike his stone.</p><p>Johanna sat on the side of the hill to watch the pair. She listened to Auggie tell stories about the past, and it soon became apparent to her that Alex was in awe of the warrior. He begged to hear more.</p><p>The sun was setting and Alex had started yawning when Johanna finally called a halt to the entertainment. She stood up, adjusted the pleats of her plaid, and started to thank Auggie.</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember what happened next. She opened her eyes and found both Auggie and Alex leaning over her. Alex was crying. Auggie was gently patting the side of her face and trying to soothe the boy at the same time.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Johanna any time at all to realize what had happened.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, I fainted again, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Auggie asked, his brow wrinkled with worry. He helped his mistress sit up. Alex immediately sat down on her lap and leaned against her chest. He obviously needed her assurance, she decided. She put her arm around the child and gave him a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite all right now, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fainted before?\u201d Auggie persisted.</p><p>Johanna nodded. The movement made her head spin. \u201cLast night,\u201d she answered. \u201cGabriel caught me. It happened so quickly that I didn\u2019t have any warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as certain was quick,\u201d Auggie agreed. He squatted on the ground next to Johanna and continued to brace her back with his arms. \u201cYou were standing one minute and flat on the ground looking as dead as a corpse the next.\u201d</p><p>Auggie was deliberately trying to make light of the topic for the child\u2019s sake. He hid his worry as best he could.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best go and see Glynis,\u201d Auggie advised. \u201cShe knows a few healing tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to sew Calum\u2019s arm, so she must have some experience,\u201d Johanna remarked. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll go and see her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Auggie countered. \u201cYou\u2019ll go now. I\u2019ll take Alex home.\u201d</p><p>From the stubborn set of his jaw, Johanna knew it would be pointless to argue with the man. \u201cAll right then,\u201d she agreed. She turned her attention to her son.</p><p>\u201cAlex, let\u2019s not mention this faint to your father. We don\u2019t want to worry him, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame on you telling the boy not to ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuggie, I\u2019m thinking of Gabriel\u2019s feelings now,\u201d Johanna argued. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to worry.\u201d</p><p>Auggie nodded agreement. He had every intention of telling his laird what had happened, of course; and when his mistress pitched a fit, he\u2019d remind her she hadn\u2019t made him give her his promise not to stay a word.</p><p>Both he and Alex accompanied Johanna to Glynis\u2019s door. They left her there, but only after Auggie pounded on the door and the Maclaurin woman had answered the summons.</p><p>\u201cLady Johanna\u2019s got a complaint to give you,\u201d Auggie announced. \u201cCome along, boy. It\u2019s time for your supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I done something to displease you, m\u2019lady?\u201d Glynis asked.</p><p>Johanna shook her head. She motioned her over to the rock ledge away from the entrance so that Glynis\u2019s husband wouldn\u2019t chance to overhear the conversation.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down, Glynis,\u201d she requested. \u201cA friend of mine is ill and I would like to gain your advice on what\u2019s to be done to help her.\u201d</p><p>Glynis immediately looked relieved. She sat on the ledge, folded her hands in her lap, and waited for Johanna to continue.</p><p>\u201cTwice now this woman has fainted for no apparent reason,\u201d Johanna blurted out. She stood in front of the Maclaurin woman and waited for her response to that news.</p><p>Glynis simply nodded. Johanna didn\u2019t know what to make of that reaction.</p><p>\u201cIs she dying of some dread disease?\u201d</p><p>Johanna was wringing her hands together now and trying not to let Glynis see how upset she was.</p><p>\u201cShe could be,\u201d Glynis replied. \u201cI\u2019m needing more facts before I give you my suggestions for treatment, m\u2019lady. Is your friend young or old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she married?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Glynis nodded. \u201cDoes she have any other symptoms to speak of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . that is to say, she awakened feeling very sick and did in fact throw up. Her stomach is queasy most of the morning. Yet when she isn\u2019t feeling queasy, she\u2019s feeling quite fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask a few personal questions before I give you my opinion, m\u2019lady,\u201d Glynis told her mistress in a low whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer them if I know the answers.\u201d Johanna replied.</p><p>\u201cHas your friend missed her monthly?\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s missed two months now but that isn\u2019t unusual, for she isn\u2019t at all consistent.\u201d</p><p>Glynis was trying not to smile. \u201cWould you happen to know if her br**sts are feeling tender?\u201d</p><p>Johanna almost checked to see before she gave her answer. She caught herself in time. \u201cPerhaps just a little, but not overly much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs she newly married?\u201d</p><p>Johanna thought that was an odd question to ask. She nodded. \u201cDo you think the strain of the new marriage would cause such symptoms? I don\u2019t believe so, Glynis, for the woman was married before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have children with the first\u2014\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t let her finish her question. \u201cShe\u2019s barren,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps by one man she was,\u201d Glynis remarked.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t know what to make of that remark. Then Glynis turned her attention with yet another question. \u201cAre you. . . I mean to ask, is she sleeping more than usual?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Johanna cried out. She was amazed by the clever questions Glynis was asking now. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of this sickness before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth I have,\u201d Glynis answered.</p><p>\u201cWill she die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, m\u2019lady. She won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what should she do?\u201d</p><p>Johanna was close to tears now. Glynis hurried to assure her. Her smile was wide when she gave her answer.</p><p>\u201cShe should tell her husband she\u2019s carrying his child.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p> <p>It was a blessing Glynis was such a strong, strapping woman. She proved to be quick on her feet, too. She caught her mistress before she hit her head on the stone wall.</p><p>The joyful news had sent Lady Johanna into a dead faint. She awakened a few minutes later in Glynis\u2019s bed. The first words out of her mouth were given in a shout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m barren!\u201d</p><p>Glynis patted her hand. \u201cBy one man you were, but not by our laird. You\u2019ve got all the symptoms, m\u2019lady. You\u2019re carrying, all right.\u201d</p><p>Johanna shook her head. Her mind couldn\u2019t accept such a possibility. \u201cWomen are barren, not men.\u201d</p><p>Glynis snorted. \u201cSo men say,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou and I have had out differences, m\u2019lady, but I\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve come to an understanding. I count you as a friend, especially on the days you\u2019re wearing our fine Maclaurin plaid,\u201d she added with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to have you for a friend, Glynis,\u201d Johanna replied, wondering why in heaven\u2019s name the woman would bring up that topic now.</p><p>Glynis was quick to explain her reasons. \u201cFriends hold each other\u2019s confidences,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I would ask you if your first husband ever took any other woman to his bed. I\u2019m not trying to shame you, m\u2019lady, only sort out the truth.\u201d</p><p>Johanna sat up before. \u201cYes, he did take other women to his bed,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd not just a few. He seemed determined to bed as many as he could. He liked to flaunt his women in front of me. I didn\u2019t mind, though,\u201d she added in a rush when she caught Glynis\u2019s pitying look. \u201cI didn\u2019t like my husband. He was an evil man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what I\u2019m really asking, m\u2019lady, is if you\u2019d be knowing if there were any illegitimate bairns as a result of his dalliances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there weren\u2019t any babies born,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cRaulf told me the women used a potion to keep from getting pregnant. He thought I used one, too, and would go into a rage each month because he was sure I was deliberately foiling his attempts to have a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are such potions around,\u201d Glynis replied. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly carrying now, m\u2019lady, so we can conclude you aren\u2019t barren after all. I\u2019m going to keep silent about this joyful news. It\u2019s up to you to pick your time and tell your husband. Our laird will be very pleased.\u201d</p><p>Johanna left the cottage a few minutes later. Glynis followed her to the stone wall. Johanna suddenly turned around.</p><p>\u201cMy husband won\u2019t allow me to work in the fields,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Glynis replied. \u201cYou\u2019re our mistress. You shouldn\u2019t be doing common work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sew,\u201d Johanna said. She added a nod. \u201cEach night I sit by the hearth and either work on my tapestry or do a little embroidery. I can fashion flowers on . . . things,\u201d she added,</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at, m\u2019lady? Just spit it out, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed you wear saffron-colored blouses under your plaid, and I was wondering if you\u2019d like me to sew a border of flowers around the neckline for you.\u201d</p><p>Glynis\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhy would you want. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tend the fields all day long, Glynis, and I would like to do something to show my appreciation. If you\u2019ll bring one of your blouses up to the hall, I\u2019ll start work tonight.\u201d</p><p>She was too embarrassed to wait for an answer. Johanna didn\u2019t understand why she was suddenly feeling so shy and unsure of herself. She waved as she ran down the path leading to the courtyard.</p><p>She slowed her pace when she reached the hill. The fullness of her condition hit her again. She walked the rest of the distance home in a daze.</p><p>Auggie caught up with her in the center of the courtyard. \u201cI\u2019ll be coming to supper tonight,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell your husband. . .\u201d</p><p>He quit his explanation that he was going to tell his laird Johanna had fainted when he saw the look on her face. \u201cWhat has you smiling like you just found a pot of gold, lass?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you tonight,\u201d she promised. \u201cIt\u2019s a grand day, isn\u2019t it, Auggie, even though the weather\u2019s a bit unusually cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, lass, you\u2019d best be knowing something about the weather here.\u201d</p><p>Auggie wanted to tell her the truth that the weather was actually mild for early fall. Keith had told him their mistress believed the Highlands were as warm as the summer all year long. He didn\u2019t want the soldiers laughing behind Johanna\u2019s back over her na\u00efvet\u00e9, but his mistress went sailing right on past him, her head apparently lost in the clouds, before he could set her straight on the topic of the Highland weather. He decided he\u2019d wait until later to tell her the truth.</p><p>Johanna sat with Alex at the table while he ate his supper. He was too young to wait for his elders. When he was finished, she sent him to the buttery to wash his face and hands.</p><p>She went over to sit by the hearth. Dumfries came loping into the hall. She gave him a firm pat of affection, then settled herself in the chair to do some sewing. Dumfries collapsed with a loud thud next to her chair and rested his head on her shoes.</p><p>Alex joined her a scant minute later. He was still wearing stew on his face. Johanna fetched a wet cloth and cleaned him properly. He wanted to sit next to her in the same chair. She scooted over to accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cWill you want to stay here with your father and me, or will you miss your other relatives, Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stay here,\u201d he replied. He let out a loud yawn and leaned against Johanna, watching as she threaded her needle.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay, too,\u201d Johanna whispered.</p><p>\u201cPapa says you missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. I did miss you.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s chest swelled up with importance. \u201cDid you cry like a baby when you missed me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled over his choice of words. \u201cI most certainly did,\u201d she lied. \u201cWould you like me to tell you a story before you go to bed?\u201d</p><p>Alex nodded. \u201cWhere did you learn the story? From Auggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cMy mother told me stories when I was a little girl; and when I grew up, I learned how to read and I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you learn to read?\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s gaze was fully directed on Alex\u2019s upturned face, and for that reason she didn\u2019t notice her husband had walked into the hall. He stood on the top step watching his wife and his son while he waited for one of them to acknowledge his presence.</p><p>\u201cI learned because it was forbidden,\u201d she answered. \u201cI was told I was too ignorant to read, and for a time I believed that nonsense. Then I got my gumption back and decided I was just as clever as anyone else. That is when I learned how to read, Alex; and when you\u2019re older, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>Alex was fingering her plaid while he listened to her explanation. He suddenly yawned wide enough for her to see the back of his throat. She instructed him to cover his mouth with his hand and then began a story that used to be her favorite when she was a child.</p><p>Alex was sound asleep less than a minute later. His head dropped to the side of her chest. Johanna was so content to have the little one in her arms, she closed her eyes to say a prayer of thanksgiving. She fell asleep almost as quickly as Alex had.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t know who to carry up to bed first. Calum came to his rescue. He took Alex.</p><p>\u201cWhere should I put him for the night, MacBain?\u201d he asked in a low whisper so the little one wouldn\u2019t wake up.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t have any idea. Clare was using the second chamber and so he couldn\u2019t put his son in there.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want Alex to sleep with the soldiers either. The boy was too young and needed to be close to his mother and father in the event he became fearful or disoriented during the night.</p><p>\u201cPut him in my bed for now,\u201d Gabriel instructed. \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out before tonight.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Calum had carried Alex out of the hall before turning his attention back to his wife. He squatted down next to her chair and started to reach for her when she suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGabriel.\u201d She said his name with wonder in her voice. He felt as though he\u2019d just been caressed.</p><p>\u201cWere you dreaming about me perchance?\u201d</p><p>He was trying to tease her, but his voice was gruff with emotion. Damn but he loved this woman. He let out a sigh then and added a frown in a bid to get his thoughts under control.</p><p>He wanted to bed her. He knew he\u2019d have to wait, so he decided to growl at her instead. \u201cYou should go upstairs, wife. You\u2019re clearly exhausted. You\u2019re doing too much work. I\u2019ve told you time and time again to rest, but you blatantly . . .\u201d</p><p>She reached over and brushed her fingertips down the side of his face. Needless to say, his concentration was broken. He thought it might be a deliberate ploy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing too much,\u201d she replied. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sleeping just now. I was dozing and thinking about something wonderful. I still can\u2019t quite believe it, Gabriel. It doesn\u2019t seem possible, and when I tell you my important news. . .\u201d</p><p>She suddenly stopped and peeked around her husband to make certain they were alone. She didn\u2019t want anyone else sharing in this special moment.</p><p>Keith and three other Maclaurin soldiers came strutting into the hall just as she realized Alex was missing.</p><p>\u201cDo you see, you were sleeping,\u201d Gabriel told her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even notice Calum took my son upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our son,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He liked the sound of that. Johanna was becoming possessive, and he thought that was a good sign. In time he hoped her possessiveness would extend to him.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is our son,\u201d he agreed. \u201cNow tell me your news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will have to wait until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. He stood up, then hauled her to her feet. \u201cYou dare to deny me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI dare anything these days, thanks to you, husband.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. He decided he\u2019d wait until later to badger her into giving him a proper explanation. Now he was determined to make her tell him her news.</p><p>\u201cI wish to know what has you worrying. You will tell me now,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>He was sounding arrogant again. Heaven help her, she was beginning to appreciate that flaw. \u201cI\u2019m not worrying,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my news when I\u2019m ready, m\u2019lord, and not a moment before. I won\u2019t be rushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to tell your laird what happened down in the meadow?\u201d</p><p>Auggie shouted his question from the entrance. Johanna turned to look at him. The old warrior bounded down the steps and started across the room. Dumfries let out a loud growl. Auggie hushed him with a quick growl back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Johanna called out. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be telling on you come morning, lass. Just see if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in thunder. . .\u201d</p><p>She deliberately interrupted her husband\u2019s mutterings to call out a greeting to the priest. \u201cGood evening, Father.\u201d In a low whisper she said to her husband, \u201cDo try to be patient this once. I promise you\u2019ll be richly rewarded.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. She couldn\u2019t tell from his expression if he was going to be agreeable or not. \u201cI wish to have some privacy when I tell you my important news.\u201d</p><p>He finally nodded. Gabriel tried not to smile. He thought he\u2019d finally figured out what it was she wanted to tell him. Lord, he felt good, and all because the daft woman had finally realized she loved her husband.</p><p>He would let her have her way, he decided. If she wanted to give him her declaration in the privacy of their bedchamber, he would accommodate her. Damn, but he wished dinner was over. He was anxious to be alone with her. He hadn\u2019t realized until this minute how important her love was to him. Wives didn\u2019t have to love their husbands, but this one had to love him, he decided. If he was going to be miserable, then by God so was she.</p><p>\u201cMatters of the heart are damned confusing.\u201d He\u2019d muttered his opinion in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d she asked, not certain she\u2019d heard what he\u2019d said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYour moods, m\u2019lord, are like the weather here,\u201d she remarked. \u201cYou\u2019re most unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Johanna\u2019s attention was turned when the soldiers filed into the hall.</p><p>She noticed a serious breach in their manners immediately. \u201cYou should bow your heads to your laird and his wife when you enter the room.\u201d</p> <p>She called out her instruction and then waited to see if the soldiers were in the mood to be polite. If they gave her any trouble, she was fully prepared to ask Megan to fetch a few more bowls.</p><p>The men bowed their heads. Johanna was satisfied. She left her husband standing by the hearth and went over to the MacBain table. Two of the younger soldiers, allowed the privilege of dining with their laird tonight, had already taken their seats. She asked them to stand up again.</p><p>\u201cNo one sits down until your laird and his wife have taken their places,\u201d she patiently explained.</p><p>There was a bit of grumbling over her dictate, but in the end everyone complied with her request.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t want to prod the men too much. For that reason she didn\u2019t scold them for shouting every other word during their supper. She was quite pleased with their progress. The men were trying to be polite. She didn\u2019t hear a single belch throughout the meal.</p> <p>Auggie asked his laird what he was going to do with the liquid gold sleeping in the cave. Because he\u2019d stated his question in a low whisper, everyone was alerted something secretive might be going on.</p><p>Johanna was astonished. The men had ignored her shouts the night before but now fell silent as soon as Auggie\u2019s whisper caught their attention. She put that observation away in the back of her mind for further use.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Auggie talking about?\u201d Keith asked his laird.</p><p>Gabriel leaned back in his chair and told the group about the barrels in the cave. There was a considerable amount of hooting and cheering over the news; and when the men had calmed down, Gabriel added the fact that they all had Auggie to thank for the treasure.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and get a barrel or two to drink tonight,\u201d Bryan enthusiastically suggested.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t give her husband time to agree or disagree with Bryan\u2019s request. She stood up and shook her head at the soldiers.</p> <p>The soldiers immediately stood up. The show of manners was impressive.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving or staying?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou may sit down, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still standing,\u201d Lindsay pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick, isn\u2019t it, m\u2019lady? Once we sit down, you\u2019ll start in throwing bowls again.\u201d</p><p>Johanna held onto her patience. \u201cI\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201d she promised. \u201cI just wanted to stand to get your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the MacBain soldier who asked her the question. \u201cIf you\u2019ll be patient for just a moment, I\u2019ll explain. The barrels aren\u2019t for drinking. The brew is too precious. We\u2019re going to use it to barter for goods we need.\u201d</p><p>She expected an argument. She wasn\u2019t disappointed. Everyone started shouting at the same time. Only Father MacKechnie and Gabriel remained silent. They were both watching Johanna and smiling while she tried to placate the men.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve had time to think about it, you\u2019ll realize bartering is the only option open to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why in God\u2019s name would we want to barter it away?\u201d Keith demanded above the noise.</p><p>She heard his question and turned to answer him. \u201cIt\u2019s sinful to steal, you see, and if we use . . . \u201d</p><p>She quit trying to explain her reasons when she realized no one was listening to her. She turned to her husband. The look on his face told her he found his men\u2019s behavior vastly amusing. She leaned close to him so he could hear her above the shouting going on between the Maclaurins and the MacBains and demanded he explain the reasons why they were going to use the barrels for trade.</p><p>He nodded agreement. She thanked him and then resumed her seat.</p><p>\u201cBe silent!\u201d While Gabriel\u2019s roar was certainly rude conduct at the dinner table, Johanna thought, it proved to be effective. The men immediately stopped arguing.</p><p>He nodded, satisfied, and then turned to her. \u201cYou may now explain your position on the distribution of the drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wish for you to explain.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to try to make them understand.\u201d he ordered. \u201cAnd while you\u2019re at it. you\u2019ll have to make me understand as well.\u201d</p><p>She jumped to her feet again. \u201cDo you mean to say you don\u2019t agree with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I don\u2019t agree with you.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to finish her gasp, then continued on. \u201cStealing has proven effective in the past. Johanna. Don\u2019t give me that look. I haven\u2019t betrayed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealing\u2019s wrong, isn\u2019t it, Father?\u201d</p><p>The priest nodded. \u201cShe speaks the truth. Laird.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult to hear the priest over the scraping noise of the stools when the men once again stood up.</p><p>\u201cWill you make up your mind, lass,\u201d Keith requested.</p><p>\u201cIs she leaving this time?\u201d Niall asked in a whisper loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t appear to be going anywhere,\u201d Calum drawled out.</p><p>\u201cOh, do sit down,\u201d Johanna muttered.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t obey her command until she had once again taken her seat.</p><p>She kept her frowning gaze on her husband. \u201cIt would please me, and please God, too, I might add, if you quit thieving and used the barrels to trade for what our clan needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it would please God,\u201d Father MacKechnie agreed. \u201cBegging your pardon for interrupting, but I\u2019ve a suggestion to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Father?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cUse only a few of the barrels to get what we need and save the rest for the clan.\u201d</p><p>There was more discussion after the priest gave his suggestion. Most of the Marclaurins were in agreement. The MacBains, however, were stubbornly united in keeping all the treasure for themselves. They were behaving like children who didn\u2019t want to share their toys. Gabriel, unfortunately, fell into that group.</p><p>Johanna was openly glaring at her husband now. He was trying not to laugh at her. The issue seemed terribly important to his wife, and he finally decided he could give up the amusement of stealing to please her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do as our priest suggests,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Johanna let out a sigh of relief. Gabriel winked at her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t always going to get your way,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I won\u2019t,\u201d she quickly agreed. She was so happy with her husband, she reached across the table and took hold of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be needing a noser.\u201d</p><p>Auggie made the announcement. Everyone turned to look at him. The younger soldiers didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. Lindsay was the first to ask what the others were thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is a noser, Auggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn expert,\u201d he answered with a nod for emphasis. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to tell us which barrels to hold back. You wouldn\u2019t want to be giving away the best, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course we wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Niall blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t a noser drink up all the new brew he\u2019s testing?\u201d Bryan asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a good taste for the drink,\u201d Lindsay boasted. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to be your noser.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed over the soldier\u2019s suggestion. When the noise had quieted down, Auggie explained. \u201cA noser doesn\u2019t taste the drink,\u201d he instructed. \u201cHe uses his nose to sniff out the aroma. He can tell just by the smell the good from the sour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we best get Spencer,\u201d Calum suggested. \u201cHe\u2019s got the biggest nose of any MacBain or Maclaurin.\u201d</p><p>Auggie smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the size but the experience, son,\u201d he said. \u201cSkill is what matters. Nosing can be taught, but the best are the ones who have a natural talent for the task. There\u2019s a noser up near the Isle of Islay we could send for, assuming he\u2019s still alive, and I heard tell of another noser living in the south, close enough to the Lowlands to make me think he might be a MacDonnell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have an outsider coming here,\u201d Calum protested. \u201cAs soon as he sees the treasure, he\u2019ll go back and tell his laird. The MacDonnells will all come running then.\u201d</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the discussion now. She was busy thinking about her joyful condition. She would tell Gabriel about the baby tonight when they were in bed together. She would make certain the candles were still burning so she could see the look of surprise on his face. after she gave him her announcement. Her hand moved to her stomach. Dear God, she was going to have a baby.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel asked the question. Everyone was shouting aye when Johanna happened to catch Father MacKechnie\u2019s horrified expression. He was staring at her; and as soon as he had her attention, he tilted his head toward her husband.</p><p>She guessed whatever had just been decided didn\u2019t sit well with the priest.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you just settled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been paying attention to the discussion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacBain,\u201d Calum called out. \u201cWe can\u2019t just send a messenger to request the noser. His clan will become suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, they\u2019d wonder why we wanted a noser and would surely follow him back,\u201d Keith interjected.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to snatch him,\u201d Auggie suggested.</p><p>\u201cHow will we know which one to take?\u201d Lindsay asked.</p><p>\u201cIf we go after Nevers, I\u2019ll go along and point him out to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevers? What kind of name is that?\u201d one of the Maclaurins asked.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, will you please explain what was just settled?\u201d Johanna insisted.</p><p>\u201cWe settled the question of what to do with the noser,\u201d Calum answered for his laird, \u201cafter he\u2019s selected the best of the brew for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we did,\u201d Keith added.</p><p>\u201cAre we all in agreement then?\u201d Auggie asked. \u201cWe snatch Nevers?\u201d</p><p>Everyone shouted his opinion of Auggie\u2019s plan to kidnap the noser while Johanna impatiently drummed her fingertips on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cPlease explain. . .\u201d she began again.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we move the barrels into the hall?\u201d Bryan asked at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the cave?\u201d Keith wanted to know.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t going to wait for an answer any longer. Father MacKechnie still looked worried. She was determined to find out why.</p><p>\u201cJust one minute, please,\u201d she called out. \u201cKeith, you said you had decided what you were going to do with the noser. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all decided,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? The noser will go home, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, no, lass,\u201d Auggie said. The very idea made him grimace.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t go home, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe would tell his laird about the barrels,\u201d Keith explained.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have the noser talking,\u201d Bryan interjected.</p><p>\u201cSure as certain he would tell,\u201d Niall agreed. \u201cI would tell our laird.\u201d</p><p>Keith tried to turn the topic then. Johanna wouldn\u2019t let him. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question,\u201d she persisted. \u201cExactly what is it you intend to do with the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Johanna, this doesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go over to the hearth and sew for a spell.\u201d</p><p>He was deliberately trying to turn her attention. Her suspicion grew. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to sew, m\u2019lord, and I\u2019m not going anywhere until someone answers my question.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel let out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn woman,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>The soldiers all nodded, for they were obviously in agreement with their laird\u2019s evaluation.</p><p>The priest decided it was his duty to tell his mistress what had been decided. No one else seemed inclined.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re thinking to kill him, lass.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d just heard. She made the priest repeat himself. Then she let out a gasp, bounded to her feet, and vehemently shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWere you in favor of this solution?\u201d she asked her husband.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s laird, m\u2019lady,\u201d Calum said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t voice an opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur laird waits, you see; and after we\u2019ve all given our suggestions, he decides for or against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll veto your sinful idea then,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that, m\u2019lady? It\u2019s a sound plan,\u201d Michael argued.</p><p>Gabriel had every intention of denying the vote to kill the noser, for he didn\u2019t think it would be honorable to gain the man\u2019s assistance and then repay him in such a foul way, but he didn\u2019t like the idea of his wife instructing him in his duties. He was also trying to come up with a viable alternative to the problem.</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to kill the noser.\u201d</p><p>Several soldiers groaned in protest over her dictate. \u201cBut, m\u2019lady, it\u2019s the truth this is the very first time all the Maclaurins and all the MacBains have ever agreed on anything,\u201d Keith remarked.</p><p>Johanna was incensed. She kept her gaze on her husband. \u201cDo I understand correctly? You plan to use the noser\u2019s skill; and when he\u2019s finished helping you, you\u2019re going to kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems we are,\u201d Calum answered for his laird.</p><p>The MacBain soldier had the gall to smile after admitting his future sin.</p><p>\u201cSo this is how you men repay a favor?\u201d</p><p>No one responded to her question. She scanned her audience, then turned back to her husband. He nodded. He was obviously agreeable to the foul plan.</p><p>Johanna decided to try to use reason to sway him. \u201cGabriel, if stealing is a sin, what do you suppose killing is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecessary,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She was getting all riled up, and he knew he should calm her by telling her he wasn\u2019t going to let any harm come to the noser, but Lord, she was such a joy to watch when she was angry. How had he ever thought her timid? He remembered how she had behaved the first day they\u2019d met. She had been timid then, terrified, too. His gentle little bride had come a long way in a very short while. The changes were all for the good, of course, but he liked to believe he was partially responsible. She hadn\u2019t felt safe when she first came to the Highlands, but she certainly felt safe now. She trusted him, too. She wouldn\u2019t be ranting and raving at him now if she still feared him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI cannot believe you\u2019re smiling, Gabriel. Have you lost your sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me smile, Johanna. You\u2019ve certainly changed since you married me. The traits were all there, but you kept them well hidden behind your shields of indifference. God\u2019s truth, you make me proud when you stand up to me. Aye, you do.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe he was giving her compliments now when they were in the middle of a heated debate she was determined to win. He was using trickery, she thought to herself. Aye, that was what he was doing. He wanted to turn her attention with a bit of praise.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to accommodate him. \u201cYou make me proud, too,\u201d she snapped. \u201cBut you still aren\u2019t going to kill the noser. I\u2019m putting my foot down, husband, so you\u2019d best give in to me. I won\u2019t let up until you do.\u201d</p> <p>She looked ready to kill someone, and he thought he might very well be her target. He couldn\u2019t resist goading her just a little bit more. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to be accommodating about bartering just to please you, but I\u2019m going to have to put both feet down on the issue of the noser.\u201d</p><p>Several loud grunts of approval followed the laird\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t allow the man to go back home. He\u2019ll bring back an army to steal the barrels,\u201d Keith explained when her frown settled on him.</p><p>\u201cNay, we can\u2019t have that,\u201d another Maclaurin shouted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s standing again,\u201d Bryan blurted out.</p> <p>\u201cFor the love of. . .\u201d</p><p>The men muttered as they hurried to stand. Johanna ignored them. \u201cGabriel, if the noser doesn\u2019t know where the cave is, and if he can\u2019t see his way there, well then he can\u2019t lead anyone to the barrels, now can he? Therefore. . .\u201d</p><p>She let her husband draw his own conclusion. He was a barbarian, yes, but he was an intelligent one. He would be able to sort it out in his mind and figure out what she was suggesting.</p><p>Calum slapped his hand on the tabletop. \u201cBy God, she\u2019s got a sound plan, Laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little mean-hearted,\u201d Keith remarked. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather be killed; but if our mistress is set on keeping the noser alive, I\u2019d have to agree it\u2019s a good alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a clever one all right,\u201d Auggie announced. His voice was filled with pride.</p> <p>Johanna didn\u2019t know what the men were talking about now. Her gaze was locked on her husband. He stared at her a long minute, then said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to let me kill him, are you, lass?\u201d</p><p>He sounded forlorn to her. She let him see her exasperation. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>His sigh was long and dramatic. \u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>She interpreted his blasphemy to mean she\u2019d won. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI knew you could be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>She was so relieved she collapsed back into her chair. The men all sat down again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll follow your suggestion,\u201d Gabriel announced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mean one, but fair.\u201d Keith sounded as though he was praising his mistress.</p><p>\u201cMean?\u201d She didn\u2019t think Keith was making any sense. The sparkle in Gabriel\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t make sense either. Was he happy he\u2019d lost the argument?</p> <p>She glanced over to see how Father MacKechnie was reacting. He should have been smiling over the victory. He wasn\u2019t though. He was looking worried again.</p><p>Her guard was immediately back up. \u201cKeith, exactly what do you think is mean-hearted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clever plan, m\u2019lady, mean or not,\u201d Calum said.</p><p>\u201cWhat plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you just gave us,\u201d he answered. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does have trouble remembering,\u201d Keith remarked. \u201cShe can\u2019t seem to keep her days straight. Why, even now she\u2019s wearing the wrong plaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill someone please explain my plan to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to blind him.\u201d</p><p>Keith gave her the atrocious news. A round of grunts followed.</p><p>She jumped to her feet again. The men all immediately joined her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a plan to tie m\u2019lady to her chair,\u201d Auggie muttered. \u201cI\u2019m getting weary of sitting and standing every other minute.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was getting a pounding headache. Her patience had been all used up. She ordered the men to sit down in a near roar.</p><p>She realized she\u2019d shouted, of course, and immediately tried to calm herself. Reason, she thought to herself, aye, she would reason with the savages.</p><p>\u201cMen, there is always more than one way into a keep,\u201d she began, her voice hoarse with control.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady,\u201d Keith interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over that before. Don\u2019t you have it straight in your head yet? We\u2019ve got us a back door and a front. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo be quiet!\u201d Johanna ordered in another shout. She threaded her fingers through her hair and lowered her voice when she continued. \u201cYou make me want to scream! God\u2019s truth, you do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are screaming, m\u2019lady,\u201d Lindsay pointed out.</p><p>She took a deep breath. By God, she would make them listen to reason or die trying. Surely a few of them realized how sinful their idea was. It was up to her to convince the others. They were members of her clan, after all, and, therefore, her responsibility.</p><p>\u201cHeaven help me,\u201d- she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Lindsay asked.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you would consider blinding the poor man,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cYou gave us the idea, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeith, if I had a bowl handy, I swear I would. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting your mistress riled up,\u201d Auggie warned.</p><p>She turned to her husband. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to blind the man. I won\u2019t hear of it. When I said there was more than one way into the keep, I was giving the men a lesson and I\u2014dear God, Keith, if you try to instruct me again about the number of entrances I swear I will throw something at you\u2014what I mean to say, husband. . . Oh, Lord, now I\u2019ve lost my thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were trying to remember how to get into the keep,\u201d Bryan reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI was not,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI was giving you a lesson, you daft men. There\u2019s more than one way to skin a fish, you see; and if you don\u2019t want the noser to see the cave, then you simply blindfold him when you take him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t skin our fish here,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cWe eat them whole.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to kill the soldier. She glared him into silence instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting her upset,\u201d Auggie shouted. \u201cIt ain\u2019t good, given her illness. Make your apology, boy,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I want your word you won\u2019t harm the noser,\u201d Johanna demanded.</p><p>Her husband was frowning at her. Lindsay was stammering out his apology, Keith thought it necessary to go over the number of entrances to the keep one last time, and Calum was wondering aloud if the English skinned their fish before they ate them. He believed they were ignorant enough to follow such a practice.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t m\u2019lady be wearing our colors today?\u201d Michael, the youngest of the Maclaurin soldiers, had only just noticed the breach.</p><p>Keith nodded. He sounded resigned when he said, \u201cShe should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuggie, what the hell did you mean when you said my wife was ailing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fainted this afternoon, Laird,\u201d Auggie explained. \u201cWent down like a corpse, she did.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s roar echoed throughout the hall. Everyone immediately fell silent.</p><p>Two months ago, such behavior would have sent her running. Aye, she would have been terrified. She\u2019d come a long way, she thought to herself, for Gabriel\u2019s fury merely irritated her now.</p><p>Her ears were ringing from his bellow. She covered them with her hands and glared at her husband. \u201cMust you do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He ignored her rebuke. \u201cYou actually fainted? You weren\u2019t pretending this time?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. \u201cWhy does everyone have to shout all the time? I\u2019m warning you now, men,\u201d she added as she scanned her audience. \u201cWhen my mama comes here, no one\u2019s going to speak above a respectable whisper.\u201d</p><p>The men didn\u2019t agree with her dictate fast enough. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d she asked in a fair bellow of her own.</p><p>The soldiers nodded in unison. She let out a very unladylike grunt of satisfaction. Then she caught Father MacKechnie\u2019s smile. Her attention was turned, of course, because she couldn\u2019t imagine what he found so amusing. She had to think about his odd behavior for a second or two.</p><p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t going to be ignored. \u201cAnswer me, damn it.\u201d</p><p>He was determined to gain a proper explanation. Her shoulders slumped. She pictured herself in bed for the next five or six months and grimaced in reaction.</p><p>She guessed she\u2019d better try to placate him. He was her husband, after all, and he seemed to be very distressed over her possible illness.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t at all what it seems to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you or did you not faint?\u201d</p><p>The chair flew backward when Gabriel stood up. He loomed over her like the avenging archangel she\u2019d likened him to in her fantasies, and Lord, he was magnificent. He leaned down until his face was just inches away from hers, obviously intent on intimidating her into answering him.</p><p>She reached up and placed her hand on the side of his face. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t harm the noser, then I\u2019ll explain what happened.\u201d</p><p>He caught hold of her hand before replying. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to negotiate, wife. What reason would you have to pretend to faint in front of Auggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt weren\u2019t a pretense, Laird. I\u2019d be knowing the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to discuss this matter in privacy with you,\u201d Johanna whispered.</p><p>\u201cI took her over to Glynis to gain some advice,\u201d Auggie announced.</p><p>\u201cDoes our laird think she pretended to faint last night?\u201d Bryan asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mean enough to try to trick us,\u201d Lindsay commented.</p><p>Calum was in agreement with the Maclaurin. \u201cAye, she is mean enough.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was aghast by the men\u2019s insults against her character. She jerked her hand away from her husband\u2019s hold and turned to the soldiers.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say I\u2019m mean?\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cause you are, m\u2019lady,\u201d Bryan cheerfully told her. She turned back to Gabriel. She fully expected him to come to her defense.</p><p>He fully expected her to tell him what the hell was the matter with her.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, how can you allow your men to defame me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment they\u2019re giving you, damn it. You will give me your full attention. When I ask a question, I expect to have it answered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you do,\u201d she agreed, trying to soothe him. \u201cIt\u2019s just that now isn\u2019t the time. . .\u201d Her mind was still focused on the soldiers\u2019 opinion of her. \u201cI cannot believe you think I\u2019m mean!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cYou killed our pet and three others,\u201d Calum reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThat was necessary, not mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came up with the plan to blind the noser,\u201d Keith said.</p><p>\u201cBlindfold him,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cYou put an arrow in the Maclnnes soldier. That was damned mean, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it again,\u201d she announced. She wasn\u2019t about to pretend she was sorry she\u2019d injured the soldier. He had meant to kick Clare MacKay, and she couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cAye, you would do it again,\u201d Keith agreed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re all thinking you\u2019re a mean one, m\u2019lady. It\u2019s an honor to have you for our mistress.\u201d</p><p>Grunts of approval followed Keith\u2019s compliment. Johanna became flustered. She brushed her hair back over her shoulders in an attempt to act as though she hadn\u2019t been overly affected by Keith\u2019s remarks. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s all right for you to call me mean, men, but you won\u2019t be saying such things in front of my mama. She wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shouted her name. She decided he\u2019d run out of patience. He had waited a long while to get her full attention. She turned back to her husband and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>His eyelid twitched. He\u2019d used up all his patience all right. Johanna braced herself and then blurted out, \u201cI didn\u2019t pretend to faint the first time and I did faint again this afternoon. However,\u201d she quickly added before he could start in bellowing again, \u201cI\u2019m really not sick. Glynis explained what was wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would overreact!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He took hold of her hand and turned to drag her across the hall. She wasn\u2019t being very cooperative. She kept trying to pull away. \u201cHow long must I stay in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you\u2019ve recovered from whatever it is ailing you,\u201d he commanded. \u201cDamn it, I knew you weren\u2019t strong enough to last a full year.\u201d</p><p>Her gasp filled the hall. She\u2019d taken grave exception to his remark. The soldiers were all watching, of course, and when they heard their lard\u2019s comment and his wife\u2019s reaction, they smiled in unison.</p><p>\u201cIf you believed I was such a weakling, you shouldn\u2019t have married me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. She jerked her hand away from his and backed up a space before he could catch hold of her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wagering she\u2019s about to get mean again,\u201d Lindsay said.</p><p>Father MacKechnie shook his head. \u201cNot with our laird,\u201d he told the soldier. \u201cShe\u2019s partial to the MacBain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look partial to him now,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cHer scowl\u2019s every bit as set as his is.\u201d</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t paying any attention to the soldiers\u2019 mutterings. Her concentration was centered on her stubborn husband. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry you married me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her fast enough. \u201cYou only married me to get the land, and after I\u2019m dead and gone, you\u2019ll have to remember to marry a big giant of a woman, preferably one who can belch as loud as any of your men.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face gave her pause.</p><p>\u201cYou will not die.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d whispered his command in a harsh voice filled with anguish. She was stunned. Gabriel sounded terrified. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will not lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not lose me.\u201d</p><p>She walked forward and took hold of his hand. Tears filled her eyes as she stared up at the wonderful man trying to glare some sense into her.</p><p>He loved her. He hadn\u2019t given her the words yet, but the proof was there in his eyes. Johanna felt overwhelmed.</p> <p>They went up the steps leading to the entrance together. She could feel him shaking. She didn\u2019t want him to worry any longer, and so she stopped at the foot of the stairs leading up to the bedchambers and turned to her husband.</p><p>The men were all craning their necks to see what was happening, but they were too far away to hear the conversation.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, do you remember my concern before we were married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had too many concerns for me to keep track of, wife. Don\u2019t push my hands away. I\u2019m going to carry you upstairs. Don\u2019t you realize you could break your neck if you fainted while trying to climb these steep steps? You may not be worried about your welfare, but I sure as hell am.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was wearing his heart on his sleeve. He didn\u2019t like feeling this vulnerable. \u201cWhat will your mother say when she arrives and finds her daughter dead?\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cMama\u2019s going to like you, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Her husband looked exasperated. He lifted her into his arms. She immediately kissed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to bed,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cOn the night after we were married, I told you I was barren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. Nicholas told me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOn our wedding night, I\u2019m certain I mentioned it.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cYes, you did,\u201d he said. \u201cSeveral times in fact. \u201d</p><p>He started up the steps. She rested her head against his shoulder. Her fingers were fully occupied stroking the back of his neck.</p><p>She wondered if their baby would have her husband\u2019s coloring. She thought she might like to have a little girl, then decided she would be just as happy with a boy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she whispered with a sigh.</p><p>She waited for him to understand. He didn\u2019t say anything until they reached their bedchamber.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I just said? I\u2019m not,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not barren.\u201d</p> <p>He opened the door but hesitated at the threshold. His gaze was fully directed on his wife. He slowly lowered her to the floor. \u201cDo you honestly believe it matters to me? You and Alex are all the family I want. I don\u2019t need another child. Damn it, woman, haven\u2019t you realized yet how much I . . . you mean more to ...\u201d</p><p>Hell, he was rambling like an old woman. He motioned for her to go inside. \u201cWarriors do not concern themselves with matters of love,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He looked miserable. She didn\u2019t smile. She knew he didn\u2019t like telling her what he was feeling.</p><p>It was a trait they both shared, she realized.</p><p>\u201cGabriel ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want you to bring up the fact that you\u2019re barren, Johanna. Now quit fretting.\u201d</p><p>She strolled into their chamber. \u201cYou may not need another child, m\u2019lord, but I do declare in six or seven months you\u2019re going to be getting one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. He shook his head. She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in his life, Gabriel MacBain was rendered speechless. His wife believed that was a most appropriate reaction.</p><p>They had, after all, just been given a miracle.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>You\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel whispered his question so his son wouldn\u2019t wake up. Alex was sleeping on a mat across the chamber. Only the top of his head was visible above the mound of covers Johanna felt he needed to stay warm.</p><p>She and her husband were in bed. Gabriel held Johanna in his arms. She was so relieved he was finally reacting, she let out a little sigh. She\u2019d given Gabriel her good news over an hour ago, then waited for him to tell her how happy she\u2019d made him. He hadn\u2019t said a word until now.</p><p>\u201cI have all the symptoms.\u201d she whispered back. \u201cI was disbelieving at first, of course, because I thought I was barren for a very long while. Are you happy about the baby, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She sighed again. It was too dark in the chamber to see his face, but she guessed he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cGlynis told me a woman can be barren with one man and fertile with another. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen can be barren, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. She hushed him so he wouldn\u2019t wake Alex. \u201cYour first husband obviously was.\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy does that please you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a bastard.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fault his reasoning. \u201cWhy don\u2019t men acknowledge that they could be the barren ones in a marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch an admission would wound their pride, I suppose. It\u2019s easier to blame the women. It isn\u2019t right, just easier.\u201d</p><p>She let out a loud, lusty yawn. Gabriel was stroking her back. The caress made her sleepy. He asked her something, but she was too tired to answer him. She closed her eyes and was dead to the world a minute later.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t fall asleep for another hour. He held Johanna close and thought about the baby. He should have wanted a boy as his first choice, for a man couldn\u2019t have enough sons to help with the building of an empire, but he really hoped for a baby girl. She would have blue eyes and yellow hair, like her mother, and if God was willing to recreate perfection, his daughter would be every bit as sassy.</p><p>He fell asleep with a smile on his face.</p><p>Laird MacBain told his clan about the baby the following morning. Johanna stood next to her husband on the top step outside the doors. Alex stood next to her. Both the Maclaurins and the MacBains cheered the news. Johanna and Gabriel had already told Alex. The little boy didn\u2019t seem overly interested about a new brother or sister, and his lack of interest convinced his parents he was feeling secure.</p><p>He could barely stand still during the announcement. His father had promised to take him riding, and to a four-year-old, a minute of waiting seemed to feel as long as an hour.</p><p>After Gabriel dismissed the well-wishers, Johanna turned to Calum and Keith.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come up with several names I\u2019d like to ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, lass, you can\u2019t tell us the baby\u2019s name,\u201d Keith blurted out.</p><p>The Maclaurin soldier was horrified by her ignorance. Didn\u2019t she realize the bairn\u2019s name should never, ever be told to another person before the baptism? As soon as he was able to stop sputtering, he asked her just that question. She told him she guessed she didn\u2019t realize.</p><p>\u201cI was never concerned about the traditions regarding babies,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, m\u2019lady?\u201d Calum asked. \u201cMost married women are careful to follow every tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was barren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Keith remarked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do our best to instruct you, then, on the importance of the name you select.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s name is far more important than just a name,\u201d Calum announced.</p><p>Before she could ask what in heaven\u2019s name he meant by that statement, Keith turned her attention. \u201cIf another person has knowledge of the name before the christening, he could use it to work magic on the babe.\u201d</p><p>Calum nodded agreement.</p><p>Johanna could tell from their serious expressions they weren\u2019t jesting with her. They really believed their nonsense. \u201cIs this tradition or superstition you\u2019re giving me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Glynis stepped forward to join the conversation. She wanted to add a few important reminders of her own.</p><p>\u201cIf the babe cries during the christening, then it is sufficient proof the devil\u2019s been driven out, m\u2019lady. Did you already know that truth?\u201d</p><p>Johanna shook her head. She had never heard of anything so preposterous. She didn\u2019t want to injure Glynis\u2019s feelings, however, and for that reason she didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall hope the baby cries,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou might also give the wee one a tiny pinch to ensure he does cry out,\u201d Glynis suggested.</p><p>\u201cSome mothers probably do,\u201d Keith speculated.</p><p>\u201cIf your baby\u2019s born at midnight or at the twilight hour, he\u2019ll have the gift of second sight, of course. Heaven help the babe if he comes during the chime hours, for then he\u2019ll have the ability to see ghosts and spirits hidden from the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, aren\u2019t you ready to leave yet?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>Gabriel nodded. He leaned down, ordered Johanna not to exhaust herself, and then lifted his son on his shoulder and started for the stables.</p><p>Leila walked across the courtyard, bowed her head to her laird when she passed him, and then hurried over to Johanna to offer her congratulations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s joyful news,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is,\u201d Glynis agreed. \u201cI was just giving m\u2019lady a few suggestions,\u201d she told Leila.</p><p>\u201cAnd I shall try to remember every one of them,\u201d Johanna promised.</p><p>Keith shook his head. \u201cI doubt you\u2019ll remember,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten what day this is,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing the wrong plaid again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if she\u2019s doing it on purpose,\u201d Calum remarked. There was a hint of amusement in his voice. As soon as the MacBain soldier spoke, Leila deliberately turned so that her back was to Calum. She kept her gaze directed on the ground. Johanna noticed the action and was intrigued by it.</p><p>\u201cGlynis, Megan told me you had a good hand at cutting hair,\u201d Johanna said.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth I do have a talent for the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare MacKay could use your assistance,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cThe Maclnnes men made a mess out of her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they did,\u201d Glynis said. \u201cThey meant to make a mess so anyone seeing her would know her shame.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t want to get into a long discussion about Clare now. \u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut Clare\u2019s father is coming here today, and I was wondering if you could . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more, m\u2019lady. I\u2019ll be happy to fetch my scissors and try to make the lass look a little more presentable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cLeila, please don\u2019t leave just yet,\u201d she added when the Maclaurin woman turned to walk with Glynis across the yard.</p><p>\u201cSince Lady Johanna\u2019s wearing the MacBain colors, I assume she\u2019s your responsibility today,\u201d Keith told Calum.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, gentlemen,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cYou both waste your time following me around.\u201d</p><p>The two men ignored her protest. \u201cAye, she is my responsibility,\u201d Calum said.</p><p>Johanna decided she would have to talk to Gabriel about the foolishness in his command. The men would continue to trail after her until they were released from the duty by their laird.</p><p>Keith bowed to his mistress and left to see his duties completed. Calum was about to go back inside, but Johanna stayed him with her hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cCalum, may I have a minute of your time? I would like to introduce you to Leila.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that suggested she\u2019d lost her senses. \u201cI\u2019ve known Leila for some time, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t spare the Maclaurin woman a glance when he said her name. Johanna turned to Leila. She was diligently staring at the ground. \u201cLeila, have you met Calum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I have,\u201d Leila whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me please, both of you, why you act as though you\u2019ve never met before? I\u2019m very curious and probably interfering, but I assure you I have the best of intentions. I thought, from the looks you try not to give each other, well, that you might actually care about each other a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a MacBain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Maclaurin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease excuse me, m\u2019lady,\u201d Calum said, his voice clipped and hard. \u201cI have duties that need my attention. I don\u2019t have time for such foolish talk.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even nod jn Leila\u2019s direction when he left. She kept her gaze turned away. Johanna reached out to touch her arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make either one of you upset. You do care about Calum, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She gave an abrupt nod. \u201cI have tried not to have these feelings, m\u2019lady,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI cannot seem to help myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe Calum has feelings for you, Leila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she argued. \u201cHe would never allow himself to become attracted to a Maclaurin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the separation between the clans ran this deep,\u201d Johanna remarked.</p><p>\u201cHow could you not know? The way the men carry on whenever you wear the wrong plaid should be proof enough of the importance they attach to the issue. We\u2019re all trying to get along with each other yet stay separate at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why must everyone stay separate?\u201d</p><p>Leila confessed she didn\u2019t know. \u201cWe\u2019re all most appreciative of our laird\u2019s patience with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard what you said at the supper table about the land belonging to the MacBains now. Everyone was talking about it, m\u2019lady. What you said made sense to some of us. The Maclaurin soldiers didn\u2019t like hearing the truth, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I think? We have one too many plaids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we do,\u201d Leila agreed. \u201cBut neither clan is going to give up its colors, no matter how much you plead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to plead with anyone,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cWill you answer a question please? If Calum was a Maclaurin, would he court you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope he would,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t a Maclaurin, and he doesn\u2019t have any feelings for me anyway.\u201d</p><p>Johanna turned the topic then. \u201cWould you like to come back to the hall and help with the tasks every now and again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, m\u2019lady, I would. I could see . . .\u201d She stopped before she gave herself away.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cYes, you would be able to see Calum more often.\u201d</p><p>Leila blushed. \u201cOur laird doesn\u2019t want me to ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course he does,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cCome for dinner tonight, Leila. You\u2019ll sit next to me. We\u2019ll discuss your duties after we\u2019ve eaten.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would be honored to sit at your table,\u201d Leila whispered. Her voice shook with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI must go inside now and take my turn sitting with Clare. I\u2019ll see you tonight, Leila.\u201d</p><p>Johanna hurried upstairs and went directly to Clare\u2019s chamber. She dismissed Megan from her task of watching over the woman and sat down to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you climb the stairs without assistance, m\u2019lady?\u201d Megan demanded to know.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Johanna answered, surprised by the censure in Megan\u2019s tone.</p><p>\u201cYou could fall,\u201d Megan countered. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be taking such chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, I have enough people fretting over me. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ll go daft if I\u2019m followed around day and night. I held onto the railing,\u201d she added when Megan looked ready to protest.</p><p>\u201cAre you ill, Lady Johanna?\u201d Clare asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s carrying, like you,\u201d Megan blurted out. She nodded, then closed the door behind her.</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations, m\u2019lady. I hope you give your husband a sound boy.\u201d</p><p>Clare struggled to sit up in bed. Johanna tucked the covers around the woman before taking her seat again.</p><p>\u201cA girl will be just as pleasing,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>Clare shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want a girl. Boys have far more advantages, but girls are only used for barter. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Johanna agreed. She folded her hands in her lap and smiled at the MacKay woman.</p><p>Clare was frowning at her. \u201cThen why would you want one? You\u2019ll have the worry your husband will give her in marriage to some evil man, and she\u2019ll spend the rest of her life . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeing afraid?\u201d</p><p>Clare nodded. \u201cAnd hurt,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMy husband would not deliberately give his daughter to a monster,\u201d she said. \u201cDid your father know MacInnes was cruel-hearted?\u201d</p><p>Clare shrugged. \u201cHe only cared about uniting the two clans.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was disheartened to hear that news. \u201cDoes your father love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as any father would love a daughter,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cGirls are more clever.\u201d Johanna said. \u201cEven Father MacKechnie believes this to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can still be beaten and humiliated. You don\u2019t realize how fortunate you are, Lady Johanna. Your husband treats you well.\u201d</p> <p>Johanna leaned back in her chair. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t stay here if he didn\u2019t treat me well.\u201d</p><p>Clare didn\u2019t look like she believed Johanna. \u201cHow could you leave?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI would find a way,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cClare, when I was married before, to an Englishman, I would pray every night I wouldn\u2019t conceive. I didn\u2019t want to give him a girl because I knew he would mistreat her whenever he felt inclined to vent his anger, and I didn\u2019t want to give him a boy because I knew he would be taken away from me and raised in his father\u2019s image. I didn\u2019t want such foul attitudes about women to be passed down, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you beaten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the Englishman die? Did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>Johanna was surprised by the question. She shook her head. \u201cThere were times I wanted to kill him, and I\u2019ll surely burn in hell for admitting such a sin of contemplation, but I didn\u2019t give in to my anger. I didn\u2019t want to be like him, Clare. I felt trapped, yes, and then I realized I was intelligent enough to find a way to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told by King John he fell from a cliff near the city on the waters. I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d left England.\u201d</p><p>Clare nodded. Johanna decided to turn the topic. \u201cGlynis will be here in a few minutes with her scissors. She\u2019ll try to repair your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will my father get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe expect him this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my hair repaired. It used to be as long as yours until they butchered it. I want my father to see what the Maclnnes men did to his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Clare answered. \u201cFour years now. I\u2019m glad she isn\u2019t here now. It would break her heart to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby you\u2019re carrying . . . will your father ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very weary now, m\u2019lady. I would like to rest.\u201d</p><p>Johanna stared at Clare a long while. The MacKay woman closed her eyes. She was feigning sleep.</p><p>\u201cClare, you can\u2019t keep this up much longer,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to talk about what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in pain, Johanna. Have you no mercy?\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cI know you ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare,\u201d Johanna interrupted. \u201cMy husband is most anxious for you to tell him who the MacBain soldier\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not name the man.\u201d</p><p>Clare burst into tears. Johanna reached out to take hold of her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you felt trapped, and I felt the same way. I couldn\u2019t marry the bastard. I couldn\u2019t. I did something I wish now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Clare shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll be found out soon enough. Please let me rest now. I\u2019m not strong enough to talk about what happened.\u201d</p><p>Johanna gave in. Glynis pounded on the door and then walked inside. She carried a brush and her scissors in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to see what I can do,\u201d she announced. Johanna stood up. \u201cClare isn\u2019t up to having her hair fussed over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean all the trouble I went to searching out these scissors was for nothing, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually no, Glynis. I could do with your services. I\u2019ve been wanting to cut my hair for quite some time. Come along to my bedroom and you can use your scissors on me.\u201d</p><p>Glynis perked up. Her errand hadn\u2019t been in vain after all. She and Johanna got into an argument about the length to be trimmed, however. Glynis didn\u2019t want to cut so much away, but her mistress was emphatic.</p><p>Johanna\u2019s hair barely reached her shoulders when Glynis was finished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit you look fetching, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it would be so curly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe weight kept the curls out,\u201d Glynis explained.</p><p>\u201cThe weight gave me a fair-sized headache every day,\u201d Johanna added. \u201cThank you so much, Glynis.\u201d She threaded her fingers through her hair and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not so certain how it looks, but it feels wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the MacBain throw a fit when he sees what I\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>Johanna could tell from Glynis\u2019s smile she was jesting with her question.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll even notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll notice, all right. He notices everything about you. We all smile over the way he stares at you. He holds affection for you, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pray he\u2019ll continue to feel affection for me tonight. He\u2019s sure to become irritated when I join him at the dinner table. \u2019Tis the truth everyone\u2019s going to be rattled by the surprise I\u2019ve decided upon.\u201d</p><p>Glynis\u2019s curiosity was captured, of course. \u201cWhat do you have planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d Johanna replied. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Glynis nagged her mistress for several more minutes before giving up. \u201cWill you be going downstairs? I\u2019ll take hold of your arm and make certain you don\u2019t fall on the steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here,\u201d she replied. \u201cWould you mind if I borrowed your scissors? I\u2019ll return them to you this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep them here,\u201d Glynis said. \u201cWhen Clare\u2019s wanting her hair trimmed, I\u2019ll know where to look. Good day to you, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Glynis was just reaching for the door latch when Johanna stopped her with a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo all women have the same symptoms when they\u2019re carrying?\u201d</p><p>Glynis turned around. \u201cMost do,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cWhen does a woman start showing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Glynis replied. \u201cSome show by the fourth month, others wait another month for their middles to fatten. You should be starting to lose your waist,\u201d she added. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Johanna said.</p><p>She thanked Glynis again. As soon as the door closed behind the woman, Johanna began work on her surprise. She spread the MacBain plaid lengthwise over the bed and cut it down the middle. She made the same long cut in the Maclaurin plaid. Then she sat down on the bed with the two halves and sewed them together. When she was finished, it was impossible to tell where the MacBain plaid ended and the Maclaurin plaid began.</p><p>Keith would probably have to take to his bed for a week when he saw what she\u2019d done. Johanna knew she was going to cause an uproar. She didn\u2019t care. It was high time everyone put his differences aside and joined together to form one clan under Gabriel\u2019s leadership.</p><p>She probably should tell her husband what she was going to do. Johanna folded the leftover strips and put them under the bed. She hid the new plaid she\u2019d sewn together there, too. She wouldn\u2019t put the garment on until dinner.</p><p>She was yawning by the time she\u2019d completed her task. She needed a nap. She took off her plaid, draped it over the chair with her belt, and then stretched out on the bed. She would only rest a minute or two.</p><p>Johanna fell asleep thinking about Clare MacKay. The woman had started to tell her something she\u2019d done, then changed her mind. She\u2019d looked terribly frightened.</p><p>She was certainly a puzzle. What had she meant when she\u2019d said in time she would be found out?</p><p>Johanna slept for three hours. She opened her eyes and found Alex sound asleep beside her. Her son was drooling all over her arm. He was obviously a sound sleeper, a trait she hoped his little brother or sister would share.</p><p>She slowly sat up so she wouldn\u2019t disturb Alex and almost burst into laughter when she spotted Dumfries sound asleep at the foot of the bed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t order the dog down without waking Alex. She scooted out of bed, washed, and then got dressed in the MacBain plaid again. Waves of nausea made the simple task seem to take forever. Johanna had to sit down several times to wait until the sickness passed.</p><p>Gabriel opened the door just as she was tightening her belt around her waist. He saw that his son was still sleeping and motioned with the crook of his finger for Johanna to join him in the hall.</p><p>He was staring at her hair, or so she believed, and frowning with obvious displeasure.</p><p>He would eventually get over his irritation, she decided. She hurried across the chamber, a smile on her face, and went out into the corridor. Gabriel pulled the door closed and turned to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too damned pale,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is why you\u2019re frowning, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. She pinched her cheeks to gain some color. \u201cHave you perchance noticed anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare\u2019s father was spotted coming up the ridge.\u201d</p><p>She forgot all about trying to gain a compliment over her haircut when Gabriel gave her his news.</p><p>\u201cI want you and Alex to stay inside our chamber until Laird MacKay and his men have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many soldiers ride with the laird?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cEnough,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Gabriel was just turning away when she shook her head at him. \u201cI wish to speak to Clare\u2019s father,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be in the mood to be polite, Johanna. Do as I order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird\u2019s angry with the Maclnnes clan, not us,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he said. \u201cHis fury is fully directed on all the MacBains. He blames us for his daughter\u2019s disgrace.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s complexion underwent a radical change. She wasn\u2019t pale now. In the space of a heartbeat, her face had turned red with anger.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask her husband how he\u2019d gained his information. If he said the Laird MacKay blamed them, then it must be true. Gabriel wasn\u2019t one to jump to conclusions without first gaining all the facts.</p><p>\u201cWho is sitting with Clare now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilda,\u201d he answered. \u201cGo back inside,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of the MacKay\u2019s anger near you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree or disagree with her husband\u2019s command. He assumed she was going to be cooperative. She did go back inside her chamber, but only for a minute or two, until she was certain her husband had gone back downstairs to wait for Clare\u2019s father. Then she hurried down the hallway to Clare\u2019s room. She sent Hilda to sit with Alex.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s going to be here in just a few minutes, Clare. Do you want to see him alone, or do you want me to stay with you?\u201d</p><p>Clare struggled to sit up in bed. She let out a little whimper of distress. Johanna wasn\u2019t certain if the movement caused her pain or if the announcement was the reason. The fear on Clare\u2019s face was aching to see.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay,\u201d she said.</p><p>Johanna straightened the blankets around the bed, more to cover her own nervousness than to make Clare comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell him what happened,\u201d Johanna advised.</p><p>Tears gathered in Clare\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>The truth hit Johanna all at once. It was a blessing she was standing next to the chair. She was able to sit down before she fell.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, I think I do understand. You made it all up, didn\u2019t you? There wasn\u2019t any MacBain . . . you aren\u2019t carrying . . .\u201d</p><p>Clare started crying. She shook her head, trying to deny Johanna\u2019s accusation. The fear in her eyes made a mockery of her attempt to cling to her lie, however.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Johanna asked. \u201cEvery time one of us tried to ask you questions, you feigned weariness.\u201d</p><p>Clare didn\u2019t give Johanna time to continue. \u201cI was weary,\u201d she defended.</p><p>Johanna could feel Clare\u2019s panic. She wanted to comfort her. She didn\u2019t, though. Instead she tried to be heartless to her pain, for she was determined to get to the truth. Only then could she help Clare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou gave yourself away, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you felt trapped and that you did something you knew would eventually be found out. Pretending to be carrying a baby would eventually be found out, wouldn\u2019t it? Didn\u2019t you realize people would notice you weren\u2019t getting bigger?\u201d</p><p>Clare was openly sobbing now. \u201cI didn\u2019t think at all,\u201d she confessed.</p> <p>Johanna slowly leaned back in her chair. \u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name are we going to do about this mess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? I\u2019m the one who will suffer the consequences when my father finds out I lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you make up such a tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was desperate,\u201d Clare admitted. \u201cCan\u2019t you understand? It was so horrible living there. Each day got worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p> <p>Clare interrupted. She was anxious to explain her reasons so Johanna wouldn\u2019t condemn her.</p><p>\u201cFather placed me in the Maclnnes household for training. I was supposed to marry the laird\u2019s son in six months\u2019 time. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize how terrible they all were. Did you know the laird has two older daughters? They were born before his precious son,\u201d she added in a rush. \u201cOne of the servants told me that each time the laird was given the news his wife had delivered him a daughter, he went up to the birthing chamber and beat the poor woman. She died after giving him a son. She probably welcomed death. I know I would have if I were married to such a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his son is just like his father, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Johanna already knew the answer to her question. She had vivid memories of the laird\u2019s son standing over Clare with his hands formed into fists at his sides.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worse than his father,\u201d Clare said. Her voice reeked with disgust. \u201cI couldn\u2019t abide the thought of being married to him. I tried to talk to my father, but he wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I had run back home, you see, but . . .</p><p>Clare couldn\u2019t go on for several minutes. Her sobs were wrenching. Johanna found it extremely difficult to maintain her own composure. Not only had Clare been placed in the hands of a monster, she\u2019d also been betrayed by her father. It was unthinkable to Johanna, for her own father would have killed Raulf had the dear older man been alive and known the anguish his daughter suffered.</p><p>\u201cYour father took you back to the Maclnnes clan, didn\u2019t he, Clare?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever felt so abandoned . . . or . . . desperate. A few days later, I heard the Maclnnes soldiers talking. They\u2019d spotted warriors wearing the MacBain plaid crossing their border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is when you came up with the lie?\u201d</p><p>Clare shook her head. \u201cThe soldiers didn\u2019t realize I was listening to them. When they whispered your husband\u2019s name, I could hear the fear in their voices. I decided then that I would go searching for these soldiers. I don\u2019t know what I thought would happen if I found them. I didn\u2019t have a plan, Johanna. I just wanted someone to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Johanna agreed, her voice a soothing whisper. She handed Clare a linen cloth to wipe her face, then took hold of her hand. \u201cI would have done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The conviction in her voice assured Clare. Johanna felt a strong bond with the woman. They were united now, for their memories of nightmares past joined them together against the atrocities forced on women by a few bullying, frightened men.</p><p>\u201cI had already been beaten once for insolence,\u201d Clare said. \u201cAnd I knew it would happen again and again. I never found the MacBain soldiers; and by the time I gave up my search, it was getting dark. I stayed in an abandoned cropper\u2019s cottage all night. Dear God, I was afraid. I was terrified of going back to the Maclnnes keep and terrified not to,\u201d she added. \u201cThey found me the next morning.\u201d Clare was holding onto Johanna\u2019s hand with such a strong grip, she was bruising the skin.</p> <p>\u201cYou felt helpless, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Clare answered. \u201cI still hadn\u2019t thought up the lie though. Three months went by, and then one morning the laird announced he\u2019d decided to move up the marriage date. Robert and I were to be wed the following Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Clare\u2019s voice was hoarse from strain and weeping. Johanna was going to get up to fetch her a drink of water, but Clare wouldn\u2019t let go of her hand.</p><p>\u201cMy lie wasn\u2019t planned ahead of time,\u201d she said. \u201cI gathered my courage and stood up to Robert. I told him I would never marry him. He went into a rage. He\u2019s a possessive man, and jealous. I knew he wouldn\u2019t want me if he believed I had willingly given myself to another man. I remembered the MacBain soldiers who had crossed the border, remembered, too, the MacInnes\u2019 soldiers fear of your laird, and that is when I came up with the lie. I knew what I did was wrong and I\u2019m sorry I lied to you. You have been so kind to me, Johanna. Hilda told me what you did to Robert. I wish your arrow had pierced his black heart. Dear God, how I hate him. I hate all men, even my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have sound reason to despise Robert,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cIn time you\u2019ll get past your hatred. You might even begin to pity the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so forgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare, I know you aren\u2019t in the mood to listen to me, but I still must instruct you not to blame the majority of men for the sins of a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hate your first husband?\u201d</p><p>Johanna sighed. \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t hate all men. My father, if he\u2019d been alive, would have protected me from Raulf. I would have found sanctuary with him. My brother, Nicholas, came to my rescue once he became aware of what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce he became aware? Didn\u2019t you tell him after the first beating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain, Clare,\u201d Johanna replied. \u201cRaulf wasn\u2019t like Robert, and I was much, much younger then. The beatings didn\u2019t start right after we were wed. He set about destroying my confidence first. I was naive, and frightened, too, and when you are called ignorant and unworthy over and over again by someone who is supposed to love and protect you, well, in time a part of you will begin to believe some of the nonsense. I didn\u2019t tell my brother because I was too ashamed. I kept thinking I would make it better. I never believed I deserved such foul treatment, and eventually I came to realize Raulf was never going to change. That is when I knew I had to find a way to leave. I would have gone to Nicholas, but as it turned out, it wasn\u2019t necessary. My husband was killed.\u201d</p><p>Johanna paused to take a calming breath. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t hate Nicholas if you knew him. He\u2019s the reason I married Gabriel,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you cannot hate my husband.\u2019Tis the truth I can\u2019 t imagine how anyone could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate him,\u201d Clare said. \u201cHe has been protecting me, and I am appreciative. He does frighten me though. You obviously do not notice what a giant of a man he is, m\u2019lady, or that his manner is most . . . abrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can be overwhelming, but only if you let him,\u201d Johanna replied, a smile in her voice now. \u201cClare, you showed incredible courage standing up to Robert. You must have known what would happen. You almost got yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy game is over, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll tell my father the truth. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he make you go back to Maclnnes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Clare said. \u201cHe wants the alliance.\u201d</p><p>Johanna felt sick. The thought of the woman being forced back into Robert\u2019s grasp was simply too appalling to think about. Only one thing was certain in her mind. She wasn\u2019t going to let that happen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell your father the truth just yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI must think about this. I cannot allow you to go back. No, I can\u2019t let that happen. We will have to put our heads together and come up with a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care, m\u2019lady? You put yourself in jeopardy by keeping me. Your compassion will get you into trouble. My father ...\u201d</p><p>Johanna wouldn\u2019t let her finish her protest. \u201cClare, I believe you\u2019ve already conquered the most difficult challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in an untenable position, and you took the most important first step. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen your road to freedom, but that doesn\u2019t matter now. You got out. Don\u2019t you understand? You cannot consider going backward now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when my father\u2019s soldiers war against the MacBains because of my lie?\u201d</p><p>Johanna shook her head. \u201cWe will find a way to avert a conflict,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . not yet, but you and I are clever. We can find a way to straighten out this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would you put your clan in such a position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe one must be sacrificed for the other,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cI do believe that every woman has a responsibility to look out for the other. When one is in bondage or suffering, then aren\u2019t all of us?\u201d</p><p>Johanna knew she wasn\u2019t making any sense. It was difficult for her to put her feelings into a coherent explanation. \u201cWomen are looked down upon by some men. There are members of our church who consider us inferior. God doesn\u2019t, though. Remember that one important truth, Clare. It took me a long while to understand. Men make the rules, not women. They tell us they are interpreting God\u2019s views, and we are supposed to be naive enough to believe them. We are not so inferior.\u201d Her voice was filled with conviction now. \u201cAs women, we must try to stand together . . . like sisters, and when we see an injustice, we damned well should try to interfere. Together . . . if there are enough of us united, we can help. Attitudes can be changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where do we start? With our sons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe start by helping each other now,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cLater, when we have sons and daughters, we teach them to love and honor one another. We are all made in God\u2019s image, men and women alike.\u201d</p><p>The sound of men coming down the hallway stopped the discussion. Clare surprised Johanna, for she didn\u2019t look overly afraid. She let go of her hand, straightened her shoulders, and smoothed her covers.</p><p>The door was just opening when Clare whispered, \u201cTogether.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded and then echoed the promise. \u201cTogether.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Gabriel was the first to enter the chamber. He didn\u2019t look happy to see his wife there. He shook his head at her. She pretended she didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Father MacKechnie led Laird MacKay into the room. The priest nodded to Johanna before turning his attention to Clare.</p><p>\u201cYou look a wee bit better today,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Laird MacKay moved to the side of the priest so he could see his daughter. He started forward, then came to an abrupt stop. \u201cDear God,\u201d he whispered, loud enough for everyone in the chamber to hear.</p><p>The sight of his daughter\u2019s bruised face made the laird blanch. Johanna had been prepared to dislike the man. He had refused to listen to his daughter\u2019s pleas and had forced her to go back to the Maclnnes men. Yet his reaction now made Johanna reevaluate her opinion. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t realized how horrible Clare\u2019s circumstances were.</p><p>No, she thought to herself. She wasn\u2019t going to give him the benefit of the doubt. She didn\u2019t care if she was being uncharitable or worse. In her mind he was just as responsible for Clare\u2019s near death as Robert Maclnnes was.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a very appealing man in appearance. He was of medium size, judging by the fact that Gabriel towered over him. He was at least twice her husband\u2019s age, too, for he had thick strands of gray streaked through his brown hair. He had deep lines around the corners of his eyes and around his mouth. Like his daughter, he had brown eyes. His nose was his most prominent feature, however. It was quite large, and hawklike. It was fortunate Clare hadn\u2019t inherited that feature from her father.</p><p>Gabriel walked over to stand next to Johanna. The window was directly behind them. The furs had been tied back, and a faint breeze brushed her back.</p><p>\u201cGood day, Father.\u201d</p><p>Laird MacKay finally recovered from his initial surprise. He walked over to the side of the bed, reached down, and took hold of his daughter\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cClare, what have you done to yourself?\u201d</p><p>The caring was there in his voice, but Johanna thought the question obscene. She saw red. She walked over to put herself between father and daughter. The laird let go of Clare\u2019s hand and backed up a space. He caught the look of fury on Johanna\u2019s face and backed further away.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Clare do, you ask? Do you honestly believe she inflicted those marks upon herself?\u201d</p><p>The laird\u2019s eyes widened. He took another step back, obviously trying to get away from Johanna\u2019s anger. It washed over him like boiling water.</p><p>\u201cNay, I don\u2019t think she did,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cRobert Maclnnes and his father are responsible . . . and you, Laird MacKay,\u201d she announced. \u201cAye, you are also responsible.\u201d</p><p>Clare\u2019s father turned to Gabriel. \u201cWho is this woman?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Gabriel walked over to stand closer to Johanna. \u201cShe is my wife,\u201d he announced, his voice hard. \u201cAnd you will not raise your voice in front of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t from around here.\u201d Laird MacKay made the comment in a much softer tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s from England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre English daughters allowed to speak to their elders in such a disrespectful tone of voice, I\u2019m wondering?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned to Johanna. He thought she was probably dying to answer MacKay\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cShe will speak for herself,\u201d he said.</p><p>Johanna kept her gaze on MacKay. \u201cMost English daughters are encouraged to voice their opinions,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir fathers, you see, love and cherish them. They protect them, too, unlike some lairds who would put alliances before their daughters\u2019 safety and happiness.\u201d</p><p>MacKay\u2019s face turned red. Johanna knew she was provoking his temper. She couldn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cDo you love your daughter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the laird replied. \u201cI cherish the lass, too.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cDo you realize, sir, your daughter almost died?\u201d</p><p>The laird shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize,\u201d he admitted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Father MacKechnie cleared his throat to gain his audience. \u201cPerhaps I should explain exactly how Clare came to us.\u201d</p><p>He waited for the laird\u2019s nod and then proceeded to describe the circumstances of Clare\u2019s arrival. He told how she\u2019d been stripped na*ed and then wrapped in a burlap bag. The priest didn\u2019t leave any details out of the telling and even included the fact that Robert Maclnnes had spit on the lass.</p><p>\u201cHe was set to give her a good kick,\u201d Father MacKechnie added. \u201cLady Johanna\u2019s arrow stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Clare\u2019s father stood with his hands clasped behind his back while he listened to the priest recount the chilling tale. His face didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to what he was hearing. His eyes, however, told another story. They were watery with unshed tears.</p> <p>\u201cThe MacInnes clan will pay for their sins against my daughter,\u201d MacKay announced, his voice shaking with rage. \u201cI speak of war, MacBain, not alliances. I was told by your first-in-command you are also after vengeance. What is your reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert MacInnes dared to take his knife in his hand and would have hurled it at my wife if I hadn\u2019t stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Johanna hadn\u2019t realized her husband planned to war against the MacInnes clan. The fury she heard in his voice as he explained his reason for wanting vengeance made her stomach queasy.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t touch your wife,\u201d Laird MacKay snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at, MacKay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRobert belongs to me,\u201d the laird replied. \u201cIt\u2019s my right to avenge my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was hard-pressed to agree. \u201cI must consider this,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Laird MacKay nodded. He turned his attention back to his daughter. Johanna blocked his view. The laird stepped to the side so he could see Clare.</p><p>\u201cI believed you exaggerated your circumstances. I knew you didn\u2019t want to marry Robert, and I foolishly thought in time you would learn to get along with him. It never entered my mind that the MacInnes men would treat you with such brutality. Their insult is unforgivable . . . and so is mine, lass. I should have listened to you. MacBain\u2019s woman is right. I, too, am responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Papa,\u201d Clare whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shamed you with my ...\u201d Her sobs prevented her from going on. Johanna hurried to hand Clare a linen cloth.</p><p>\u201cStop that now,\u201d her father ordered. \u201cI do not wish to see you weep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Clare said again. \u201cI cannot seem to stop.\u201d The laird shook his head. \u201cYou should have made me listen to you when you came running home, daughter, instead of disgracing yourself with a MacBain. Getting yourself with child wasn\u2019t the answer. Now you\u2019ll give me the bastard\u2019s name and I\u2019ll settle my grievances with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegging your pardon for interrupting,\u201d Johanna said, \u201cbut I thought Clare came home to you after the first beating. Isn\u2019t that fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were no bruises,\u201d the laird replied. \u201cI thought she made the tale up to gain my sympathy. I\u2019m a man who admits he\u2019s wrong when he is,\u201d he added with a nod,</p><p>Father MacKechnie was pleased to hear the laird\u2019s confession. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair start,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cGive me the name of the man, Clare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed in me. You mustn\u2019t blame the MacBains, for this was fully my sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wanting the name, daughter.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t care for the laird\u2019s harsh tone of voice. She moved to put herself between father and daughter.</p> <p>Gabriel saw the expression on her face and immediately reached out to take hold of her arm. Laird MacKay also realized what Johanna was doing.</p><p>\u201cDo you think to protect my daughter from me?\u201d he asked. He sounded astonished.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t answer his question. She tried to turn his attention.</p><p>\u201cI have misjudged you, sir, for I now realize you do love your daughter. Clare needs rest now. She took several blows to the head, and she\u2019s very weak. Why, even now she\u2019s struggling to keep her eyes open.\u201d</p><p>She prayed Clare would take the hint. She nodded to the laird to emphasize her lie, then moved aside so he could see his daughter.</p><p>Clare had caught onto the plan. Her eyes were closed, and she looked as though she\u2019d already fallen asleep. Johanna lowered her voice when she said, \u201cDo you see, Laird? She needs rest if she is ever going to recover. \u2019Tis the truth she could still die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wanting to take her back home with me,\u201d the lard whispered back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting excellent care here, Laird,\u201d Father MacKechnie announced. \u201cYour daughter doesn\u2019t appear to be strong enough to go anywhere. Best leave her be. She\u2019s under Laird MacBain\u2019s protection. She can\u2019t have better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does have better,\u201d Gabriel interjected. \u201cShe has my wife\u2019s protection as well.\u201d</p><p>Laird MacKay found his first smile. \u201cI can see that she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should go downstairs to discuss this worrisome topic,\u201d Father MacKechnie suggested. \u201cThe matter of who fathered her child can wait, can\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man will wed my daughter. I\u2019m wanting your assurance, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cI put the question to each . . .\u201d</p><p>Johanna interrupted. \u201cHe asked some of his soldiers,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cBut not all of them, of course. There are</p><p>. . . so many, and some haven\u2019t returned from . . . duties. Isn\u2019t that right, husband?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t blink an eye over his wife\u2019s lie. \u201cThat is correct,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m wanting to know, Laird, if you stand with me on the marriage issue,\u201d MacKay muttered. \u201cWill you demand the soldier responsible for disgracing Clare marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>MacKay looked satisfied. The priest hurried over to the entrance and pulled the door open. Laird MacKay gave his daughter an awkward pat on her shoulder and then turned to leave. Gabriel gave Johanna a hard wait-until-I-get-you-alone look before following Clare\u2019s father out the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou took my daughter in, MacBain, protected her, too, and your wife has shown her compassion. I won\u2019t be warring against you if a marriage comes about. We could have us a fair alliance . . .\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie pulled the door closed, cutting off Laird MacKay\u2019s remarks.</p><p>Johanna collapsed into the chair and let out a loud sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou may open your eyes now, Clare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, Johanna? I have to tell my father the truth.\u201d</p><p>Johanna nibbled on her lower lip while she thought about the problem.</p><p>\u201cAt least now we know you won\u2019t be sent back to the MacInnes clan. Your father might have been blinded before by the fever of an alliance, but he certainly had his eyes opened just now. When he saw the bruises on your face, he was convinced. He loves you, Clare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him, too,\u201d Clare whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it when I said I hated him. I was . . . angry. Oh, what a mess I\u2019ve made. I don\u2019t know what Father will do when he finds out I\u2019m not carrying.\u201d</p><p>Long minutes passed in silence. Then Johanna straightened in her chair. \u201cThere\u2019s only one solution to this problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Clare said, guessing Johanna was going to instruct her to tell the truth. \u201cI have to ...\u201d</p><p>Johanna smiled. \u201cGet married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so stunned, Clare. It\u2019s a sound solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have me? I\u2019m supposed to be carrying, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re clever enough to think of a solution,\u201d Johanna insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ll find someone suitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being stubborn or sincere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I think,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe thought of marrying anyone remotely like Robert MacInnes makes my stomach turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does, but if we can find someone who realizes your value and treats you with respect, then wouldn\u2019t you be happy to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a man does not exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband is such a man.\u201d</p><p>Clare smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he is,\u201d Johanna agreed. \u201cBut there are other men almost as perfect,\u201d she added in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fortunate, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that, Clare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love your husband.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t react to the truth for a long minute. Then she leaned back in her chair and let all her indecision and her insecurities go.</p><p>\u201cI do love him.\u201d</p><p>The wonder in her voice made Clare smile. \u201cHave you only just realized it?\u201d</p><p>Johanna shook her head. \u201cI do love him,\u201d she repeated. \u201cBut I realize now I have loved him for a long time. Isn\u2019t it odd I couldn\u2019t acknowledge my feelings, even to myself? I have been foolishly trying to protect myself,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cNo one likes to feel vulnerable. Good God, I love him with all my heart.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her laughter filled the chamber. It was filled with such joy, Clare found herself laughing, too.</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019ve never told him how you feel,\u201d Clare remarked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Johanna answered.</p><p>\u201cThen what do you say when he tells you he loves you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gabriel has never told me he loves me,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t realize it, you see, at least not yet. Eventually he\u2019ll acknowledge he loves me, but I doubt he\u2019ll ever tell me.\u201d</p><p>She paused to laugh again. \u201cMy husband is so unlike the barons in England, and I thank God for that blessing. The men I knew there would sing sweet ballads to the ladies they held in esteem. They hired others to write down poetic words of love for them to recite. The men were quite flowery in their pretty speeches. Most of it was nonsense, of course, and certainly insincere, but the barons believed they were chivalrous. They all held courtly love in high regard.\u201d</p><p>Clare\u2019s curiosity had been caught, and she asked Johanna several more questions about the men in England. A good hour passed in conversation before Johanna finally insisted Clare get some rest.</p><p>\u201cNow that your father has seen you, do let Glynis trim your hair.\u201d</p><p>Clare agreed. Johanna stood up to take her leave.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell your husband the truth about me?\u201d Clare asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cEventually,\u201d she hastily added. \u201cI must choose the right moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will he do?\u201d</p><p>Johanna opened the door before replying. \u201cHe\u2019ll growl something fierce I imagine, and then he\u2019ll help me figure out what to do.\u201d</p><p>Hilda was coming down the hallway with a tray of food for her patient. Johanna backed up so the cook could get past her.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacKay left,\u201d Hilda announced. \u201cHe\u2019s going to let you stay here until you\u2019re strong enough to go home with him, lass. Lady Johanna, they\u2019re waiting on you to start supper. The men are surly with hunger. You\u2019d best get yourself down there.\u201d</p><p>Hilda placed the tray on Clare\u2019s lap. \u201cYou, lass, are going to eat every morsel, and I\u2019m going to stand here to see that you do. You need to regain your strength,\u201d she added with a nod.</p><p>Johanna turned to leave, then suddenly stopped. \u201cIf either of you ladies should hear a commotion coming from the hall, please don\u2019t be concerned. I\u2019ve planned a little surprise, you see, and some of the soldiers might become a bit upset.\u201d</p><p>Hilda and Clare both demanded to know what the surprise was. Johanna shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Johanna wouldn\u2019t let them prod her into explaining. She went down to her chamber and changed into the plaid she\u2019d hidden under the bed. Alex came into the room while she was adjusting her pleats under her belt.</p><p>\u201cHurry and shut the door,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to want an explanation. He didn\u2019t notice anything different about her plaid either. The little boy ran over to his bed, lifted the mat, and pulled out a long wooden sword.</p><p>\u201cAuggie\u2019s going to show me how to fence,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cHave you had your supper?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cI ate with Auggie,\u201d Alex answered as he ran for the door.</p><p>\u201cOne minute, please.\u201d</p><p>He slid to a halt. \u201cCome and kiss me good-bye,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go away.\u201d</p><p>He fairly shouted his worry. Johanna hurried to assure him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Alex wasn\u2019t convinced. He dropped his wooden sword and ran to her. He threw himself into her arms and held tight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go away,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Lord, what had she started? \u201cAlex, now that I\u2019m your mother, I wish for you to kiss me every now and again when you leave. Do you understand? You told me you were going with Auggie, and that is why I asked for a kiss before you left.\u201d</p><p>It took her another ten minutes to convince the child. She stroked his back until he was ready to let go of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going away,\u201d he said then. \u201cI\u2019m just going outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still leaving,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd so I ask you again for a kiss.\u201d</p><p>She leaned down close to Alex. He stretched up and gave her a wet kiss on her cheek.</p><p>Alex picked up his sword and ran for the door. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to sit by the fire and sew, Mama. Papa said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>Alex opened the door. \u201cIt is so,\u201d he answered. \u201cPapa said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did your father say?\u201d</p><p>Alex turned and pointed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to stay where he puts you. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>She was going to have to have a talk with Gabriel about the outrageous things he was telling their child.</p><p>\u201cI do remember,\u201d she answered. \u201cGo along now. You don\u2019t want to keep Auggie waiting.\u201d</p><p>Alex forgot to shut the door. Johanna finished adjusting her plaid, took a deep breath, and then went downstairs.</p><p>Megan was just starting up the steps to fetch her mistress. She almost toppled over the banister when she noticed what Johanna was wearing.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be so cold that you need two plaids, m\u2019lady. Why, it\u2019s sweltering in here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing two plaids,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cI\u2019m only wearing one.\u201d</p><p>Megan climbed a few more steps so she could get a closer look. \u201cGood God, you made a new plaid. Does our laird know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Johanna answered.</p><p>Megan made the sign of the cross. Johanna tried to make her understand. \u201cI\u2019m sure my husband will give me his full support. My opinions and suggestions are important to him. Yes, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll stand behind me on this issue.\u201d</p> <p>Megan made another sign of the cross. She obviously wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>Johanna was exasperated. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she promised. \u201cStop doing that,\u201d she added when Megan\u2019s hand flew to her forehead again to make yet another sign of the cross.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s seen you yet,\u201d Megan blurted out. \u201cThere\u2019s still time to change into a proper plaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Johanna replied. She tried to maintain her serene expression. In truth, Megan\u2019s reaction did make her a bit nervous. She straightened her shoulders and continued on down the steps. Megan lifted her skirts and hurried past her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Johanna asked when Megan started down the corridor leading to the back of the keep.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fetch a few extra bowls, m\u2019lady. I\u2019ve a feeling you\u2019ll be needing at least five before you gain the men\u2019s cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Megan disappeared around the corner before Johanna could tell her she had no intention of throwing anything. Father MacKechnie drew her attention then when he walked inside. She turned to smile at him. He gawked at her.</p><p>Johanna stood on the bottom step and waited until the priest recovered from his surprise.</p><p>\u201cWell now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWell now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Father.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond to her greeting. He seemed to be in a bit of a stupor. His reaction was making her apprehensive.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think my husband and his soldiers will be overly upset with me?\u201d</p><p>The priest broke into a wide grin. \u201cI\u2019ll stand by your side when we find out,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be honored to escort you to your husband.\u201d</p><p>The priest took hold of Johanna\u2019s arm. She didn\u2019t notice. \u201cI expect them to be a little upset at first,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut only just a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cTell me, lass. When was your last confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s preferred to receive absolution before you meet your Maker.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s smile was forced. \u201cYou exaggerate the men\u2019s reaction. None would dare harm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about the men,\u201d he replied. \u201cI was considering your husband\u2019s reaction. Come along, lass. I\u2019m anxious to witness the battle you\u2019re about to wage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all get past their anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d the priest speculated. \u201cThe Highlanders consider their plaids sacred, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, I shouldn\u2019t have . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you should have,\u201d the priest countered. He was in the process of prying her hand away from the railing.</p><p>\u201cFather, are you for or against this change in our plaids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m for it,\u201d the priest answered. He burst into laughter then. \u201cI almost fasted today for penance. Now I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. I would have missed . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish his explanation. She let out a groan. \u201cYou\u2019re making me terribly nervous,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, lass. I don\u2019t mean to tease you. You know you\u2019re going to have to let go of that railing eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll act as though nothing is out of the ordinary,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cWhat think you of that plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plain ignorant, lass,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d She let go of the railing and took hold of Father MacKechnie\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll plead ignorance. Thank you. You\u2019ve given me a wonderful suggestion. \u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d plead insanity.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie was sorry he\u2019d made the jest the minute the words were out of his mouth. He was paying for his rash comment, too, for he was now having to drag his mistress over to the steps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand by your side,\u201d he promised. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. It will all wash out.\u201d</p><p>The soldiers were all standing around the tables. Gabriel stood near the buttery. He was talking to Calum and Keith. He spotted her before anyone else did.</p><p>He squinted at her, then closed his eyes and looked again. She smiled as she continued toward her seat at the table.</p><p>Keith and Calum both turned at the same time.</p><p>\u201cMy God, what\u2019s she done to our plaid?\u201d Calum bellowed his question.</p><p>\u201cAm I seeing what I think I\u2019m seeing?\u201d Keith asked in a shout of his own at the very same time.</p><p>Everyone turned to look at Johanna then. A collective gasp filled the air.</p><p>Johanna pretended not to notice the horrified expressions on the men\u2019s faces.</p><p>\u201cI told you it would be all right,\u201d she boasted in a whisper to the priest.</p><p>Gabriel leaned back against the wall and continued to stare at his wife.</p><p>\u201cMacBain, you\u2019d best do something before all hell breaks loose,\u201d Calum said.</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he remarked. \u201cAnd high time one of us did something,\u201d he added.</p><p>Keith\u2019s face had turned bright red. \u201cLady Johanna, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to please you, Keith,\u201d she replied.</p><p>He did a double take. \u201cYou think to please me by joining the MacBain plaid to mine? How could you think . . . how could you believe I would . . .\u201d</p><p>He was actually sputtering. She prayed it was due to his surprise and not indignation. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t seem to keep my days straight. You have noticed that flaw, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlaw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy faulty memory,\u201d she explained. \u201cCome and sit beside me, Keith, and I shall give you a proper explanation for my bold action. Calum, you take Keith\u2019s place at the other table.\u201d</p><p>Johanna kept giving her husband wary glances every other second. He hadn\u2019t shown any outward reaction to her surprise . . . yet.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, are you ready to sit down?\u201d she called out.</p><p>She had a death grip on Father MacKechnie\u2019s arm. He patted her hand in a bid to get her to let go of him.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like me to sit, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Gabriel\u2019s left,\u201d she answered, \u201cand across from me. It will be easier for you to give me the last rites if it becomes necessary,\u201d she added in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget which day it was and that was your reason for wearing both plaids?\u201d Lindsay wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIt is only one plaid,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cI cut them each down the middle and then sewed one half of each together to form this one. The colors blend together quite nicely.\u201d</p><p>Johanna reached her chair and turned to Gabriel. He was still leaning against the wall, staring at her.</p><p>His silence made her even more nervous. \u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. She couldn\u2019t stand waiting to hear what he thought of her boldness. \u201cPlease tell me how you feel about this change,\u201d she asked.</p><p>He suddenly pulled away from the wall. His voice was hard and angry when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m most displeased.\u201d</p><p>She turned her attention to the table. She tried to hide her hurt and her disappointment. She\u2019d hoped for his support, of course. \u2019Tis the truth, she\u2019d expected it. His disappointment fairly overwhelmed her.</p><p>She heard several loud grunts of approval. She didn\u2019t look up to see who the offenders were.</p><p>Gabriel walked over to the table. He nudged her chin up, then put his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI should have thought of this myself, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>It took her a full minute to realize he was giving her his approval.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far more clever than I am,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tried to tell him thank you for his compliment but couldn\u2019t. She burst into tears.</p><p>Everyone started shouting at the same time. Keith blamed Calum\u2019s rude reaction to their mistress\u2019s clothing as the reason for her distressed state. Calum was just as emphatic in his opinion that Keith\u2019s constant browbeating tactics were the true reason Lady Johanna was weeping.</p><p>Gabriel seemed to be the only one not affected by his wife\u2019s tears. He ordered her to sit down, then moved to stand behind her. He put one hand on her shoulder and turned his full attention to his soldiers.</p><p>\u201cSeeing my wife dressed in both plaids has opened my eyes. I have only just realized the great lengths Johanna has gone to in order to accommodate all of you. She has been told which plaid to wear, which chair to sit in, who to walk with, and so on, and she has never been anything but gracious in her bid to please you. From the day she arrived here, she has accepted all of you, Maclaurins and MacBains alike. She has treated Calum and Keith with equal affection. She has given all of you her devotion and her loyalty. Her repayment has been your criticism and your disdain. She has even been called coward by some, yet she didn\u2019t come to me with a single complaint. She suffered the humiliation in silence, proving without a doubt she is far more understanding and forgiving than I could ever be.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed the laird\u2019s speech. Gabriel squeezed his wife\u2019s shoulder before continuing. \u201cAye, she\u2019s been damned accommodating,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd so have I.\u201d His voice was hard now and angry. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to be patient with you, but I find it\u2019s one hell of a strain, for I\u2019m really not a patient man at all. I have had enough of this conflict and, obviously, so has my wife. From this moment on, we are united as one clan. You have accepted me as your laird. Now you will accept each other. Those of you who cannot do this have my permission to leave at first light.\u201d</p><p>Another minute or two of silence followed the laird\u2019s command. Then Lindsay took a step forward. \u201cLaird MacBain, which plaid will we wear?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned his attention to the Maclaurin soldier. \u201cYou have given me your loyalty, and I am a MacBain. You will wear my colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your father was a Maclaurin,\u201d Keith reminded his laird.</p><p>Gabriel turned his frown on his first-in-command. \u201cHe neither claimed me nor gave me his name,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd I do not claim him. I\u2019m a MacBain. If you follow me, you wear my colors.\u201d</p><p>Keith nodded. \u201cI follow you, Laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, too, Laird,\u201d Lindsay blurted out. \u201cBut I\u2019m wondering now what we will do with the Maclaurin plaids.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was going to suggest they burn the things, then changed his mind. \u201cThe plaid belongs to your past,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou will hand it down to your children with the tales of your history. The MacBain plaid you put on tomorrow is the beginning of your future. United, we will become invincible.\u201d</p><p>The tension in the hall was broken by their laird\u2019s last remark. A resounding cheer went up.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis cause for a celebration,\u201d Father MacKechnie announced.</p><p>\u201cA toast it is,\u201d Gabriel agreed.</p><p>\u201cWithout spilling,\u201d Johanna blurted out.</p><p>For some reason, her instruction was found to be vastly amusing by the men. She couldn\u2019t imagine why they were carrying on so, then thought that perhaps they were simply laughing with relief. There had been a few worrisome minutes during Gabriel\u2019s speech. At least she\u2019d been worried.</p><p>She dabbed at the corners of her eyes with her linen square, embarrassed now because she couldn\u2019t seem to quit crying.</p><p>Dear God, she was thankful she\u2019d married Gabriel. Her life had been so bleak and desolate. She\u2019d never known what joy was until he came into her life.</p><p>Such thoughts only made her weep all the more. The men didn\u2019t pay her any attention now. She heard Keith whisper it was her delicate condition causing the undignified display of emotions. Calum nodded agreement.</p><p>Johanna looked up and spotted Leila standing by the entrance. She immediately stood and motioned for the woman to come to her.</p><p>Leila seemed hesitant. The men all stood with their goblets. The jug was being passed down the line so that each soldier would pour his own. Johanna walked around the group and met Leila in the center of the hall.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, m\u2019lady, I heard,\u201d Leila interrupted. \u201cYour husband gave a powerful speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and sit down next to me, Leila, at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a Maclaurin,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAt least I was until a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>She blushed after making the comment. Johanna smiled. \u201cYou are still a Maclaurin, but you are now also a MacBain. Calum won\u2019t have any excuse not to court you now,\u201d she added in a low whisper.</p><p>Leila\u2019s blush intensified. Johanna took hold of her hand and pulled her along.</p><p>The soldiers had just finished a toast to their laird and their future. They were about to take their places at the tables when Johanna gained their attention.</p><p>\u201cI would like to make a few changes in the seating,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cWe like where we sit, m\u2019lady,\u201d Michael told her.</p><p>She ignored the protest. \u201cIt is only fitting that both commanders sit with their laird. Keith will sit on his laird\u2019s left, and Calum will sit on his right.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head at her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou will sit next to me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound like he was going to bend on the issue. \u201cAll right then,\u201d she agreed. \u201cCalum, you\u2019ll sit next to me. Leila, come along. You may sit next to Calum.\u201d</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t quite finished making changes. When she was finished, a Maclaurin sat next to a MacBain at each table.</p><p>Father MacKechnie sat at the head of the second table where Keith used to sit. He was thrilled with the honor bestowed upon him. Keith was just as pleased with the new arrangement, if his smile was an indicator, because he now sat next to his laird.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter where the rest of us sit?\u201d Lindsay asked his mistress.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to tell him the truth that she wanted to completely eliminate the division by the clans. She never again wanted to see the Maclaurins all clumped together at one table and the MacBains seated at the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The soldier repeated his question when Johanna didn\u2019t immediately answer him. She couldn\u2019t think of a logical reason to give the inquisitive man. And so she gave him an illogical one. \u201cBecause my mama\u2019s coming. That is why.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay nodded, then turned to repeat her explanation to the MacBain soldier seated next to him. \u201cHer mama\u2019s coming. M\u2019lady wants everything to be just so.\u201d</p><p>The MacBain soldier nodded. \u201cAye, she does,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Johanna turned her attention to the table so the men wouldn\u2019t see her smile. She wanted to laugh over Lindsay\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 but didn\u2019t dare.</p> <p>Dinner was a wonderful success by her measure. Calum and Leila started out as stiff as boards, but by the time the meal was finished they were talking to each other in low whispers. She was straining to hear what they were talking about when Gabriel realized what she was doing and pulled her closer to him.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a wedding soon,\u201d Gabriel remarked with a nod in Calum\u2019s direction.</p><p>Johanna smiled. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The mention of marriage turned her thoughts to Clare. The MacKay woman needed a husband, and in Johanna\u2019s estimation, there were several fine possibilities sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cKeith? Have you\u2014\u201d Johanna began, thinking to ask him if he\u2019d considered his future.</p> <p>Keith wouldn\u2019t let her finish her question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you to bring that up,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my duty to tell your husband, m\u2019lady. I tried to keep your promise, even felt a bit relieved because I felt responsible for the Maclaurin women and their offense was mine, but I didn\u2019t get through the full day without realizing my first loyalty belonged to the MacBain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Johanna had never seen a grown man blush until now. Keith was turning red with embarrassment.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to let the matter drop. \u201cExactly what did you tell my husband?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel answered her. \u201cHe explained about the names, Johanna, and how Glynis came up with . . .\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cShe was most contrite, husband. You mustn\u2019t take issue with her. Promise me you won\u2019t talk to her about this.\u201d</p><p>Since Gabriel had already had a talk with Glynis, he felt it safe to give his wife his promise.</p><p>She nodded, satisifed. \u201cI wondered where you\u2019d heard I was being called a coward,\u201d she said then. She turned her frown to Keith. \u201cIt never entered my mind, however, that you would tell my husband. I believed someone else had overheard Glynis and then went to his laird with the tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his duty to tell me,\u201d Gabriel announced. \u201cYou will thank him, wife, not sanction him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all came out in the wash,\u201d Johanna announced.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in thunder does that mean?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s giving us another lesson, Laird,\u201d Keith explained with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gabriel replied.</p><p>\u201cNay, Laird, you won\u2019t see. None of your wife\u2019s lessons make any sense.\u201d</p><p>Johanna would have explained what she\u2019d meant by her remark, but Alex drew her full attention when he came running into the hall. She saw the frightened look on his face and immediately stood up.</p><p>Alex circled the table and hurled himself into her arms. He buried his face in her plaid.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Alex?\u201d she asked, her concern apparent in her voice. \u201cDid you have a bad dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something under the bed. I heard it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rolled his eyes in exasperation. He reached over to pull his son away from Johanna. Alex wouldn\u2019t let go until his father ordered him to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping on a mat on the floor, Alex,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t possible for anything to get underneath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Papa,\u201d Alex argued. \u201cI got in your bed. It\u2019s under there. It might get me if I close my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex ...\u201d his father began.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better go up with him and look under the bed, husband. It\u2019s the only way he\u2019ll be convinced. Besides, there might really be something under there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d Alex insisted.</p><p>Gabriel let out a loud sigh before complying with his family\u2019s wishes. He stood up, lifted his son into his arms, and walked out of the hall.</p><p>Johanna took her seat again. She smiled at Keith. She was thrilled to have his attention without Gabriel. Her husband would certainly interfere in the discussion.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Johanna drawled out. \u201cThey\u2019re such a joy. When you get married and have a family of your own, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m saying. You are going to get married someday, aren\u2019t you, Keith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, m\u2019lady,\u201d he answered. \u201cNext summer as a matter of fact. Bridgid MacCoy has agreed to become my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite hide her disappointment. She turned her gaze down the table and settled on Michael as a possibility.</p><p>He caught her staring at him. He smiled. She nodded. \u201cChildren,\u201d she began again. \u201cThey\u2019re wonderful, aren\u2019t they, Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do say,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhen you get married, you\u2019ll understand. You do plan to marry someday, don\u2019t you, Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d he answered with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cHave you anyone in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you matchmaking, m\u2019lady?\u201d Keith asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll marry Helen when I\u2019m ready,\u201d Michael interjected. \u201cI\u2019ve told her I will, and she agreed to wait.\u201d</p><p>Johanna frowned. The possibilities were becoming a bit limited. She turned to Niall.</p><p>\u201cChildren ...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cShe is matchmaking,\u201d Keith announced.</p><p>It was as though he\u2019d just shouted the alarm that they were under siege. The soldiers literally jumped from their stools. They bowed to Johanna and left the room in the space of a single minute. She didn\u2019t even have enough time to order them back into their seats.</p><p>Only the soldiers already spoken for remained. And Father MacKechnie, of course, but then he wasn\u2019t a viable possibility either, for priests couldn\u2019t marry.</p><p>Gabriel came back to an almost empty hall. He looked around him in puzzlement, shrugged, and then sat down again to finish his supper.</p><p>He smiled at his wife.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He looked sheepish. \u201cThere was something under the bed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, for she believed he was jesting with her. Then he explained, \u201cDumfries crawled underneath.\u201d</p><p>Leila and Calum both stood up. Leila bowed to her laird. \u201cThank you for giving me the honor of dining with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Gabriel nodded. Leila blushed. \u201cThank you, too, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark,\u201d Calum announced.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have anything more to add. Johanna tried not to smile. \u201cPerhaps you should escort Leila home,\u201d she suggested, \u201cif it\u2019s dark, Calum.\u201d</p><p>The soldier nodded. \u201cAs you wish, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Calum motioned for Leila to walk ahead of him. Johanna turned back to her husband. Keith caught her attention then. The look of surprise on his face indicated he\u2019d only just realized a romance was budding between Leila and Calum.</p><p>He suddenly grinned. He stood up, bowed to his laird, and then called out, \u201cWait up, Calum. I\u2019ll walk with you.\u201d</p><p>Johanna could hear the laughter in his voice. Calum wasn\u2019t amused by Keith\u2019s offer. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I want to,\u201d he said. He hurried to catch up with the couple. \u201cIt\u2019s dark outside.\u201d</p><p>Leila kept walking. Calum tried to shove Keith aside. The soldier wouldn\u2019t be shoved, however. They bickered back and forth as they left the hall.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if those two will ever learn to get along,\u201d Johanna remarked.</p><p>Father MacKechnie was feeling lonely. He picked up his goblet and moved to take Keith\u2019s. place at the other table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of good-hearted rivalry between two commanders,\u201d the priest remarked. \u201cLaird, that was a fine speech you gave tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Johanna agreed. \u201cI would like to ask you something, though,\u201d she added. \u201cWhy did you wait so long? Why didn\u2019t you give your speech a month ago or two months ago? You would have saved me quite a lot of aggravation, husband.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leaned back in his chair. \u201cThey weren\u2019t ready then, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they were ready tonight,\u201d the priest interjected with a nod.</p><p>She was still puzzled. \u201cWhat made them ready tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what,\u201d the priest said, \u201cbut who, lass.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. Gabriel nodded. A warm glint had come into his eyes. \u201cYou made them ready to accept the change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I do that?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s begging for compliments,\u201d Gabriel told the priest.</p><p>\u201cIt appears she is,\u201d Father MacKechine bantered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging to understand,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cIt was your quiet defiance,\u201d Gabriel finally explained.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. The priest seemed to understand, however, for he nodded several times.</p><p>\u201cExplain my quiet defiance to me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed. \u201cYou will never make me believe you couldn\u2019t keep track of which plaid to wear on which day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou forgot on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, no one forgets on purpose,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cYou put no importance on keeping track,\u201d the priest said.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThat is true,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI thought it was nonsense, but I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet defiance,\u201d Gabriel repeated. \u201c \u2019Twas the reason you learned to read,\u201d he added. \u201cIsn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that was different,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Johanna let out a sigh. She knew she shouldn\u2019t let her husband believe she\u2019d deliberately worn the wrong plaids just to make the men realize how foolish they were behaving in their determination to maintain their separation from each other. It wouldn\u2019t be honorable to accept praise for something she hadn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so clever,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cAye, you are,\u201d her husband said. \u201cYou convinced Laird MacKay to wait another couple of weeks before taking his daughter home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare isn\u2019t up to a long journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you stopped me from telling MacKay none of my men touched his daughter. I know you were deliberately stalling so that Clare could stay here, and I did keep silent,\u201d he added. \u201cBut when MacKay comes back, I will have to tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so will she,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be strong enough by then.\u201d And hopefully married, Johanna thought to herself, if she could find a suitable possibility.</p><p>Gabriel could prove helpful. \u201cHusband? I find it honorable indeed that you have such faith in your soldiers. To know without a doubt that none of them would ever have touched Clare . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that notion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom you,\u201d she replied, puzzled by his question.</p><p>\u201cNow, Johanna, you can\u2019t believe my men wouldn\u2019t take what was offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you defended them and led me to believe none had touched her,\u201d she argued.</p><p>He looked exasperated. \u201cWe are talking about two different issues,\u201d he explained. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any of my men would refuse the opportunity to bed a willing woman,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I also believe that if he did touch her, he wouldn\u2019t leave her there. He would bring her home with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is also the fact that the soldier would certainly admit he\u2019d bedded the lass. He wouldn\u2019t lie to his laird,\u201d Father MacKechnie added.</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cAnd that, you see, is the real issue.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t see, but she didn\u2019t want to argue with her husband. In her opinion, he was making the issue far more complicated than it needed to be.</p><p>Father MacKechnie stood up to take his leave. He once again praised Gabriel for his cunning and forceful speech, then turned to bow to Johanna.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize, lass, that you saved the Maclaurins from certain exile? You used your wiles to get their cooperation,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou gained their affection, too.\u201d</p><p>Johanna was humbled by the priest\u2019s opinion. She whispered her thank you for his kind words, even as she thought that tomorrow she would have to straighten out his opinion. Gabriel was the reason the Maclaurins were cooperating. Surely the priest would realize that fact soon enough.</p><p>Father MacKechnie left the hall. Johanna and Gabriel continued to sit at the table. They were finally all alone. She was suddenly feeling embarrassed and shy, for the praise she\u2019d received was overwhelming her.</p><p>\u201cI will make Father understand the truth tomorrow,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are the reason the Maclaurins are finally cooperating.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood up and pulled Johanna to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to learn to accept a compliment when it\u2019s given to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the truth . . .\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her finish. He nudged her chin up so she would look at him and then said, \u201cThe truth is simple to understand, lass. You became the Maclaurins\u2019 saving grace.\u201d</p><p>She thought that was the most wonderful thing Gabriel had ever said to her. Tears filled her eyes. She didn\u2019t think she was going to cry, however. She wasn\u2019t so undisciplined.</p><p>Then Gabriel made her forget all about being dignified.</p><p>\u201cAnd mine, Johanna. You\u2019re my saving grace as well.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Gabriel left the holding the following morning. He was evasive about his mission. Johanna immediately became suspicious and demanded to know if her husband planned to do any stealing. He took exception to her question, of course, and an argument resulted.</p><p>\u201cI have given you my word I won\u2019t steal,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019d best learn not to insult me with such accusations, woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is only because I worry about your safety,\u201d she countered. \u201cI would be most unhappy if anything happened to you while you were . . . hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have just given me another insult,\u201d he announced, though his voice had lost its hard edge. \u201cHave you so little faith in me? My men and I are so quiet when we take what we need, no one hears us. We are in and out of their stores before their animals even catch our scent.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all impressed with his boasts. She let out a rather inelegant snort. \u201cI happen to have complete faith in you,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI was merely curious to know where you were going. That was all there was to my question. However, if you don\u2019t want to tell me, then don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. When she found out he was planning to be away for at least two weeks, perhaps as many as three, she became even more curious.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t nag him, though certainly not because she thought she was above such tactics. Gabriel simply didn\u2019t give her time. He told her he was leaving, argued with her for a minute or two, then kissed her soundly and left.</p><p>He didn\u2019t confide in her because he didn\u2019t want her to worry. He and a full contingent of soldiers were joining Laird MacKay in the war against the MacInnes clan, and once they\u2019d finished with those infidels, Gabriel planned to ride to Laird Gillevrey. Yet another request had come from Baron Goode begging an audience with Johanna. The Englishman obviously didn\u2019t understand what the word no meant. Gabriel planned to personally and forcefully insist the baron give up. He wanted to make sure the ignorant baron comprehended what would happen to him if he dared to pester Johanna again. He prayed the baron hadn\u2019t sent a vassal.</p><p>His wife was kept busy with Alex, Clare MacKay, and mundane everyday household affairs. Glynis trimmed Clare\u2019s hair; and after another two weeks resting in her chamber, the MacKay woman was finally strong enough to join Johanna for supper in the great hall.</p><p>Clare was getting prettier with each new day. Once the bruises faded and her facial features were no longer distorted from swelling, she turned into a strikingly beautiful woman. She had a wonderful sense of humor and an appealing brogue that sounded musical to Johanna. She tried to copy it, much to Clare\u2019s amusement.</p><p>Johanna tried to keep her concentration on the preparations for her mother\u2019s visitation. She was anxious to see her but actually hoped she wouldn\u2019t arrive for another month or two. With a bit of prodding, Johanna was certain she could convince her mama to stay until after the baby was born.</p> <p>Johanna was getting thick through her middle, but she wasn\u2019t actually showing yet. She was sleeping quite a lot now. She took an afternoon nap, then still went to bed early each night. She and Alex kept the same hours. It became a ritual for her to take him up to bed. After he\u2019d washed and cleaned his teeth, they would kneel side by side at the foot of the bed and say their nightly prayers together.</p><p>She was usually nodding off by the time they were finished. Alex wanted to delay sleep, and for that reason he liked to include everyone he\u2019d ever met in his prayers. Gabriel was always at the top of their list, of course. They prayed for him first, then for Alex\u2019s relatives and Johanna\u2019s; and after all the acquaintances had been named, Johanna insisted on a prayer for King John\u2019s nephew, Arthur. Alex wanted to know why they were praying for him, and Johanna explained that Arthur should have been king, and since that right had been denied, they would pray he\u2019d made it to heaven.</p><p>Gabriel came home just a few minutes after Johanna had taken Alex upstairs, but by the time he finished listening to Keith\u2019s report and had his supper, his wife and son were sound asleep.</p><p>It was as hot as hell inside the chamber. Fall had come to the Highlands and with it a cooling breeze his wife could barely tolerate. The furs covered the window, and his wife was hidden under a mound of plaids. Since Alex wasn\u2019t sleeping on his mat, Gabriel assumed he was also hidden somewhere under the covers.</p><p>He found his son at the foot of the bed and carried him over to his mat. Alex must have put in an exhausting day, for he didn\u2019t even open his eyes while he was being carried from one bed to another.</p><p>Gabriel barely made a sound as he got ready for bed. He stripped out of his clothes, washed, and then started discarding covers in his attempt to find his wife.</p> <p>Johanna was sleeping in the center of the bed. He stretched out next to her and gently pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He needed her tonight. Hell, he always needed her, he thought to himself. Not an hour had passed during their separation that he hadn\u2019t thought about her. It was a shameful habit he was getting into, for he was behaving like a lovesick husband who only wanted to stay at home with his wife.</p><p>The comforts of family life had actually taken the pleasure out of warring.</p><p>Johanna was wearing a long white nightgown. He hated the thing. He wanted to feel her smooth body pressed up against him. He eased the garment up over her thighs and began to stroke her while he nuzzled the side of her neck.</p><p>She took her time waking up. He wasn\u2019t deterred, however, and when she finally realized where she was and what her husband was doing, she was very enthusiastic in her responses.</p><p>It proved to be a difficult challenge to keep her from making any of those arousing sounds he liked so much, but he didn\u2019t want Alex to wake up, and so he sealed her cries of ecstasy with long hot kisses. When she found fulfillment, she tightened all around him and let out a soft whimper.</p><p>When he found his own pleasure, however, he let out a loud shout.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d</p> <p>Johanna went rigid in her husband\u2019s arms. Her hand moved to her mouth to keep herself from laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Alex. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, son.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s head dropped to the crook of Johanna\u2019s neck. She turned so she could nibble on his earlobe. \u201cWelcome home, husband.\u201d</p><p>His grunt in reply made her smile. She fell asleep hugging him tight. He fell asleep wishing he had enough strength to make love to her again.</p><p>It was a thoroughly satisfying homecoming.</p><p>Nicholas arrived late the following afternoon. Gabriel stood on the steps outside, waiting for his brother-in-law to dismount. Calum stood by his laird\u2019s side. He spotted the look of displeasure on Gabriel\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou going to kill him this time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he replied in a voice that sounded a bit forlorn. \u201cMy wife would be unhappy, but by God, that is the only reason her brother\u2019s still breathing.\u201d</p><p>Calum hid his grin. He knew his laird\u2019s anger was all pretense. He turned to watch their guest.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, MacBain. The baron isn\u2019t wearing his usual daft smile.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s brother was all alone. He was in a hurry to get to MacBain, too, for he swung his leg over his mount and jumped to the ground before the stallion had stopped. The horse\u2019s coat was lathered, indicating he\u2019d been pressed hard.</p><p>Something was wrong, all right. Nicholas wasn\u2019t the sort of man to abuse his mount.</p><p>\u201cTake care of his horse,\u201d Gabriel ordered Calum. He went down the steps and walked forward to meet his brother-in-law.</p><p>Neither warrior was much on proper greetings. Nicholas was the first to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, MacBain.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t question Nicholas. He simply waited for him to explain.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Johanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upstairs, getting Alex ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tried to contain his impatience. He followed Nicholas inside, dismissed Megan from finishing her task of preparing the tables for supper so that he and Nicholas would have privacy, and then waited by the buttery while his brother-in-law poured himself a drink.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better sit down to hear this news,\u201d Nicholas suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a mess, and Johanna\u2019s in the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>Johanna had just come down the stairs when she heard her brother\u2019s voice. She didn\u2019t pick up her skirts and run to Nicholas, but came to an abrupt stop instead, for the anger in his tone, added to his worrisome words, made her wait to hear what mess he was talking about before she intruded.</p><p>She knew it wasn\u2019t polite to eavesdrop, but concern and curiosity overrode manners now, and she knew that if she interrupted, the men would change the topic. Both her husband and her brother were overly protective of her feelings. Aye, they would change the topic all right, and it would take her a good amount of nagging to get any answers out of either one of them. Listening in on the conversation might not be proper, but it was certainly effective. Besides, she\u2019d heard her name and knew the mess somehow involved her. She edged a little closer to the entrance and waited to hear her brother\u2019s next remarks.</p><p>\u201cJust get it said, Nicholas,\u201d Gabriel commanded.</p><p>Johanna nodded. She was in full agreement with her husband\u2019s demand and feeling every bit as impatient as he\u2019d sounded.</p><p>\u201cBaron Raulf has returned from the dead. He wants his wife back.\u201d</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t hear her husband\u2019s reaction to Nicholas\u2019s news. She was too stunned to hear anything more. She felt as though she\u2019d just been struck a powerful blow. A scream gathered in the back of her throat. She backed up until the railing prevented her from going any further. She shook her head in denial. It couldn\u2019t be true. Raulf had fallen from a cliff. There was a witness. He was dead.</p><p>Demons stayed in hell, didn\u2019t they?</p><p>And then she ran. She didn\u2019t have any clear destination in mind. She simply wanted to find a place where she could be all alone until she gained control over her panic and her fear.</p><p>She went down the back corridor, but by the time she reached the door leading outside, she realized what she was doing and why. The fear had been immediate and instinctive. It was a black remnant from her past, she thought to herself, and in the past her fear had always controlled her. She wouldn\u2019t allow it to control her now.</p><p>Johanna sat down on the bench and leaned back against the wall. She took several deep, calming breaths. After a few minutes, the panic began to ease, and with it the fear.</p><p>She was a different woman now, she reminded herself. She\u2019d found courage and strength, and no one, not even a demon, could take those things away from her.</p><p>Her hand moved to her stomach in a protective action. Tears came into her eyes, but they were tears of joy, not apprehension, as she thought about the miracle growing inside her.</p><p>She said a prayer in thanksgiving for all the blessings God had given her. She thanked Him for giving her Gabriel and Alex and the baby sleeping inside her and thanked Him, too, for giving her a safe haven where she could be free of pain and where she could learn how to love, and last of all she thanked Him because He\u2019d made her strong and clever.</p><p>And then she set about using her cleverness to find a way out of the mess.</p><p>Johanna sat on the bench in the dark for almost an hour, but when she finally stood up, she had a clear plan in mind. She was feeling peaceful now, actually serene. Most important in her mind, she was in complete control.</p><p>Yes, she had come a long way. She smiled over the compliment she\u2019d just given herself, then had to shake her head because she was acting daft. She wasn\u2019t crazed. She believed she would be all right. If it came to a battle of wits, Raulf wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against her. In her estimation, men who beat women were ignorant. They were also weak-minded and filled with insecurities. Raulf had all of those sorry traits. Yes, she would be victorious if the battle was waged in London\u2019s court with threats and accusations. She would use her knowledge of his sins to condemn him.</p><p>But if Raulf decided to use his fists and his sword to get his way, Johanna knew she wasn\u2019t physically strong enough to withstand his attack. It didn\u2019t matter though. Raulf could summon an army to aid him, but in the end, she would still be victorious. Because of Gabriel. He was her champion, her protector, her saving grace. She had complete faith in his ability to keep his family safe. Raulf was no match against him.</p><p>A demon, after all, could easily be crushed by an archangel.</p><p>Johanna let out a sigh. She was ready to let her husband comfort her. She picked up her skirts and ran to him.</p><p>Nicholas intercepted her in the center of the hall. He lifted her into his arms and swung her off the floor.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicholas, I\u2019m so happy to see you!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cPut her down, damn it!\u201d Gabriel roared. \u201cAnd get your hands off her. My wife isn\u2019t in any condition to be tossed about like a caber.\u201d</p><p>Both Johanna and Nicholas ignored Gabriel\u2019s commands. She kissed her brother and hugged him tight. He finally put her down and draped his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMy sister may look delicate, MacBain, but surely you\u2019ve noticed by now she\u2019s really as strong as an ox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed you haven\u2019t let go of her yet,\u201d Gabriel snapped. \u201cJohanna, come here. You should stand by your husband.\u201d</p><p>He sounded surly, but the sparkle in his eyes indicated he was pleased to see her happy. She thought he might actually like Nicholas, too, but Gabriel would go to his grave before admitting it. Men, she\u2019d learned, were a complicated lot.</p><p>She pulled away from her brother and went to her husband. He immediately put his arm around her shoulders and hauled her close into his side.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring Mama with you, Nicholas? She would have been happy for your company, and she is planning to come here for a visitation. Isn\u2019t that right, husband?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cYes, Nicholas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t ready to leave England just yet,\u201d Nicholas countered. \u201cBesides, there developed a bit of a problem, Johanna . . .\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wouldn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cYour mother will come next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain, please, the problem you mentioned,\u201d she requested.</p><p>Both men looked wary now. She thought they didn\u2019t know how to give her the bad news. After several minutes of prodding, however, she came to the realization neither one had any intention of telling her about Raulf.</p><p>Gabriel could barely make himself let go of Johanna. When they sat down at the table to share their dinner, he kept reaching over to take hold of her hand.</p><p>Nicholas sat across from his sister and adjacent to Gabriel. Keith sat next to him. Clare joined them a few minutes later and took her seat next to Johanna.</p><p>Both Nicholas and Gabriel stood up when Clare entered the room. Johanna had to motion the other soldiers to also stand.</p><p>Nicholas kept his gaze on the lovely woman walking toward him. Gabriel kept his full attention on his brother-in-law. He waited to see a sign of recognition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you know this woman, Nicholas?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His brother-in-law took exception to Gabriel\u2019s tone of voice. \u201cHow the hell could I know her? I haven\u2019t met her yet. \u201d</p><p>Johanna hurried to make the introductions. Clare made a curtsy; but because Nicholas was scowling, she didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>Gabriel still wasn\u2019t willing to admit defeat. He believed he\u2019d thought the matter through and come up with the only logical conclusion possible. The MacBain plaid had been spotted near MacInnes land. Nicholas had worn the plaid on his last return trip to England. Since none of the other soldiers had been near the holding, Nicholas had to be the man responsible for getting Clare MacKay with child.</p> <p>\u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ve never met Clare MacKay before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you all right,\u201d Nicholas drawled out.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, what is the matter with you?\u201d Johanna asked. \u201cClare, come and sit next to me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your brother was the one responsible for Clare\u2019s condition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow could you think that?\u201d Johanna cried out. \u201cHe would never abandon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a logical conclusion,\u201d Gabriel defended.</p><p>\u201cIt was a sinful conclusion,\u201d Johanna countered.</p><p>Nicholas was trying to follow the budding argument. He understood Gabriel was trying to blame him for something or other and that Johanna was valiantly trying to defend him, but he didn\u2019t have a clue as to the topic.</p><p>\u201cExactly what is it you think I\u2019m responsible for?\u201d he asked Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, this matter needn\u2019t concern you,\u201d Johanna said.</p> <p>\u201cHow can it not concern him?\u201d Gabriel asked. \u201cIf he is the father . . .\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cHe isn\u2019t,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>The frown on Gabriel\u2019s face was chilling. \u201cI see,\u201d he remarked. He sat down, motioned for Nicholas to do the same, and then turned back to his wife.</p><p>\u201cThen you know who the man is, don\u2019t you, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. She fully intended to explain the situation to her husband, but she wanted to wait until they were alone.</p><p>\u201cWe have company,\u201d she whispered, hoping her reminder would make Gabriel realize she didn\u2019t wish to discuss the delicate topic now.</p><p>He refused to take the hint. \u201cYou will give me the man\u2019s name,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She let out a sigh. Clare had been diligently studying the tabletop with her head bowed and her hands fisted in her lap. She looked up when Johanna\u2019s husband demanded an answer, took a deep breath, and then said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any man, Laird MacBain.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t prepared for that answer. He leaned back in his chair and stared at the MacKay woman for a long minute before he turned to his wife.</p><p>Johanna immediately nodded. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d she said, repeating Clare\u2019s statement.</p><p>Johanna kept her gaze on her husband as she reached over and took hold of Clare\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019d best get ready,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cReady for what, m\u2019lady?\u201d Clare whispered back.</p><p>\u201cGrowling.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel ignored the banter. He was still reacting to the news he\u2019d just been given. The ramifications were staggering, and try as he did, he couldn\u2019t understand why the woman would put herself in such jeopardy over a lie.</p><p>He shook his head. Johanna nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s joyful news, Gabriel,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>His face turned red. She guessed he didn\u2019t think it was joyful at all. Clare was squeezing her hand now in obvious fear. Johanna turned to her.</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to be frightened,\u201d she announced. \u201cMy husband would never hurt you. He\u2019s just been given a surprise, that\u2019s all. In a minute of two he\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill someone tell me what in thunder is going on?\u201d Nicholas demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Gabriel, Johanna, and Clare all shouted the denial together.</p><p>Johanna was the first to realize how impolite they were being to her brother.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, this matter can wait until later for discussion,\u201d she announced. \u201cPlease?\u201d she added when he looked like he was going to argue with her.</p><p>Her husband finally nodded. \u201cWe should only have pleasant conversation at the supper table,\u201d she said then. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Clare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Clare replied. She let go of Johanna\u2019s hand and straightened on her stool. \u201cHave you given your brother your good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband has,\u201d Johanna replied.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>He still sounded irritated to her, but she wasn\u2019t upset. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would want to,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She smiled. Nicholas\u2019s curiosity was captured of course. \u201cWhat is this news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell him,\u201d Johanna insisted.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s a very impatient man,\u201d Clare remarked. \u201cBut then, most Englishmen are, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t,\u201d Nicholas snapped. \u201cJohanna, tell me your news.\u201d</p><p>Clare was startled by Nicholas\u2019s hard tone of voice. Her shoulders straightened a bit more, and she frowned at the man she now decided was a rude boor.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t barren.\u201d Gabriel made the announcement and actually smiled. His soldiers all immediately nodded their agreement.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth, she isn\u2019t barren,\u201d Keith remarked.</p><p>The men all nodded again. Calum and Leila came into the hall then. Leila was holding Calum\u2019s hand. She let go of him when they started down the steps. Johanna smiled over the sight of the happy couple before turning her attention back to her brother.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look as though he understood. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a baby, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is such a thing possible?\u201d</p><p>Johanna started blushing. Gabriel laughed, for he found his wife\u2019s embarrassment amusing. He was still determined to give her hell because she hadn\u2019t told him the truth about Clare MacKay, of course, but he wouldn\u2019t raise his voice to her when he was letting her know how displeased he was, given her delicate condition.</p><p>\u201cShe is married to a Highlander,\u201d Gabriel said in answer to Nicholas\u2019s ridiculous question. \u201cAnd that is how it happened.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas laughed. He pounded Gabriel on the shoulder while he congratulated him, then turned his attention to his sister.</p><p>\u201cThis is joyful news,\u201d he said. His voice shook with emotion. \u201cMother will be very happy.\u201d</p><p>Johanna became teary-eyed. She reached for the linen square she kept tucked in the sleeve of her blouse. \u201cYes, Mama will be very happy,\u201d she said while she dabbed at the corner of her eyes with her cloth. \u201cYou must be certain to tell her when you return to England, Nicholas. She\u2019ll want to begin sewing for the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow do you understand why I don\u2019t want my wife upset by any unpleasant news?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Nicholas replied.</p><p>They really weren\u2019t going to tell her about Raulf. She didn\u2019t have a shred of doubt about that truth. Both men were trying to protect her from worry. She would have to be told eventually, of course, and she wondered how long they thought they would be able to keep the secret.</p><p>Their motives were good-hearted, she supposed, but Johanna wasn\u2019t going to let them treat her like a child. Besides, the matter needed to be discussed. She had a sound plan in mind to keep Raulf from making any trouble, and she wanted to talk to Gabriel about it.</p><p>Her husband became preoccupied. Nicholas also seemed to be caught up in his own thoughts. Both men were frowning now, and neither was eating.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t about to bring up the topic until the men had finished their supper. She decided to turn the conversation to everyday matters.</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed our wall is almost completed, Nicholas? The men have done a fair amount of work since your last visit.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded.</p><p>\u201cKeith, have I mentioned how fit you look wearing the MacBain plaid?\u201d she remarked.</p><p>The soldier grinned. \u201cAye, m\u2019lady, you have mentioned it at least ten times today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me my shoulders look wider and stronger with the MacBain plaid,\u201d Michael interjected.</p><p>\u201cShe told me I looked taller,\u201d Lindsay called out.</p><p>\u201cAnd I meant every one of my compliments,\u201d Johanna blurted out. \u201cEvery single one of you does look better in the MacBain plaid.\u201d</p><p>The soldiers laughed. \u201cWe have accepted our laird\u2019s colors, m\u2019lady. You don\u2019t have to fret any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been fretting,\u201d she defended.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you suddenly complimenting us?\u201d Keith asked.</p><p>She shrugged. The men found her reaction vastly amusing. She deliberately changed the subject to a less embarrassing one. The soldiers had all ignored Nicholas; when one mentioned the incident with the wolves, they outshouted each other in their bid to tell the tale of their mistress\u2019s cunning.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t believe her brother needed to hear the story, but her protest was ignored. Gabriel reached over and took hold of her hand. The men were laughing and shouting now, and in the middle of the chaos, Gabriel leaned close to Johanna.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll always protect you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He whispered his question. Johanna leaned to the side of her chair and kissed her husband. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas saw the tender moment between Johanna and Gabriel. He nodded, satisfied. He\u2019d done the right thing by insisting she marry the laird.</p><p>Calum asked Gabriel a question then. Johanna scooted back on her stool and turned to Clare.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019lady,\u201d Clare answered.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t convinced. Clare had barely touched her food and had stayed remarkably silent for most of the meal.</p><p>She thought Nicholas might be the reason for Clare\u2019s timid behavior. For some reason the two of them had taken an immediate dislike to each other. If Clare wasn\u2019t sick, then Nicholas was the only other reason for her odd conduct. They both kept staring at each other; and when one caught the other looking, a quick frown resulted.</p><p>Their behavior was bizarre as well as distressing, for Johanna had grown quite fond of Clare and she wanted the young woman to like her family.</p><p>She put the matter aside when the men requested permission to leave. \u201cWhere is Father MacKechnie this evening?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Keith stood up before answering. \u201cAuggie wanted him to sample a drink of his new batch of brew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you run into him, will you please tell him I would like to speak to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to speak to him about?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cAn important issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will discuss your important issue with me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I will,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I would also like to hear Father MacKechnie\u2019s opinion, too.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to Clare before her husband could question her further. \u201cWhat do you think of my brother? He\u2019s handsome, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome? M\u2019lady, he\u2019s English,\u201d Clare whispered.</p><p>Johanna laughed. She turned to her brother. \u201cClare doesn\u2019t appear to like Englishmen, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to dislike an entire country of men,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an unreasonable woman,\u201d Clare defended. \u201cIf I were English, I might think your brother was handsome.\u201d</p><p>It was all she was willing to concede. Nicholas didn\u2019t appear to care what her opinion was. Yet Johanna wasn\u2019t fooled by her brother\u2019s indifferent behavior. He was interested in Clare MacKay all right and trying not to let anyone know.</p><p>Clare was acting a little too defensive. Johanna suddenly straightened on her stool. Gabriel noticed the look of surprise on her face. He demanded to know what the hell was the matter with her.</p><p>She patted his hand and gently told him she didn\u2019t care for his gruff tone of voice. She deliberately didn\u2019t answer his question.</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to get married?\u201d</p><p>Her brother hadn\u2019t been prepared for her blunt question. He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m putting it off for as long as possible,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have other more important matters to think about,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut do you have anyone in mind when you do decide to marry?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. \u201cI really haven\u2019t thought about it. When I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll marry. Now, enough of this talk.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t finished discussing the topic just yet. \u201cWould a large dowry be important when making your choice?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI don\u2019t need a large dowry.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Then she turned to Clare. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want a large dowry,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Clare frowned in puzzlement but only for a second or two. Then she realized what Johanna\u2019s plan was.</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she vehemently shook her head. \u201cYou cannot think I would ever consider an Englishman,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Johanna tried to soothe her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you to consider anything,\u201d she said. It was a blatant lie, of course, but her motives were sincere and she didn\u2019t believe she was committing a sin. She\u2019d achieved her goal, too, for all she wanted was to plant the idea in Clare\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cMy father would die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does one recover from death?\u201d Gabriel wanted to know.</p><p>Johanna ignored his question. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to force you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d she told Clare.</p><p>She turned to her husband. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t what right? Johanna, I don\u2019t have any idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t bothered by her husband\u2019s irritation. \u201cWhen is Clare\u2019s father coming back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow or the day after.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was staring at Clare now. The look on her face bothered the hell out of him. When she heard her father was coming, her eyes clouded up with tears, and damned if she didn\u2019t look frightened. Nicholas didn\u2019t understand his own reaction. He barely knew the woman and had already decided he didn\u2019t like her much, yet now he felt the urge to try to straighten out her problem for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do not wish to see your father?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to see him,\u201d Clare replied.</p><p>\u201cClare won\u2019t be ready to go home tomorrow or the day after,\u201d Johanna told her husband. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t completely recovered yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna,\u201d Gabriel began in a warning tone of voice.</p> <p>\u201cShe looks fit enough to me,\u201d Nicholas remarked, wondering what the hell they were talking about. \u201cHave you been ill?\u201d he asked Clare.</p><p>She shook her head. Johanna nodded. Nicholas was thoroughly exasperated.</p><p>\u201cClare\u2019s been very ill,\u201d Johanna said then. \u201cShe needs time to regain her strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that is why her hair is cut like a boy\u2019s,\u201d Nicholas remarked. \u201cShe had fever, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have fever,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cGabriel, I must insist you tell Laird MacKay his daughter isn\u2019t up to a journey just yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can put him off,\u201d Gabriel replied. He turned to glare at Nicholas. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity you didn\u2019t father her child,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt would solve all our problems.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas opened his mouth to say something but was too stunned to think of anything appropriate.</p><p>\u201cI still cannot believe you thought my brother would be so dishonorable,\u201d Johanna said.</p><p>\u201cIt was logical, damn it,\u201d her husband countered.</p><p>\u201cAnd just how would it have solved our problem?\u201d Johanna demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Gabriel countered. \u201cThe priest would marry them. You did hear me promise MacKay there would be a marriage, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly marry him.\u201d</p><p>Since Clare was pointing to Nicholas when she made the emphatic statement, he had to assume she was talking about marrying him.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI might also mention I haven\u2019t asked you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Clare bounded to her feet. \u201cPlease excuse me,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI suddenly feel the need for some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. Clare immediately left the hall. Nicholas watched her leave, then turned back to his sister. She was frowning at him.</p><p>\u201cWill one of you tell me what in thunder is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve upset Clare, Nicholas. You\u2019d better go after her and make your apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I upset her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou refused to marry her,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cDidn\u2019t he, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>Her husband was thoroughly enjoying Nicholas\u2019s confusion. \u201cAye, he did refuse,\u201d he agreed, just to goad his brother-in-law\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cStart explaining,\u201d Nicholas demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt would be wrong of us to talk about Clare\u2019s problem,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cShe\u2019ll tell you when she\u2019s ready. Nicholas, why did you come here?\u201d</p><p>The switch in topics took him by surprise. He couldn\u2019t come up with a quick excuse. He turned to Gabriel for assistance.</p><p>Father MacKechnie inadvertently came to Gabriel\u2019s and Nicholas\u2019s rescue. He came rushing into the hall.</p><p>\u201cKeith told me you wished to speak to me, m\u2019lady.\u201d he called out. \u201cIs it convenient now, or would you like me to come back later?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel and Nicholas literally jumped at the opportunity to turn Johanna\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cCome and join us, Father!\u201d Gabriel shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again,\u201d Nicholas called out at the same time.</p><p>If the priest was surprised by the warriors\u2019 enthusiastic greetings, he didn\u2019t let it show.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were back, Nicholas,\u201d Father MacKechnie said. \u201cWere you checking up on your sister? You can see she\u2019s happy,\u201d he added with a nod.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you came all this way?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>It was sinful to admit, but she was really enjoying her brother\u2019s discomfort. Lying to her was difficult for him. she decided, if the look on his face was any indication. His frown was quite telling, considering the innocence behind the question.</p><p>Gabriel rescued him. \u201cHave you had your dinner. Father? Johanna, where are your manners? You should ask the servants to feed the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already eaten,\u201d the priest announced. He sat down next to Johanna, declined the offer of a drink. and then went into detail about Auggie\u2019s latest batch of brew.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a kick to it all right,\u201d he announced. \u201cOne drink and a body could fly across the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>Johanna laughed over the priest\u2019s exaggeration. \u201cIt will warm us come the long . . .\u201d The priest was about to say the brew would warm their stomachs on the cold winter nights ahead but hastily changed his remark. \u201cIf there\u2019s any left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong what?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cLong warm winter nights,\u201d the priest mumbled with a glare in Nicholas\u2019s direction. He obviously still blamed Johanna\u2019s brother because of the lie he\u2019d told about the warm climate in the Highlands.</p><p>Nicholas was surprised everyone was still keeping the truth from his sister. He almost laughed but caught himself in time.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, do you know that since I came here, the weather has turned most unpredictable. Why some nights it\u2019s actually cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, lass, it\u2019s never cold,\u201d Gabriel argued.</p><p>\u201cNow Johanna . . .\u201d Nicholas began.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why you came here? There is obviously a problem of some sort, or you would have waited to accompany Mother, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, son?\u201d the priest also wanted to know.</p><p>Nicholas was hard-pressed to come up with an answer. \u201cThe weather,\u201d he announced after a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live with the lie any longer, Johanna. I came here to tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s burst of laughter told him she didn\u2019t believe him. Yet once he\u2019d started the fabrication, he was damned if he was going to stop.</p><p>\u201cI lied to you. There, I\u2019ve said what I came here to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean you lied to me about the weather?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas grinned. Her laughter was contagious and so was her cunning. It suddenly dawned on him that she\u2019d always known he was lying.</p><p>He leaned forward and pointed his finger at her. \u201cYou knew . . . all the while, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a woolen plaid, Nicholas. Of course I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen each time one of us lied and told you the weather was unusually cold, you knew the truth, lass?\u201d</p><p>The priest sounded appalled. Johanna nodded. \u201cIt was kind of you to hold my brother\u2019s lie, for you only had my happiness in mind, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bent sense of humor, wife,\u201d Gabriel announced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as warped as a shield left out in the rain too long,\u201d Nicholas agreed.</p><p>She laughed. The men assumed she wasn\u2019t bothered by their insults.</p><p>Johanna yawned and immediately apologized. Gabriel demanded she go upstairs to bed.</p><p>\u201cFirst I would like to discuss something with all of you,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want to talk about?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help if I can,\u201d the priest promised.</p><p>\u201cI have a problem,\u201d Johanna began.</p><p>\u201cTell us what it is, lass,\u201d Father MacKechnie insisted.</p><p>Johanna stared at Gabriel when she gave her answer. \u201cIt seems I have two husbands.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>You have only one husband, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s tone of voice didn\u2019t suggest she argue with him. She took hold of his hand and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou listened while I was telling your husband about Raulf, didn\u2019t you, Johanna?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t proper conduct, lass,\u201d her husband decreed.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t proper conduct for you to think you could keep this important news from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get this straight in my head,\u201d the priest interjected. \u201cAre you telling me Baron Raulf\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Nicholas answered.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord above,\u201d the priest muttered. \u201cWhere\u2019s he been all this while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocked away in a dungeon an ocean away,\u201d Nicholas answered. \u201cHe was sent halfway across the world to act as King John\u2019s representative to negotiate a trade agreement. Raulf left England before John started feuding with the Church. The king doesn\u2019t give a damn about placating the pope now.\u201d</p><p>After finishing his explanation, he turned to his sister. \u201cHow much did you overhear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the blasphemy. \u201cPlease explain the mess I\u2019m in the middle of to Father.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas picked up his goblet and drained the contents in one long swallow. Johanna suddenly felt the need to get closer to Gabriel. She stood up and moved to stand next to him. He put his arm around her waist and pulled her close to his side. She put her arm around his neck and leaned against him.</p><p>\u201cBaron Raulf fell from a cliff and everyone believed he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in England when word came,\u201d the priest reminded Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, he didn\u2019t die,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s back in England and mad as a hornet because his wife and his lands have all been given away. The king wants to appease the bastard, though only God knows why. John has ordered Johanna to return to Raulf, and in an attempt to pacify MacBain and avert war, he has agreed to let him keep this holding.\u201d</p><p>Father MacKechnie muttered something under his breath. \u201cIt makes no difference what your king wants, son. Johanna\u2019s marriage was annulled and that\u2019s a fact. The pope himself signed the decree. Isn\u2019t that what you told me, lass?\u201d</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cIt is so,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I would really need an annulment. I requested it only to stall the king from making me marry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn has decided to make himself pope. Since he started fighting with the Church, practically all ties with the Holy Father have been severed. Priests have already fled to the Lowlands in anticipation of the interdict. John\u2019s sure to be excommunicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your king believes he can switch husbands as easily as snapping his fingers?\u201d Gabriel asked his brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Nicholas replied. \u201cHe won\u2019t listen to reason. I tried to talk to him, but he remains stubbornly determined to keep Raulf happy. I wish to God I knew why.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when our laird refuses to give up Johanna?\u201d the priest asked.</p><p>\u201cJohn will assign troops to Raulf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d the priest asked.</p><p>\u201cWar.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas and Gabriel said the word together.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Johanna whispered. \u201cWe have only just rebuilt, Gabriel. I will not have it all destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything you can do about it, Johanna,\u201d her brother said.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Raulf?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I had seen him, I would have killed him because of what he did to you. No, I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d</p><p>Johanna shook her head. \u201cYou cannot kill him. The king would turn his anger on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to her, son,\u201d the priest advised. He let out a weary sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a problem on our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does Gabriel have before he must give his decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohanna, you cannot believe I would consider giving you up,\u201d her husband muttered.</p><p>\u201cTwo messengers and four soldiers riding escort will be here tomorrow or the day after to give your husband King John\u2019s demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is Raulf?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cI gained my king\u2019s promise Raulf would be kept in court with him until this is settled.\u201d</p><p>Johanna sagged against her husband. Gabriel immediately moved his chair back so he could lift her onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t give us much time to form a plan of action,\u201d the priest said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d Gabriel argued. \u201cThe messengers will have to return to England with the report we\u2019ve denied the demand. That will give us enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to do what?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cPrepare,\u201d Nicholas answered.</p><p>Johanna changed the subject then. \u201cWhat have you heard about Arthur? We were told the king\u2019s nephew was murdered. Have you heard anything more?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas frowned over the switch in subjects. Johanna looked exhausted, however, and he decided she was trying to turn the conversation to a less distressing one.</p><p>\u201cThere have been several conflicting reports,\u201d Nicholas replied. \u201cBaron Goode has vowed to find out what happened to Arthur. He\u2019s turning over every rock in his search. More and more believe Arthur was murdered. He was a contender for the throne,\u201d he explained for Father MacKechnie\u2019s benefit, \u201cand a true threat to John\u2019s position. Goode wasn\u2019t the only one backing the nephew. Arthur had quite an army supporting his bid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your king say about this mystery?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cHe vows he has no knowledge of how his nephew died,\u201d Nicholas answered. \u201cThe most common belief is that overzealous supporters of King John captured Arthur and threatened to castrate him, and he died of fright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would do it,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p><p>\u201cSpeculation is still running high,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this. If any of the barons had proof John was involved in his nephew\u2019s death, England would be thrown into rebellion. The barons would hang John by his . . .\u201d Nicholas caught himself before he said something Johanna was certain to take offense to and quickly substituted another more appropriate word, \u201c... feet.\u201d</p><p>Johanna let out another loud yawn. She begged the men\u2019s pardon and then said, \u201cAnd that, you see, is why King John wants to keep Raulf happy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel guessed what Johanna was about to say before she spoke another word. It all snapped into place now. Johanna not only knew Arthur had been murdered; she also knew who had killed him.</p><p>\u201cJohanna, explain what you just meant,\u201d Nicholas asked. \u201cDo you know why John wants to appease Raulf?\u201d</p><p>She was about to answer her brother\u2019s question when Gabriel gave her a gentle squeeze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of his most favored barons,\u201d she said.</p><p>Gabriel loosened his hold. She guessed her answer pleased him. She would wait until they were alone to ask him why he didn\u2019t want her to tell Nicholas anything more.</p><p>\u201cJohn doesn\u2019t want to keep Raulf happy,\u201d Gabriel said then. \u201cHe wants to get him killed. And that, you see, is why he\u2019ll eventually send him to me.\u201d</p><p>The discussion heated up, but Johanna was too exhausted to stay downstairs and listen to her husband and her brother argue about what was to be done.</p> <p>Father MacKechnie requested the honor of accompanying his mistress up to her chamber. His real goal was to get her alone, and as soon as they had left the hall, he clasped her hand in his and asked her if she was going to fret about this nasty bit of news or if she was going to place the matter in God\u2019s hands and get a good night\u2019s rest like any intelligent lass would.</p><p>Gabriel was also concerned his wife would worry until she made herself ill. He was fully prepared to try to soothe her fears but found it wasn\u2019t necessary. He couldn\u2019t even get her to wake up long enough to kiss her good night. She was dead to the world and sleeping like an innocent without a care to concern her.</p><p>Johanna awakened in the middle of the night. A weight rolled onto her feet, startling her. As soon as she moved, Gabriel sat up. He spotted his son at the foot of the bed and immediately ordered him to go back to his own bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wake him,\u201d Johanna whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s been in our bed for over an hour. Just scoot him off my leg, please.\u201d</p><p>Her husband let out a sigh loud enough to wake the dead. Alex didn\u2019t stir, though. He slept through the transfer from one bed to the other.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he have enough covers?\u201d Johanna whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s cold in here,\u201d she added with a nod.</p><p>Gabriel got back into bed and hauled his wife into his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s my son,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cold doesn\u2019t affect him.\u201d</p><p>She thought her husband\u2019s remark was most illogical. She was going to tell him so, but he turned her attention with his gruff command to kiss him.</p><p>He thought only to give her a quick kiss, but she tasted so good to him and she was so wonderfully responsive, he decided he wanted a little more. He kissed her again, long and hard. And then he decided he wanted it all.</p><p>It was agony making love without making any noise, and Gabriel\u2019s last coherent thought before his wife drove him beyond the limits of his control was that he was going to be damned happy when his son moved into the other chamber.</p><p>He liked the way his wife snuggled up against him afterward. Hell, he liked everything about her, he thought with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to tell you something,\u201d she whispered in the darkness. \u201cI know why King John wants to be rid of Raulf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest now, Johanna. We\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about it now.\u201d</p><p>He gave in. \u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut if you begin to get upset, you will put the worry aside until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his qualification. \u201cI wanted to tell you earlier,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to tell Nicholas, too, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Nicholas isn\u2019t just your brother, he\u2019s also an English baron. If he were to hear unsettling news regarding his overlord\u2019s behavior, he might be forced to act upon it. No one\u2019s going to unseat John now; and if Nicholas tries, he\u2019ll get himself killed.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t considered the possibility that Nicholas might feel compelled to challenge the king. She was thankful now Gabriel had stopped her from telling what she knew.</p><p>\u201cHow did you come to guess\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cI have but one question to ask you, Johanna. Your answer won\u2019t leave this chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the king kill Arthur or did Raulf?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate in giving him her answer. \u201cI believe Raulf killed him, but the order came from King John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>She was so relieved to finally share the burden she\u2019d been carrying around, tears came into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did you come by this knowledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the king\u2019s messenger reading the order,\u201d she explained. \u201cRaulf didn\u2019t know I was listening, but the messenger spotted me in the doorway. I don\u2019t know if he told my husband or not. I\u2019m certain he told the king. Raulf left shortly before Easter. He didn\u2019t come home until the middle of the summer. A scant month later I heard the rumor that Arthur had disappeared. Years later, after I\u2019d been told of Raulf\u2019s death, I was ordered to London and kept under lock and key. The king came to see me several times, and during each audience, he would deliberately bring up Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was fishing to find out what you knew,\u201d Gabriel speculated.</p><p>Johanna nodded. \u201cI pretended ignorance, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was this messenger the king sent to Raulf with the order to kill Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron Williams,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cJohn certainly wouldn\u2019t have trusted a court messenger. Williams and Raulf were the king\u2019s closest confidants. Yet the two barons didn\u2019t trust each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were damned fortunate the king didn\u2019t kill you. He took a chance letting you live with the knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t certain I knew anything,\u201d she argued. \u201cBesides, he knew I couldn\u2019t give testimony against him. Women aren\u2019t allowed to make any accusations in court against anyone but their own husbands and then for only a very few offenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron Goode believes you know something, doesn\u2019t he? That is why he tried to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cAll the barons were aware of the relationship between John and his two favorites, Raulf and Williams. As we now know, Raulf left England just before Arthur disappeared. Goode is guessing there might be a tie between the two. He probably wants to question me about the dates involved. He couldn\u2019t know I overheard anything\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to listen carefully,\u201d Gabriel commanded. \u201cYou will not tell anyone what you overheard, not even your brother. Give me your promise, Johanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there is one person I really must speak to,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing John.\u201d</p><p>He caught himself before he shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I can make him listen to reason. It\u2019s the only way, husband. I don\u2019t want a war.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel decided to use logic to make her understand her jeopardy. \u201cYou\u2019ve just told me you can\u2019t testify against the king. If you think you can threaten him with the promise you\u2019ll tell the barons what you know and ignite a rebellion against the crown, John will simply silence you before you can carry through your plan.\u201d</p><p>A long minute passed in silence. Gabriel believed Johanna was finally realizing the foolishness in her wish to speak to the king.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t considered that plan of action,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen what in God\u2019s name was your plan? Did you think you could gain John\u2019s sympathy?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI just thought I would mention the message he sent Raulf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would your reminder help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sent a written message, Gabriel, in his own hand. Raulf believes he burned it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel went tense in anticipation. \u201cDidn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Williams read the order to Raulf, he placed it on the table and took his leave. That is when he spotted me. I nodded to him and continued on across the entrance and then went down the back corridor. I wanted Williams to believe I had only just gotten there, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Gabriel prodded, impatient to hear the rest of the tale.</p><p>\u201cRaulf accompanied Williams outside. When he returned to the hall, he picked up the scroll and tossed it into the fire. He stood there and watched until it had been completely destroyed.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile changed Gabriel\u2019s expression. God, he was married to a clever woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he burn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Bishop Hallwick\u2019s important sermons on the inferiority of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaulf didn\u2019t know you could read, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, he didn\u2019t,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cHe would have beaten me if he\u2019d known I\u2019d deliberately proven him wrong, for he told me again and again I was too ignorant to learn how. Of course, he beat me because I was ignorant, too, so I don\u2019t suppose . . .\u201d</p><p>It was the very first time she\u2019d spoken so openly about the beatings, and although he\u2019d known the truth for a long time now, it still shook him to hear her say the words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose what?\u201d he asked, his voice gruff with emotion.</p><p>She squeezed herself closer to him before she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he ever needed a reason to beat me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never touch you again,\u201d Gabriel promised.</p><p>The fury in his voice was chilling. \u201cI know you will keep me safe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDamned right I will,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t upset by his harsh reaction but comforted. He was outraged on her behalf.</p><p>\u201cYou took a terrible risk when you switched the scrolls,\u201d he said then. \u201cWhat if Raulf had decided to reread his king\u2019s command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believed the risk was worth it,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt was an important paper to save. John\u2019s signature appears at the bottom, and his seal is affixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a fool to put his name . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe believes he\u2019s invincible,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think he knew Raulf wouldn\u2019t believe Williams without a written order. Time was important, though I\u2019m not certain why, and surely that was the reason King John didn\u2019t summon Raulf to London and tell him what he wanted done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the scroll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrapped it in soft cotton cloths and hid it inside the altar of the chapel Raulf had just had built for the bishop. It\u2019s wedged between two marble squares.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel felt her shiver and tightened his hold on her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know I almost destroyed it just before I was told Raulf was dead. Then I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted someone in future to find it and know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in keeping you safe, Johanna. I will not allow you to talk to King John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want war,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She sounded close to tears. He kissed her forehead and demanded she quit worrying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll convince England\u2019s king to leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>She tried to argue with him. \u201cYou can\u2019t think to go to England?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. \u201cIt\u2019s late, Johanna, and time you went to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Exhaustion won. She decided she would have to wait until tomorrow to talk some sense into her husband. Of only one thing was she certain. She wasn\u2019t about to let him confront King John or Raulf without a foolproof plan in mind. She would demand he take at least a league of Highlanders with him.</p><p>Morning proved to be too late to demand her husband be reasonable. When Johanna dressed and went downstairs to find Gabriel, Nicholas gave her the news that he\u2019d already left the holding.</p><p>She didn\u2019t become hysterical, but it took every bit of strength she possessed to control herself. She spent the day pacing and worrying. By dinnertime, her nerves were flayed.</p><p>Father MacKechnie sat at the head of the table at Johanna\u2019s insistence. She sat on the priest\u2019s right, next to Clare, and Nicholas took his seat across from her.</p><p>The thought of food turned Johanna\u2019s stomach. She could barely stand to watch anyone else eat. She didn\u2019t say a word until the trenchers had been cleared from the table.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, why did you let him go?\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cLet him? Johanna, I made a sound argument, but your stubborn husband wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>She tried to calm down. \u201cThen you, too, realize the jeopardy . . .\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t argue against his going. I tried to talk him into letting me go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t take enough soldiers with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Nicholas defended.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t had enough time to think of a plan. He can\u2019t go barging into John\u2019s court and demand a hearing.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas grinned. \u201cAye, he can,\u201d he replied. \u201cYour husband can be very persuasive when he wants to. He\u2019ll get his audience all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have gone, Nicholas,\u201d Clare blurted out. \u201cYou\u2019re a baron. Your king would have listened to you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas turned his attention to the beautiful woman frowning at him with such obvious indignation.</p><p>\u201cThat was my argument,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Johanna shook her head. \u201cOnly Gabriel can make the king listen to reason,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nicholas leaned back on his stool. \u201cWhy is that, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>She was immediately sorry she\u2019d made the remark. \u201cBecause he\u2019s my husband,\u201d she replied. \u201cBesides, last night you said you had already tried to talk to John and he wouldn\u2019t listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still should have gone with him,\u201d her brother said.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d Clare asked.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to stay here,\u201d he answered. \u201cGabriel made me responsible for you, Johanna, and he\u2019s going to be damned unhappy when he comes back and finds you\u2019ve made yourself ill with your worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he comes back,\u201d Johanna whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou shame Gabriel by making such comments,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cYou should have confidence in his ability.\u201d</p><p>Johanna burst into tears. Father MacKechnie dropped the piece of bread he\u2019d been nibbling on and reached over to pat Johanna\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, lass. It\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>While the priest tried to comfort his mistress, Clare attacked Nicholas with a defense of Johanna\u2019s conduct.</p><p>\u201cShe loves her husband,\u201d she cried out. \u201cHow dare you criticize her? She\u2019s worried about his safety, and she certainly doesn\u2019t need you to make her feel guilty or ashamed!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clare was shouting by the time she finished her speech. She\u2019d bounded to her feet and folded her arms across her chest while she glared at Nicholas.</p><p>He showed no reaction to her behavior or her words. In truth, he wasn\u2019t offended. Nay, he found Clare\u2019s defense of Johanna admirable.</p><p>\u201cHow did you become so loyal to my sister in such a short time?\u201d His voice was kind and soothing. The bluster seemed to leave her all at once. She collapsed back onto her stool, straightened her plaid across her shoulder, brushed a strand of hair out of her eyes, and then looked at Nicholas again.</p><p>He was smiling at her. He was a handsome man, she thought to herself, and the look of tenderness in his eyes made her feel warm inside. She shook her head against such thoughts and tried to remember his question.</p> <p>\u201cYour sister saved my life.\u201d</p><p>Johanna mopped at her eyes, thanked the priest for his concern, and then turned to Clare.</p><p>\u201cYou saved yourself, Clare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a hand in it,\u201d Father MacKechnie announced.</p><p>Alex appeared at the entrance. He was hopping from one foot to the other while he waited to get some attention.</p> <p>Johanna spotted her son and immediately excused herself from the table. \u201cI must tuck him in,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cWill you come back down?\u201d Clare asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very weary tonight,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up with you,\u201d Clare announced. She stood up, bowed to the priest, and then turned to Nicholas. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to shout at you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas had stood up when his sister did. Clare walked around the end of the table to leave the hall but stopped when she reached his side.</p><p>He towered over her. She tilted her head back so she could look into his eyes. They were beautiful, she thought to herself . . . for an Englishman.</p> <p>\u201cI have apologized, Baron. Have you nothing to say in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd catch hell again? You seem to take exception to everything I say, Clare MacKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d she defended.</p><p>He grinned. Father MacKechnie snorted with his laughter. \u201cHe\u2019s got you now, lass. You just proved him right.\u201d</p><p>Clare didn\u2019t know if Nicholas was jesting with her or not. She could feel herself blushing and didn\u2019t understand why. She certainly hadn\u2019t done anything to feel embarrassed about.</p><p>She decided she\u2019d wasted enough time trying to understand the strange Englishman. She turned to the priest, bid him good night, and then muttered the same to Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cSleep well, Clare.\u201d</p><p>The caress in his voice shook her. She glanced up to look at him.</p> <p>He winked at her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t run out of the hall. She walked at a ladylike pace. She didn\u2019t smile until she reached the entrance. Then she smiled all the way up the stairs. She did a lot of sighing, too. Baron Nicholas was a thoroughly unacceptable man, and heaven help her, she was beginning to like him.</p><p>Nicholas watched her leave the hall. Father MacKechnie asked him to sit back down. \u201cDon\u2019t leave just yet. Share some brew with me. None of us is going to get much sleep tonight, worrying as we are.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas reached for the jug and poured a drink into the priest\u2019s goblet.</p><p>\u201cClare intrigues me,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cOf course she does,\u201d Father MacKechnie agreed. \u201cShe\u2019s a bonny lass, isn\u2019t she now?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. \u201cWere you here when she arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Father MacKechnie said.</p><p>Nicholas waited for the priest to tell him more. Father MacKechnie didn\u2019t seem inclined.</p><p>\u201cAs long as Clare is here, I\u2019m responsible for her safety, too, Father,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAye, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacBain told me her father will be coming to collect her tomorrow or the day after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that,\u201d the priest replied. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Will you let her leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell me what happened to the woman. I can\u2019t make any kind of decision until I know her history. Clare seemed upset over the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean upset because her father\u2019s coming to get her?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. The priest let out a loud sigh. \u201cYou\u2019d best hear what happened to the poor lass. Clare MacKay arrived here so bloody and torn apart it looked as though the wolves had gotten to her. It\u2019s a miracle her face wasn\u2019t scarred. It\u2019s a miracle she even lived. I gave her the last rites,\u201d he added so Nicholas would understand he wasn\u2019t exaggerating.</p><p>He took a long swallow of his drink and then told Nicholas the full story. He was pleased with the baron\u2019s reaction. Nicholas was properly outraged.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s carrying a MacBain?\u201d Nicholas asked when the priest finished his explanation.</p><p>\u201cNay, son, she isn\u2019t carrying. She made it up, you see, and confessed the full truth to our laird only last night. Clare told me this morning, though not in confidence or in confession, so I am at liberty to talk about it,\u201d he hastily explained. \u201cShe said she was feeling relieved. She\u2019s a proud woman. She doesn\u2019t like to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way she could think of to get away from the MacInnes men. She went to an extreme. She could have gotten herself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me about her injuries, she damned near did get herself killed,\u201d Nicholas remarked.</p><p>The priest agreed with a nod. \u201cClare\u2019s father is the only one who doesn\u2019t know the truth yet. He\u2019s expecting to meet the father of Clare\u2019s babe and set a marriage date.\u201d</p><p>The bizarre conversation of the night before was suddenly making sense to Nicholas. \u201cThe MacBain kept asking me if I recognized Clare. He thought I was the man responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s accusing you now, son. It would have been convenient if you had been the one, at least I imagine our laird thought it would have been convenient.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. \u201cSon of a . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped himself from saying the blasphemy just in time. \u201cWhat will Clare\u2019s father do when he finds out she lied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo telling,\u201d the priest replied. \u201cI will of course try to intercede if he loses his temper. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019m afraid for her. Laird MacKay\u2019s a hard man. He loves his daughter, but when he finds out she lied, he might marry her off to the first unattached clansman he spots. She\u2019s got a hard future in front of her.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas thought about what the priest had told him for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to save Johanna.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s voice was whisper soft, as though he was in confession. The priest put his goblet down and turned to the baron. \u201cYou cannot blame yourself for what happened to Johanna. She told me she kept the truth from you because she was ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known what was happening,\u201d Nicholas muttered. \u201cRaulf kept her hidden away, and I should have been clever enough to realize his reasons. He didn\u2019t want me to see her bruises, of course. Dear God, how I want to be the one who kills him.\u201d</p><p>The priest decided to turn the baron\u2019s thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019d best be deciding what to do when Laird MacKay gets here. Johanna doesn\u2019t want Clare to leave. I\u2019m warning you now, son. You\u2019re going to have to contend with your sister as well as Clare\u2019s father. You\u2019ve also got the king\u2019s messengers coming here with their demand to take Johanna back to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn assured me he would send only the messengers and four escorts,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cIt will only take a few minutes to give them Gabriel\u2019s answer and send them home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy laird believes he\u2019s going to be able to change your king\u2019s mind, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder how he thinks to accomplish his goal,\u201d Father MacKechnie said.</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. \u201cHe was damned confident he would get the king to withdraw his support from Baron Raulf, but Gabriel wouldn\u2019t tell me what he planned to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re caught in the middle, aren\u2019t you? You can\u2019t call up your own vassals to fight by your side, for you\u2019re in the Highlands now and the battle might very well be waged against your own king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re living in difficult times,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cIt is unthinkable for a vassal to lose his faith and trust in his overlord. Most of the barons in England have had their fill of John\u2019s antics. There\u2019s constant talk of rebellion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand why,\u201d the priest remarked. \u201cYour king\u2019s made more enemies than allies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d Nicholas agreed. \u201cHe has even turned the holy pope against him. Change is in the air, Father, and if John doesn\u2019t mend his ways, he\u2019ll eventually be forced to hand over his power just to remain king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA king without power? How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn will be forced to give over specific rights to the barons,\u201d Nicholas explained.</p><p>The priest had never heard of such a thing. Yet in all of his considerable years he\u2019d never seen such an inept leader as John. The stories he\u2019d heard over time regarding King John\u2019s behavior couldn\u2019t all be exaggerations; and if only a few of them were true, then England\u2019s leader would certainly have quite a bit of explaining to do when he stood before his Maker.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust your king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will continue to serve my overlord until he breaks the bond. I am his vassal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you trust him?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t say another word. He pushed his chair back, bid Father MacKechnie good night, and then left the hall.</p><p>His silence was his answer.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>All hell broke loose the following day.</p><p>The weather was a prelude to disaster. A violent thunderstorm erupted shortly before dawn. Lightning felled two giant pines. One crashed down on top of the tanner\u2019s cottage, and the other fairly destroyed the kitchen\u2019s roof. Thunder shook the castle walls. The storm seemed relentless.</p><p>Alex attached himself to Johanna. The noise frightened the child; and every time another clap of thunder sounded, he tried to bury himself underneath her.</p><p>By the time the storm had worn itself out, Johanna and Alex were exhausted. They slept until late in the morning.</p><p>Clare shook Johanna awake.</p><p>\u201cPlease wake up, Johanna. I must talk to you. Father\u2019s riding up the last hill. What am I going to tell him? He\u2019s going to be furious. I can\u2019t think what to do. Oh, Alex, please don\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>Johanna sat up in bed just in time to catch her son as he hurled himself into her arms.</p><p>She soothed the little boy first; and when she finally made him realize neither he nor his mother was in any danger, he quit crying. Alex had been fretful since his father\u2019s departure, and Johanna thought she might very well be responsible. The little one had latched onto her fear. She decided she was going to have to be more vigilant in hiding her worries.</p><p>\u201cClare, help Alex get dressed please. I must hurry if I\u2019m going to talk to Nicholas before your father gets here. What did I do with my plaid?\u201d</p><p>Johanna raced to get dressed. She was thankful the morning sickness had passed. She didn\u2019t have time to deal with a bout of nausea now. She washed her face with cold water, cleaned her teeth, but didn\u2019t take the time to brush her hair. On her way down the hallway she threaded her fingers through the mess to try to get the tangles out.</p><p>\u201cMama, wait for me,\u201d Alex shouted.</p><p>Johanna stopped at the top of the steps. Alex ran down the hallway and took hold of her hand.</p><p>\u201cHow would you like to visit Auggie this morning? Lindsay will take you over to his cottage. He\u2019ll be pleased for your company.\u201d</p><p>Alex was thrilled. Auggie had become one of his favorite companions. He eagerly nodded, let go of Johanna\u2019s hand, and ran downstairs shouting Lindsay\u2019s name.</p><p>Nicholas wasn\u2019t in the great hall. Clare called out to Johanna and motioned for her to come to the door, which she had partially opened.</p><p>\u201cFather\u2019s here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNicholas is waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay inside, Clare,\u201d Johanna ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll try to get my brother . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d Clare announced.</p><p>Johanna didn\u2019t argue. Clare pulled the door wide and then followed Johanna outside.</p><p>It was cold and damp. The clouds were gray, and a fine mist was falling.</p><p>Laird MacKay spotted his daughter immediately and gave her a quick nod in greeting. He was still mounted on his steed, and there were at least twenty clansmen with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s MacBain?\u201d the laird shouted.</p><p>Nicholas waited until Clare\u2019s father had dismounted before he answered him.</p><p>\u201cHe had an important matter to take care of and left yesterday morning. I suggest you come back in two or three weeks. He should be back by then.\u201d</p><p>Laird MacKay frowned with anger. \u201cClare MacKay,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cYes, Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou married yet?\u201d</p><p>Clare walked down the steps and started across the courtyard. Her voice held a note of fear in it when she gave her answer.</p><p>\u201cNo, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen war it is,\u201d Laird MacKay bellowed.</p><p>The veins in the side of his neck stood out. Nicholas shook his head. \u201cMacBain doesn\u2019t have time to war against you,\u201d he announced. \u201cHe\u2019s got another, more important battle on his hands.\u201d</p><p>MacKay didn\u2019t know if he should be insulted or not. \u201cWho is he warring against?\u201d he demanded to know. \u201cThe Gillevreys? Or is it the O\u2019Donnells? They\u2019re a sneaky lot. Makes no difference which clan it is, for they\u2019re both poorly trained and can be defeated in a day\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird MacBain went to war against England, Papa.\u201d Clare blurted out the lie.</p><p>Her announcement gained her father\u2019s full attention. \u201cWell now, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he decided.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacKay, you look soaked through. Won\u2019t you come inside and warm yourself by our fire?\u201d Johanna tried to play the gracious hostess now in hopes of soothing the old man\u2019s temper. \u201cYou must be hungry after your long journey.\u201d she added as she walked down the steps.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t hungry and I can\u2019t imagine why I\u2019d be needing to warm myself. It\u2019s hot as ever today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, please come inside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laird MacKay shook his head. \u201cI won\u2019t be moving a foot until I hear the name of the man who disgraced you, Clare. I\u2019m wanting to know who my son-in-law is, and I\u2019m wanting to know now. Which MacBain shamed you, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any MacBain.\u201d</p><p>Clare\u2019s voice shook when she gave her father her answer. Johanna tried to hush her before she could say any more.</p><p>Clare shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to know,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you just say? It wasn\u2019t a MacBain?\u201d her father demanded.</p><p>\u201cFather, will you please listen to me,\u201d Clare implored. \u201cI have to explain what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m wanting to listen to is the name of the man you\u2019re going to wed.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas hadn\u2019t said a word during the debate between father and daughter. He seemed completely unconcerned. Yet when Clare tried to walk past him to get closer to her father, he reached out and grabbed hold of her arm to keep her from going any further.</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d Johanna whispered.</p> <p>\u201cHell,\u201d Nicholas muttered.</p><p>Clare was thoroughly confused by Nicholas\u2019s action. \u201cPlease let go of me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis matter doesn\u2019t involve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but it does,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She shook her head. He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for you, Clare MacKay, and you are accountable to me. I haven\u2019t given you permission to go anywhere. Get behind me and stay there.\u201d The last of his command was given in a hard, downright mean, tone of voice.</p><p>Clare was simply too astonished to argue. She turned to Johanna for guidance. Nicholas\u2019s sister lifted her shoulders in a shrug. She looked as confused as Clare was by Nicholas\u2019s behavior.</p><p>\u201cDo it now.\u201d</p> <p>Clare obeyed the command before she had time to think about it. She moved to stand behind Nicholas, then leaned up on tiptoe so he could hear her whispered protest. \u201cI am not accountable to you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t bother to whisper his reply. \u201cYou will be.\u201d</p><p>Clare still didn\u2019t understand what Nicholas was telling her. Johanna understood, though. She walked over to her brother. Keith appeared out of nowhere and blocked her path. He obviously didn\u2019t want her to get too close to Laird MacKay.</p><p>She tried to ignore the soldier\u2019s interference. \u201cNicholas? Are you certain you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>Her brother didn\u2019t answer her. Laird MacKay strutted forward. He wanted to snatch his daughter back.</p><p>\u201cMacBain promised me a wedding,\u201d he announced. \u201cHe\u2019s not a man to go back on his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d Nicholas agreed. \u201cThere will be a wedding.\u201d</p><p>The laird looked appeased. He grunted low in his throat and gave a brisk nod.</p> <p>\u201cPapa, there isn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe silent, lass, while I get my particulars,\u201d her father ordered. He kept his gaze centered on Nicholas. \u201cAnd who is my future son-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Laird MacKay\u2019s mouth dropped open. His eyes looked as though they were going to bulge right out of his face. He shook his head in denial and took a step back in an attempt to distance himself from the Englishman.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>Nicholas wouldn\u2019t let the laird retreat. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered, his voice emphatic.</p><p>Clare grabbed hold of Nicholas\u2019s tunic and tried to pull him back. \u201cAre you crazed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Johanna nudged Keith out of her way and hurried over to Clare\u2019s side. \u201cLet go of him,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Clare started to protest the outrageous pledge Nicholas had just given her father, but Johanna stopped her by grabbing hold of her hand and demanding in a whisper that she wait until later to argue.</p><p>\u201cIs it a trick then?\u201d Clare asked, thinking Nicholas might be giving the rash promise in order to stall for time.</p><p>\u201cIt could be,\u201d Johanna allowed, knowing full well her brother never said anything he didn\u2019t mean. He was going to marry Clare MacKay all right, and from the set look on his face, no one was going to stop him, not even a reluctant bride.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re English,\u201d the laird shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t seem to be at all affected by the old man\u2019s fury. He actually smiled when he said, \u201cI won\u2019t require a substantial dowry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare MacKay, you might as well have taken a dagger and plunged it into your father\u2019s very own heart,\u201d the laird wailed.</p><p>\u201cBut, Father . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe silent.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas snapped the command. He didn\u2019t take his gaze off Clare\u2019s father when he gave his order. He waited for the angry old warrior to either pounce on him or gain control of himself.</p><p>Johanna tried to soothe Clare, but it was difficult for her to pay attention to what she was doing and keep her attention on the laird at the same time. She was mesmerized by the man\u2019s behavior. Lairds didn\u2019t weep, but this one looked like he was going to break down and cry at any moment. He was certainly having difficulty accepting Nicholas\u2019s announcement.</p><p>\u201cAn English baron wed to my daughter? I\u2019ll die first, I will. \u201d</p><p>Johanna quit rubbing Clare\u2019s shoulder and stepped forward. \u201cA very rich baron,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>The laird frowned at Johanna with what she thought was indignation. \u201cWealth is not an issue here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow rich?\u201d</p><p>They were married an hour later.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time for a celebration. Father MacKechnie had only just blessed the union when Michael came running into the great hall. He was looking for Keith or Nicholas to give his news.</p><p>He spotted the baron first. \u201cOne of our soldiers doing border patrol has just arrived with the news,\u201d he said. \u201cEnglish soldiers were spotted coming onto our land. It\u2019s an army, Baron, and only an hour away from the keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many were sighted?\u201d Keith demanded.</p><p>\u201cToo many to ever count,\u201d Michael told him.</p><p>Nicholas let out a roar so forceful and so filled with fury, the sound surely reached the Lowlands.</p><p>He had been betrayed by his king. The bond between vassal and overlord was destroyed. John had lied to his baron, for he hadn\u2019t sent a messenger and escort. He\u2019d sent an army.</p><p>The keep would be under siege in less than an hour\u2019s time. Keith immediately took charge of readying the area for attack by posting guards all along the walls, and Nicholas took on the responsibility of leading a contingent of men down the ridge to meet the English soldiers in a flanking attack.</p><p>Laird MacKay was told to go home before the fight began. He refused the order and mounted his horse to ride by his son-in-law\u2019s side. He told one of his men to ride like lightning back to his own holding and gather his considerable troops. Nicholas was damned thankful for the old man\u2019s interference. He knew they were going to need every fighting man available.</p><p>Clare couldn\u2019t seem to make up her mind if she wanted to get hysterical because she was now married to an Englishman or if she wanted to be helpful in the battle against the intruders. Then Nicholas turned to leave, and Clare picked up her skirts and ran after him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare make me a widow, Baron,\u201d she demanded. \u201cI\u2019m wanting an annulment, not a funeral.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas reached his stallion, grabbed the reins in one hand, and then turned to his bride. \u201cYou won\u2019t be getting either,\u201d he announced.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say to him next. Nicholas stared at her for a long minute, then decided he\u2019d wasted enough time on his new bride. He started to turn away.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Words still eluded her. And so she simply threw herself into his arms. Nicholas knew what to do next. He let go of the reins, wrapped his arms around his trembling bride, and gave her a kiss filled with promise, commitment, and a fair amount of lust.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a boy with your hair cut so short, but you sure as hell kiss like a woman, Clare MacKay.\u201d</p><p>She forgot how to breathe. She couldn\u2019t seem to gather her wits about her until her husband was riding away.</p><p>\u201cTake care of him, Papa!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cI will, lass. Get yourself inside and stay there.\u201d Clare turned to do just that when she spotted Johanna running across the yard. \u201cJohanna, where are you going? It isn\u2019t safe for you to stay out here.\u201d</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t listening. She ran all the way to Auggie\u2019s cottage. She was crying by the time she got there.</p><p>Alex took one look at his mother and started wailing. She picked the child up and hugged him tight.</p><p>\u201cAuggie, take Alex up to my chamber. I\u2019m making you responsible for him. Don\u2019t let any harm come to him. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd where will you be while I\u2019m looking out for the boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t time for me to explain,\u201d she answered. \u201cKing John has sent an army four times the size of our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve survived before, lass. We\u2019ll survive again.\u201d</p><p>The price was too dear to pay for Johanna to be reasonable. She didn\u2019t want a single man to die because of her fight with England\u2019s king. She believed she was the only one who could avert a massacre.</p><p>\u201cThe king betrayed my brother,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used trickery, Auggie, and so I will use the truth to stop this before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Johanna kissed Alex and handed him to Auggie. \u201cGo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI must know both of you will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it gets too threatening, I\u2019ll take the boy and hide. I\u2019ll bring him back when it\u2019s finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you get outside the walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my ways,\u201d Auggie boasted. \u201cQuit your crying, boy. We\u2019re on an adventure now. Let\u2019s fetch your wooden sword and have our own battle.\u201d</p><p>Johanna stayed inside Auggie\u2019s cottage for several minutes. She knelt down and said a prayer for courage.</p><p>She finished her petitions, made the sign of the cross, and then stood up. Clare and Keith were both standing in the doorway, watching her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re swarming up the hills, m\u2019lady,\u201d Keith announced. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to find a way to get you out of here. We can\u2019t defend ourselves against such numbers.\u201d</p><p>Clare was trying not to cry. \u201cPapa and Nicholas are both going to get killed. I\u2019ve never seen so many soldiers, Johanna. I don\u2019t know what we will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan,\u201d Johanna announced. \u201cThey\u2019re here to fetch me, aren\u2019t they? Keith, you will simply give me to them.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI cannot, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice in the matter,\u201d she countered. \u201cListen carefully. We were taken by surprise, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><p>She waited for his nod before continuing. \u201cIf we\u2019d had time to prepare, what would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalled up our allies,\u201d Keith replied. \u201cAnd when they arrived, we would outnumber the enemy. Even now the word is being passed through the Highlands, for the sight of such a vast army would be spread like wildfire. Most of our allies are to the north, however, and they are probably only just now hearing the news. They\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it will be too late, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is always hope, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is also a better plan,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf I willingly go to the English soldiers, they will retreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take you back to England!\u201d Clare cried out.</p><p>\u201cThey will if Keith cannot mount an attack in time. How long before you can gather enough men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA single full day,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cGabriel hasn\u2019t reached England yet. He will have heard. Add him to your numbers.\u201d</p><p>Johanna continued to try to make the commander listen to reason. Keith wouldn\u2019t agree with her plan, however, and kept insisting he would give up his life to keep her safe.</p><p>And so she resorted to trickery to get her way. She pretended to give in. Keith asked her to go back to the great hall and wait there with Clare until he sent men to sneak the two of them out of the keep.</p><p>Johanna nodded agreement. She started up the hill with Clare at her side, but just as soon as Keith had regained his mount and ridden away, she turned to her friend.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve going to have to help me,\u201d she announced. \u201cYou know it\u2019s the only way, Clare. I won\u2019t be harmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that, Johanna,\u201d Clare whispered with fear. \u201cWhat about your baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be all right. Raulf doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m carrying, and the pleats in my plaid hide my condition.\u201d She nodded again. \u201cWe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Baron Raulf is leading the army? How will you keep him from hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not forgotten how to cower,\u201d Johanna replied. Her voice was filled with sadness. \u201cAnd I will try not to incite his anger. Clare, I love my brother and all these good men here. I cannot let them die because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease help me.\u201d</p><p>Clare was finally swayed. She gave a quick nod. \u201cAren\u2019t you frightened, Johanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cBut I\u2019m not overwhelmed with it. In my heart, I know it\u2019s a sound plan. Gabriel will find me.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down Clare\u2019s face. She forced a smile to hide her terror. \u201cI wish I had someone like Gabriel who I could love and trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Clare, you do. Nicholas is every bit as gentle and good as my husband.\u201d</p><p>Her friend\u2019s smile became genuine then. \u201cDear Lord, I forgot I was married,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cCome now. We must get you out of here before I also forget I have courage.\u201d</p><p>The two women turned direction and ran toward the back entrance to the stables. Twenty minutes later, and after considerable subterfuge and plain sneakery, Johanna rode out of the keep and down the steep hill.</p><p>She was going back to hell again. Yet when she spotted Raulf riding toward her, her heart didn\u2019t stop beating and her stomach didn\u2019t twist in agony.</p><p>Johanna wasn\u2019t terrified now; she was determined. She had a sound plan.</p><p>She had Gabriel.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>They took her to the Gillevrey keep. Raulf and his army had crossed the clan\u2019s border and immediately found themselves under attack. The Highlander soldiers were courageous in battle, but Laird MacKay\u2019s evaluation was proven true. They were a poorly trained group of men, and it had only taken the English infidels one day to conquer the land and the castle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laird Gillevrey and thirty of his men were locked away in the cellars below the great hall. The other clansmen were being held in the soldiers\u2019 quarters in the lower bailey.</p><p>Johanna\u2019s surrender had been swift. She rode down the hill and into the jaws of the enemy. They enveloped and surrounded her.</p><p>Although she was just a scant foot or two away from Raulf, she didn\u2019t speak to him. She simply sat atop her mount with her hands folded together and waited to see what he would do.</p><p>Raulf was dressed in full knight\u2019s battlewear, but his head was covered with the old-fashioned open conical helmet. He preferred it over the modern fully enclosed gear. He\u2019d told her his vision was improved. She believed vanity was the true reason.</p> <p>It was difficult for her to look at him. His appearance hadn\u2019t changed much. His eyes were just as green, his complexion was still unscarred, and there were only a few added age lines creasing his narrow cheeks now. Then he took his helmet off, and she realized there had been a dramatic change after all. His hair had been the color of wheat when she\u2019d last seen him. It was white now.</p><p>\u201cWe will go home now, Johanna, and all this will be put behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she immediately agreed.</p><p>Her answer pleased him. He nudged his mount close to her side and reached over to touch her face.</p><p>\u201cYou have grown more beautiful,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, my love.\u201d</p> <p>Johanna couldn\u2019t look at him now, for she was certain he would see the disgust in her eyes. She bowed her head in what she prayed looked like submission.</p><p>Raulf was apparently satisfied. He put his helmet back on, turned his mount, and then gave the order to ride.</p><p>They didn\u2019t stop for water or rest and reached the Gillevrey holding late that afternoon.</p><p>Johanna immediately pleaded exhaustion. Raulf escorted her inside. The entrance was narrow. Steps leading upstairs were directly in front of her. To the right was the hall. It was a large room, square in dimensions, and the balcony above surrounded it on all sides. Johanna was disheartened by that notice, for she knew if she was kept upstairs, she couldn\u2019t sneak out the door without being spotted by the guards in the hall.</p><p>She was given the third chamber. The door was in the center of the balcony. Raulf opened the door for her. She kept her head bowed and tried to hurry past him. He grabbed hold of her arm and tried to kiss her. She wouldn\u2019t let him. She turned her head away.</p><p>He roughly pulled her into his arms and hugged her. His hands toyed with her hair.</p> <p>\u201cDid they make you cut your hair?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. \u201cOf course they did,\u201d he decided. \u201cYou never would have willingly cut your hair, for you surely remember how much I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did remember,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cIt will grow again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Raulf suddenly tightened his hold on her. \u201cWhy did you get our marriage annulled?\u201d</p><p>The pain he was inflicting upon her made her flinch. \u201cThe king wanted me to marry Baron Williams. I demanded an annulment to stall for time. I didn\u2019t believe you were dead.\u201d</p><p>Her answer satisfied Raulf. \u201cJohn didn\u2019t tell me Williams wanted you for wife. The bastard did lust after you, didn\u2019t he? And you never did like him much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very sleepy,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI don\u2019t feel at all well.\u201d</p><p>Raulf finally let go of her. \u201cThe excitement has been too much for you. You were always weak, Johanna, and only I know how to take care of you. Go to bed now. I won\u2019t bother you tonight. I put one of your gowns on the bed. You will wear it tomorrow. When you join me downstairs, I will have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>He finally left her alone. The door had a lock, but the key had been removed. She would have to find something to block the entrance, she decided. She didn\u2019t trust Raulf to leave her alone; and if he did sneak into the chamber during the night, she would be prepared. If he tried to touch her, she would kill him . . . or die trying.</p><p>Johanna had been in complete control of her emotions until now; and although she was exhausted from the strain, she was still feeling proud of herself because she hadn\u2019t allowed her anger or her fear to gain the upper hand. It was her sole duty to protect her baby from harm until Gabriel came to fetch her. Yes, that was her only duty.</p><p>Messengers had left to chase down Gabriel as soon as the English army had been spotted. Johanna prayed the clansmen wouldn\u2019t have to go all the way to London to catch up with their laird.</p><p>The MacBain allies were surely preparing to ride now, too, she decided. Why, by tomorrow night or the night after, she would certainly be rescued.</p><p>Johanna set about defending her little chamber from attack. She pushed an empty chest over to the door to block it. She knew it wouldn\u2019t keep anyone from breaking in, but she hoped the sound when the chest was moved would wake her up if she accidentally fell asleep.</p><p>She hurried over to the window, pulled the fur covering back, and looked down. Then she muttered an expletive. There wouldn\u2019t be any escape possible through the opening. It was a straight drop two stories down, and the rock wall was too smooth to find handholds to climb down.</p><p>The room was cold and damp. She was suddenly so weary she needed to sit down. She removed her belt and wrapped herself in her plaid. Then she went over to the bed.</p><p>She spotted the gown spread out upon the covers. Recognition was swift. Her weariness vanished, and fury such as she\u2019d never known before flooded her. She was consumed by it, and all she wanted to do was scream as loud as a warrior would when he rode into battle.</p><p>It was her wedding gown. The shoes she\u2019d worn were there too, she noticed, and the ribbons, dear God, the ribbons she\u2019d entwined in her hair were spread out on the covers as well.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s demented,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And determined, she silently added. He\u2019d told her he had a surprise for her in the morning, and now she fully understood what he planned. The fool actually believed he was going to marry her again.</p><p>Johanna was literally shaking with rage when she reached for the gown. She hurled it across the chamber. The ribbons and shoes went flying next.</p><p>Her anger quickly drained the rest of her strength. Johanna stretched out on the bed, pulled her plaid up over her head, took her dagger out of the sheath she\u2019d tied with string around her thigh, and held the weapon in both hands.</p><p>She fell asleep minutes later.</p><p>The scraping noise the chest made when it was moved across the stone floor woke her up. Sunlight streamed into the chamber from the sides of the fur covering the window. Johanna had dropped her dagger sometime during the night. She found it in a fold of the plaid and was ready to strike when she sat up.</p><p>\u201cMay I enter, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>The whispered request came from an elderly woman. She held a tray in her hands but hesitated in the doorway until she was given permission.</p><p>\u201cYou may,\u201d Johanna called out.</p><p>The woman hurried inside. She used the back of her foot to push the door closed.</p><p>\u201cBaron Raulf ordered me to serve you,\u201d she said as she walked closer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Gillevrey,\u201d Johanna guessed when she spotted the colorful plaid.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d the woman replied. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Laird MacBain\u2019s wife, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Johanna answered. Her voice was sharp, for she was in a hurry now to gain some answers the Gillevrey woman might be able to give her.</p><p>\u201cAre there guards posted outside this door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is one,\u201d the servant answered.</p><p>\u201cHow many in the hall below?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many to count,\u201d the woman answered. She put the tray on the foot of the bed. \u201cMy laird\u2019s locked in the cellar, m\u2019lady. They\u2019re treating him like a common thief. He sends you an important message. I was allowed to carry food to him early this morning, and he whispered the words he wanted me to repeat to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is his message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe MacBain will avenge this atrocity.\u201d</p><p>Johanna smiled. The servant looked expectant. \u201cDoes your laird require an answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell him, yes, the MacBain will certainly avenge this atrocity.\u201d</p><p>The woman gave a brisk nod. \u201cAnd so it will be done,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She sounded as though she was in prayer. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Johanna asked.</p><p>\u201cLucy,\u201d the woman answered.</p><p>Johanna scooted off the bed. She held onto her plaid with one hand and offered her other hand to the woman.</p><p>\u201cYou are a good and courageous woman, Lucy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd now I have a favor to ask of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do anything I can to help, m\u2019lady. I\u2019m old and surely feeble, but I will diligently try to serve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must find a way to stay inside this chamber for as long as possible. Are you good at lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s called for,\u201d Lucy answered.</p><p>\u201cThen report to the baron that I am still sleeping soundly. Tell him you put the tray down but didn\u2019t disturb me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Lucy promised. \u201cThe baron doesn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to get you downstairs, m\u2019lady. He\u2019s pacing with impatience, but only because the man he sent for has still not arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t catch the name,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cBut I heard what he was. He\u2019s a bishop, and he\u2019s living somewhere near the Lowlands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBishop Hallwick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lady, please lower your voice. The guard will hear you. I didn\u2019t catch the bishop\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Johanna\u2019s heartbeat quickened. \u201cOf course it\u2019s Hallwick,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWill the bishop help you, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Johanna answered. \u201cHe\u2019s an evil man, Lucy. He would aid Lucifer if there was gold involved. Tell me this, please. How did you know Baron Raulf sent for anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one pays me any attention because I\u2019m old. I can act dotty when I set my mind to it. I was standing near the corner of the hall when the soldiers came inside to take over our laird\u2019s home. The baron didn\u2019t waste a minute giving his instructions. He sent six men to ride to the Lowlands. They were to escort the bishop back.\u201d</p><p>Johanna rubbed her arms to ward off the chill she felt. Raulf had been quite methodical in his plans. She wondered what other surprises were in store for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d best get downstairs before the baron notices I\u2019ve been in here so long, and you\u2019d best get back under the covers so the guard will see you\u2019re sleeping when I open the door.\u201d</p><p>Johanna thanked the servant and then hurried to do as she suggested. She stayed in bed a long while, waiting for the summons to come.</p><p>Raulf left her alone. The blessed reprieve lasted until the following afternoon. Johanna spent a good deal of her time staring out the window. The hills below were covered with English soldiers. She thought they probably surrounded the keep on all sides.</p><p>How was Gabriel going to get to her?</p><p>She straightened her shoulders. That was his problem to worry about, not hers, she decided. But Lord, how she wished he would hurry up.</p><p>Lucy came back into the chamber late that afternoon. She carried another tray of food.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been coming and going all day long, m\u2019lady. Now men are fetching pails of hot water and bringing up a wooden tub. The baron has ordered a bath for you. Why in heavens he\u2019d think about your comforts now is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m going to marry him,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cThe bishop\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Lucy answered. \u201cThere\u2019s another baron down below as well. I heard his name. He\u2019s called Williams. He\u2019s an ugly one all right with his frizzled dirt-colored hair and black eyes. He and Baron Raulf have been arguing most of the afternoon. It\u2019s a heated fight all right, and wouldn\u2019t it be a blessing if they killed each other and saved your husband the bother?\u201d</p><p>Johanna smiled. \u201cIt would be a blessing. Lucy, please stay and lean against the door while I bathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to accommodate the foul man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to look as pretty as possible for my husband,\u201d Johanna explained. \u201cHe will be here any time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you put on the English gown?\u201d Lucy asked. She pointed to the corner where Johanna had thrown the garment.</p><p>\u201cI will wear my plaid.\u201d</p><p>Lucy nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to fetch you clean underclothes when I go get the soap and drying cloths,\u201d she said.</p><p>Johanna carried through with her determination to wear her plaid. She knew Raulf would be furious, but she was also certain he wouldn\u2019t strike her in front of witnesses. She would have to make certain she was never left alone with him. She wasn\u2019t at all certain how she would achieve that miracle, and damn it all, where was Gabriel?</p><p>She absolutely refused to consider the possibility her husband might not be able to get to her in time, and whenever a worrisome thought popped into her mind, she pushed it away.</p><p>She took her time bathing. She even washed her hair. Then she sat on the side of the bed to dry it with the cloths Lucy gave her. The servant insisted upon brushing her hair for her, and when she was finished and the curls fell just so about her shoulders, Lucy declared she looked as beautiful as a princess.</p><p>The summons came an hour later. Lucy was wringing her hands when she repeated the order. Johanna was extremely calm. She knew she couldn\u2019t put off the confrontation any longer.</p><p>She put in yet another request to her Maker to help Gabriel get to her in time, tucked her dagger in her belt and covered it with a fold from her plaid, and then went downstairs.</p><p>They made her wait at the entrance for almost ten minutes before bidding her to come into the hall. Raulf and Williams were standing at a round table on the opposite side of the room, arguing about a paper Williams waved in his hand.</p><p>The two barons were opposite in appearance yet quite similar in temperament. They snapped at each other like mad dogs, one with his shock of white hair and the other with his brown-colored locks and black soul. They were both hideous to her.</p><p>Bishop Hallwick was also in the hall. He sat in a tall-backed chair in the center of the room. He held a scroll in his hands and appeared to be reading the thing over and over again. Every other minute or so he would shake his head as though in confusion.</p><p>The bishop had aged considerably in the past few years. He looked sickly, too, for his complexion had a yellow cast to it now. Lucifer must be dancing with anticipation, Johanna thought to herself. Hallwick was old and worn out, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before he was welcomed home by the devil himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Johanna noticed a movement above. She looked up and spotted Lucy making her way along the balcony. The servant was pausing at each chamber and pushing the door open before moving on. Johanna assumed she\u2019d been told to air out the chambers.</p><p>\u201cBut I will take the stand that this marriage is only a formality, a renewal of our vows if you will,\u201d Raulf announced in such a loud, angry tone of voice that Johanna heard him.</p><p>Williams nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cA renewal. When the pope and our king settle their differences, we\u2019ll send these explanations to Rome. I doubt Innocent will involve himself in the matter anyway.\u201d</p><p>Raulf turned then and spotted Johanna standing in the entrance. He frowned when he saw what she was wearing.</p> <p>Williams ordered her to come forward. Johanna did as she was commanded. She didn\u2019t cross the room however, but stopped when she was several feet in front of Bishop Hallwick.</p><p>He nodded to her. She ignored him. Williams noticed her slight.</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten to kneel in the presence of a man of God, Lady Johanna?\u201d</p><p>The sneer in his voice disgusted her. \u201cI do not see a man of God in this room,\u201d she answered. \u201cI see only a pathetic mockery dressed in priest\u2019s black garb.\u201d</p><p>Both barons looked quite stunned by her opinion. Williams was the first to recover. He took a step forward. \u201cHow dare you speak to Bishop Hallwick with such disrespect.\u201d</p> <p>Raulf nodded. The look of fury in his eyes was chilling. \u201cWhen the holy bishop hears your confession and gives me your penance, Johanna, you will regret your rash outburst.\u201d</p><p>She saw Hallwick nod out of the corner of her eye. She still refused to look directly at the old man, however, and kept her attention on Raulf.</p><p>\u201cHallwick isn\u2019t holy,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd I will never kneel before him and give him my confession. He has no hold over me now, Raulf. He teaches blasphemy against women. He is, in fact, a despot and an evildoer. Nay, I will never kneel before him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for your sins, woman.\u201d</p><p>The bishop\u2019s scratchy voice was filled with malice. She finally turned her gaze to him. \u201cAnd you will pay for the terrible punishments you\u2019ve inflicted upon all those honorable women who turned to you for counsel whose only fault was in believing you were God\u2019s representative. They didn\u2019t realize as I do what a monster you are. I wonder, Hallwick, if you fear going to sleep at night. You should, you know. You\u2019re old and sick. You\u2019re going to die soon, and then, by all that is truly holy, you will be made accountable for your tortures.\u201d</p><p>The bishop staggered to his feet. \u201cYou speak heresy,\u201d he shouted.</p> <p>\u201cI speak the truth,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cTonight you will learn your opinions should best be kept to yourself,\u201d Raulf announced. He nodded to Williams and then took several steps toward her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t back away from him. \u201cYou are a fool, Raulf. I won\u2019t go through any pretense of remarrying you. I already have a husband. You seem to have conveniently forgotten that important fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cannot want to stay with the barbarian.\u201d Williams said. \u201cHer mind has been broken, Raulf. That\u2019s why the demons speak through her.\u201d</p><p>Raulf stopped. \u201cHave you been possessed by an evil spirit?\u201d</p><p>The bishop latched onto the possibility at once and vehemently nodded. He turned to walk toward the side doorway which Baron Williams now blocked. \u201cShe\u2019ll have to be purified before she can speak her renewal vows,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019ll get the holy water and the stick, Baron. You\u2019ll have to beat the demons out of her. I don\u2019t have enough strength.\u201d</p><p>The bishop was out of breath by the time he finished explaining his errand. He wheezed his way across the chamber. Johanna didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to the threat just given. She tried to keep her expression as serene as possible.</p><p>Raulf was watching her closely. \u201cYou do not seem to be afraid of what is going to happen to you,\u201d he remarked.</p> <p>She turned her attention back to him. He looked both angry and confused. She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Raulf, who has become possessed if you believe I would ever prefer you to my laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot possibly love the savage,\u201d Williams blurted out.</p><p>She kept her gaze directed on Raulf when she gave her answer. \u201cOh, but I do love him,\u201d she replied, her voice strong with conviction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be punished for such treasonous and disloyal remarks against me,\u201d Raulf threatened.</p><p>She was neither impressed nor frightened. She tilted her head while she considered the man who had so terrified her in the past. Raulf looked pitiful to her, and she was suddenly so filled with loathing, she could barely stomach the sight of him.</p><p>He could never destroy her. Never.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly believe you and Williams and Hallwick are superior to one Highlander? You really are fools,\u201d she added with a shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cWe are King John\u2019s closest advisers.\u201d Williams shouted the boast.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, King John,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cThe three of you are worthy company for each other.\u201d</p><p>The derision in her voice was a slap to Raulf\u2019s pride. He was visibly shaking with his anger now. \u201cWhat has happened to you?\u201d he demanded in a harsh whisper. \u201cYou never would have spoken to me with such blatant disrespect in the past. Do you feel safe because you are in Scotland? Is that it, Johanna? Or do you believe I\u2019m so overcome with joy to have you back I will overlook your slander against my character? You would do well to remember the pain you suffered in the past because of the necessary punishments you forced me to measure out. Aye, you would do well to remember.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t cowering away from him. Raulf was confused by her behavior. He didn\u2019t see fear in her eyes. He saw defiance.</p><p>\u201cTonight I will show you what happens to a wife who has forgotten her place,\u201d he threatened.</p><p>He thought to terrify her and knew he\u2019d failed when she simply shook her head at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened to you?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cYou are too ignorant to ever understand what happened to me,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThe Highlanders have done this to her!\u201d Williams shouted.</p><p>Raulf nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s no similarity between us and Scotland\u2019s waste,\u201d Raulf muttered.</p><p>She nodded. Her quick agreement gave Raulf pause. Then she clarified her position. \u201cYou have spoken your first truth,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no similarities between you and my Gabriel, and I thank God for that. You have vowed your love for me a thousand times in the past and then used your fists to show me how very much you love me. Gabriel has never told me he loves me, yet I know he does. He would never ever raise a hand against me or any other woman. He\u2019s honorable and courageous and has a heart and a soul as pure as an archangel\u2019s. Oh, no, you two are nothing alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you speak such blasphemy!\u201d The veins in the sides of Raulf\u2019s neck stood out from the force of his scream.</p><p>She knew she was provoking his rage, but she couldn\u2019t stop the words from pouring out. It so offended her that he dared consider himself superior to any Highlander. His opinion of himself was perverse, and she was determined to set him straight.</p><p>\u201cShow me the companions you keep and I\u2019ll tell you who you are. My mother taught me that valuable lesson, but I doubt either one of you will understand the meaning behind it. I happen to keep very good companions. My clan\u2019s my family, and each one of us would die to keep the others safe. They\u2019re all proud and honorable men and women.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at the two barons. Disgust echoed in her voice when she continued. \u201cNay, you can\u2019t understand. How could you? You don\u2019t know what honor is. Look at your companions. You cannot turn your back on each other for fear of getting a knife between your shoulders. You would both kill your own fathers if it meant you would gain more power. You, Raulf, have broken every commandment, and so has your overlord. You and Williams both conspired with your king to commit one heinous crime after another. You will pay for your sins one day in the future, and very soon now you will pay for forcing me to leave my sanctuary. You\u2019re demented if you believe you can get away with this atrocity. If my husband has any faults at all, it is that he is a terribly possessive man. Oh, Gabriel will come after me all right. You have dared to take away the woman he loves. He won\u2019t show you any mercy; and when you\u2019re dead, I doubt God will show you much mercy either. You are a demon, Raulf, and Gabriel is my very own archangel. He will crush you.\u201d</p><p>Raulf\u2019s fury became uncontrollable. His roar echoed throughout the hall. Johanna braced herself for his attack and reached for her dagger.</p><p>Raulf ran toward her. He was just a few feet away when he raised his fist in preparation for the first blow he would deliver.</p><p>An arrow stopped his advance. It went completely through his closed fist. Raulf\u2019s bellow of rage turned into a scream of agony. He staggered backward and looked up to find the man who had attacked him.</p><p>They were everywhere.</p><p>The balcony was filled with warriors wearing the MacBain plaid. They surrounded the great hall on all sides. All but one soldier had arrows knotched to their bows. Baron Raulf was in their sights.</p><p>There was but a second or two of awareness in Raulf\u2019s eyes before he died, recognition, too, perhaps, as he stared at the giant warrior standing directly above Johanna. Gabriel\u2019s gaze was locked on the baron. He slowly reached back to take a second arrow from his carrier.</p><p>Death captured Raulf\u2019s expression of terror. The next arrow ended his life. It penetrated the center of his forehead. And then another arrow and another and another sliced through the stillness to cut into the target. The force of so many arrows striking at the same time propelled Raulf backward and upward; and when he finally collapsed to the floor, there were over fifty arrows lodged in his body.</p><p>Lucifer had his soul.</p><p>Johanna turned around and looked up. Gabriel stood above her. Nicholas was at his side. Both warriors handed their bows and carriers to the soldiers standing behind them, then turned to come downstairs. All of the other clansmen had fresh arrows knotched in preparation. Their target was Baron Williams who was now cowering in the corner of the hall.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for Gabriel to come to her. As soon as he reached the entrance of the hall, she dropped her dagger and ran to him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her hug him. He wouldn\u2019t even look at her. His gaze was fully directed on Baron Williams. \u201cThis isn\u2019t finished yet,\u201d he announced in a gruff tone of voice. He gently pushed her behind his back. \u201cYou may show me your affection later, wife.\u201d</p><p>Her next remark surely saved Williams\u2019s life. Gabriel started forward but stopped when he caught her whispered reply. \u201cAnd you may explain your reason for being so tardy, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile eased his frown. He continued on across the hall; grabbed Williams by his shoulders, forcing him to stand up; and then slammed his fist into his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to live for one purpose only,\u201d Gabriel announced. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take a message to your king and save me the journey. I\u2019ve been separated from my wife long enough, and I cannot stomach the notion of having to look upon King John.\u201d</p><p>Blood was pouring down from Baron Williams\u2019s broken nose. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he stammered out. \u201cI\u2019ll take any message you wish to give me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dragged the baron over to the table and shoved him into a chair.</p><p>Her husband\u2019s voice was too low for Johanna to hear what he was saying to Williams. She tried to walk closer but suddenly found herself surrounded by soldiers who deliberately blocked her path.</p><p>Nicholas also wanted to find out what Gabriel was telling the baron. The soldiers wouldn\u2019t let him get any closer. He turned to his sister, noticed she was staring at Raulf, and immediately walked over to put himself in front of her.</p><p>\u201cDo not look at him,\u201d Nicholas ordered. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore. He\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>It was a ridiculous thing to say, given the fact that arrows covered Raulf\u2019s body from head to feet. She was about to point out that fact to her brother when he spoke again. He gave her his boast, not his confession.</p><p>\u201cI killed him.\u201d</p><p>Keith stepped forward. \u201cNay, Nicholas. I killed him,\u201d he announced in a near shout.</p><p>Calum came forward next. \u201cNicholas, you didn\u2019t even have your arrow at the ready when I killed him.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly every soldier in the hall was shouting his boast that he\u2019d been the one to end Baron Raulf\u2019s life. Johanna didn\u2019t understand what was happening or why it seemed so important for each man to claim he\u2019d been the one responsible for killing the baron.</p><p>Then Nicholas smiled. He noticed her confusion and hastened to explain. \u201cYour husband is protecting me from my own king, Johanna. Gabriel won\u2019t ever admit it, of course, but he\u2019s making damned certain I can\u2019t be blamed for killing another baron. Each one of his men will continue to boast the kill. However,\u201d he added when Keith nodded, \u201cit is a fact that I really did kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, boy, I killed him,\u201d Laird MacKay shouted from the balcony.</p><p>And then it started all over again. The hall was echoing with shouts when Gabriel finished with Baron Williams. He hauled him to his feet, looked around him, and nodded with satisfaction. He waited until the shouting had died down, then said to Williams, \u201cYou will tell your king at least sixty men took credit for killing his favored baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after you\u2019ve given him my other important message, I suggest you do one last thing to please me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Williams promised. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Gabriel stared at the man a long minute before giving him his final instruction.</p><p>\u201cHide.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to say more. Williams fully understood his message. He nodded and ran out of the hall.</p><p>Gabriel watched him leave and then turned around. He ordered two soldiers to remove the dead body from the hall. Lindsay and Michael hurried forward to take care of the chore.</p><p>Nicholas and Johanna stood side by side across the room with Keith and Calum.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finished, little sister,\u201d Nicholas whispered. He put his arm around Johanna\u2019s shoulders and pulled her up against him. \u201cHe can\u2019t ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s finished, and now you will let go of your guilt. You were never responsible for what happened to me in the past. I was in charge of my own destiny, even in those most difficult times.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brother shook his head. \u201cI should have known,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have protected you.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to look up at him. \u201cThat\u2019s why you married Clare, isn\u2019t it? You were protecting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Johanna smiled. She decided the reasons why her brother married Clare weren\u2019t important. What mattered was their future together. Clare, Johanna believed, would eventually fall in love with Nicholas. He was such a good, kind-hearted man. Clare would realize her good fortune in time. And Nicholas would also grow to love her. Clare was a sweet woman. Aye, Johanna decided. It was going to be a sound marriage.</p> <p>Gabriel was staring at her. Laird MacKay was standing by his side and waving his hands in agitation as he talked to Johanna\u2019s husband. Every now and then Gabriel would shake his head.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what has Laird MacKay upset,\u201d Johanna remarked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably wanting to raid the castle before they let the Gillevrey laird out of the cellar,\u201d Nicholas replied.</p><p>Johanna couldn\u2019t take her gaze off her husband. He was taking forever to come to her. Didn\u2019t he realize how much she needed his comfort?</p><p>\u201cWhy is Gabriel ignoring me?\u201d she asked her brother.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t read his thoughts,\u201d Nicholas replied. \u201cI would guess he\u2019s trying to calm down before he talks to you. You gave him one hell of a scare. You\u2019d best get a good apology ready. I\u2019d try to look humble,\u201d he advised.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why he would want an apology.\u201d</p><p>Keith stepped forward to answer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t stay where you were put, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas tried not to laugh. He could tell from his sister\u2019s expression she didn\u2019t like hearing his explanation. If looks could do injury, Keith would now be writhing on the floor in acute pain.</p><p>Johanna straightened away from her brother. \u201cI did what was necessary,\u201d she told Keith.</p><p>\u201cWhat you thought was necessary,\u201d Nicholas corrected.</p> <p>From across the room Gabriel nodded. Johanna knew then he was listening to their discussion.</p><p>In a much louder tone of voice she said, \u201cI was protecting my clan by leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach one of us would die to protect the others.\u201d</p><p>Calum interjected the remark. He was smiling at Johanna while he repeated her very words back to her. He had obviously been hiding in one of the opened doorways on the balcony during her confrontation with Raulf.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d Calum answered.</p><p>Keith nodded. \u201cWe keep good companions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all understood your lesson, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Johanna started blushing. Nicholas thought the soldiers\u2019 obvious adoration for their mistress might be the cause of her embarrassment. Both Keith and Calum looked as though they might kneel down in front of her at any moment to pay her homage.</p> <p>\u201cYou made us very proud, m\u2019lady,\u201d Calum whispered in a voice that shook with emotion.</p><p>Her blush intensified. If they continued with their praise, she knew she would start weeping, and then they would surely become embarrassed. She couldn\u2019t let that happen. She hurried to change the topic. She glanced up at the balcony, then turned to Keith. \u201cIt\u2019s a straight drop from the windows to the ground,\u201d she began. \u201cHow in heaven\u2019s name did you ever get inside?\u201d</p><p>Keith laughed. \u201cI cannot believe you\u2019re asking me that question,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am asking you,\u201d she countered, wondering what he found so amusing. \u201cPlease explain. How did you get inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Johanna, there is always more than one way into a keep.\u201d</p><p>She burst into laughter. The sound was filled with such joy, Gabriel\u2019s entire body reacted. His throat tightened up, his heart started slamming a furious beat, and he found it damned difficult to take a deep breath. He knew that if he didn\u2019t take her into his arms soon, he would surely go out of his mind. He wanted privacy, because once he started touching her, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to stop.</p><p>Dear God, how he loved her.</p><p>He started to go to her and then forced himself to stop. By God, she would realize the hell she had put him through first, he thought to himself. Why, she had taken a good twenty years off his life. When his men had chased him down and told him she was in the hands of Baron Raulf, terror such as Gabriel had never known before filled his mind, his heart, and his soul. He was certain he\u2019d died a thousand deaths on his way to the Gillevrey holding. Another scare like that would put him in his grave. Only after he had gained her promise never to take such chances again would he let her comfort him.</p><p>Gabriel asked MacKay to go downstairs and let the laird out of his prison and then turned to Johanna.</p><p>\u201cMacBain\u2019s wanting your attention, Johanna,\u201d Nicholas whispered.</p><p>She looked at her husband. He nodded to her and then ordered her to come to him by crooking his finger at her.</p><p>The look on his face told her she was about to catch hell. She didn\u2019t want to waste time listening to him rant and rave about the danger she\u2019d placed herself in. It was finished now and she was safe. That was all that mattered. Besides, she wanted to be comforted, and she\u2019d waited long enough. She was out of patience and in desperate need of her husband\u2019s touch.</p><p>The only way she was going to get what she wanted was to catch her husband off guard and nudge him into forgetting his bluster.</p><p>She took a step toward Gabriel and then stopped. She forced a frown while she folded her arms in front of her chest.</p><p>She hoped she looked displeased.</p><p>Gabriel was astonished by her behavior. \u201cJohanna?\u201d</p><p>The uncertainty in his voice made her want to smile. She didn\u2019t dare, of course, because she wanted to soothe his temper, not prod it.</p><p>\u201cYes, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment, m\u2019lord,\u201d she answered in a voice as serene as a sweet summer breeze. \u201cFirst I would like to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the expression \u2018in the nick of time\u2019 mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to smile but glared instead. He knew what she was doing. She thought to make him feel guilty because he hadn\u2019t gotten to her sooner.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let her turn the tables on him. If anyone was going to apologize, by God, it would be his stubborn, ill-disciplined wife.</p><p>He shook his head at her, took another step forward, and then announced, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take you a lifetime to soothe my temper.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to contradict her husband, but she was certain it would only take her a minute or two. She walked forward to stand directly in front of him.</p><p>She clasped her hands together and smiled. She stared up at him with those beautiful, bewitching blue eyes, and Gabriel knew then there wouldn\u2019t be any talk about safety tonight.</p><p>\u201cWill it take you a lifetime to get around to telling your wife you love her?\u201d</p><p>She reached up and gently stroked the side of his face. Her voice was filled with tenderness when she said, \u201cI love you, Gabriel MacBain.\u201d</p><p>His voice shook when he answered with his own pledge. \u201cNot nearly as much as I love you, Johanna MacBain.\u201d</p><p>And then she was in his arms and he was kissing her and hugging her and telling her in broken whispers how much he loved her and how he knew he was damned unworthy of her but it didn\u2019t matter because he would never let her go and how she had become the center of his life.</p><p>He was rambling, but he didn\u2019t care. Some of what he said made sense, most didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t matter to her. She was crying and also rambling with all the loving words she\u2019d kept protected inside her.</p><p>Their kisses became passionate, and when he finally pulled away, she was trembling. He let go of her, but only for a second, then caught hold of her hand and walked out of the hall. She was blushing and kept her head bowed when they passed her brother and her clansmen. Gabriel slowed his pace when he led the way up the steps so Johanna could keep up with him, then threaded his way through the throng of men standing on the balcony until he reached the first chamber. He pulled his wife inside, shut the door, and then reached for her again.</p><p>Clothing became an obstacle. Gabriel didn\u2019t want to quit kissing her long enough to get undressed, and so he tried to do both at the same time.</p><p>They made it to the bed, though just barely, and made love with an intensity that left them both shaken. He was gentle; she was demanding, and each was eventually thoroughly satisfied.</p><p>He stayed inside her a long while afterward. He covered her from head to feet and braced himself on his elbows to keep from crushing her. He kissed her brow, the bridge of her nose, and finally her chin.</p><p>She let out a loud, lusty yawn. Gabriel rolled to his side. He covered her with his plaid and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou should sleep now,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not weak, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in the darkness. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not weak,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re strong and courageous and honorable.\u201d He leaned down to kiss the top of her head before adding, \u201cBut you\u2019re carrying, my love. You must rest for the baby\u2019s sake. Alex and I would be lost without you. You\u2019re the center of our family, Johanna. I\u2019ve known that truth for a long while. I think that is why. I was a bit overprotective. I wanted to keep you under lock and key so nothing would happen to you.\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of laughter in her voice when she responded. \u201cYou let me sew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me again you love me. I like hearing your pledge.\u201d</p><p>She cuddled up against her husband. \u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAlmost from the very beginning. My heart softened toward you the day we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, it didn\u2019t,\u201d he countered. \u201cYou were afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you gave me your promise,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhat promise did I give?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were still frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, just a little,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut then God gave me a sign and I knew everything was going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>He was intrigued. \u201cExplain this sign,\u201d he commanded. \u201cYou\u2019ll laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your name,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard it before the wedding ceremony. Nicholas called you MacBain, and so did your men. But you had to give your true name to the priest, and that is when I knew I was going to be safe.\u201d</p><p>He broke his promise and laughed. She didn\u2019t mind. She waited until he\u2019d finished and then said, \u201cYou were named after the highest of angels,\u201d she explained. \u201cMama taught me to pray to the archangel Gabriel,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd do you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, love. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s the protector of the innocent, the avenger of evil. He watches over women and children and is our own special guardian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is truth and not fanciful thinking, then he didn\u2019t do a very good job of looking out for you,\u201d Gabriel said. He thought about the years she\u2019d endured hardship under Raulf\u2019s control and immediately started to get angry again.</p><p>\u201cOh, but my archangel did protect me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Gabriel demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe gave me you.\u201d</p><p>She stretched up and kissed his chin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you understand or if you think I\u2019m crazed, Gabriel. Just love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, lass. I do. Have you any idea how proud I was when I heard the praise you gave me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean when you were on the balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaulf needed to know the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had no understanding of what true love is,\u201d she added. She leaned up again to smile at her husband. \u201cI know when you realized you loved me,\u201d she boasted. \u201cIt was when you found me in the tree and saw the wolves.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was long before that god-awful incident.\u201d</p><p>She badgered him to explain. \u201cIt was your immediate acceptance of Alex. When he asked you if I had given you a wedding gift, do you remember what you said? I remember every word,\u201d he added before she even had time to nod. \u201cYou said, \u2018He gave me a son.\u2019 And that is when my heart softened toward you. It just took me a little while to realize it.\u201d</p><p>The mention of their son made her frown. \u201cAlex is certainly fretting. I want to go home . . . with you. I don\u2019t want you to go to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cWilliams will give King John my message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will he tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Williams about the scroll I hid in the chapel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His denial surprised her. \u201cBut I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaulfs dead,\u201d Gabriel explained. \u201cThe king doesn\u2019t have any reason to bother us now. If he should decide to send additional troops here for whatever reason, then we\u2019ll mention the damning evidence.\u201d</p><p>Johanna thought about her husband\u2019s explanation a long while before finally coming to the conclusion he was right. The king didn\u2019t need to know she had kept the scroll. \u201cYou want him to think it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill anyone ever know the truth about Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the barons already believe the king was behind the murder,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cEven Nicholas has his own suspicions. He has another reason for turning against his overlord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn betrayed his trust. He gave Nicholas his word he was only sending a messenger and escort, and he assured your brother Raulf would be kept in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will Nicholas do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll join Baron Goode and the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebellion?\u201d</p><p>He could hear the worry in her voice. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut a king without loyal vassals and an army has little power. Nicholas told me the barons plan to force John to make necessary concessions. Do you know why Nicholas gave you to me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled over his choice of words. \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me to you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe was merely matchmaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand what he was telling her. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother. Of course he loves me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was there when you were born and saw you raised, but he told me he left to do the king\u2019s fighting when you were only nine or ten years old. He returned several years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe came back home just a few months before I was wed to Raulf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had become a very beautiful woman,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cAnd Nicholas was suddenly having unbrotherly thoughts about you.\u201d</p><p>She bolted up in the bed. \u201cIs that what the argument was about on our wedding day? You became angry and dragged Nicholas away,\u201d she reminded him.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cWhen I heard his full name, I knew he wasn\u2019t related . . . by blood, and I had already noticed he seemed a bit overly protective for a brother.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe rarely came to see you when you were married to Raulf. He feels tremendous guilt over that slight, for if he hadn\u2019t been so determined to hide his feelings, he would have seen how you were being treated by the bastard.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again. He wasn\u2019t going to argue with her. He pulled her down on top of him and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cHe seems to have gotten over the affliction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was never afflicted,\u201d she countered. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s a married man now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d</p><p>Johanna smiled. Gabriel sounded quite astonished. \u201cYes, Nicholas,\u201d she said. \u201cHe married Clare MacKay. Do quit laughing so I can explain,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019ll be happy together once Clare gets past the fact she\u2019s married to an Englishman.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s laughter echoed around the room. The rumbling in his chest nearly knocked her head off his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI wondered why Laird MacKay joined our fight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only said he was protecting his interests. He never mentioned the marriage. I probably wouldn\u2019t have paid any attention if he had tried to explain. I was fully occupied trying to get to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took you a long while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take me much time at all,\u201d he countered. \u201cI had already turned around and was on my way back home when my men reached me with the news you\u2019d been taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had already turned around? Then you heard about the army, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the MacDonald soldiers told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never heard you or saw you on the balcony, Gabriel. You and your men were as sneaky as thieves,\u201d she praised.</p><p>\u201cWe are thieves,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d she corrected. \u201cYou aren\u2019t any longer. The father of my children doesn\u2019t steal. He barters for what he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have everything I could ever want,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJohanna . . . those things you said about me . . . to hear you say . . . to know you believed . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not any good at putting into words how I feel,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou told me you loved me. I don\u2019t need or want anything more. You please me just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>Johanna closed her eyes and let out a loud sigh of contentment.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t ever going to take needless chances in future,\u201d he told her. \u201cDo you have any idea of the worry you caused me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel guessed she didn\u2019t. He waited a full minute for her to answer his question before he realized she had fallen asleep.</p><p>He left the chamber a few minutes later to give his appreciation to Laird Gillevrey for his hospitality. The English army had scattered like mice down the hills under the watchful eyes of Gabriel\u2019s allies from the north. The Highlanders outnumbered the enemy by three to one now and made their presence felt. Baron Williams would have been a fool to consider attacking; and although Gabriel was certain he would run back to John, he still wasn\u2019t taking any chances. He doubled the number of guards needed along the perimeter of the holding and insisted his allies stay for as long as Johanna was inside the keep.</p><p>Johanna slept for twelve straight hours. She was fully recovered from her ordeal the following morning and was anxious to go home. Yet just as they were about to take their leave, she insisted upon returning to the great hall. Gabriel wasn\u2019t about to let her out of his sight. He followed her back inside and stood guard at the entrance.</p><p>His wife took hold of one of the servants and tugged her along to stand in front of the laird.</p><p>\u201cI cannot leave before telling you what a fine, courageous woman Lucy is,\u201d Johanna began. \u201cYou have none more loyal than this woman, Laird Gillevrey,\u201d she added.</p><p>She spent a good five minutes praising the servant, and when she was finished, the laird stood up and smiled at Lucy. \u201cYou will be richly rewarded,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Johanna was satisfied she had done her duty. She bowed to the laird, thanked Lucy once again for her help and her comfort, and then turned to leave. She stopped just as suddenly.</p><p>Bishop Hallwick captured her full attention. He stood in the center of the doorway on the other side of the hall. He was staring at her. She looked at his face for no more than a second or two, but that was long enough for her to see his expression. It was filled with loathing and disdain.</p><p>He was wearing cardinal red robes. Johanna wondered if he decided to increase his status overnight. His satchels were near his feet. Two Gillevrey soldiers stood behind him. Johanna assumed they were going to escort the bishop home.</p><p>The sight of him made her skin crawl. She would have left the hall without acknowledging the unholy man; but as she turned, she noticed the long narrow rod protruding from one of his satchels and she knew she couldn\u2019t leave without taking care of one last important duty.</p><p>She slowly walked over to the bishop. Her gaze was directed on the object of her anger. Before Hallwick could think to stop her, Johanna snatched the punishment stick and moved back until she was standing directly in front of him.</p><p>Hallwick took a step back. He tried to leave, but the Gillevrey soldiers blocked his exit.</p><p>Johanna slowly lifted the stick up in front of Hallwick\u2019s eyes. The hatred in his expression turned to fear.</p><p>She stood there a full minute without saying a word. She stared at the stick she held up. Hallwick stared at her. The hall became silent with expectation. Some might have thought she was about to strike the bishop. Gabriel knew better. He had followed her over to the old man and now stood just a foot or two behind her.</p><p>Johanna suddenly changed her hold on the stick. She grasped one end with her left hand and took hold of the other end with her right hand. And then she held the weapon up in front of the bishop again. Her grip was as fierce as her determination. Her hands ached from the strain of trying to break the stick in half.</p><p>The wood was too thick, too new. Johanna wouldn\u2019t give up. If it took her all day to destroy the rod, so be it. Her arms shook as she applied every bit of strength she possessed.</p><p>And then she suddenly had the strength of twenty. Gabriel reached over her shoulders and placed his hands on top of hers. He waited for permission. She nodded.</p><p>The punishment rod snapped in half. The crack was like an explosion of thunder in the silent hall. Gabriel let go and moved back. Johanna continued to hold the broken weapon for another few seconds, then threw the two ends at the bishop\u2019s feet. She turned around, took hold of her husband\u2019s hand, and walked by his side out of the hall.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Evening was Gabriel\u2019s favorite time of day. He liked to linger at the table to discuss the day\u2019s events and to plan tomorrow\u2019s duties with his soldiers. He never really listened to the men\u2019s suggestions or remarks, however. He pretended to, of course, but all the while he watched Johanna.</p><p>Nicholas and Clare had left for England over three months ago. Clare hadn\u2019t wanted to leave the Highlands, and it took Nicholas time and patience to coax her into going.</p><p>One relative had left, but another was on her way. Johanna\u2019s mother was expected to arrive tomorrow or the day after. As soon as word arrived she was on her way, Gabriel had sent an escort to wait at the border of his land for her.</p><p>In two weeks time he would leave to attend his first council meeting with the other lairds. He wouldn\u2019t be gone long, because Johanna was expected to deliver their babe in about a month\u2019s time.</p><p>Auggie and Keith had stolen the noser from the Kirkcaldy clan. Laird Gillevrey had mentioned the man and had made the comment he was the best noser in all of the Highlands. Auggie kept the noser locked up for a good long while once he\u2019d selected the finest of the brew for them. The noser was named Giddy. and he was harmless enough. After a month or two of boredom, Auggie took mercy on him and let him try his hand at the game of striking the stones. Within a week, Giddy caught the fever. Now there were two fanatics digging holes all over the courtyard, the meadow, and the valley below, and Gabriel had the suspicion that, once the barrels had been traded and Giddy could go home, he probably wouldn\u2019t leave. He and Auggie had become fast friends; and when they weren\u2019t striking stones, they were dragging copper kettles to Auggie\u2019s cottage to convert into a more effective brewing apparatus.</p><p>Johanna sat by the fire every night and worked on her tapestry. Dumfries waited until she was settled in her chair and then draped himself across her feet. It became a ritual for Alex to squeeze himself up next to her and fall asleep during her stories about fierce warriors and fair maidens. Johanna\u2019s tales all had a unique twist, for none of the heroines she told stories about ever needed to be rescued by their knights in shining armor. More often than not, the fair maidens rescued their knights.</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t take issue with his wife. She was telling Alex the truth. It was a fact that maidens could rescue mighty, arrogant warriors. Johanna had certainly rescued him from a bleak, cold existence. She\u2019d given him a family and a home. She was his love, his joy, his companion.</p><p>She was his saving grace.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>England, 1210</p><p>The chamber was stale and musty with the scent of dying flesh. The room was filled with priests and students who surrounded the bed on all sides. They held candles up and chanted prayers over their esteemed bishop.</p><p>Hallwick was dying. His breath was shallow and uneven. He didn\u2019t have enough strength to open his eyes. Across the room was a round table covered with coins the priests had collected from the congregation to pay for indulgences for their bishop. They thought to buy his way into heaven, and the gold would be given to the church as assurance that any past sins the holy man might have inadvertently committed would be forgiven.</p><p>Hallwick had never tried to hide his hatred and his disgust for women. Yet the priests he\u2019d trained didn\u2019t believe those views were sinful. They accepted as fact each and every dictate the bishop gave them and were determined to preach his beliefs to their own subjects so that Bishop Hallwick\u2019s good word would be carried down through the generations.</p><p>Yet in death the bishop contradicted himself. He died crying his mother\u2019s name. </p> </body></html>"]
