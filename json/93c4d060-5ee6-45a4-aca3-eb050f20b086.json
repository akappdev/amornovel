A single rower sliced through the channel like an arrow shooting out to sea, and I couldn\u2019t help but stare after him, more than a little jealous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Isn\u2019t it, Cammie?\u201d I heard my mother ask. She slipped her arm around my waist. It felt sure. Safe.</p><p>But all I could do was muster a nod and add a not-very-enthusiastic \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have an interest in rowing?\u201d asked the man in the tweed cap and brown trench coat who was accompanying us. He looked like an ad for London Fog. Either that or a Sherlock Holmes impersonator. Or a bigwig British academic. And, of course, I knew that last one was right on.</p><p>\u201cCam, Dr. Holt asked you something.\u201d Mom nudged me.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. Sure. Rowing looks...fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you row at your school now?\u201d</p><p>He sounded interested. He looked interested. But I\u2019ve been trained to hear what people don\u2019t say\u2014to see the things that are better kept hidden\u2014so I knew that Dr. Holt was simply trying his best to be nice.</p> <p>\u201cNo. We do...other things,\u201d I told him, and reminded myself that it wasn\u2019t a lie. I didn\u2019t, however, feel the need to add that by other things I meant learning how to kill a man with uncooked spaghetti and disarm nuclear bombs with Tootsie Rolls. (Not that I\u2019d done either of those things yet. But I still had one semester left at the Gallagher Academy.)</p><p>\u201cWell\u201d\u2014he pushed his horn-rimmed glasses up on his nose\u2014\u201cCambridge is a very well-rounded university. Whatever activities you enjoy, I\u2019m sure we have them here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I highly doubt it, I thought, just as my mom said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you do.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Holt turned up a path, and my mother and I followed. The long lawns were green, even in winter. But the sky overhead was gray, threatening rain. I shivered inside my down jacket. I wasn\u2019t as thin as I had been at the start of my senior year, but I was still a little underweight. Despite the fact that Grandma Morgan had spent the better part of Christmas break force-feeding me various things covered with gravy, my coat felt too big. My shoulders felt too small. And I remembered with a pang what had happened to me the previous summer\u2014that even Gallagher Girls aren\u2019t always as strong as they need to be.</p><p>\u201cCammie?\u201d Dr. Holt asked, pulling me back to the moment. \u201cI said, what other schools are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOxford, Yale, Cornell, and Stanford,\u201d I said, rattling off the universities that Liz had put on my hypothetical short list, answering the question I\u2019d only half-heard.</p> <p>\u201cThose are all excellent schools. I\u2019m sure that if your test scores are any indication, you will have your pick.\u201d</p><p>He patted my back, and I tried to see what he was seeing. An average-looking, average-sounding American teenage girl. My hair was in a ponytail, and my shoes were scuffed. I had a zit coming in like gangbusters on my chin and a couple of scars at my hairline, which had forced a recent experiment with bangs that hadn\u2019t turned out so well.</p><p>There was absolutely no way for Dr. Holt to know what I\u2019d done over my summer vacation; but there are some scars that even bangs can\u2019t cover, and they were still there. I could feel them. And I couldn\u2019t tell Dr. Holt the truth\u2014that I was a perfectly normal senior at the world\u2019s foremost school for spies.</p><p>\u201cAnd this, Cammie, is Crawley Hall. What do you think of it?\u201d</p><p>I turned to study the big stone building. It was beautiful. Old. Regal. But I\u2019d been living in an old, regal building since I was twelve, so I couldn\u2019t muster the enthusiasm Dr. Holt was probably hoping for.</p><p>\u201cOur economics department is world renowned. Do I understand correctly that you are interested in economics?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go in?\u201d Mom asked. \u201cTake a look around?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dr. Holt pushed his glasses up again. \u201cThe university is closed for our winter break. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re already making something of an exception.\u201d</p><p>My mother reached out and touched him gently on the arm. \u201cAnd I am so grateful to you for working us in like this. As you know, we\u2019re only in the UK for a couple of days, and Cammie has so been looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Holt looked at me. I tried and failed to mimic my mother\u2019s smile as Dr. Holt walked on.</p><p>\u201cAnd here we have the library. Some might say it\u2019s the jewel in our campus crown,\u201d Holt added. \u201cWe have the finest collection of rare books in the world. First editions by Austen and Dickens\u2014we even have a Gutenberg Bible.\u201d</p><p>He puffed out his chest, but all I could say was \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, up this path you will find\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Dr. Holt?\u201d My mom cut him off. \u201cDo you think it would be okay if Cammie looked around on her own? I know classes aren\u2019t in session, but maybe that would help her to get a feel for the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d my mother asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. Of course.\u201d Dr. Holt looked at me. \u201cWhat do you say, Cammie? Meet us back at the quad in an hour or so?\u201d</p><p>Something seemed so strange about that moment. For months, there had always been someone by my side. My mother. My roommates. My (and I don\u2019t use this word lightly) boyfriend. Someone was always there, watching out for me. Or just watching me. It felt more than a little strange for my mother to nod her head and say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kiddo. Go on. I\u2019ll be here when you get back.\u201d</p><p>So I stepped away, reminding myself that when you\u2019re a spy, sometimes all you can do is go on. One foot in front of the other, wherever the narrow path might lead.</p><p>Before I turned the corner, I heard Dr. Holt say, \u201cWhat a...charming girl.\u201d</p><p>My mother sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s had a hard year.\u201d</p><p>But Mom didn\u2019t try to explain. I mean, how do you tell someone, Oh yes, my daughter used to be a real sweetheart, but that was before all the torture? So she didn\u2019t say a thing, which was just as well. Dr. Holt didn\u2019t have the clearance to hear it anyway.</p><p>I walked by myself around the corner of the grand old building. There was an arbor covered with ivy. A statue of someone whose name I didn\u2019t know. The air was moist and cool around me. I felt alone as I walked between two buildings and found myself staring down at the river again. Another single rower slid across the water, looking backward, moving forward. It seemed to go against all logic, but the man kept pushing on against the current, and I wondered how he made it appear so easy.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here.\u201d</p><p>The voice cut through my train of thought, but I didn\u2019t startle; I turned.</p><p>\u201cSo did you get it?\u201d my best friend, Bex, asked. Her British accent was even thicker in her native land, and her smile was especially mischievous when she crossed her long arms. The wind blew her black hair away from her face. She looked alive and eager, so I held up the key card I had slipped out of Dr. Holt\u2019s pocket.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She looped her arm through mine. \u201cCammie, my dear, I was born ready,\u201d she said, and then she walked up to Crawley Hall and swiped.</p><p>When the light flashed green she said, \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Crawley Hall seemed empty as Bex and I closed its doors behind us. Our footsteps echoed in the corridor. We passed heavy wooden arches and stained glass windows. It felt more like a museum than a school, and not for the first time in my life I walked down the hallowed halls of education, totally breaking the rules.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think, Cam? Are you a Cambridge girl? Or do you fancy yourself as more Oxonian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOxonian?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a word. Now, answer the question.\u201d Bex shrugged and leaned against a door that was unlike the others we had passed\u2014not heavy wood, but steel. Security cameras were trained on it, and it took Bex a second to finagle her way inside.</p><p>\u201cCambridge is nice. It could use better locks, though,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo, no Cambridge.\u201d Bex nodded. \u201cHow about Yale? Or you could always join me at MI6. The two of us together, out in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bex asked. She put her hands on her hips and squinted at me. \u201cIt\u2019s winter break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re seniors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said again.</p><p>\u201cSo aren\u2019t you...curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout life. Out there. Life!\u201d she said again. \u201cTell me, Cameron Ann Morgan, what do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d reached another door, and I stopped, looked up at the camera that monitored the entrance, and whispered, \u201cAlive.\u201d</p><p>Thirty seconds later we were standing in the entrance hall of the largest library I had ever seen. Old oak tables filled the center of the room. Bookshelves thirty feet high stretched along every wall. First editions of Thackeray and Forster sat behind protective glass, and Bex and I walked alone through the empty room like a pair of extremely literate thieves.</p><p>We climbed the stairs and started through a maze of shelves and small alcoves, perfect for studying.</p><p>\u201cWe should have brought Liz,\u201d I said, thinking about how our smallest, smartest, and...well...nerdiest roommate would have loved it there; but when Bex came to an abrupt stop, I remembered why Liz wasn\u2019t allowed on that particular type of field trip.</p><p>I peered around Bex\u2019s shoulder in time to see a shadow move across the floor. The lights were off and the corridor was still, yet a figure cut through the light that streamed through the stained glass windows, like a puppet in a show that only we were supposed to see.</p><p>I heard a door open and close, and slowly Bex and I eased out onto the landing and padded softly down a narrow hallway to where a door stood slightly ajar.</p><p>We paused for a moment, and Bex mouthed the words You sure?</p><p>But I didn\u2019t answer. I\u2019d come too far\u2014I wanted this too much. So I didn\u2019t hesitate. I just pushed open the door and walked into the room, my pulse quick and my hands steady, ready for whatever I might find.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d the man cried. \u201cWho are you? What are you doing here? I\u2019m calling security.\u201d He spoke rapid-fire, barely breathing in between demands, certainly not giving us enough time to answer.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands up. Up! Put them up,\u201d he shouted, even though he didn\u2019t hold a weapon. His hair was overgrown and gray. He wore a dirty, wrinkled suit and looked like he hadn\u2019t showered in days.</p><p>\u201cMr. Knight?\u201d Bex asked. She inched closer. \u201cSir Walter Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis area is restricted,\u201d he shouted again. \u201cThe campus is closed. You aren\u2019t supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be a lot of things,\u201d I said. \u201cMy name is Cammie Morgan.\u201d As soon as I said the words, a shadow crossed his face. It was like he was staring at a ghost.</p><p>Me.</p><p>He was staring at me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t supposed to be alive. But I was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any bodyguards, I see,\u201d Bex said, looking around the room. It was an office, not very big\u2014just large enough for an old desk, a chair, and a short leather sofa that rested beneath the only window. There were a rumpled pillow and blanket, and the trash can overflowed with take-out containers and week-old newspapers.</p><p>\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d Bex added. \u201cYou\u2019re not sure who you can trust, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I said. When I noticed that he was shaking, I added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Bex laughed. \u201cHe could be a little afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Bex sidled closer, and Walter Knight backed away until he was pressed into his desk and couldn\u2019t move any more.</p><p>When Bex spoke again, her voice was so low it was almost a whisper. \u201cElias Crane the sixth is dead, Sir Walter. You probably heard about his car accident.\u201d Bex made little quote marks above her head, emphasizing the word. \u201cOh, I bet that drove you crazy, wondering if it really was an accident. I mean, it\u2019s possible he\u2019d just had too much to drink when he drove his BMW off that cliff. But when Charlene Dubois went missing while driving her kids to school...\u201d Bex let the words draw out. She made a tsk tsk tsk sound. \u201cThat you couldn\u2019t chalk up to coincidence. So you went on the run.\u201d She threw her arms out wide in the small space. \u201cAnd you came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Sir Walter shouted, but Bex just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Why else would you be sleeping on the couch in an office that\u2019s supposed to be abandoned, instead of at your London flat? Or your French villa? Or even your Swiss chalet? I have to say, this was a pretty smart decision. Squatting in a library. Clever. I bet a lot of people don\u2019t even know that Cambridge sees it as a feather in their cap for a former British prime minister to have an honorary office here. It\u2019s nice. It took us a while to track you down. But we did track you down, of course. And we won\u2019t be the only ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first rule of running, Sir Walter,\u201d I told him. \u201cNever go anyplace familiar.\u201d</p> <p>He was shaking his head and saying, \u201cNo. No. You have the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou are Walter Knight, son of Avery Knight, great-great-great grandson of Thomas Avery McKnight. Tell me, did your great-grandfather change the family name because it made it easier for an Irish boy to rise to power in the British government at the turn of the century? Or was it because of the Circle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your great-great-great grandfather\u2019s name on a list once.\u201d I put my hand in my pocket and felt the piece of paper that I kept there, while the image flashed through my mind. That list had been buried in my subconscious for years, but once I\u2019d remembered it, I hadn\u2019t been able to forget it. The names written there were going to haunt me until the descendants of every last one of those men was collected and accounted for. \u201cIt was a list of very angry\u2014very powerful\u2014men. Now their descendants are very powerful people. And, as you know, Sir Walter, somebody wants you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d he snapped, and pointed toward the door. \u201cGet out now. Before I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you what?\u201d Bex grabbed him by the collar.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be safe here,\u201d I said, and watched the words land, the realization sweeping him off his feet. He walked to the window and sank onto the couch, pushing aside the pillow and blanket.</p><p>\u201cDoes the CIA know you\u2019re here?\u201d Sir Walter asked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me they\u2019re sending little girls to do their dirty work these days.\u201d</p><p>Sure, I should have felt insulted. After all, this man and the goons who worked for him had been trying to kill me for months. And failing. If anyone knew not to underestimate a Gallagher Girl, it should have been this guy. But in my professional opinion, guys almost always underestimate girls. And honestly, we Gallagher Girls wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>His gaze shifted quickly from Bex to me. He looked between us as if expecting one of us to teleport out of there and come back with reinforcements.</p><p>\u201cYour former...associate...Catherine Goode. She killed Crane. You know that, right?\u201d I asked, but he said nothing. \u201cAnd Charlene Dubois didn\u2019t just go for a drive and forget to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlene...is she dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Probably. But you know Catherine better than we do, so tell me\u2014why do you think she is picking off the leaders of the Circle of Cavan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crazy,\u201d the man said with a scowl, and I knew from experience he was right. \u201cShe hates us. She wants to control things, and what she can\u2019t control she destroys.\u201d</p> <p>I thought about Catherine Goode\u2019s son. She hadn\u2019t been able to control him. Did that mean she was bound to someday destroy him too?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming for you, Sir Walter.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t be as nice as we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the Circle of Cavan,\u201d the man spat.</p><p>Bex shook her head slowly. \u201cWrong answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d This time, he shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not a part of that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the Boy Scouts,\u201d I told him. \u201cThey don\u2019t let you walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished. And...and...this is your fault.\u201d He pointed in my direction. \u201cYou should have had the decency to die when we needed you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been going through a bit of a rebellious streak. I swear it\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here to kidnap me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou say kidnap. We say hold in a secure facility until it\u2019s safe to turn you over to the proper authorities,\u201d Bex replied with a grin. \u201cBut to each his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we found you, Sir Walter, then it\u2019s just a matter of time before Catherine does too,\u201d I told him. \u201cNow, come on. Let us keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>I reached for his arm, but he jerked away.</p><p>\u201cNo place is safe. You don\u2019t understand. Look at you. How could you understand? You\u2019re children. If you knew what the others want to do...what the Inner Circle is planning...I never wanted this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Bex asked. \u201cWhat are they planning?\u201d</p><p>Knight shook his head. His lips actually quivered when he told us, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seemed afraid when he first saw us, when he spoke about Catherine and the people she had killed. But in that moment, his fear turned to terror. He rocked back and forth, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t stop it. No one can stop it. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Bex shouted, gripping him by the shoulders, holding him still. \u201cTell us what you\u2019re talking about, and we\u2019ll stop it\u2014whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fools.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s already begun.\u201d</p><p>Bex looked at me. We\u2019d come there with one simple mission: to find Thomas McKnight\u2019s descendant and take him into custody. We hadn\u2019t been counting on this. If the leaders of the Circle\u2014the Inner Circle, as Knight had called them\u2014were planning something, then that could very well change everything.</p><p>There was a new urgency in her voice when Bex said, \u201cLook, we\u2019re asking nicely. When Catherine comes\u2014she won\u2019t ask at all. So come with us now. Please.\u201d</p><p>The man snarled, \u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>Irony is a funny thing. Maybe the room was bugged and someone heard the cocky, condescending tone of his voice. Or maybe it was just fate that made the sniper pick that moment to fire. But I guess we\u2019ll never know.</p><p>Suddenly, glass shattered, showering the room in glistening, falling shards. Bex and I dove behind the desk just as the rifle fired again. I heard the hiss of the bullet, saw the dark spot that grew on Sir Walter\u2019s chest, and watched him fall hard onto his knees.</p><p>He was still upright, though, as I scrambled toward him.</p><p>\u201cSir Walter!\u201d I yelled. He was one of the people who had sent a hit man on my trail, wished me and the list inside my head out of existence. But I didn\u2019t feel any peace. Whatever ghosts had followed me to that room, they wouldn\u2019t be satisfied just to watch him die.</p><p>\u201cSir Walter!\u201d I yelled again. A drop of blood ran from his lips. As the life drained out of him, he toppled over onto the floor, never to defy us\u2014or anyone\u2014again.</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d I heard Bex call my name. She had a death grip on my arm and was dragging me to my feet. But I couldn\u2019t move. I was frozen, staring through the shattered window at the woman who stood atop the building across the lawn, picking up a grenade launcher and pointing it in our direction.</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d I said.</p><p>And then my boyfriend\u2019s mother took aim at our window again. And fired.</p><p>Glass crunched beneath my feet.</p><p>Blood ran into my eyes.</p><p>The grenade must have struck a gas line, because smoke swirled all around me and I could feel the heat of the explosion at my back. But Bex\u2019s hand was still in mine, and the two of us stayed low, crouching beneath the black air, running down the hall, away from the body and the flames.</p><p>When we reached the end of the hall, I looked out the window and saw Zach\u2019s mother running across the lawn. She must have sensed me there, because she stopped and turned, raised her hand and waved, almost like she\u2019d been expecting me, hoping to see me.</p><p>And then she was running again, and I knew I had to find her, make her pay\u2014that as long as she was out there, a part of me would never, ever heal.</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d Bex yelled as sirens started to sound.</p><p>Classes might not have been in session, but it was still one of the most prestigious places in all of England. There were smoke detectors and glass-break detectors, and someone was going to come looking for whoever had done this thing, and we needed to be far away when they did.</p><p>\u201cCam, come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d I yelled, trying to break free.</p><p>Bex held tightly to my hand\u2014didn\u2019t let me go. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>I\u2019ve been to Bex\u2019s home before. She is my best friend, after all. But when your best friend is the daughter of two superspies, then that pretty much means your best friend moves. A lot. So walking inside the Baxter flat, I couldn\u2019t help myself. I looked around. New rooms. New walls. Same feeling.</p><p>Even though every spy I knew (which was a lot of spies) had spent the past few weeks telling me I was safe\u2014that as soon as I remembered the names on the list, there was no reason for the Circle to try to silence me\u2014it was still kind of weird to walk inside the Baxters\u2019 flat and have no one clear the rooms and pull the draperies tight over the windows. Instead, Bex\u2019s mother hugged me. Her father kissed my cheek. They asked my mom about Sir Walter Knight and told us everything everyone at MI6 was saying about the explosion at one of the most famous universities in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But no one was worried about me. Or...well...no one was worried until I asked, \u201cSo what do we do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, girls,\u201d Mr. Baxter started, \u201cI thought you knew that today was an exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnight is dead,\u201d Bex said. \u201cCrane is dead. Dubois is missing. Along with her two kids,\u201d Bex added pointedly. \u201cSo I think Cam has a good point: What do we do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go back to school,\u201d my mom said, taking over. \u201cWe go back and leave it to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo who?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d her mother snapped.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Bex shrugged. \u201cTo whom,\u201d she corrected herself, even though I highly doubted that had been her mother\u2019s point.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear Knight.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t just spooked. And it wasn\u2019t just Catherine. Whatever the Inner Circle is planning, it\u2019s so big and awful that even he was terrified of it. And this coming from a man who has been a member of the Circle most of his life.\u201d</p><p>That was when I pulled the crumpled piece of paper from my pocket. It was in Liz\u2019s handwriting. Tiny pieces of paper clung to the left-hand side of the sheet from where she\u2019d ripped it out of a spiral-bound notebook just a few weeks before. I\u2019d folded it in quarters and put it in my pocket, and it had stayed there ever since, never leaving my side, always within reach.</p> <p>The paper had grown soft and worn, and even though I knew every word by heart, I kept it. Part of me thought I might keep it forever. Part of me couldn\u2019t wait to watch it burn.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, slamming the paper down on the table where the adults could see. \u201cSeven names. Seven,\u201d I practically shouted. In spite of everything, I still felt like I had to make them understand.</p><p>I looked down at Liz\u2019s feminine cursive, at the names I\u2019d carried in my subconscious for years.</p><p>Elias Crane</p><p>Charles Dubois</p><p>Thomas McKnight</p> <p>Philip Delauhunt</p><p>William Smith</p><p>Gideon Maxwell</p><p>Samuel P. Winters</p><p>\u201cThese men formed the Circle with Iosef Cavan in 1863,\u201d I told them.</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d my mother said, but I continued as though she hadn\u2019t spoken at all.</p><p>\u201cThese men survived him. And then their kids took up the family business. And then their grandkids. And so on. And so on. And now... Now Elias Crane the sixth is dead.\u201d I took a marker and drew a line through the name Elias Crane at the top of the list.</p><p>\u201cDubois\u2019s great-great-great-great granddaughter is probably dead,\u201d Bex added, and I drew another line.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now McKnight\u2019s heir is gone too,\u201d I finished with one more line.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found three heirs, girls,\u201d Mr. Baxter told us. \u201cThree is a good start.\u201d</p><p>I knew what Mr. Baxter was saying. The men and women represented on that list weren\u2019t good people. They\u2019d sold arms to extremists and assassinated world leaders\u2014terror for profit was what Agent Townsend always called it. And I hated them. I hated them more than almost anyone on earth. But there was one person I despised more.</p><p>I thought about the woman on the rooftop. She had kidnapped me\u2014tortured me\u2014to get those names, and now she was killing them off one by one, eliminating the competition in the most hostile takeover possible. And I knew that if Catherine wanted the leaders of the Circle dead, then maybe we needed at least one of them to be taken alive.</p><p>\u201cThree of them are dead,\u201d I said, drawing in a deep, slow breath. \u201cBut we still have four more names. Now we have to find the descendants of these men. We have to find them and stop them before they can do whatever it is they\u2019re planning next. Because, according to Knight, it is something bad and it is something big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not for you to worry about, girls,\u201d Mrs. Baxter said, and Bex threw her hands into the air.</p><p>\u201cSo who is going to worry about it? MI6? The CIA?\u201d</p><p>We all looked at my mother, who put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Bex said, as if my mother had just proven her point. \u201cThe Circle has moles at every level of the CIA. MI6 too. And Interpol. Who knows where else? And that is why you need us,\u201d Bex finished, but her father was already shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThis was a one-time deal, girls,\u201d Mr. Baxter told us. \u201cSir Walter Knight was a politician. An intellectual. A...nerd. He didn\u2019t pose a physical threat, and for that reason and that reason alone you were allowed to come along today. That will not be the case for the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t do this on your own,\u201d Bex protested. \u201cThere\u2019s too much legwork. You need us.\u201d</p><p>Bex\u2019s mother folded her hands in front of her. \u201cNo. Actually, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I thought about the locked door of my mother\u2019s office, the parade of agents and assets who had been in and out of our school in the weeks before Christmas. The task of taking down the Circle was a mission so secret that only my mother and my teachers and their most trusted friends were invited to the party. Bex and I should have known that we wouldn\u2019t be allowed to stay.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Solomon?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat about Zach? They\u2019ve been tracking his mom, haven\u2019t they? Do they even know Catherine was here today? Have you talked to them? Are they okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie,\u201d Mom said, \u201cJoe Solomon is the last person in the world you need to worry about. And Zach is with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Agent Townsend? Someone has to bring him into the loop. And Aunt Abby. She and Townsend are together, right?\u201d I looked at Bex\u2019s parents. \u201cHave you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d my mom said, louder this time, cutting me off. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. The two of you are already in this far deeper than you should be. And this is as deep as you go. For your own good.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Baxter walked smoothly through the room and placed her hand on her daughter\u2019s back. \u201cBex, why don\u2019t you and Cam go for a walk? Have some fun.\u201d</p><p>We both turned and looked out the window at the people on the street. I wasn\u2019t sure what was stranger\u2014that three parents were asking their teen daughters to leave the house on New Year\u2019s Eve, or that Bex and I totally didn\u2019t want to go.</p><p>\u201cThey do a great light show at the Thames,\u201d Mr. Baxter said. \u201cYou can see it better from the park.\u201d</p><p>But Bex and I had both witnessed our fair share of explosions for that day. We didn\u2019t need to see any more.</p><p>\u201cWe know where we can find another heir,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Cammie.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice was a warning.</p><p>\u201cWe know that Samuel Winters\u2019s great-great-great-great grandson shares his name and is the US ambassador to Italy. He\u2019s probably at the embassy in Rome right now,\u201d I went on. \u201cAnd Preston is with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls, we are not going over this again. The ambassador is a hard target. He\u2019ll be safe in the embassy. And that means Preston will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlene Dubois\u2019s kids weren\u2019t safe,\u201d I said, and thought about the first time I had met Preston Winters. He\u2019d had an easy grin that had made him seem a little too eager. His arms were growing too quickly for the rest of him to catch up. He\u2019d been a dork. He was my friend. And now there were people in the world who wanted to kill his father\u2014maybe even Preston himself. People don\u2019t get to choose their families. Or their family businesses. Bex and I knew that better than anyone. And I couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful that at least my family business was working for the good guys. Preston wasn\u2019t that lucky.</p><p>\u201cAre Zach and Mr. Solomon in Rome?\u201d Bex asked this time, taking the lead. \u201cBecause someone needs to be in Rome. Someone needs to get Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I know Joe Solomon,\u201d Mr. Baxter said, sounding sage and wise, \u201cthen I know that he is wherever he needs to be. Where that is, however, I\u2019m not certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing,\u201d my mom said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Preston is fine, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out there!\u201d I snapped. My voice cracked, and I hated myself for it, but I talked on. \u201cCatherine is out there, and she\u2019s hunting the same people we\u2019re hunting, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is why you are going back to school!\u201d I don\u2019t know if my mother even realized she was yelling, but the words were out and echoing around the small room. \u201cYou are going to go back to school, and you are going to have one semester where no one is shooting at you and chasing you and... We are going to have one semester when I don\u2019t spend every waking moment wondering whether or not my daughter is going to live to see graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seniors,\u201d I said. \u201cI turn eighteen next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen act like it,\u201d Mom told me. The words hit me like a slap. As far as our parents were concerned, it was over. There was no argument Bex or I could make. We were beaten.</p><p>\u201cGo watch the fireworks, girls.\u201d Bex\u2019s mom put her arm on my shoulders. \u201cGo be young. Have fun. Enjoy the night.\u201d</p><p>Covert Operations Report</p><p>Operatives Baxter and Morgan were temporarily exiled from the London safe house at 2300 hours and told to go have fun. The Operatives, however, were currently unfamiliar with the protocol for \u201cfun-having,\u201d so they decided to worry about their mission objectives instead.</p><p>The people on the street wore funny hats and sang songs I didn\u2019t know while they walked toward Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, parties, and pubs. But neither Bex nor I even smiled. She draped her arm through mine, and, as we walked, I was sure she probably looked chic and cool and European. I felt slow and clumsy and American.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bex said, \u201chow did you enjoy your first collegiate experience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d I said, \u201cit didn\u2019t seem all that different from my high school experiences.\u201d</p><p>Bex sighed. \u201cI know what you mean. If I ever reach the point in life where there are no more snipers, I might go crazy. Or bake. I could take up baking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz took up baking,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019d be better at it. I would totally rock baking.\u201d</p><p>But something told me she would vastly prefer the snipers.</p><p>The crowds were growing heavier. We passed middle-aged women in feather boas, college boys with their collars turned up. I felt like disappearing, there on that crowded street. And yet, I also felt like the most conspicuous girl in the world.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cam,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fourth time you\u2019ve checked our tail in the past ninety seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it too,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. Because I\u2019m trained that way. Not because I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the year you\u2019ve had, you\u2019re either afraid or you\u2019re crazy,\u201d Bex said, and I thought about Dr. Steve\u2014wondered exactly how many games he\u2019d played with my head\u2014just as my best friend added, \u201cAnd you\u2019re not crazy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bex gave me a smile that looked exactly like her mother\u2019s. Her words had sounded just like her father\u2019s. I\u2019d never known anyone who was equal parts their mom and their dad. But maybe I was wrong. Maybe I was exactly fifty percent my father too. But my father was gone. Dead. And now I\u2019d never know.</p><p>\u201cTell me again,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe Circle leaders\u2014or the Inner Circle,\u201d Bex added with a wink, \u201cwanted you dead so that you couldn\u2019t tell your boyfriend\u2019s psychotic mother...and my mother...and your mother...who founded the Circle back in the day. Without that list, no one would have ever known who the Inner Circle is. But you did remember, my brilliant friend. You remembered who was on that list, and now we all know who was on that list, and so the Inner Circle no longer needs you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said with a nod.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, they\u2019d probably still kill you, you know? Out of spite. But there\u2019s not a price on your head anymore, Cam. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, thought about the other fear I couldn\u2019t shake. \u201cIs Preston safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents think so. And my parents have a very annoying habit of being right,\u201d Bex said; but I just studied my best friend and maybe the most naturally gifted spy I\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Preston is probably safe for now. But he won\u2019t be forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. And I just keep thinking...\u201d I let the words trail off.</p><p>\u201cAbout Knight?\u201d Bex guessed. She took a heavy breath. \u201cMe too. Fancy a guess at what he was talking about? If the leadership of the Circle is planning something so big and awful that even blokes like Knight are scared...then I\u2019m terrified.\u201d</p><p>Bex is the bravest person I know. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that. It is the honest truth. And I know a lot of seriously brave people. But right then Bex shivered a little\u2014a whole body shake, like her spine was tingling. Like someone had just walked over her grave.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out eventually,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Neither of us said what we were thinking: that finding out was the part that scared us.</p> <p>Then she turned to face me. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to win this thing, Cam. We are going to find the other descendants of the people on that list and take them down. And we\u2019re going to find and stop Zach\u2019s mom. We\u2019ll do it, and...\u201d But my best friend trailed off. \u201cOne more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year.\u201d</p><p>Just then horns began to honk. Lights flickered. There was a blast, and purple hues streaked across the sky, shining down on the city of London. It had been a year since I\u2019d seen Zach there, since Mr. Solomon had been on the run and my world had been turned upside down. I looked up at the fireworks that filled the sky. It was exactly the kind of moment when Zach liked to show up, say something cryptic, and kiss me.</p><p>I half-expected him to appear through the crowd, crawl out of the river in a wet suit, rappel out of a black helicopter.</p><p>But no kiss came.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Bex,\u201d I told my best friend, then turned and checked my tail, knowing there was no such thing as a fresh start, totally unsure whether or not this new year would be exactly like my last.</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>PROS AND CONS OF RETURNING TO THE GALLAGHER ACADEMY AFTER ALMOST A FULL MONTH AWAY:</p><p>PRO: Laundry. Sure, Grandma Morgan is an expert ironer, but the Gallagher Academy has this lavender-scented detergent that is maybe the most awesome-smelling stuff ever.</p><p>CON: There is nothing like being back at school to remind you that you have a lot of work to do. (And I do mean A LOT.)</p><p>PRO: Over the break, the maintenance department finally got around to installing the new judo mats.</p><p>CON: Bex, of course, had to challenge everyone to a round of judo.</p><p>PRO: Two words: Sublevel. Access.</p><p>CON: No matter how many hours we spent trying, we never could figure out exactly what the Circle was up to.</p><p>I know I shouldn\u2019t admit it, but I wasn\u2019t exactly looking forward to the rest of the students coming back to school. Bex and I had been alone with my mom and the other teachers for three whole days by then, and there was something nice about it. No lines in the Grand Hall, no crowds on the stairs. I could use all the hot water I wanted in the shower. But most of all, I totally wasn\u2019t looking forward to\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Sure, they call me the Chameleon, but when it comes to getting lost in the crowds at the Gallagher Academy, Liz really is quite a natural. After all, that afternoon the halls were full of girls and teachers, piles of backpacks and suitcases lining the halls, and even though we\u2019re seniors and all, Liz was lost in a throng of freshmen and sophomores.</p><p>But as she grabbed me by the arm and pulled me into a quiet alcove, I couldn\u2019t help but remember that the start of a new semester meant questions\u2014lots of questions. And the hardest ones weren\u2019t going to be coming from our teachers.</p><p>\u201cSo...what happened over break? Where did you go? Who did you see? What do the Baxters think about Preston, and...oh... Just tell me what happened!\u201d</p><p>Technically, the answer was classified. We were in an unsecured alcove with far too many highly trained ears and eyes around. I could have given any of those excuses, but I didn\u2019t have to, because just then Bex stepped into the alcove and said, \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Now, to be technical about it, there were a whole lot of girls there, but I knew exactly who Bex meant. What I didn\u2019t know was why she was leading us down the main staircase and through the foyer that served as the official front door of our school.</p><p>Out front, at least a dozen limos and town cars were lining up to deliver our classmates, but Bex broke into a full run, darting around the corner of the building.</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d Liz cried, \u201cslow down. Where are we...\u201d</p><p>But then Liz couldn\u2019t finish. She was too transfixed by the sight of the swirling blades of the helicopter that was slowly coming to rest on our school\u2019s back lawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hand it to Macey,\u201d Bex said. \u201cShe still knows how to make an entrance.\u201d</p><p>We were used to some pomp and circumstance, but even for Macey McHenry, a helicopter arrival seemed a little over the top. But then I realized that Macey wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>My mother was walking around the corner of the mansion, waving to a man in a trench coat and scarf who was offering a hand to help Macey climb out of the helicopter.</p><p>\u201cSenator,\u201d my mom said, shouting over the roar of the engines. \u201cWhat a nice surprise.\u201d</p><p>She sounded like she\u2019d been expecting him, but considering the fact that our school wasn\u2019t going on full automatic lockdown, my mother must have had it on good authority that he wasn\u2019t coming inside.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Morgan,\u201d Senator McHenry said, taking my mother\u2019s hand. Then he seemed to notice Bex, Liz, and me. \u201cGirls,\u201d he added.</p><p>Macey was quiet beside her father. She looked thinner than I remembered. Her usually bright blue eyes were duller. Worried.</p><p>\u201cHello, Senator. It\u2019s so nice to see you again,\u201d Bex said in her best American accent, harkening back to the role she\u2019d played so well the very first time Macey had ever set foot on our campus. \u201cTo what do we owe the pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just dropping Macey off,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the intrusion, but with all that has gone on in the past few weeks... It seems being a public figure has become a bit of a hazardous job. I mean, did you hear about that woman from the European Union? Dubois, I think her name was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Sir Walter Knight,\u201d the senator went on. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. If a man isn\u2019t safe at Cambridge...\u201d The senator shook his head then looked into my mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cI got acquainted with him during the campaign, you see. He and Ambassador Winters were close. Knight was a top advisor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I wasn\u2019t aware of that,\u201d Mom said, even though she was very well aware of it all. In fact, she knew more about what was going on than even the senior senator from Virginia, but that\u2019s part of the job, sometimes. Shaking your head. Saying the right things instead of the truth.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure Macey got here safely.\u201d He squeezed his daughter\u2019s shoulders, and Macey didn\u2019t pull away. In fact, she didn\u2019t do anything. I wondered if maybe that was what I\u2019d looked like the semester before, climbing out of a helicopter, numb and too thin. But exactly why Macey looked that way I wasn\u2019t really sure.</p><p>\u201cNow, Macey, you have a good semester.\u201d He patted her awkwardly on the arm.</p><p>\u201cYes, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudy hard and...enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...good-bye.\u201d</p><p>I waited for him to give her a hug, kiss her cheek. But Macey\u2019s father just hunched low and walked back to the chopper. Once inside, he gave us a textbook politician\u2019s wave, and then he was rising, disappearing into the sky over Virginia.</p><p>Three months before, when I had found my father\u2019s grave, I\u2019d tried to claw through the frozen earth with just my bare hands\u2014I\u2019d been willing to do anything just be closer to him. As the cold air whirled around us, I thought back to the way I\u2019d felt then, and I looked at Macey, who hadn\u2019t even watched as her own dad took flight.</p><p>\u201cSo, Macey,\u201d Liz started slowly, \u201chow was your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Macey asked, cutting Liz off and spinning, looking at my mother.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Mom asked, but I already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cPreston. He\u2019s here, right?\u201d There was a hopefulness about Macey, but a desperation too as she asked, \u201cYou did get him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacey,\u201d my mother said, reaching for her, \u201cyou have to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Macey snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d Her father\u2019s helicopter looked like a wasp on the horizon.</p><p>\u201cThe US Embassy in Rome is one of the most secure buildings in Europe. Preston\u2019s father is a powerful man. He\u2019s safe,\u201d Mom said, then repeated, \u201cPreston is safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard Elias Crane the sixth had a car accident,\u201d Macey said. \u201cAnd Charlene Dubois and her kids disappeared? Her kids!\u201d Macey had a point, and she knew it. It wasn\u2019t just the leaders of the Circle who were getting hurt. Their kids were getting caught in the cross fire. Which meant Preston wasn\u2019t as safe as any of us wanted to believe.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t living in a cave, you know,\u201d Macey told us. \u201cThese things make the news. And every day I waited for the news that the American Embassy in Rome had been attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen, Macey,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cBut it will.\u201d Macey was so certain, and the worst part was that she was right. \u201cSo when are you going to get him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the time is right, Macey. And only when the time is right.\u201d My mom sounded like a headmistress, a senior operative, someone who had lived most of her life on a need-to-know basis. And as far as she was concerned, we absolutely, positively did not need to know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Liz started. She hadn\u2019t had spies as parents. Unlike Bex and me, she still didn\u2019t know the signs that a conversation was over.</p><p>\u201cThat is all, girls. You go settle in,\u201d Mom told Macey. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all at the Welcome Back Dinner.\u201d</p><p>And then she turned. A cold wind blew across the grounds. Her dark hair spiraled around her, and she walked so tall, so straight. And I knew Rachel Morgan wasn\u2019t going to cave, not to the likes of us.</p><p>Macey must have known it too, because there was fire in her eyes when she said, \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p> <p>Bex and I shared a look, then Bex lowered her voice. \u201cWe\u2019d better go inside.\u201d</p><p>The halls were starting to clear out as we made our way through the mansion. Loud music boomed out of a few rooms. There were showers running on almost every floor. It sounded like the start of a new semester, but when we reached the suite I shared with my three closest friends in the world, it hit me: this wasn\u2019t a regular semester. It was our last semester.</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019re inside. No eavesdropping freshmen here, so are you three going to tell me what\u2019s going on or aren\u2019t you?\u201d Macey asked, spinning on us all and slamming the door. \u201cBecause I know Cam didn\u2019t get that scratch on her cheek from shaving.\u201d</p><p>Absentmindedly, I reached up and touched my face, the last remaining trace of Cambridge and Knight and our encounter with my boyfriend\u2019s mother. I know childhood is supposed to scar you, but mine seemed to be going to extremes.</p><p>\u201cI got this in England. Cambridge,\u201d I said, clarifying.</p> <p>\u201cYou were there?\u201d Liz asked. \u201cWith Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I admitted. Something about the memory sent a shiver down my spine. \u201cWe went to try to get him, bring him into custody, you know? But Zach\u2019s mom was there, and we weren\u2019t quite quick enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy him?\u201d Macey asked. She was bristling against even us. \u201cWhy did he get to be saved?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t saved! We were too late,\u201d I shouted. \u201cWe were there to take him into custody. And then he started rambling on and on about how he had left the Inner Circle because they were planning some big, huge, terrible thing. He said it had already started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Liz asked, but Bex just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBefore he could tell us...he died.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and I felt myself growing cold and angry. \u201cBefore he could tell us, Zach\u2019s mother murdered him.\u201d</p><p>Down the hall, music was blaring. Girls rushed past, looking for lost suitcases and misplaced uniform skirts; but in our suite, the real world was taking over. It was already long past graduation.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t even try to save Preston?\u201d Macey\u2019s blue eyes turned to ice.</p><p>\u201cPreston Winters is not a soft target, Macey,\u201d Bex snapped. They weren\u2019t the comforting words of a friend. They were the analysis of an operative, and that was exactly what Macey needed then. \u201cHis father knows that Catherine is hunting down members of the Inner Circle, and he\u2019s no doubt taking precautions. He\u2019s also a US ambassador in a major post, which means embassy protection. Which means anti-terror roadblocks and biohazard detectors, bulletproof limousines and marines. It means marines, Macey. So Preston isn\u2019t out there on his own. He lives in a fortress with a whole lot of people whose job it is to step between him and a bullet, so pull yourself together. Preston is fine. And if he\u2019s not our mission at the moment, then he\u2019s not our mission. Do you get that?\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment, but eventually Macey nodded. She walked to her closet and threw open the doors, pulled out a plaid skirt, and started getting undressed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>Macey looked at her like she was an idiot. \u201cWelcome Back Dinner,\u201d she said, not only as though the fight was over but like it had never happened at all.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re...\u201d I started slowly, carefully choosing my words, \u201cokay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Fine. Let\u2019s just go to dinner,\u201d Macey said, but none of us moved.</p><p>\u201cOh, you guys,\u201d Liz exclaimed after a moment, and then she started to cry.</p><p>\u201cLiz, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d I started, but her wails cut me off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our last Welcome Back Dinner!\u201d</p><p>Bex tried to comfort her. (But Bex is really better at inflicting pain than softening it.) I wanted to say something. But all I could do was remember that of all of Liz\u2019s many, many skills, pretty-crying definitely isn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Bex looked at me, a silent thought coursing between us. It was going to be a very long semester.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Walking down the stairs that night, most of the senior class around me, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it had been forever since I\u2019d been to a Welcome Back Dinner. Then I stopped cold, one hand on the banister of the Grand Stairs, realizing it hadn\u2019t been forever. It had been a year. (And let\u2019s face it, a year is pretty much forever in teenage girl time.)</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Cam?\u201d Bex asked. The rest of the group was walking on toward the doors like conquering heroes.</p><p>Like seniors.</p><p>But I was still frozen where I stood.</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Bex said again, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>What was I supposed to say? That Liz was right, and the whole night was a little too symbolic-slash-scary? That Macey was right, and marine protection or not, Preston wasn\u2019t going to be safe until he was far away from his father? Or that Bex herself was right\u2014that we were operatives, and we just had to keep our eyes on our mission?</p><p>So I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t freak,\u201d Bex said, almost like she\u2019d read my mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not freaking,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you look like you\u2019re freaking.\u201d</p><p>I turned my gaze to her and let my guard down. \u201cI haven\u2019t done one of these in a while,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Bex shook her head and walked down a couple of stairs. \u201cI think you\u2019re freaked about what happened at Cambridge. I think it scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through worse, Bex,\u201d I said, joining her on the lower stairs. \u201cWay worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not the attack.\u201d Bex raised a finger in contradiction. \u201cWhat happened before the attack. I think you saw the future. Which is kind of freaky when\u2014two months ago\u2014you didn\u2019t think you were going to have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...Cammie...\u201d Tina Walters started as soon as I\u2019d found my seat at the senior table. None of the teachers were inside yet, and the hall was filled with chattering and laughing, but something else, too. Tina leaned closer, her voice no louder than a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, Tina?\u201d I said. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Tina wasn\u2019t just the Gallagher Academy\u2019s self-appointed director of communications (aka school big mouth). She was also the daughter of one of the school\u2019s leading alums, who happens to pose as D.C.\u2019s most powerful gossip columnist. So conspiratorial whispers are kind of Tina\u2019s stock-in-trade.</p><p>\u201cAbout that huge oil tanker that exploded in the Caspian Sea, of course!\u201d she said as if natural and geopolitical disasters were common Gallagher Academy conversation. And...well...I guess they kind of were. \u201cWhat do you think really happened?\u201d Tina asked.</p><p>It had been in the news, of course. I\u2019d heard about it. Everyone had heard about it. But even for spy girls, it was an unusual topic.</p><p>\u201cBecause my sources say it was no accident,\u201d Tina said before I\u2019d had the chance to utter a word. \u201cEvery Iranian port on the Caspian has been shut down because of it. And trust me, if there is one thing the Iranians like, it\u2019s oil. If there are two things they like, it\u2019s oil and their ability to ship it to potential buyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about that bridge explosion in Azerbaijan?\u201d Courtney Bauer asked.</p><p>Liz wheeled on her. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said there was a bomb on the train,\u201d Courtney said.</p><p>\u201cA bomb?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Courtney stirred the ice in her glass almost absentmindedly as she answered. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she was the one who separated that car from the rest of the train before it blew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saved a lot of lives,\u201d Bex said, but Courtney tried to shrug it off.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d she said, even though it was. After all, it\u2019s hard to admit that your mom did something really scary without also admitting that, next time, she might not be so lucky.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Tina went on, \u201cCammie, what do you know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, but Tina just looked at me. \u201cReally,\u201d I told her. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything. I was in England with Bex\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, did you hear about that former prime minister who got blown up at Cambridge? It was supposedly an accident, but my sources say it wasn\u2019t. What do you know about that?\u201d Tina tried again.</p><p>I could have lied to her. I would have lied to her. My school had taught me how. My circumstances took away almost all of the guilt. I was just about to do exactly that when the doors at the back of the room swung open and our teachers walked in. As their long procession moved down the center aisle, a new thought filled my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Zach?\u201d I scanned the room. \u201cAnd Mr. Solomon? Where are they?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Macey gave me an It\u2019s not fun, is it? look, but I didn\u2019t have time to consider the irony. Or the hypocrisy. Honestly, there\u2019s such a fine line between the two that sometimes it makes my head hurt.</p><p>I\u2019d always assumed that Zach and Mr. Solomon would be back for the start of school and, technically, school began with the Welcome Back Dinner. But Zach and Mr. Solomon were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Before anyone could answer, my mother took her place at the front of the room and said, \u201cWomen of the Gallagher Academy, who comes here?\u201d</p><p>In unison, every girl in the room stood and said, \u201cWe are the sisters of Gillian.\u201d</p><p>With every line of our motto I felt a tug, not just in my heart but in my head. We were sisters. And that wasn\u2019t going to end with graduation. We would honor her sword and guard her secrets with our lives. Our school\u2019s motto made it sound so easy, so grand. There in that beautiful building with our perfectly pressed skirts, it was supposed to be so simple. Gallagher Girls = Good. But it wasn\u2019t. I knew it. I\u2019d seen it. I\u2019d heard Zach\u2019s mother brag about being a member of my sisterhood. Looking around the room, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if there were any traitors in our midst even then.</p><p>\u201cI hope you all had an excellent break,\u201d my mother said from the front of the room. \u201cIt\u2019s very good to see you back here, safe and sound.\u201d She took a breath, letting the words settle over us. Then she shuffled some papers on the podium, checking notes she probably didn\u2019t need.</p><p>\u201cNow, eighth grade, your suites will be undergoing a complete bug sweep\u2014that\u2019s insects, not listening devices. Please be prepared for some brief interruptions in the next week and use the back stairwell for the time being, as we have found termites in the front. Sophomores, Professor Buckingham tells me that many of you have yet to turn in your Track Declaration Forms. Those must be filled out before classes begin tomorrow morning. Trust me, ladies, this is not how you want to begin your careers. And, seniors...congratulations. I\u2019m very proud of you, and I\u2019m very excited for you to begin our career assessment program. The first event is in two weeks. Please see Madame Dabney for the complete schedule.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mom looked down at her list one final time, then folded the paper. \u201cI guess that\u2019s it. Welcome back, girls. And have a great semester.\u201d</p><p>She smiled out across the room. It was like a spotlight, so bright and hopeful and happy. When my mother looked like that, it was easy to believe that there was no evil in the world. I wanted to know if she was faking or forgetting. Whatever the case, I was hoping our last semester at spy school would teach us how to do that for ourselves.</p><p>That night, our suite was unusually quiet. It was the first night back, after all. We didn\u2019t have any tests or homework. There should have been movie marathons and makeovers. Liz should have been clamoring for extra credit; but even she was silent as we sat on our beds, none of us talking.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Lizzie?\u201d Bex tried to tease. \u201cHave you reached your lifetime limit for bonus points?\u201d</p> <p>Usually a remark like that would make Liz go white and ask whether or not a limit to extra credit was an actual thing. Then she\u2019d dig out her Gallagher Academy Student Handbook just to make sure. But she didn\u2019t do either. And that, let me tell you, was scary.</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Bex moved to Liz\u2019s bed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Liz stood and picked up a bundle of clothes, starting for the bathroom. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Bex cut her off.</p><p>On her bed, Macey shifted to study us. But she didn\u2019t mention Preston again. She didn\u2019t ask about Cambridge.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bex. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d Again, Liz tried to go to the bathroom, but again, Bex cut her off.</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>Right then it was like all the nostalgia had been drained from Liz. She had a brand-new encryption textbook, but she wasn\u2019t giddy. There was a stack of Microbiology Monthlys waiting for her, but she hadn\u2019t even picked them up. Liz wasn\u2019t being Liz, and Bex was right not to like it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Liz?\u201d I asked, flanking her from the other side. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Liz said, louder. \u201cIt\u2019s just...I keep thinking about what Knight told you\u2014about what the Circle is doing.... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just...\u201d She gave a slight glance toward the window. \u201cI can\u2019t help but worry that things are going to get worse before they get better.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, my gaze followed hers. I totally knew the feeling.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t exactly surprising when I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. I thought about Liz\u2019s words, about my mother\u2019s warnings. Living to see graduation didn\u2019t seem as unlikely as it had a few months before, but Bex was right. The future was out there. And I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it was more than a little bit scary.</p><p>That was why I slipped out of my bed and out of our room, into the dark and chilly halls, wandering in silence until\u2014</p><p>\u201cHi, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>The girl in the hall was tiny. Her arms and hands were so small, she looked almost like a doll; but her big brown eyes were so brilliant that I was convinced that she had to be either dream or ghost.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I scared you,\u201d the girl told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone else was up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, do you?\u201d the girl guessed. Then she shrugged and smiled a little. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d She honestly sounded like she meant it. \u201cI\u2019m Amy.\u201d She held out her hand in a manner that would have made Madame Dabney proud.</p><p>There was nothing at all self-conscious about her. She was so poised. So beautiful. If I hadn\u2019t known better, I might have thought that I had been transported back in time to an audience with a very tiny Cleopatra.</p> <p>I studied the girl, wondering why\u2014in that moment\u2014she seemed so familiar. Probably I\u2019d seen her around, encoded her face. Maybe I\u2019d even met her last semester during one of the trances that had taken me out of my right mind. But in any case, it felt like I knew her when she asked, \u201cAre you okay, Cammie?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and looked up at me with those big, brown eyes. I wasn\u2019t surprised that she knew my name and my face. She\u2019d probably heard more than a few stories about all that had happened in the past few years. And right then she was looking up to me. Literally. Figuratively. She was looking at me like I was exactly who she was hoping to grow up to be.</p><p>But right then all I wanted to do was go back in time and be her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I told her. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a seventh grader.\u201d She shook her head slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re a senior. You\u2019re not supposed to recognize me. Besides, I thought I was coming to a school where not being recognizable was an advantage.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little, completely at home and at ease, and even though I didn\u2019t know that seventh grader, I liked her.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Amy, what are you doing wandering around out here when everybody else is sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the mansion at night. It doesn\u2019t really feel like a school then. When I\u2019m alone and barefoot on the carpets, it feels just like a home. Like my home.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and nodded and knew exactly what she meant.</p><p>The grandfather clock at the end of the hall started to chime. Three o\u2019clock. In four hours, those halls would be filled with screaming girls and swinging backpacks, long lines at the waffle bar and a whole new semester.</p><p>My last semester.</p><p>I looked at my new little friend and tried to see the mansion through her eyes\u2014before the world got so close to our walls.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Cammie,\u201d Amy called to me as she walked to the end of the hall. She stopped with her hand on the banister, looking back over her shoulder at me. \u201cWe\u2019re all glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>And then she disappeared up the stairs without a word or a sound; and I stood, silently wondering if I might have been mistaken. Maybe she really had been a dream.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>If our teachers were feeling any nostalgia about its being our Last First Day of a New Semester Ever, they totally didn\u2019t show it the following morning.</p><p>For starters, they made us have our breakfast conversations in Mandarin, and then Madame Dabney came by and reminded everybody that our holiday thank-you cards were due in the mail by noon. (Madame Dabney takes her thank-you cards very seriously.)</p><p>But the day didn\u2019t really get weird until my roommates and I joined the rest of the senior Covert Operations class in Sublevel Three. Because...well... Sublevel Three was empty.</p><p>Mr. Solomon was gone.</p><p>Aunt Abby was who-knew-where.</p><p>Technically, Agent Townsend hadn\u2019t been on the Gallagher Academy payroll all year.</p><p>Exactly who I had been expecting as soon as we stepped off the elevator and into the ancient space, I wasn\u2019t quite sure.</p><p>And then I heard the voices.</p><p>\u201cIs the landline secure?\u201d Mr. Smith asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d my mother said. \u201cBut needless to say, we aren\u2019t taking any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk for Romero,\u201d Mr. Smith was whispering just as the entire senior CoveOps class came walking around the corner.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Are you teaching us?\u201d I asked, too much optimism in my voice. I should have known better.</p><p>\u201cNo, Cam. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mom brushed a hand across my cheek and put something in a backpack.</p><p>Behind her, Mr. Smith closed a door marked STORAGE with a snap. I heard the whining of gears and motors as the school\u2019s security measures clicked into place, locking the closet, keeping whatever lay inside just out of reach.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, ladies,\u201d Mr. Smith said, even though he\u2019d already seen us in Countries of the World. \u201cIf you\u2019ll go back to class and take a seat, I\u2019ll be right\u2014yes, Ms. McHenry?\u201d he asked Macey with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Solomon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a manner that totally didn\u2019t encourage follow-up questions.</p><p>I watched the rest of the senior class pivot and start for our classroom, turning and moving like a flock of geese, but I was frozen to the spot. I looked from my mother to the backpack, from Mr. Smith\u2019s eyes to hers. And I knew what had brought her all the way to Sublevel Three.</p><p>\u201cYou found another descendant, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked as soon as the rest of the class had left, but I didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cWhich one is it? William Smith? Is it the granddaughter in Toronto? I thought she might\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the woman in Toronto,\u201d Mom said, her voice firm. \u201cShe\u2019s descended from a different William Smith. Now, you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop worrying!\u201d I snapped, louder than I\u2019d intended. \u201cThe Circle of Cavan is planning something awful. Mr. Solomon and Zach are gone who knows where. We haven\u2019t seen Aunt Abby or Agent Townsend in weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Cam, you don\u2019t need to worry about my sister and Agent Townsend,\u201d Mom said, but I was still rambling on.</p><p>\u201cZach\u2019s mother is going around killing people. She\u2019s killing people\u2014and their kids\u2014and I can\u2019t do anything but worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart.\u201d Mom sounded like she meant it, and I think she really did. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask where. I didn\u2019t ask why. I knew better than to beg for answers. She was never going to give them.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to get Preston?\u201d Macey called from the end of the hall.</p><p>Mom shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re leaving, aren\u2019t you? To track down one of them...one of the Inner Circle?\u201d I asked, but my mother\u2019s silence was her answer.</p><p>I watched her turn and walk steadily to the end of the hall, no hesitation. No fear.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I yelled, and she glanced back, dark hair falling across her shoulders. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>It was cold as we walked from the P&amp;E barn and back to the mansion that night. We shivered in our uniforms and thin sweaters. Overhead, there was a blanket of clouds hanging between us and a starry sky. I thought about Zach and Mr. Solomon, my mom and Aunt Abby. I wondered where in the world they might be. Was it cold there too? Or were they someplace where it was summer and the middle of the day? There were about a million things I didn\u2019t know, so I gave up trying to guess the answers. Instead, I wondered what they would do if they were the ones being left behind, treated like they were helpless.</p><p>The Circle of Cavan wasn\u2019t my own private mission, no matter how personal it felt. It hadn\u2019t started with me. But somehow I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it was going to end with me. Eventually.</p><p>And right then I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The waiting. The helplessness. I didn\u2019t want to go back in time anymore. I was ready for my future when I stopped and asked, \u201cOkay. What can we do?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a rhetorical question. Very few questions at our school ever are.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Cam?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean, we don\u2019t know what the Inner Circle is planning and, aside from Ambassador Winters, we don\u2019t know where any of them are.\u201d I shrugged at the irony. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where my boyfriend is. Still, I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m going to go crazy if I don\u2019t do something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Macey rolled her eyes. \u201cI know. Let\u2019s stand around talking about it some more.\u201d Then she started toward the doors with new fire, new purpose. \u201cNo. I\u2019m through talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Mace?\u201d Bex asked, blocking her way; but Macey didn\u2019t even look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m going to do what someone should have done weeks ago. I\u2019m getting Preston out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Macey,\u201d Liz said. \u201cLet\u2019s think about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m through thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said we shouldn\u2019t go, Macey.\u201d I took her arm, held her there. \u201cThey said he\u2019s not in any danger.\u201d</p><p>Macey gave a knowing\u2014almost spiteful\u2014smile. \u201cAnd they\u2019d never lie, would they?\u201d</p><p>It only took a second for the words to seep in, and yet it seemed like it took forever. Of course my mother would lie. To keep me safe. To protect the mission. To stop the Circle and its leaders once and for all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Rome,\u201d Macey told us. \u201cNow, you can stay here or you can come with me. I\u2019m not giving you a third option.\u201d</p> <p>She turned and started inside, but in a flash, Bex\u2019s hand was on her arm, gently tugging her back as if pulling her away from a cliff.</p><p>Macey whirled on her. I wasn\u2019t sure if she was going to strike or just pull away; but she didn\u2019t have to do either because Bex was smiling, saying, \u201cThen I guess we\u2019re going to miss some classes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>HOW TO SNEAK OUT OF YOUR SCHOOL AND CROSS THE ATLANTIC WITHOUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF SPIES BEING THE WISER:</p><p>(A list by Cameron Morgan)</p><p>Secret passageways. I know I\u2019ve mentioned these before, but seriously. My academic experience would have been extremely different without them.</p> <p>Roommates with private jets. Again, this makes things a lot easier. I\u2019m not saying that we couldn\u2019t have stowed away on a cargo ship (that was Bex\u2019s original idea), but when Macey made a phone call and said, \u201cThe jet will be here in twenty,\u201d we didn\u2019t exactly protest.</p><p>Don\u2019t go where you\u2019re going. No. Really. So you want to go to Rome to break out your roommate\u2019s boyfriend...the last thing you do is fly to Rome. Too obvious. Too easy to track. And, besides, we were in Macey\u2019s mom\u2019s private jet. There were going to be flight plans and manifests and stuff. So Rome was absolutely not our destination.</p><p>Pack carefully (because even a rolling bag can be inconvenient in a high-speed chase, especially one involving cobblestones).</p><p>Be careful.</p><p>The shoreline of Marseille was beautiful, I had to give it that much. I stood on the deck of the tiny boat that Macey had hired to take us across the Mediterranean, watching the lights disappear in the distance. Ocean spray slapped me in the face, and I had to keep hold of the railing to stay on my feet. Big swells rocked against the hull. A storm was moving in. That\u2019s when I felt the dark figure that came to stand beside me.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Preston?\u201d I asked Macey.</p><p>\u201cBefore we left for break your mother absolutely forbade me to speak to him. Remember?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cI do remember. So\u201d\u2014I looked at her from the corner of my eye\u2014\u201cwhat did he say?\u201d</p> <p>Another big wave crashed against the boat. Liz was down below, curled up in a little ball, eating green apples and every kind of anti-nausea medication we were able to smuggle out of the school\u2019s medical wing. Bex wasn\u2019t going to leave her, so that meant Macey and I were alone.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a clue, Cam.\u201d She leaned her arms against the rail and stared out at the water, which was as blue as her eyes. \u201cI called him on New Year\u2019s Eve. He was going to a party. He was...fine. That same day, Zach\u2019s mom was murdering a man and blowing up Cambridge, and Preston was talking about spring break. He asked me to come visit.\u201d Macey looked down at the water. \u201cI think he really likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Macey shook her head. \u201cI mean...he doesn\u2019t like this.\u201d Macey gestured down at her long legs and designer boots. The tight jeans and cashmere sweater. Even on a rickety boat in the middle of nowhere, she looked like she was at a photo shoot, but that didn\u2019t matter to Macey. Turns out, I guess, it didn\u2019t matter to Preston either.</p><p>\u201cHe likes me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s a spy thing, or maybe it\u2019s a girl thing\u2014but when you spend your whole life trying out a series of aliases, it is a great comfort to find someone who knows and likes the person behind the cover.</p><p>\u201cYou know his schedule?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSome of it,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>\u201cGood. When we get in there tomorrow...we\u2019re going to have to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just walk up and grab him. His dad has to know what is going on\u2014what Zach\u2019s mom is up to. He has to know he\u2019s a target. Which means Preston is going to have guards. And those guards are going to do everything they can to keep him away from the likes of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I could hear the annoyance in Macey\u2019s voice, but those things had to be said, and so I took it upon myself to say them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like it was last fall is what I\u2019m saying. We can\u2019t knock on the embassy door and ask if Preston can come out and play. Well...we can if we want his dad to try to kill me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, okay?\u201d Macey wasn\u2019t snapping, but she was frayed. I could hear it in her voice, see it in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know you get it. It\u2019s just that this is serious, Macey. We might make things worse. In our business, there\u2019s always the chance that you are just going to make things worse. If we go in there without knowing exactly what we\u2019re doing, then people could get hurt. People could die. Are you willing to take that risk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know there are risks, Cammie. Okay? I know what\u2019s happening to him and around him...what the situation is and...\u201d She trailed off. For a moment I thought she wouldn\u2019t even finish, but the she turned her gaze out to the water. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wish this boat would go faster.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The street outside the ambassador\u2019s residence was quiet. Out front, marines stood guard by the gates. The lines of tourists and people needing visas stretched from the front doors and around the corner, waiting for the offices to officially open, but the four of us had just arrived at our post. It was easy to agree there was no use in trying to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Bex asked me.</p><p>\u201cIt looks the same,\u201d I said from my place by the window. A steaming cup of hot cappuccino was in my hands, but I didn\u2019t sip. It was enough just to feel the warmth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Liz asked. \u201cI mean, maybe it won\u2019t be so hard.\u201d</p><p>Macey cut her eyes at her. \u201cLooks can be deceiving.\u201d</p><p>Covert Operations Report</p><p>The Operatives took up a position in a safe flat (i.e., hotel room) overlooking the United States Embassy in Rome. They began taking shifts, keeping watch.</p><p>Over the course of eight hours the Operatives noticed five guard changes and the entrance of two motorcades. They also consumed a total of twelve cups of gelato.</p><p>The Operatives also observed a variety of strange patterns in the area:</p><p>Three separate tourists seemed to be more interested in getting pictures of embassy security than any of the traditional sights.</p><p>The Operatives also regretted not packing warmer sweaters.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we see?\u201d Bex asked through my comms unit later that day. She and Liz were in a van, checking out the surrounding streets, scouring for a weakness in the embassy\u2019s defenses. But Macey was beside me, binoculars pressed against her eyes as we stared down at the embassy\u2019s front gates, watching. Counting.</p><p>\u201cAnything going on?\u201d Bex went on.</p><p>\u201cSame old, same\u2014wait,\u201d I said when the embassy\u2019s front doors opened and two bodyguards walked out, a smaller, thinner figure with a backpack pressed between them.</p><p>\u201cIs that...?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d Macey said. I felt her start to bolt, but then she stopped herself. Macey had come way too far to be stupid.</p><p>I watched Preston and his guards walk toward a waiting car and climb inside. The gates opened, and, with a roar, two motorcycles pulled up to flank the limo as the three vehicles moved through the gates.</p><p>I knew part of Macey still wanted to run. But me...I was stunned, trapped in the memory of the men last fall who had chased me through the streets of Rome, and I knew that the men on the motorcycles weren\u2019t a part of the embassy\u2019s protective detail. They were Circle. And they were watching Preston\u2019s every move.</p><p>Just then one of the unmarked vans that had been rotating in and out of position on the street pulled into traffic, following Preston and his watchers into the distance.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d I heard Bex\u2019s voice in my ear. \u201cCam, what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, Liz,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019d better get back here. I think we need to hurry.\u201d</p><p>The school must have been a church once upon a time. At least part of it. The main hall had stained glass windows and a high, arching ceiling covered in mosaics. It was beautiful. Fortunately, its security was also totally lax.</p><p>The lock on the alley door was easy to pick. The back stairwell had no cameras. And, perhaps most importantly, the school\u2019s intercom system was incredibly hackable.</p><p>\u201cPreston Winters, you are needed in room 84,\u201d the female voice on the intercom said.</p><p>That room 84 was the boys\u2019 bathroom, no one seemed to notice.</p><p>\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d Macey said, and Preston slammed the bathroom door behind him.</p><p>\u201cMacey? What are you...I...I mean, you\u2019re in Rome. And you\u2019re in the boys\u2019 bathroom.\u201d He sounded like he wasn\u2019t certain which was more peculiar.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d she said, and I stayed quiet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d He stepped toward her. I think he was going to hug her\u2014maybe kiss her. I kind of wanted to hide. But more than that, I wanted to get out of there.</p><p>Preston, on the other hand, seemed immune to the weirdness.</p><p>\u201cAre you in town long?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere are you guys staying? Have you been to the embassy yet? Maybe we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go to the embassy, Preston.\u201d Macey\u2019s voice was even. \u201cYou can never go back to the embassy again.\u201d</p><p>Then, for the first time, he looked at me. It was a look that said he thought it might be a joke, that she was teasing. Or just being a crazy politician\u2019s daughter. But Macey was through rebelling, and deep down Preston knew it. \u201cCammie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated...how?\u201d he asked. His expression grew grave. \u201cCircle complicated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019ll tell you all about it in a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Terror filled his eyes. Last summer, he\u2019d been the one I\u2019d gone to when I was on the run. He\u2019d taken me in and given me shelter. He knew what the Circle of Cavan was, but as far as we knew, he had no idea that his father was actually one of the Circle\u2019s leaders\u2014that someday that job was supposed to pass to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m safe. But you aren\u2019t.\u201d I stole a glance out the window. I didn\u2019t see Bex and Liz, but they were out there. Waiting. Ready. \u201cLook, we don\u2019t have time to explain it all now, but we need you to trust us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacey?\u201d He turned to her just as there was a honk in the alley behind the school. Down below, we saw a truck moving to block the narrow passage. Vendors yelled. People on Vespas tried to squeeze around. But the truck didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cLook, Preston, I wish we could explain everything. But we can\u2019t. Not yet. Bex and Liz are outside waiting for us, and we have to go. Now.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around, bewildered. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p> <p>Just then the truck honked again, as if in answer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bread truck,\u201d Preston said, glancing out the window. \u201cYou came here in a bread truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust us?\u201d Macey asked. It was the million-dollar question. Without the right answer, everything would have been for nothing.</p><p>Preston grinned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I reached for the window. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>I was unlatching the glass when I noticed Preston was no longer beside us.</p><p>There was a banging on the door. A deep voice was yelling, \u201cMr. Winters? Mr. Winters, open the door, sir.\u201d And Preston was halfway there.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Macey yelled and bolted across the room. She pressed his body against the door, and it looked like Preston couldn\u2019t decide whether to be worried or incredibly happy about the situation.</p><p>\u201cJust you,\u201d she explained.</p><p>On the other side of the door, the guards banged again. I thought of the men on the motorcycles who had chased me through the streets last fall. Maybe they were the same ones who were in the hallway right then. Maybe this time I wasn\u2019t meant to get away so easily.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my bodyguards,\u201d Preston tried to explain, but Macey just jerked him by the collar.</p> <p>\u201cYou have new guards now,\u201d she said.</p><p>Preston, however, didn\u2019t look so sure.</p><p>\u201cMy dad said I should never go anywhere without them. There have been a few attacks against some high-profile people in Europe. Not that I\u2019m all that important or anything,\u201d he tried to explain.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, trust me. You\u2019re high-profile enough,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Down below, Bex honked again.</p><p>Outside, the banging grew louder. They were trying to break down the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s now or never, Preston,\u201d Macey told him, but he just looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI came to you once, Preston. When I had nowhere else to go. I was hurt and bleeding and scared, and you saved me. You saved my life. Now I\u2019m trying to return the favor.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to Macey then, reaching out to take her hand. And together they climbed onto the windowsill.</p><p>And jumped.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>We were almost to the end of the alley when we heard the explosion. The truck shook. Macey was knocked off her feet, and Bex put the pedal to the metal, laying rubber down the cobblestone alley. When we reached the street, she didn\u2019t even slow down. We shot into traffic, tires squealing, while black smoke filled the air behind us.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Terror filled Preston\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think my school is on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>His eyes got even wider. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re the ones who set it,\u201d Macey said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world; but Preston just looked at us all in turn, taking it in. He knew the truth about the Gallagher Academy, after all. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. But I guess there are some things you have to see to believe, and it was like Preston was seeing us for the very first time.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said numbly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>In the front seat, Liz spun around. She had a laptop open and yelled at me, \u201cHe\u2019s transmitting!\u201d Then she looked at the boy and smiled. \u201cHi, Preston!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Liz. How are you\u2014hey\u2014hey!\u201d</p><p>He stopped talking. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what most boys would do if Macey McHenry were ripping off their shirts.</p><p>\u201cMacey!\u201d Preston gasped, but Macey didn\u2019t slow down.</p><p>\u201cTake it off,\u201d she told him. \u201cTake it all off.\u201d</p><p>She had ripped the button-down shirt off his arms and was going to work on his belt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Preston snapped. But he didn\u2019t protest long because, if I\u2019m going to be honest\u2014which is kind of the point of these reports\u2014I was already unzipping his pants.</p><p>Then Macey started ripping off Preston\u2019s white T-shirt. (Yes, actual rippage.) And I was fighting with his zipper. I wasn\u2019t exactly proud of how we handled the situation, but desperate times call for incredibly desperate measures.</p><p>\u201cGive me everything you have,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cReally, Cammie. I never knew you thought of me that way.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s pants were undone by that point and I ordered, \u201cStep!\u201d</p><p>He did as he was told, and a moment later I had the pants in my hands.</p><p>Preston just stood there, dumbfounded, in his boxers as I cracked open the back of the truck and hurled the pants into the street. A split second later the rest of his clothes and shoes followed.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he shouted, but right then, through the open doors, I heard the roar of motorcycles. Memory came rushing back. Terror mixed with adrenaline, and I didn\u2019t feel sorry for the mostly naked boy. Not even a little bit. I just wanted us all to get out of this alive.</p><p>\u201cLiz?\u201d Macey asked, but Liz shook her head. \u201cNo go,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s still got a signal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s in him?\u201d Macey asked.</p><p>\u201cThen we cut it out,\u201d I said, pressing Preston to the floor of the moving truck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of this!\u201d Preston shouted, his voice way more high-pitched than any eighteen-year-old guy ever wants his voice to be, but I didn\u2019t have time to care. I was looking at his body, examining every inch for scars.</p><p>\u201cHave you had any shots, Preston? Any implants in the last six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cFocus,\u201d Macey said. I thought she was going to slap him.</p><p>\u201cI...I had to go to the dentist!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask for an invitation. I pried open his mouth like Grandpa Morgan trying to buy a horse.</p><p>\u201cRetainer,\u201d I told Macey.</p><p>\u201cGive it to us, Preston,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He scooted farther back, pressing against the side of the truck.</p><p>\u201cGive it to us,\u201d I told him. \u201cOr I borrow Bex\u2019s knife.\u201d</p><p>And that must have done it, because he handed me the slimy piece of plastic and metal. I hurled it out the back of the van.</p><p>And we waited.</p><p>Seconds stretched out for what seemed like hours before Liz finally gave the longest sigh I\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cThat does it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>Only then did Macey and I drop to the floor of the truck. Breathing hard. Hearts pounding. I laid my head against a basket full of croissants, resting there, staring at Preston, who sat in his boxer shorts, arms crossed self-consciously across his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to explain?\u201d Preston was trying to keep his voice steady and failing. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell him everything\u2014about his father and Zach\u2019s mother and all the ways his life was getting ready to change, but I couldn\u2019t say a word because Bex was already yelling, \u201cHang on!\u201d</p><p>Rebecca Baxter may possibly be the greatest spy I\u2019ll ever know. She\u2019s also probably the most aggressive driver. So when she gripped the wheel and took a corner far faster than any bread truck is ever supposed to move, we all held on for dear life while the truck jumped the curb and burst through a newsstand.</p><p>Preston looked like he might throw up, and I couldn\u2019t really blame him.</p><p>Liz turned around and handed a bundle of clothes between the seats. \u201cHere you go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou brought clothes?\u201d Preston asked. \u201cYou knew you were going to make me jump out of a window. And strip. And throw a perfectly good retainer away?\u201d</p><p>Bex glanced back. \u201cI was just hoping about the stripping part. Nice abs, by the way.\u201d Then she went back to driving.</p><p>\u201cLook, Preston,\u201d Macey started. \u201cWe can explain. And we will. Soon. But right now we have to get you someplace safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was someplace safe! And then you made me jump out a window and blew up my school!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t someplace safe,\u201d Macey told him just as I heard the roar.</p><p>\u201cAnd, technically, we didn\u2019t blow up the school,\u201d Liz qualified. \u201cIt was a very small and highly controlled explosion.\u201d</p><p>Through the dirty windows at the back of the truck, I saw motorcycles come racing up behind us. I felt Bex jerk the wheel, and the truck skidded onto a main street, going the wrong direction.</p><p>Cars honked. Pedestrians yelled as Bex swerved onto the sidewalk. But still she didn\u2019t slow down.</p><p>Preston\u2019s breath was coming harder than it should have as he asked, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>Before I could explain Bex said, \u201cGuys, we have\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she never got to finish. The crash came too fast\u2014too hard. One second we were careening along the Roman streets, and the next there was nothing but the screech of tires and the crunch of metal. I felt myself falling, tumbling in the back of the truck as it flipped onto its side. Sparks and scraping metal. Something was pushing us across the street.</p><p>And then we were falling, tumbling over and over like clothes in a dryer, until there was a splash and then nothing but cold and fear.</p><p>The river was freezing. Bread floated all around us as the water cascaded through the back of the truck and the broken windows, taking us lower. Deeper into the cold.</p><p>\u201cPreston!\u201d Macey was yelling, but she sounded too far away. \u201cPreston!\u201d she called again.</p><p>Slowly, water filled the back of the truck, and as my eyes adjusted to the black, my head swirled. Blood ran down my face. I wanted to be sick or maybe just close my eyes and sleep, but then I thought about what I\u2019d told Bex just days before: what I really wanted to be was alive.</p><p>So I kicked and clawed and swam toward the broken doors at the back of the truck, and that was when I saw him. Preston\u2019s eyes were closed and his lips were turning blue. A bump was growing on his head, and I knew it wasn\u2019t just the cold water that was sending him into shock.</p><p>\u201cPreston! Cam!\u201d Macey yelled again, and I realized it was coming through my earpiece.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him,\u201d I yelled. \u201cSwim!\u201d I ordered, and put my head down, pulling Preston out of the truck as quickly as I could. My friends must have done as I said, because when I surfaced they were gone.</p><p>Air bubbled up from the sinking truck.</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d Liz yelled. She sounded afraid, but I couldn\u2019t see her. It was like I was in an echo chamber. The whole world had had the volume turned down.</p><p>\u201cCammie, are you okay?\u201d Liz said just as a bullet pierced the water, slicing into the murky darkness. Splash. And then another. And another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So I just put my head down and kept on swimming, dragging Preston toward the shore.</p><p>The current must have carried us farther away from the wreckage than I realized, because when Preston and I came up for air, I gasped and looked around\u2014waiting\u2014but no shots came.</p><p>In the distance, there was shouting.</p><p>\u201cCammie?\u201d Preston said, his voice groggy. \u201cWhat happened? Where am I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe went for a little swim, Pres. And now we\u2019ve got to go for a run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you can do it. Come on. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Running down the streets of Rome, I didn\u2019t dare stop to think about what we must have looked like. A tiny line of blood was smeared across Preston\u2019s face. My wet hair was tangled and filled with broken glass. Blood ran into my eyes, and the sweatshirt we\u2019d packed for Preston was two sizes too big and hung off him like a wet blanket.</p><p>Macey and Bex and Liz were on the other side of the river, running past an SUV with a pair of busted headlights, and I immediately knew what had caused the crash. As they passed, the SUV revved its engine and started chasing after them, swerving in and out of traffic. Other cars stopped, but the SUV just kept coming, plowing onto sidewalks, bursting through barricades.</p> <p>\u201cRun!\u201d Bex yelled, her voice carrying across the river, and Preston and I didn\u2019t have to be told twice.</p><p>I reached for Preston\u2019s hand, dragging him away. But the motorcycles were already weaving across a bridge, rushing toward us. I heard the haunting, piercing wails of police cars and fire trucks. In less than two minutes our sinking truck would be surrounded by authorities. Cops and bystanders would fill the streets, searching.</p><p>The motorcycle engines revved.</p><p>We didn\u2019t have two minutes.</p><p>Preston\u2019s hand was too still. He was going into shock. Of course he was. He was human. He was just a boy, no matter who his father was. And I knew it was up to me to pull the ambassador\u2019s son away from the sirens and the sinking truck, the motorcycles and the men who wouldn\u2019t stop until they found us.</p><p>Preston was the asset. The Gallagher Girl part of me knew that getting him out of there was my job\u2014my mission. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I shouted.</p> <p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Preston said. We were on his home turf, and I let him drag me into an alley I\u2019d never seen before. Laundry hung on lines overhead, blocking out the sun. And still we ran faster and faster, pushing aside the low-hanging sheets that floated around us like ghosts. And then we broke free of the alley and onto another street, light streaming all around us, and I knew where Preston was going.</p><p>\u201cIs that the embassy?\u201d I asked, already sure of the answer.</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>Even drenched and freezing, shocked and terrified, Preston was stronger than he looked. It was all I could do to stop him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted, jerking his arm, pulling him out of the street.</p><p>\u201cCam, we\u2019ll be safe at the embassy. It\u2019s US soil. They can\u2019t get us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Preston.\u201d I shook my head. I found his eyes. I had to make him see\u2014make him understand. But not even the Gallagher Academy can teach you how to change somebody\u2019s world, alter everything they\u2019d ever thought was true.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d he shouted. It went far beyond fear and rage and panic. Preston was desperate. And desperate people do desperate things. \u201cIt\u2019s the Circle, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re after us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because of last summer? Because you stayed here? Did you leave something or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Circle isn\u2019t after you, Preston. The Circle...it is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get your new bodyguards? Was it back before Christmas?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, but the answer was written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cA lot of strange things started happening then, didn\u2019t they?\u201d I asked him. \u201cMurders of prime ministers...disappearances of bigwigs in the European Union... Strange things keep happening to powerful people. People whose families have been powerful for centuries. People whose ancestors used to follow the teachings of a man named Iosef Cavan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Preston shook his head. He eased away from me.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Preston. Something has been different lately, hasn\u2019t it? Your dad, he\u2019s been changing his patterns. Fewer trips out of the embassy? New cars? New guards? New protocols?\u201d I spoke slowly, but still Preston inched farther and farther away from me and the things I had to say. \u201cSomeone is hunting Circle members, Preston\u2014the descendants of the Circle founders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Preston shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is hunting you.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, I reached into the pocket of my jeans, my cold hands scraping against the wet denim; but I clawed until I found the piece of paper. Gently, I unfolded it, peeling back the damp layers until I could look down at the names I knew by heart.</p><p>\u201cThis is why they wanted me, Preston. Because years ago I saw this list. Because I knew about the people who founded the Circle of Cavan. Look, Preston. Look!\u201d I pointed to the names. \u201cElias Crane. His great-great-great-great grandson is dead. Charles Dubois\u2019s great-great-great-great granddaughter and her kids are probably dead. Look at the last name, Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel is a family name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked. \u201cWasn\u2019t your dad named for a relative who fought in the Civil War?\u201d</p><p>There was no denying the truth in what I\u2019d said, but Preston just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSo what if he was? That doesn\u2019t mean my family has anything to do with the Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Preston.\u201d I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were nice to you. My dad helped you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to kill me, Preston. He would have killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a spy. You lie. It\u2019s what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying now.\u201d</p><p>Preston continued to inch away from me\u2014from the truth he no longer wanted to hear.</p><p>When a helicopter roared overhead and began to land in the courtyard inside the closed gates of the embassy, I looked away for a split second. I swear I didn\u2019t lose focus for more than a breath. But when I turned back, Preston was bolting into the street, into traffic, pushing people aside and running against the grain to the embassy\u2019s gates.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d he yelled, and then I saw what he was seeing. Ambassador Winters was out of the building and walking across the courtyard. He crouched beneath the chopper\u2019s spinning blades and only stopped when his son\u2019s cries broke through the air.</p><p>\u201cDad! Wait! Open the gates,\u201d Preston yelled.</p><p>\u201cPreston, stop,\u201d I called after him.</p><p>He stole a hurried, frantic glance in my direction, but ran even faster, as if he was no longer sure exactly who to trust. I totally knew the feeling.</p><p>\u201cOpen the gates!\u201d Preston yelled again, but the guards must have been given some kind of order because they glanced at the ambassador and the gates stayed closed.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Preston yelled. He gripped the iron fence, pleading. But the man only ran faster to the chopper and closed the door, blocking off the sound of Preston\u2019s cries.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Preston asked one final time. This time it wasn\u2019t a scream. It was a whimper.</p><p>Then the whole scene changed.</p><p>It was like the whole thing was happening in slow motion. I heard the sirens. I recognized the snipers for what they were the moment they appeared on the embassy\u2019s roof. What I didn\u2019t know was why.</p><p>The helicopter started to rise, but someone fired a warning shot and the chopper hovered.</p><p>More guards filled the courtyard, rifles trained on Preston\u2019s father. And when a voice came booming through a bullhorn, I knew.</p><p>\u201cSamuel Winters, you are under arrest,\u201d Agent Townsend said. I saw him appear then, through the crowd. My aunt Abby stood at his side, her dark hair blowing in the swirling wind. \u201cLand the chopper or we will fire. I repeat, we will fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...what\u2019s happening?\u201d Preston asked, turning to me. \u201cYou brought them here.\u201d He glared.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your aunt, Cammie! I know you brought her here!\u201d He pointed to where Agent Townsend was dragging Preston\u2019s father out of the helicopter and placing him in handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know they were coming. But I knew you were in danger,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will be okay, Preston. You have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>And maybe he would have. Maybe he would have believed what I was saying\u2014despite what he was seeing. Maybe everything would have made sense in a matter of time if Agent Townsend hadn\u2019t turned and started toward us, yelling, \u201cPreston Winters?\u201d</p><p>As soon as I heard Agent Townsend\u2019s voice, I felt a sense of relief. He\u2019d help us get Preston home. He\u2019d help us keep Preston safe.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they taking my father?\u201d Preston asked, but he didn\u2019t rush the man. He was shaking too badly. I didn\u2019t know if it was the cold or the rage, but I guess it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Agent Townsend reached for Preston\u2019s trembling hands. \u201cMr. Winters, you are under arrest for the suspicion of espionage.\u201d</p><p>Townsend spun Preston around, pressing his body into the fence.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d someone shouted. I saw Bex and Liz running toward us, neither of them able to keep up with Macey. They all had blankets draped over their shoulders, but Macey\u2019s blew free as she ran. She looked a lot like an angel losing her wings.</p><p>\u201cTake him away,\u201d Townsend told another agent, but Macey was on him then.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she yelled, trying to get to Preston. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is for us to determine, Ms. McHenry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong! You\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Agent Townsend had been our teacher. He\u2019d been our ally. Our confidant. Our friend. Sure, we\u2019d never really liked him; but I\u2019d grown fond of Agent Townsend. He was one of the good guys, but that didn\u2019t stop Macey\u2019s fists from beating against him. She looked frail and feminine. She didn\u2019t fight like a Gallagher Girl right then. She fought like a girl who was watching the only boy who\u2019d ever known and cared about the real her being dragged away. Maybe forever.</p><p>A pair of agents took Preston by each arm and led him to a white van that sat in the courtyard, lights spinning.</p><p>There was another van exactly like it not far away, and I could see the ambassador sitting in the back. The streets surrounding the embassy were on fire with lights and sirens and swarming crowds, but the ambassador looked only at me. He gave a nod in my direction as if to make sure I knew it wasn\u2019t over.</p><p>Then another man climbed into the back of the van and sat beside Preston\u2019s father. I recognized this new man, though it took me a moment to remember from where. The man\u2019s hair was slightly thinning. He had a normal build. A normal face. He could have been an accountant, an English teacher, a mid-level manager in any company in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he wasn\u2019t. He was Interpol. And when he brought a hand to his temple\u2014a tip of the imaginary hat\u2014I was quite certain that I would be seeing him again very, very soon.</p><p>When the agents closed the door and drove the man and Preston\u2019s father away, I looked down at the piece of paper that was still in my hands. The ink looked like blood, running across the page. Without a word, Liz handed me a pen, and I crossed off the name at the bottom of the list.</p><p>Four down.</p><p>Three to go.</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>We had dry clothes and hot coffee, but even as we sat on Macey\u2019s jet, I didn\u2019t feel any warmer. Or safer. In a few minutes, we\u2019d take off. In a few hours, we\u2019d be home. Preston was, technically, out of harm\u2019s way, but it still felt like our mission was a complete and utter failure.</p><p>Macey sat beside me, motionless. I wanted to tell her that it was okay, that Preston would be safe now. But Macey didn\u2019t want to hear it. Which was just as well. I didn\u2019t want to say it.</p><p>When the jet\u2019s door slid down and Aunt Abby stepped in, I thought that we were ready to go home. But then someone else climbed into the cabin.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Macey shouted at Agent Townsend. \u201cWhere\u2019s Preston?\u201d</p> <p>Macey was up and moving toward him, and I could have sworn Agent Townsend looked scared.</p><p>\u201cMacey.\u201d Abby blocked her way. \u201cI\u2019ll be asking the questions. Now, sit down,\u201d Abby ordered. And for once in her life, Macey did as she was told.</p><p>There was a bandage on Townsend\u2019s temple. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI will survive, Ms. Morgan. Thank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Abby snapped. \u201cCameron Ann Morgan, don\u2019t you sit there acting like you\u2019re so sorry. I\u2019m not even going to ask the four of you why you\u2019re here. I don\u2019t care. What were you thinking\u2014stumbling into a live op like that?\u201d my aunt asked, but all I could think of was how she\u2019d been when she first came to my school. Cocky and easy and fun. She\u2019d grown up. And I guess she wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><p>Bex shifted in her seat. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was a live op.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you should have known.\u201d Abby had her hand on her hip. She sounded like my mother. \u201cYou all should have known better. You\u2019re seniors. You should realize by now that everything you do comes with repercussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were we supposed to know you\u2019d be there?\u201d Macey challenged. She crossed her long arms. \u201cAll anyone ever says is Don\u2019t worry about Preston. Preston isn\u2019t in trouble. We won\u2019t let Preston get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we didn\u2019t,\u201d Abby countered. \u201cWe had eyes on the embassy at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that you could take him!\u201d Macey shouted, and, for that, not even Abby had an answer. She and Townsend shared a look and, I\u2019m not going to lie, it kind of scared me. Macey must have seen it too, because her voice changed. Anger morphed to terror.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere is he right now?\u201d</p><p>Townsend shook his head slowly. He ran a hand through his hair and took a seat. I watched my aunt lean ever so slightly against him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, Ms. McHenry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Macey snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWe would lie\u2014if we had to. But we aren\u2019t,\u201d Abby said with a shake of her head. \u201cAll Circle operatives are held in a high-security facility, the location of which is need-to-know, and we don\u2019t know. I can promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Macey told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Abby shook her head. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you the truth. He\u2019ll be okay, Macey. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s protocol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtocol for what?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be questioned, along with his father,\u201d Townsend said.</p><p>\u201cQuestioned...\u201d Macey started. \u201cYou mean, interrogated. You mean, tortured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the authorities\u2019 hands, girls,\u201d Abby said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Cammie is fine,\u201d Macey said, then glanced at me. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d I said. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t the Circle, Macey,\u201d Abby told her. \u201cWe\u2019re the good guys.\u201d</p><p>Macey crossed her arms. \u201cForgive me if I have my doubts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Preston\u2019s mother?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be questioned too, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cBut the Circle doesn\u2019t exactly admit spouses, so I doubt she knows anything. She\u2019ll stay at the embassy for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man...in the van with Preston\u2019s father\u2014\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Max Edwards,\u201d Townsend filled in before I could say anything more. \u201cHe used to be with Interpol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember him. I met him two years ago at the career fair. He told me he knew my father.\u201d I thought about the man who had given me his business card during my sophomore year. He\u2019d looked at me that night like he saw through my chameleonness. He\u2019d looked at me that way again that afternoon. Something about it made me feel uneasy, vulnerable. Naked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cEdwards has been in this business a long time. He knows everyone. That\u2019s why he\u2019s heading up the task force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat task force?\u201d Bex didn\u2019t even try to hide the skepticism in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSeems the intelligence community is finally starting to take the list seriously, girls,\u201d my aunt told us. \u201cEdwards is in charge of a brand-new task force that has just been put in place. It\u2019s not big. Just a few key agents from the CIA, MI6, all the usual suspects. They\u2019re supposed to track down the Inner Circle. Not that it\u2019s going to be easy. But they\u2019re going to try. And if today is any indication, they might just succeed. Winters is the first Inner Circle member to be taken alive, after all.\u201d</p><p>Knowing what we knew about the Circle\u2019s network of moles within the world\u2019s intelligence community, I started to agree. Maybe it would work. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t have to be alone in the search anymore. But Macey just crossed her arms and huffed.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the Inner Circle and their families?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPreston needed to be questioned, ladies,\u201d Agent Townsend said as if he expected that to be the end of it.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Liz spoke then. Her voice cracked. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d Abby leaned forward, staring at the four of us as if she were about to give us the most important lesson of our covert lives. \u201cYou should stop and listen to yourselves sometime. \u2018We\u2019re practically adults, let us run wild.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re only kids, leave us alone.\u2019\u201d I watched my aunt lean closer, emphasize every word. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is Preston\u2019s birthday, Macey?\u201d Townsend asked.</p><p>\u201cDecember fifth,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>\u201cThen he just turned eighteen, did he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s an adult now, by our standards. And the Circle\u2019s.\u201d Townsend looked at us all as if part of him truly hated what he had to say. \u201cSo no matter what we know about his father\u2019s dealings, at this moment, there is a good possibility that Preston knows more.\u201d</p><p>Macey was shaking her head. \u201cNo. No. He didn\u2019t know a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he?\u201d Townsend asked. \u201cAbby is right. You want to be treated like grown-ups? Well, that includes both the good and the bad. And the possibility exists, ladies, that Preston Winters might be very bad indeed.\u201d</p><p>My roommates and I fell into silence. I didn\u2019t say a thing because, like it or not, the adults in my life were right far more often than they were wrong.</p><p>The Circle had always been a step or two ahead\u2014and right then, I didn\u2019t like where those steps were going.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>It was dark when the jet finally landed. I\u2019m sure I must have slept on the long ride over the Atlantic, but I didn\u2019t really remember. I just remember staring out the window: watching, thinking, waiting for something, but what, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>On the Tarmac, Agent Townsend whispered something to Abby, then squeezed her hand and kissed her softly when he didn\u2019t think we were watching. But we\u2019re Gallagher Girls. To tell you the truth, we are always watching.</p><p>Abby let him go, her eyes a little misty. And I couldn\u2019t help myself\u2014I thought about Zach. He was out in the world somewhere. And a part of me worried that I might never see him again.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, girls,\u201d Abby told us when we walked through the doors. The lights were out. Our school was sleeping, and in the stillness I could feel how far we\u2019d gone, and how far we still had to go.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again,\u201d Abby snapped, and started down the hall that led to the stairs to the teachers\u2019 quarters. \u201cNow go to bed.\u201d</p><p>And maybe we would have done exactly that, except when we reached the top of the Grand Stairs, I saw the light seeping from underneath my mother\u2019s office door, and that was all the invitation I needed. I raced down the Hall of History and never looked back.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d I yelled. \u201cMom, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d I said, bursting through the door; but then I stopped cold because Joe Solomon was lying on the leather couch in my mother\u2019s office. And, oh yeah, his shirt was totally off.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d I said. I might have physically stumbled. But what else was I supposed to do at the sight of my teacher\u2014and my mom\u2019s new sort-of boyfriend\u2014with his shirt off?</p><p>It was epic. It was awkward. It was epically awkward.</p><p>And judging from the traffic jam of girls who were plowing into me from behind, I totally wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Liz echoed me but couldn\u2019t find the words to finish, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Mr. Solomon said, and then he tried to sit upright. I could see the bruises that covered his chest, spreading across his ribs. When he shifted on the sofa, I saw the massive gash in his side, and I felt the cold feeling of dread that maybe he wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d gotten hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Zach?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Mr. Solomon said, even though, technically, he hadn\u2019t answered my question.</p><p>\u201cStep aside, girls,\u201d my mother said from behind us, and we moved out of the doorway and into the office, watched her dip a sponge into a bowl of sudsy water and kneel at Mr. Solomon\u2019s feet. He winced when she brought the sponge to the long, ragged knife wound that ran across his ribs.</p><p>\u201cWimp,\u201d she told him. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cDid you find Catherine?\u201d Bex blurted. \u201cDid she do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mr. Solomon shook his head. He sounded more disappointed than pained, like he\u2019d gladly suffer a thousand cuts if it meant bringing Zach\u2019s mother to her end.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Zach?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs he...\u201d I trailed off. I just looked at Mr. Solomon\u2019s blood and couldn\u2019t finish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo to bed, girls,\u201d Mom said, but she didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cI will deal with you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Liz started.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing.\u201d Mom never took her eyes off of Joe Solomon. He winced again when she started wrapping a bandage tighter and tighter around his ribs.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital staff should be doing this,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>Mr. Solomon smiled. \u201cI like the nurse I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls, I need to debrief Mr. Solomon, and he needs to visit the hospital wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Solomon said, but Mom gave him her \u201cmom\u201d look and he backed down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to tell me about his mission, and then he\u2019s going to have his head CAT scanned and his ribs X-rayed. I will talk to you girls in the morning.\u201d She ushered us toward the door. \u201cIt will all be better tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to think it was true\u2014that my mother was right, and that there was nothing a night in my own bed would not fix. But I wasn\u2019t so certain. Especially when we walked into the suite and saw that someone was already sleeping in my bed.</p> <p>\u201cZach!\u201d I didn\u2019t care that I was yelling. I ran to him. He propped himself up on one elbow and gave me a sleepy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou woke me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be in this part of the school,\u201d I said.</p><p>He took my hand, held it against his chest, and said, \u201cSpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Zachary.\u201d Bex was sauntering through the door. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you. Now, get out.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He pushed himself off the bed and started for the door, pulling me along behind him.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t say a word as we crept down the hall lined with suites filled with sleeping girls. Neither of us spoke when we reached the spiraling staircase at the back of the school.</p><p>The stone was cold against my skin. A freezing wind blew through the cracks in the old windows. But Zach\u2019s hand was warm in mine, and I didn\u2019t feel the chill, even when he stopped me on the stairs, pressed me against the wall, and kissed me. Softly at first, then more urgently, hungrily. It was like he hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said finally, pulling back and running his hands through my hair.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said and kissed him again. I didn\u2019t think about the classes I\u2019d missed or the ones that would be waiting on me in just a few hours. I couldn\u2019t even dream of going to bed.</p><p>\u201cYou were gone,\u201d I whispered into his skin. \u201cYou were gone for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go again,\u201d I told him, but he said nothing. That was the kind of promise that spies could never make, so he just took my hand and led me farther down the stairs, into the wide corridor that ran along the back of the school.</p><p>\u201cYou saw Preston?\u201d he asked when we reached the warmth of the hall.</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd they took him?\u201d</p><p>Again, I couldn\u2019t say the words but didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you, Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking\u201d was his answer.</p><p>\u201cFor your mom?\u201d My voice cracked, but I didn\u2019t hide it.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe found us. In Cambridge. She killed Walter Knight.\u201d I made myself look at him, see the hurt that filled his eyes. He already knew about our mission, of course. But I had to say it anyway. I had to be the one to tell him, even if he wasn\u2019t hearing it for the first time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. If she hurt you...\u201d He ran his hand along my neck and shifted my head, as if to make sure everything was the way it should be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I will, Cammie.\u201d He pulled away from me then, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to touch me with his hands\u2014dirty hands. Like I deserved better than to be touched by the hands of a killer. \u201cSomeday. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I reached for him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was sad, not cocky. It was like he\u2019d seen the future, and he was finally telling me the thing he\u2019d always known, Zachary Goode\u2019s great and final secret. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you, Zach? What happened to Mr. Solomon? To you?\u201d</p><p>Zach ran a hand through his hair. He was far too young to look so exhausted.</p><p>\u201cYou know how we started out tracking my mom.... Well, we figured the best way to find her would be to find whatever Circle descendant she had her sights set on next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDelauhunt,\u201d Zach told me. \u201cFrederick Delauhunt. He\u2019s an arms dealer. We tracked him down to this fortress outside of Buenos Aires. He probably had fifty armed guards. And we could tell by the activity in the compound that they were getting ready to move him. We should have waited for backup, but I kept thinking about what would happen if we didn\u2019t find him again. I thought about what they did to you. And then I got stupid.\u201d Zach took a deep breath. \u201cAnd Joe got hurt.\u201d</p><p>He eased slowly away, almost like he was content to leave me, like deep down he knew that I was better off without him. \u201cYou should probably go to bed, Gallagher Girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go to bed anyway. Try to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>I leaned into him. \u201cNo. I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d I took both his hands in mine and stepped backward. \u201cDo you want to see something cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked with that roguish grin he\u2019d first given me when he\u2019d walked through our doors as an exchange student. Before things got complicated. Before his mother changed my life.</p><p>I walked to an old candelabra that the housekeeping staff rarely remembered to clean, so it was dusty when I reached for it. And pulled.</p><p>Slowly, a door opened a crack. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Zach asked, creeping closer.</p><p>I took his hand again. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>There was a time when I loved being in the secret passageways on my own. I would slip inside the darkness and disappear, be alone in the middle of a hundred people, be myself inside a place where you spend most of your time learning to be somebody else.</p><p>I\u2019d never shown that one to Bex. I\u2019d never brought Liz or Macey there to study. That was my private passage, and as I held on to Zach\u2019s hand, it felt very much like it still was. Only then, it wasn\u2019t mine. It was ours.</p><p>We squeezed together through dusty corridors and tight shadowy spaces, skirting between decaying beams. It must have been the servants\u2019 quarters once upon a time, because there was a round window there in the narrow space. It stared out to the east, across the grounds and the hills and the trees.</p><p>We stood together, looking out at a world that was covered with frost, a shimmering white glow.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Zach said. He pressed up against the window, which fogged with his breath.</p><p>Sometime years before, I had dragged an old bean bag chair to that place. I watched Zach sink onto it, and then he pulled me down to lean against him. I felt his arms go around me, holding me tight.</p><p>I was safe.</p><p>I was warm.</p><p>I was home.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>PROS AND CONS OF THE WEEK THAT FOLLOWED:</p><p>PRO: Nothing helps take your mind off of stumbling into (and almost messing up) a live CIA operation like makeup work.</p><p>CON: We had to do a lot of makeup work.</p><p>PRO: We no longer had to wonder whether or not Zach\u2019s mom was going to come after Preston at the embassy.</p><p>CON: We had no idea where Preston was.</p><p>PRO: Zach was back.</p><p>CON: I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it was just a matter of time until we all had to go away again.</p><p>I could tell you that the week that followed was a pretty typical week at the Gallagher Academy. I could tell you that, but I\u2019d be lying. After all, my roommates and I were not just the girls who had missed the first few days of classes of the spring semester\u2014we were also the girls who had been there when Ambassador Winters was taken into custody, which in teenage-spy-girl terms didn\u2019t make us famous. It made us infamous. And let me tell you, that is a really big distinction.</p><p>\u201cSo, Cam,\u201d Tina Walters said, slipping her arm through mine as we walked into the Grand Hall, \u201cI heard that Winters is locked in an underwater facility off the coast of Greenland. What do you know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Tina,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut the cover story is bogus, right? I mean, I know they\u2019ve told the press that he was extracted based on intel that he was going to be the target of a terror plot, but that\u2019s not true, is it?\u201d</p><p>Tina leaned a little closer, studying me so intently I thought my skin might catch fire. I was sure she didn\u2019t actually know the truth. Very few people did. That\u2019s the thing about spies. Most of the secrets we keep are from each other.</p><p>I liked Tina.</p><p>I even trusted Tina.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t tell Tina the truth. Not because she was the school gossip (even though she was), but because, from that point forward, almost everything about my life was on a need-to-know basis and, right then, Tina didn\u2019t. No matter how much she probably thought otherwise.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Tina asked slowly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue, Tina.\u201d I shook my head, and thought about the look the ambassador had given me as he sat in the back of the van, defiant. Had that look been a threat? A warning? Or maybe just a good-bye. I shook my head again and said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d realizing it wasn\u2019t even a lie.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Courtney started, leaning into the conversation as we sat down at the senior table, \u201cis what is the deal with Preston Winters...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d Anna Fetterman said, then blushed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tina agreed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he was really cute when they led him away in handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>Anna gasped. \u201cThey didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Tina nodded slowly. \u201cThey did. To tell you the truth, I always got the feeling he might be kind of evil. It\u2019s the dimples,\u201d she hurried to add. \u201cI, for one, never trust a boy with dimples.\u201d</p><p>Macey bristled but didn\u2019t say a word. After that, the Grand Hall fell quiet. Or as quiet as the Grand Hall ever is. I wanted to grab Macey and pull her away, tell her that it was all going to be fine. That Tina and the CIA and MI6 and that man from Interpol were all wrong\u2014that Preston wasn\u2019t like his father.</p><p>But just then, from across the table, Bex caught my eye, and I could tell she was thinking it too: What if he is?</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d Professor Buckingham\u2019s voice came slicing through the Grand Hall, \u201cif you are finished with your breakfast, I need you to come with me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I bolted to my feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight this way, dear,\u201d Buckingham said. She swept her arm toward the big double doors, and I didn\u2019t have a choice. I followed.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I couldn\u2019t move\u2014couldn\u2019t speak. I stood just inside my mother\u2019s office door looking at the man I\u2019d last seen sitting in a van with Ambassador Winters in Rome. I remembered everything about him\u2014the moment he\u2019d given me his business card two years before as I snuck out of our school to see my first boyfriend; the look on his face two days before as they were driving Preston and his father away. I knew exactly who I\u2019d been brought to see. What I couldn\u2019t imagine was why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He seemed to doubt my memory, though, because he extended a hand.</p><p>\u201cWe met once\u2014a long time ago.

More recently of a high-level task force in charge of arresting high-level Circle leaders and their teenage sons.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little, amused by my moxie, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again, Cammie. I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get to speak in Rome. I\u2019ve become something of...a fan.\u201d</p> <p>He had a way of speaking, low and almost under his breath, as if I were the only person in the world who was meant to hear his words, even as we stood three feet away from my mother.</p><p>\u201cOh. Really?\u201d I said, almost mocking, as he looked at me over the top of his glasses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment, Cammie. You\u2019ve made quite a name for yourself, you know?\u201d</p><p>I did know. But I was also pretty sure that it wasn\u2019t the kind of compliment covert operatives usually wanted.</p><p>He lowered his voice even further. \u201cI was very sorry to hear about your father\u2019s passing. And what you went through. You have my condolences, Cammie.\u201d</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t want his sympathy. So I just turned toward my mother. \u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here with a request,\u201d my mother said.</p><p>\u201cAs you are well aware, Cammie, the Circle of Cavan is currently engaged in a record level of activity,\u201d the man told me. \u201cAs such, there is a new interagency task force. CIA. MI6. Interpol. Israeli Secret Service. All the usual players are taking part, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all this. Get to the part I don\u2019t know,\u201d I told him, my patience running out.</p><p>\u201cWhat you saw in Italy, Cammie. That was the result of this task force. We\u2019re going to track the Circle leaders down.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my mother, and Agent Edwards must have read the look that passed between us.</p> <p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Cammie. The Circle has double agents, moles, traitors at every level of every agency. Well...that\u2019s why this task force doesn\u2019t report to any agency. We are very small. We are very select. We only have people we trust completely. And one of the people I trust most...is you. That is why I\u2019ve come to ask a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing any favors for you,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cHear him out, Cammie,\u201d Mom warned, but I raged on.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring Preston here?\u201d I asked, but I didn\u2019t really let myself be hopeful.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Max Edwards said. \u201cBut there is something you and I need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake about it, Agent Edwards, you can try to make me talk\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be the first,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t work out so well the last time, so you can save yourself the trouble.\u201d</p><p>I started for the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to question you, Cammie.\u201d The man\u2019s words stopped me. \u201cNot about Preston. Not about anything.\u201d</p> <p>And I couldn\u2019t help myself. I turned and glared at him. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as if looking for a way to finally say, \u201cI guess because we need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me,\u201d he said, and I didn\u2019t move again. \u201cAs you know, when possible, we\u2019ve been taking Circle members into custody. A few of the lower-level assets have been somewhat cooperative. But Mr. Winters...he is refusing to speak to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d I laughed a little at his na\u00efvet\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He smiled a condescending smile. \u201cWhat I meant to say is that he refuses to speak to anyone...but you.\u201d</p><p>And at last I was surprised. For all of his experience and training, Agent Edwards and his task force needed me.</p><p>\u201cAs I told you earlier, Agent Edwards,\u201d Mom began, \u201cmy daughter does not have to go anywhere with you. She doesn\u2019t have to help you. She will not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie,\u201d my mother said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do this. You don\u2019t have to go and you do not have to help. It could be dangerous,\u201d she added, the last part a warning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Cammie,\u201d Agent Edwards said, walking toward me. \u201cYour mother is right. So what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I never got to finish, because in the next second a syringe was in Agent Edwards\u2019s hand, and the needle was in my arm, and just that quickly my mother\u2019s office began to spin, the whole world spiraling quickly into black.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The room was black around me. A pounding, throbbing ache filled my head. I waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but they didn\u2019t. Instead, I was swallowed by the hollow emptiness, uncertain how to break free.</p><p>I shivered and realized I was freezing cold. My uniform felt familiar against my skin, and I knew that no one had bothered to change my clothes in the time that I\u2019d been unconscious. But how long had that been? A few hours? A few days? The last time I\u2019d woken up in a strange place, I\u2019d just lost months of my life, and that memory came pounding back then. My head hurt. My arms and legs ached. I felt something churning in my stomach, and I couldn\u2019t help myself, I was sick\u2014vomit covered the floor, and I started to cry. I started to scream. I wanted out. I needed out. So I stood and pressed my hands against the walls.</p><p>I felt cold steel. Metal. Something man-made and foreign. And I knew that even though I was no longer being held by the Circle in Austria, I most certainly wasn\u2019t in the Gallagher Academy anymore, either.</p><p>Slowly, I eased down the wall, feeling my way as I went, forcing myself to breathe deeply, steadily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said aloud to no one but myself. \u201cI\u2019m not lost. I\u2019m not lost. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then I found the lever. And then I turned it and felt the door shift against my hands. Light poured in, and I shut my eyes as I stumbled forward, out of the back of a van and into a massive, empty hangar. Bright fluorescent lights hung above; but inside there was nothing but the plain, unmarked van...and me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cammie.\u201d I jerked my head upward and saw Max Edwards standing on the catwalk that ran across the top of the room. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked, my voice groggier than it should have been. My head pounded and swirled.</p><p>Agent Edwards was coming down the stairs, strolling easily toward me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to wake up alone like that, Cammie. I thought you\u2019d sleep for at least another hour. Good thing I came to check on you.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my aching head. \u201cMy grandma says I have a high metabolism. Besides, I\u2019m really, really good at being knocked unconscious. I have a lot of experience with that.\u201d</p><p>Agent Edwards chuckled like he thought I was making a joke. I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me where we are, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cammie. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr when we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo again. A smart girl like you can use time to calculate distance, Cammie, and you know I can\u2019t let you do that. That wasn\u2019t part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is need-to-know, and I don\u2019t?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Max Edwards led the way down a long, narrow hallway. Cameras hung at regular intervals. It was all steel and concrete, and I felt the chill that seeped through the walls. \u201cSo how far underground are we?\u201d I asked the man, who didn\u2019t say a thing.</p><p>We passed beneath a series of strange grates.</p><p>\u201cBiohazard detectors?\u201d I asked. \u201cAir vents?\u201d</p><p>Again, the man was silent, but I didn\u2019t need him to reply. I just needed him to take me to Preston, so I kept counting our steps, noticing the gradual incline of the hall. I wasn\u2019t exactly new to covert underground facilities, so wobbly head and upset stomach or not, I was starting to feel like I might be on slightly familiar ground. But then the hallway turned, and I came to an abrupt stop in front of the most intimidating door I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is special,\u201d I said while Edwards waved up at a security camera that was stationed overhead. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better\u201d\u2014I talked on while Edwards placed his palm on a scanner and looked into a retinal image camera\u2014\u201cI\u2019d say this is a door fit for a...\u201d</p><p>The door sprang open, swinging wide, as I finished, \u201c...prison.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up at Agent Edwards, but again he said nothing. Still, I could see in his eyes that I was right.</p><p>There were guards and thick walls. Cameras covered every angle, not hidden, not disguised. It was a place built to remind you that Big Brother was watching.</p><p>The doors were made to lock down in a flash. It was all steel and chrome and concrete, and even if Edwards had had the forethought to pack me a jacket, I\u2019m pretty sure I would have shivered.</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be in prison,\u201d I snapped at the man beside me. But Agent Edwards only laughed, a condescending huff that, despite the chill, burned me.</p><p>\u201cPreston Winters is the next generation of one of the most powerful and notorious criminal families in the history of the world. Put your hand here, Cammie,\u201d he instructed, almost as an afterthought, but I did as I was told.</p><p>My palm stung, but I didn\u2019t let him see me wince.</p><p>Finally, the guards cleared us to go through yet another massive door. I felt Agent Edwards\u2019s hand on my back. If I hadn\u2019t known better, I would have sworn he was worried for me as he instructed, \u201cOnce in the room, Cammie, do not leave your chair. You cannot carry anything in your pockets or in your hair. Do not mention the day of the week or the time of day.\u201d</p><p>There, among those windowless rooms and artificial lights, I knew the game they were playing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the day of the week or the time of day,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He didn\u2019t scold me. He sounded too nervous.</p><p>\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d I told him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are the rules, Cammie. Now, you can abide by them, or you can leave and we will have gone to a great deal of trouble for nothing. It\u2019s your call.\u201d</p><p>There comes a time in every spy\u2019s life when you don\u2019t have the luxury of caring. Emotion is a rarity, a commodity so precious that you have to dole it out in special, secret batches. Agent Edwards had passed that point. This was a place for people who had to be immune to what they did, to what it meant. And I didn\u2019t know if the chill inside the prison came from being underground or from the cold hearts of the people who filled it.</p><p>He looked at me as if I were still young and innocent, as if part of him envied me because I was still able to feel. A part of me wondered how much longer I had before my heart froze over too.</p><p>\u201cCome, Cammie.\u201d He reached for the final door. \u201cYour country needs you.\u201d</p><p>The first time I met Preston Winters he\u2019d been twenty pounds too light for his frame, wearing clothes that were chosen by some focus group somewhere. He\u2019d been too quick to smile\u2014too easy to laugh. He\u2019d been all about bad jokes and good eye contact, and I\u2019d liked him. I\u2019d liked him a lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But walking into the small, sterile room with a lone metal chair and a window of darkened glass, I couldn\u2019t imagine the boy I knew inside that place. The Preston Winters I\u2019d met had been normal. Helpless. Free.</p><p>\u201cI can stay with you, Cammie....\u201d Agent Edwards sounded nervous, afraid for me, as if part of him were starting to regret bringing me here and making me a part of this world. But it was my world too.</p><p>I thought about the scars on my body.</p><p>It was my fight.</p> <p>So I turned to him. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>I walked nervously to the heavy metal chair in the center of the room and sat down like I\u2019d been told to do. In the reflection of the glass I could see the cameras trained on me. I had no illusion of privacy. Preston and I would be recorded from every angle; they wouldn\u2019t miss a single word. But at least I\u2019d get to see him. At least I\u2019d get to tell Macey he was okay.</p><p>I sat alone for ten minutes, but I didn\u2019t shift. I didn\u2019t waver. I wasn\u2019t about to let the men on the other side of those cameras see me sweat.</p><p>Then a buzzer sounded. The glass went bright, and I looked through to the other side at Ambassador Winters, who sat smiling back at me.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Preston?\u201d I lunged forward and was almost off my chair before I remembered Agent Edwards\u2019s warning. I scooted back slightly but didn\u2019t dare let my gaze leave the ambassador\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Cammie,\u201d Winters told me. \u201cYou\u2019d know better than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he...\u201d I started before the truth finally settled down on me. \u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d The ambassador crossed his ankles. He looked perfectly at home there in a room exactly like mine. But he wore shackles around his hands and feet. \u201cYou\u2019re a very intelligent young lady. Maybe I missed your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy with me. And don\u2019t waste my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened, Cammie,\u201d he said, not answering my question.</p><p>\u201cSorry that you tried to have me killed, or sorry that I had enough dumb luck to avoid it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head\u2014a tsk, tsk, tsk gesture that made my skin crawl. \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky, my dear. But you are anything but dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said you wanted to talk to me\u2014that I was the only person you would talk to.... So, what is it? What do you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Despite the handcuffs and shackles, Winters leaned closer, looked into my eyes. \u201cHow are you, Cammie?\u201d</p><p>He sounded like the man who had welcomed me into the embassy, embraced me like a friend. And I hated him for it. I hated him so, so much.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to ask me that. You don\u2019t get to act like you\u2019re one of the good guys. Don\u2019t forget. Do not forget that I know better.\u201d</p> <p>I watched the words sink in, and for a second I could have sworn a degree of sadness crossed his face. \u201cI know you do, Cammie. But I\u2019m still interested in your welfare.\u201d</p><p>I started to stand. \u201cGood-bye, Mr. Winters. I wish I could stay and chat, but we\u2019ve got this big test, and I\u2019d really better be getting back to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Cammie. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why you brought me here, or I go. Now. And I never come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the Circle, Cammie?\u201d</p><p>He shifted then, not with his body but with his tone.</p><p>\u201cStop wasting my time,\u201d I told him again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know when we were founded? By whom? Why?\u201d</p><p>He put a special emphasis on the final word and that, at last, made me wonder.</p><p>\u201cCavan was a proud man,\u201d Winters went on. He didn\u2019t wait for me to answer. \u201cHe hated anyone who might have more power than he had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the point,\u201d I snapped, and Winters talked on.</p><p>\u201cCavan wanted\u2014no, needed\u2014the Union to fail. A divided America was the only America he could stomach. And that meant he needed Lincoln to die. For the country to splinter, shatter. So the question is, Cammie, what does the Circle need now?\u201d</p><p>For a second, I forgot he was a man who\u2019d tried to kill me, and I looked at him like he was one of my teachers, like it was just another day back at school.</p><p>\u201cThe Circle wants power. They need profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cammie.\u201d Winters shook his head, but he didn\u2019t scold. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, we allowed ourselves to stray from Cavan\u2019s original mission. We got greedy, hungry for physical wealth, and Cavan\u2019s original goal slipped from our minds. I do so admire the Gallagher Academy. It is still what your founder wanted it to be. Of course, Gillian Gallagher did it all without government involvement. I wonder what she would say if she saw the way the agencies have the run over your school today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a governor, an ambassador. You were almost president\u2014and you mean to tell me that you hate the government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should governments have more power than the people they\u2019re supposed to govern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this supposed to be a social studies class? Because I haven\u2019t had one of those in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe strayed from our mission, Cammie. Zach\u2019s mother\u2014Catherine\u2014she\u2019s just one of our operatives who became greedy. But people like Catherine were only reflecting what they saw in our leadership. We lost sight of our ultimate goal, and now the Circle is crumbling. And so those of us in the Inner Circle decided that it is time to finish Cavan\u2019s original mission.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to Cambridge, the mad terror in Knight\u2019s eyes as he talked about whatever it was the Circle was planning. I had thought the truth had died with him, but there it was again\u2014staring back at me through three inches of reinforced glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat mission is it?\u201d I asked, lurching forward. \u201cWhat is the Inner Circle planning? Tell me how to stop it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned a little closer. The shackles on his wrists jangled as he pointed in my direction and said, \u201cElizabeth Sutton is a very smart girl.\u201d</p><p>The abrupt change in subject knocked the air out of me. I had wanted answers and I got games. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Liz,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIf that\u2019s some kind of threat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt Ms. Sutton. And you...well, you would do well to listen to her. She is wise beyond her years.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and spat, \u201cWhat does Liz have to do with this?\u201d I was racked with confusion and fatigue. \u201cWhy am I here? Why are you telling me all of this? Why aren\u2019t you telling them?\u201d I pointed to the cameras that lined the room, covering every possible angle.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have a favor to ask of you, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>I watched his eyes grow darker. Any trace of happiness was gone. I no longer thought he was enjoying himself, playing with me. He was a desperate man. And he looked at me as if I were his only way out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped.</p><p>The ambassador looked down at his bound hands. \u201cMy son. He\u2019s not part of this, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston will be fine. He\u2019s in custody. Catherine can\u2019t get to him now.\u201d</p><p>The ambassador\u2019s eyes iced over. \u201cNone of us will ever be fine again. But my son can help you stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have they done?\u201d I asked again, more urgent now. I thought about what Knight had told me. \u201cThe Circle leaders got together and put something into motion. What was it?\u201d Impatience and fear were breaking through my voice. \u201cTell me what I have to do!\u201d</p><p>He was opening his mouth to speak\u2014the words were almost there. A few moments longer and Winters would have told me everything we needed to know, but they were moments we didn\u2019t have. Because before Preston\u2019s father could say another word, the glass that stood between us went black.</p><p>\u201cAmbassador?\u201d I yelled and glanced at the door, expecting a guard to knock\u2014come in and tell me that my time was up. But no knock came. I looked at the cameras, but the tiny lights were out and I knew that they were off. No one was watching. No guards were monitoring our conversation. I was alone in the quiet room, and I felt the hair on my arms stand on end. Everything was too still, too quiet, as I broke with protocol and rushed toward the glass.</p><p>\u201cAmbassador! Ambassador, are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I raised my hand and started to bang, but then I heard the sounds of a struggle on the other side. Sharp cracks filled the air\u2014twice, in rapid succession, and I bolted away just as a third crack sounded.</p><p>The thick glass that separated the two rooms must have been bullet resistant\u2014but not bulletproof\u2014because the glass began to splinter, cracks spreading out like a spiderweb.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d I yelled into the cameras, but I knew no one would hear me.</p><p>I ran to the door and peered out the tiny window just in time to see the door to the next room open.</p><p>There was a small, basic lock on my door. It seemed out of place there in that high-security fortress; but I turned it anyway and backed away slowly, hoping that whoever had shot the ambassador wouldn\u2019t care about me. I was a visitor\u2014a kid. There was nothing trapped inside of me that anybody wanted anymore. I was nothing, I told myself.</p><p>But then the doorknob moved.</p><p>Someone pushed against the door, but the lock held, and I jerked backward just as something heavy crashed against the door.</p><p>In my head, lists were forming. Plans. Options. But the fact remained that I was locked in a room with no weapons and no...</p><p>Window.</p><p>I picked up the metal chair and took aim at the center of the web that filled the heavy glass.</p><p>Out in the hall, someone banged against the door, so I hit harder.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said to no one but myself. \u201cCome\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then the glass shattered, falling to the floor. I jumped over the partition and into the other room, where the ambassador was still bound to his chair as he lay on the floor. Blood stained the concrete. His face looked almost peaceful as he stared up at me and gave me one last smile.</p><p>\u201cSave Preston,\u201d he whispered, eyelids fluttering.</p><p>And then he died.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Even as I watched the life drain out of Preston\u2019s father, I knew that I should run. And yet I felt like I should wait, hold his hand, tell him that his son was going to be okay. But there are some lies even spies can\u2019t tell a dying man.</p><p>The door to the room where I\u2019d been sitting banged open, and I didn\u2019t wait for the shooter to realize I was gone\u2014to see me on the other side of the shattered glass and follow. I leaped over the ambassador\u2019s lifeless body and hurled myself into the hall, running away from the interrogation rooms as quickly as I could.</p><p>But my breath came harder than it should have. I told myself that I\u2019d eaten too much of Grandma Morgan\u2019s fudge over Christmas\u2014that maybe the drugs they\u2019d used to transport me there weren\u2019t entirely out of my system. Whatever the case, my legs didn\u2019t move as quickly as they should have. My breath was labored and heavy, and after a hundred feet, I wanted to double over and catch my breath, but I didn\u2019t dare slow down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If I slowed down, I\u2019d die.</p><p>I was deep underground in a facility so secure there were probably only a handful of people who knew it even existed, but someone from the Circle had found Winters there. Someone was still looking for me.</p><p>The corridor curved and branched, and footsteps echoed in the hallway. I looked for a way out, but then I realized a pair of guards was running toward me.</p><p>A deep voice ordered, \u201cSpread out. Find her.\u201d</p> <p>I thought maybe I should trust them, but then I remembered I couldn\u2019t trust anybody.</p><p>So I pressed myself deeper into the shadows and the pair ran past. As soon as they were gone, alarms began to sound. The overhead fluorescents pulsed. The lights on the surveillance cameras began to blink, and I knew that the system was rebooting. It wasn\u2019t just a camera malfunction, the sirens said. The facility knew there was a breach, a gunman. A body. They would know that I was on the loose, and maybe they would blame me\u2014how did I know? All I was sure of was that I wasn\u2019t safe there.</p><p>My side ached and my head hurt, and when the hallway branched, I stopped and looked and listened.</p><p>Heavy cables ran overhead, electrical lines that carried currents and pictures and sound. But one hall had fewer lines, so that was where I went.</p><p>I slowed my pace, moving carefully. There was a storage room that was locked. A vacant room that I thought must have been a cell. And then there was another door. Through the tiny window, I looked into what must have been a guardroom. Monitors covered one wall, and on them I saw people walking in cells, sleeping on cots.</p> <p>Red lights whirled. Gates swung shut. The images changed then, and I saw him.</p><p>\u201cPreston.\u201d</p><p>He was asleep in a cell\u2014I didn\u2019t know where. He looked so peaceful. So innocent. There was no way for him to know that somewhere in that labyrinth, his father\u2019s body was lying on the floor\u2014that I still had his blood on my hands.</p><p>And then more than ever I knew I had to get out of there. I had to survive so that I could get him out too.</p><p>Thirty yards down the corridor, a metal barrier began to fall out of the ceiling, blocking off the only other exit. I had no idea what lay in that direction, but I knew I couldn\u2019t go back the way I\u2019d come, so I bolted forward. My hands pumped at my sides. My lungs burned, but I didn\u2019t let that stop me as I dropped to the ground, sliding faster and faster. I felt the metal barrier graze against my hair\u2014a few strands even caught in it\u2014nothing but faint traces that I had been there as I made it to the other side.</p><p>There was an air shaft. I didn\u2019t know where it led or what would greet me on the other side, but what else was new?</p> <p>Cold hit me as I opened the shaft.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think twice. I shimmied inside. And that was when I felt the fall.</p><p>You might think I\u2019m exaggerating. But, believe me, this time I\u2019m totally not. I felt myself begin to slide, with nothing to hold on to. No way to stop my descent. Suddenly, I burst free of the shaft and landed on what felt like a slab of solid ice.</p><p>But then even the ground gave way beneath me, and soon I was falling, tumbling. Snow covered me, and I rolled over and over. Freezing dampness clung to my hair and my skin. My teeth rattled, and instantly I understood why my breath had been so labored, why my head had hurt so much.</p><p>Agent Edwards hadn\u2019t brought me down to the facility. I clawed backward, easing across the ledge on which I lay.</p><p>He\u2019d brought me up.</p><p>I looked out at a sky that was so blue it was almost too bright to look at. A few fluffy white clouds floated by. Ridges of mountains surrounded me, and everywhere there was snow and rocks and big pine trees heavy with needles.</p><p>Those weren\u2019t the Alps, I was certain. The air and the sky just felt different than they had last fall. My internal clock had reset itself somehow, and I knew the sun felt lower than it should have. I was north. Very, very north. Alaska, maybe? And I was alone, clinging to a narrow ridge, a foot from the edge of the world.</p> <p>They\u2019d come looking for me eventually, wouldn\u2019t they? Follow my tracks? Find me? But would they reach me before night fell and the temperature dropped? Never before had my uniform skirt felt so short, my sweater so thin. I couldn\u2019t stop shaking and telling myself that I had come too far to freeze to death on that mountain.</p><p>People would be looking for me. The gunman would get caught. I was going to be okay, but only if I kept going, so I didn\u2019t look back. A hundred yards down the steep face of the cliff, I saw a loading bay\u2014what I assumed was probably the main entrance to the facility. So I set one foot in front of the other and got ready to make the climb.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>THINGS TO EXPECT AFTER A SECURITY BREACH AT MAYBE THE MOST SECURE PRISON ON THE PLANET (ALSO, AFTER CLIMBING DOWN A MOUNTAIN):</p><p>(A list by Cameron Morgan)</p><p>Hot chocolate. Seriously. The guards who find you are going to insist that you keep moving and change into warmer clothes, but the real medicine is hot chocolate. The hotter and the chocolatier the better.</p><p>Turns out, if you escape from a high-level detention facility, really big, really macho guys stop looking at you like you\u2019re cute and start looking at you like you\u2019re awesome.</p><p>After doing a climb like that with no gear and no help, nobody seems to think they need to drug you to get you OFF the mountain.</p><p>The trip home takes A LOT longer when you\u2019re fully conscious.</p><p>Long trips are an excellent time to think.</p><p>You may totally not like what you\u2019re left to think about.</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d Mom said as soon as I walked through the school\u2019s front doors. She rushed across the foyer and threw her arms around me. Then, just as quickly, she pushed me away\u2014held me at arm\u2019s length\u2014and examined me as if trying to make sure Agent Edwards was returning me in the same condition I\u2019d been in when I\u2019d left.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t. And my mother, spy that she is, could see so.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>But my mother just slid her gaze onto Agent Edwards. \u201cDid they find out how the shooter got in?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUh...yes.\u201d He spoke the word too carefully. \u201cThe gunman was a guard at the facility. He\u2019d been turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Mom told him. \u201cKiddo.\u201d Mom smoothed my hair. Her hand cupped my face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go upstairs? Go to bed. You need your rest.\u201d Then Mom turned her full attention back to the man who\u2019d brought me home. \u201cI need to talk to Agent Edwards.\u201d</p><p>There was a feeling coursing between them\u2014two veteran operatives, powerful people, neither one used to backing down. I eased away, but I don\u2019t think Agent Edwards or my mother even noticed that I was still standing there. They were too busy staring daggers at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of nerve bringing her back like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have rather she not come back at all?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy with me. She was supposed to be safe with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry your daughter had to live through that,\u201d Agent Edwards said.</p><p>\u201cLive being the key word, of course.\u201d Mom leveled a glare at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Rachel?\u201d Agent Edwards sounded tired and impatient and ever so slightly annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI mean my daughter was flown to the far corner of this country only to see the ambassador killed and have the gunman turn on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormer ambassador,\u201d Max Edwards corrected. \u201cAnd as the head of the interagency task force, no one regrets his death more than I. He had information we needed, Rachel. After all, that\u2019s why your daughter was there.\u201d</p><p>Mom sidled closer. \u201cAnd as soon as he started talking, he was killed? And the girl he was talking to was targeted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was regrettable.\u201d</p><p>Mom shook her head slowly. \u201cTo say the very least.\u201d</p><p>I watched my mother in that moment, the narrowing of her eyes, the straightening of her spine. She moved ever so slightly in front of me as if to block any more bullets that might be heading in my direction. And I knew what she didn\u2019t say: that I wasn\u2019t out of danger. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cIt was an isolated incident,\u201d Edwards told her.</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d Mom asked. \u201cWas it really? I thought your task force was impervious to moles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is taking this breach more seriously than I am, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, evidently you aren\u2019t taking it seriously enough,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means it\u2019s hard to sail a leaking ship,\u201d Mom told him. \u201cPerhaps your mole-free, traitor-proof task force isn\u2019t quite as safe as you thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Rachel\u201d\u2014I watched the man shift, take a different tack\u2014\u201cwhere is Joe Solomon? Where is he right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe Solomon is dead.\u201d Mom\u2019s voice cracked. She\u2019d spent enough time imagining what it would be like to lose him that it probably wasn\u2019t hard at all for her to pretend that she had. \u201cHe was killed in an explosion at the Blackthorne Institute last spring. As the head of the task force, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Edwards smiled. \u201cHow silly of me to forget.\u201d He stepped toward the door but glanced back at my mother. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you again soon.\u201d He nodded in my direction. \u201cCammie,\u201d he said, then opened the door.</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn back again, didn\u2019t falter. But even after he was gone, his presence lingered. I felt it in my bones, saw it in my mother\u2019s eyes as she kept her gaze trained on the front windows, watching the headlights of Max Edwards\u2019s car disappear.</p><p>\u201cThey know,\u201d Mom said. She didn\u2019t look at me. She just kept staring into the darkness, almost like she was waiting for black helicopters and SWAT teams to descend upon our grounds and swarm all over the mansion. \u201cThey know about Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey suspect,\u201d I tried to correct her; but Mom just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, Cammie. They know. Or they think they know, and that is all they need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s not safe here.\u201d Mom looked numbly at the closed door.</p><p>\u201cThe task force isn\u2019t going to work, is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>I waited for my mother to answer, but it was like I hadn\u2019t spoken at all. The answer was the silence that stretched between us.</p><p>\u201cSo what does that mean? Do we go back to looking for the Circle leaders ourselves? I think we\u2019ve got to. We should call the Baxters, right? Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go to bed, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>At last, my mother looked at me, but it wasn\u2019t the look I\u2019d grown used to. She didn\u2019t want to be alone. She looked at me like maybe it was the last time she\u2019d ever see me\u2014like that moment was precious and rare and fleeting. Only then did I realize just how close I\u2019d come to never coming home again.</p><p>Mom hugged me and smoothed my hair. She kissed the top of my head just like she\u2019d done when I was a little girl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so grown-up, kiddo,\u201d she said, and I felt myself blush a little. \u201cWhen did you get so grown-up? You don\u2019t even need me anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cammie.\u201d She held me tighter, looked into my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve already handled situations that agents twice your age would crumble under. You\u2019re a tremendous operative. And you\u2019re ready, sweetheart. When the time comes, I promise you, you\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said\u2014because what else could I say? It was like my mother was talking in riddles, and I was far too exhausted to try to break the code.</p><p>\u201cNow, go on. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s killing Zach and the girls not to have all the details.

It was a new approach for her, and it scared me. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was awful. They shot Ambassador Winters right in front of me. It was...awful,\u201d I said again. I didn\u2019t care how ridiculous I sounded.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cam.\u201d Bex eased slowly closer. \u201cJust tell us what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey knocked me out to take me there. I don\u2019t even remember leaving the mansion. And when I woke up I was groggy and sick. And then Agent Edwards realized I was awake and he took me inside the prison. I thought I was going to see Preston, but it was his dad instead. Preston\u2019s dad asked for me. And then they killed him. They shot Ambassador Winters. They shot him and then they came for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Preston there?\u201d Macey asked, but she didn\u2019t face me.</p><p>\u201cHe was in a cell in the facility. I didn\u2019t see him, though. I saw a video feed, and he was on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked fine, Macey. Just fine. I didn\u2019t see him up close, but the ambassador was okay, so that tells me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil they killed him,\u201d Macey cut me off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ambassador was okay until they killed him\u2014that\u2019s what you mean, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about this, Macey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about what? The truth? Because that is the truth, isn\u2019t it? Someone didn\u2019t want Winters talking, so they killed him. Because he knew something. And maybe Preston knows it too. Maybe now you know it. Maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come after me again?\u201d I finished her thought in spite of how much I hated it. I didn\u2019t want to go back to being the girl the Circle of Cavan was chasing.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Winters tell you, Cammie?\u201d Bex was in front of me, staring into my eyes. If she could have reached into my head and pulled the truth out she would have, but all she could do was hold me perfectly still and say, \u201cThink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCavan,\u201d I said. \u201cWe talked about the Inner Circle and Preston and...\u201d I trailed off, stunned by what I remembered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Macey asked.</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe talked about Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Liz?\u201d Bex asked, pointing in our roommate\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I shook my head, the whole thing coming back in bits and pieces. \u201cHe asked about you.\u201d I looked at Liz, whose eyes were even bigger and bluer than usual. \u201cHe said how smart you are. It was almost like he was trying to tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Liz?\u201d Macey asked. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, no offense, you are smart. It\u2019s just...\u201d Macey\u2019s voice trailed off as she turned to Liz, who had gone even paler. \u201cI mean, it is ridiculous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Liz\u2019s voice was so soft it trembled. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Liz looked at all of us, blue eyes darting, filling with grief and fear and tears.</p><p>\u201cLiz, you\u2019re scaring me,\u201d I finally said when her silence became too much.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s my fault,\u201d she blurted, and the tears silently rolled down her face. Her pale cheeks burned crimson, and the words came in ragged stops and starts.</p><p>\u201cI think it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s you?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you guys remember the tests? Before we started school?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>Bex shook her head. \u201cThere were no tests, Liz. We\u2019ve been on break. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not now. When we were sixth graders? Before we started here at all? There were those tests. Remember those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We took a few tests,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I took more,\u201d Liz said. \u201cI took dozens. Hundreds. Probably because my parents weren\u2019t spies. I don\u2019t know why. I just know that I was poked and prodded and questioned for months. Personality tests. IQ tests. Psych profiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them, Lizzie?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cThe butterfly effect.\u201d Again, Liz\u2019s voice cracked. She brought her hands to her face.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I told her, but she didn\u2019t move. She just kept shaking her head back and forth, over and over, until I thought she might get dizzy.</p><p>\u201cA butterfly flaps its wings over the ocean and there\u2019s a hurricane in Asia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know what the butterfly effect is, Liz,\u201d Bex said, but it was like Liz never even heard her.</p><p>\u201cAll things are connected,\u201d Liz said. \u201cLike dominoes. Like a house of cards. Like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need more facts and fewer similes, Lizzie,\u201d I tried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault!\u201d she shouted again.</p><p>\u201cLiz, am I going to have to hit you?\u201d Bex asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019m totally willing to hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hysterical, Rebecca.\u201d I don\u2019t know if it was the use of Bex\u2019s full name or the tone of Liz\u2019s voice but I knew right then that whatever Liz was worried about\u2014it was real. And it was bad.</p><p>\u201cLiz, calm down,\u201d I tried. \u201cBreathe. What is your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d Liz went on after a minute. \u201cOne of the tests I had to take was on abstract thinking. You know\u2014big questions. Crazy theories. If the earth were in the path of a meteor made of cheese, how would you stop it? That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tests had cheese meteor questions?\u201d Bex asked. I shushed her, and Liz talked on.</p><p>\u201cWell, one of the questions was \u2018How would you start World War Three?\u2019 That was it. A hypothetical. A crazy notion.\u201d Then her eyes got even bigger, her voice clearer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t even know what the Gallagher Academy really was at the time. I just knew that it was really exclusive and I wanted to get in. I wanted to get in so badly.... So when they asked me how I\u2019d start World War Three, I told them.\u201d</p><p>The idea washed around the room, settling on us all slowly, like someone had left a window open and the fog was rolling in.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was just a hypothetical. It was supposed to be a hypothetical! But now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell them?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She looked up at me, absolute terror in her eyes. \u201cI told them that World War Three would start with a tanker blowing up on the Iranian coast of the Caspian Sea and a bridge going out in Azerbaijan.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d talked about those tragedies at the Welcome Back Dinner, and I thought back to that night\u2014how quiet Liz had been. How worried. And I realized how long Liz had been carrying that weight.</p><p>\u201cLiz, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Macey said. \u201cIt was just a ship. It wasn\u2019t even a military ship. And that bridge was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA trade route,\u201d Liz cut her off. \u201cMore importantly, that bridge and the ports along the Caspian coast are Iranian trade routes. And with every route that gets cut off, the Iranians have to start using other routes that go through more and more volatile territories. Like Turkey or Afghanistan or Caspia.\u201d</p><p>Liz seemed exhausted, as if the sheer act of admitting it all out loud was about to be too much for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about it for a while now. What if I was right? What are the odds of those things just randomly happening? And then...what if they weren\u2019t random?\u201d Liz trembled, the last bit of color draining from her face. \u201cRemember what Knight told you in Cambridge? That the Circle is planning something terrible and it has already begun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d I asked, \u201care you saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the Circle has my test. And I think they\u2019re using it to start World War Three.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>No one told Liz she was crazy. As far as I could tell, no one even thought it. Mainly because A) Liz\u2019s particular brand of crazy doesn\u2019t include being stupid. And B) Take it from the girl who spent most of the past semester being totally brainwashed\u2014in our world, crazy never means impossible. And, besides, I didn\u2019t know what the Circle had done, but I did know they were capable of anything.</p><p>So we didn\u2019t panic as we ran downstairs. No one cried or yelled or sounded any alarms as we rushed through the dark and sleeping hallways. And yet there was a hurried, frantic pace to our steps\u2014like this secret was on our heels and we had to outrun it.</p><p>My mother\u2019s office light was on and the door was closed.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I yelled, banging on the door probably louder than I needed to. \u201cMom, it\u2019s me. I need to talk to you. It\u2019s an\u2014\u201d</p><p>But then the door opened, cutting me off.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sutton,\u201d Professor Buckingham said when she caught sight of Liz. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d She eyed all four of us with our untucked shirts and sloppy ponytails. We didn\u2019t look like trained covert operatives, I was sure. But I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for the headmistress,\u201d Macey said as if that were explanation enough. Professor Buckingham looked back as if it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was just here,\u201d I countered.</p><p>Then I heard the voice. \u201cGallagher Girl?\u201d</p><p>I turned and saw Zach in the corner of the office. His eyes were narrow and cautious.</p><p>Buckingham glanced in his direction, then explained, \u201cI was just giving Zachary a message, and then I was going to come find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to see the headmistress,\u201d Liz blurted, but Buckingham didn\u2019t waver.</p><p>\u201cThat was the message, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d our teacher said. \u201cCameron, your mother and Mr. Solomon have been called away\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalled away?\u201d Macey asked. \u201cWhere? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust moments ago,\u201d Buckingham said, and I thought about the way my mom had hugged me in the foyer, the finality of her words, and, at last, I heard them for what they were. They weren\u2019t a good night. They were a good-bye.</p><p>\u201cSomething urgent has come up and the two of them had to...leave,\u201d Buckingham finished, choosing her words carefully.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Liz started, and Buckingham cut her off.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. Listen to me very carefully, girls. They had to go. They will be gone indefinitely, and they will be unreachable. Do not try to follow them,\u201d Buckingham warned. \u201cDo not try to track them down. If you want them to be safe then you will follow these instructions. Do you understand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I did understand, but that didn\u2019t mean I had to like it. I looked at Liz and thought about what our oldest faculty member was really telling us: that the people we trusted most were gone. And there was no way to know when\u2014or if\u2014they would ever return.</p><p>Buckingham started through the Hall of History.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is fine, Cameron. She will be back soon.\u201d She looked certain. She sounded sure. But she held my gaze just a moment too long. Her hands shook, and in that moment, Patricia Buckingham didn\u2019t look like a seasoned operative. She looked like an old woman, and it was harder than it should have been to watch her walk away.</p><p>\u201cYou need a coat,\u201d Zach told me an hour later. Then he took off his own jacket and slipped it around my shoulders. Because even major security threats of global proportions couldn\u2019t stop my boyfriend from being pretty much the sexiest guy alive.</p> <p>We were standing in the space I\u2019d first found a year before. Once upon a time it had been home to the Gallagher Academy\u2019s covert carrier pigeon program. Then Mr. Solomon had used it to decipher my father\u2019s final words to me. And now it was my favorite place to hide. With a small balcony and a secluded cave-like room, I felt free there, looking out over the school grounds and the lights of distant towns.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d Liz shook and paced. \u201cWhy would they leave? They can\u2019t just leave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Bex said, inching closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I laughed at my own foolishness. \u201cIt was Edwards,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen he brought me home, he asked about Mr. Solomon\u2014like he knew he was still alive and hiding out here...like Edwards and his task force were going to come after Mr. Solomon and anyone who might be helping him.\u201d</p><p>I felt like an idiot that I hadn\u2019t seen what Mom was saying in that moment. I speak fourteen different languages. I should know \u201cgood-bye\u201d when I hear it.</p> <p>\u201cSo now they\u2019re just gone?\u201d Macey asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on a mission, Macey,\u201d Zach reminded her. \u201cIf what happened at the prison proves anything, it\u2019s that nothing has changed. The Circle has moles everywhere. Even within Max Edwards\u2019s little task force. If we want to stop the Circle\u2019s leaders, then we are going to have to track them down ourselves.\u201d Zach crossed his arms and leaned against the balcony\u2019s railing. \u201cThat\u2019s what Rachel and Joe are going to do.\u201d</p><p>He was right, and I wanted to say so. But a thought I couldn\u2019t articulate had settled in my mind, and I felt myself turning it over and over like a talisman.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Gallagher Girl?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just...something isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>Technically, a whole lot of somethings weren\u2019t right, but there was one I couldn\u2019t put my finger on, and that, more than anything, haunted me. I wanted to ask my mother for advice. I needed to talk to Abby. I wanted Joe Solomon to fly in like the pigeons and start asking me questions until I landed upon the answer my mind knew but couldn\u2019t say. I had been on my own for months last summer. But I\u2019d never felt more alone in my life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Liz asked. \u201cWho do we tell about my test and...you know...World War Three?\u201d</p><p>It sounded so silly when she put it that way\u2014so crazy and far-fetched; but Liz was the smartest person I knew, and Liz wasn\u2019t just serious. She was terrified.</p><p>\u201cLiz, are you sure you\u2019re right about this?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you telling me that five and a half years ago you said that a person would have to do these exact things to start World War Three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Liz looked slightly guilty. \u201cNot these things exactly.\u201d</p><p>Bex opened her mouth to protest; but, for once, Liz was too fast for her.</p><p>\u201cI said it would be about oil and the trade routes of the gulf. I said that to escalate the tension in the region, one would need to eliminate the trade options for Iran and drive over eighty percent of their oil traffic through the pipelines they have going through Caspia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaspia is a police state,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. There was a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat fifteen years ago, and a bunch of military higher-ups took over the government and got rid of the royal family. King Najeeb has been living in exile ever since. The royal family had close ties to the West and an alliance with Turkey. But the military dictatorship that now rules Caspia is loyal to Iran. The whole thing almost blew up ten years ago, but that led to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Treaty of Caspia,\u201d I said. \u201cMr. Smith talked about that for a solid week our eighth grade year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Liz said. \u201cCaspia is a no-man\u2019s-land. Neither Iran nor Turkey can officially cross the border. But if more and more of the Iranian oil traffic has to go through there, then that border starts looking more and more tempting to the Iranian forces.\u201d Then Liz shrugged. \u201cAt least that was my theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, Liz?\u201d Bex asked with a shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not science, okay? It\u2019s a butterfly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEffect, we know,\u201d Bex finished for her.</p><p>\u201cNo! You don\u2019t know. I\u2019m telling you that someone has my essay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we can\u2019t tell anyone, Lizzie,\u201d I explained. \u201cIf you gave that answer to the Gallagher Academy, then that means the Circle got it from the Gallagher Academy. We have no idea who we can trust.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like these things are covert. Everyone in the world knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>\u201cSo are you sure, Liz?\u201d Bex finished. \u201cI mean, it sounds like the best spies in the world think these things are unrelated. Flukes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd things are never more than they appear?\u201d The question cut us to our core. \u201cBesides,\u201d Liz added, \u201cI think the best spies in the world are right here. And I\u2019m asking them to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get a message to Mr. Solomon?\u201d I asked Zach, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. There\u2019s a dead drop I can use, but there\u2019s no way of knowing when he\u2019ll get the message. Or if he\u2019ll get the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d Macey asked me.</p><p>\u201cThe same. We have to assume every means of communication in and out of the school is being monitored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does that mean, really?\u201d Liz asked me.</p><p>\u201cI guess...I guess it means we\u2019re on our own.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>THINGS THAT TOTALLY FREAKED ME OUT IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED:</p><p>(A list by Cameron Morgan)</p><p>My mom and Mr. Solomon. I had no idea where they were or what they were doing. When\u2014or if\u2014they\u2019d return. You may think spies would be used to that feeling, but spy kids? We never do get over it.</p><p>Liz. It was the only time I\u2019d ever seen her depressed about getting a test answer right.</p><p>There was currently a non-zero chance that the Circle of Cavan wanted me dead. Again.</p><p>Having people want me dead was something I was actually starting to get used to.</p><p>\u201cHello, girls. Welcome back,\u201d Madame Dabney said as we walked into Culture and Assimilation class the next morning. She walked down the row of tables that served as desks. There were lace tablecloths and silver candles. It always felt like we were going to tea, and in that room we sat straighter than anyplace else on earth. In that room, we were ladies.</p><p>She handed us each a stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cWhat you have here is our best idea of what your graduation and placement examinations will contain. The written test, of course. Your practical exams...well, they could be anything. And make no mistake, they could come at any time.\u201d</p><p>I thought about all I\u2019d seen and done. My life had been a test for years.</p><p>\u201cOn the twenty-eighth we will be taking senior portraits.\u201d</p><p>Madame Dabney handed the packets to the first girl in each row and we took turns taking one and handing the rest to the girl behind us.</p><p>\u201cThose of you wishing to schedule summer internships must return these applications to my office by the fifteenth of next month,\u201d Madame Dabney said, sending along another stack of forms.</p><p>\u201cLetters of reference for placement in any of the US agencies are required no later than April first. Please do not wait until the last minute to request these, ladies,\u201d Dabney warned. \u201cThat, more than anything, can ensure you receive a bad one.\u201d</p><p>Finally Madame Dabney walked back to her desk. \u201cAnd, of course,\u201d she said, \u201cthe annual career fair is tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d I blurted, totally not realizing I was speaking aloud.</p><p>\u201cYes, Cameron. Due to the...events...of last fall we decided to host the career fair in the spring semester this year.\u201d She passed another piece of paper down the long rows. \u201cHere are the agencies and programs that will be attending. And do remember, ladies, this is not just their opportunity to get to know you. It is your chance to get to know them.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re seniors. Take this opportunity very, very seriously. Your futures will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the piles of paper that lay on the lace cloth before me. I\u2019d been running for days. I\u2019d been hiding for years. But Madame Dabney was right. My future was on my tail, and there was no way I could lose it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>That night, the Grand Hall didn\u2019t look like the Grand Hall. All the tables were gone, pushed to the sides or moved to another room. Booths lined the walls. I walked up and down the aisles. Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives had set up a mock firing range where the teachers usually sat. There were MI6 and Interpol. The FBI and CIA.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d one clean-cut man said, pushing a brochure in my direction. \u201cHave you considered a career with Homeland Security? We are the agency of the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe US State Department,\u201d a woman said as I passed. \u201cThe world is our office.\u201d</p><p>There were seventh graders, loading up on Tootsie Rolls and free erasers from the US Marshals Service (they make people disappear). To tell you the truth, I\u2019d seen it all before. I\u2019d heard all the pitches, read all the material. The years changed; the booths grew. But I didn\u2019t have any better idea of what my future was going to look like.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d a man in an FBI polo shirt said, \u201cdo you know where you\u2019re going to be a year from now?\u201d</p><p>I looked him in the eye. \u201cThat is an excellent question.\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, I would have been happy just knowing where my mother and Mr. Solomon were right then.</p><p>\u201cOfficial FBI Post-it pad for your thoughts.\u201d I turned to see Bex behind me, holding out a bag full of loot. Part of me wanted to smile, but I couldn\u2019t. I just looked around the big room I knew so well and wondered why everything felt so utterly unfamiliar.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d I said.</p><p>Bex, being excellent at both spying and best friending, didn\u2019t ask me what I meant. She just slid her arm through mine and told me, \u201cThey\u2019re out there, Cam. And they\u2019re okay. And they\u2019ll be back whenever it is best for them to come back and not a minute before.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, and then it was like the crowd parted. I could see Liz staring up at a huge display from the National Security Agency, offering prizes to anyone who could crack the codes they had on their walls.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you have it?\u201d the recruiter asked her, but Liz shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said and turned away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d I said, and Bex nodded in grave agreement.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Lizzie,\u201d Bex said when we reached her.</p><p>When I put my arm around her shoulders, I realized they were even thinner than usual. She was pale as a ghost except for the dark circles that ringed her eyes. Guilt weighed on her, and I for one was terrified of how far it might drag her down.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d I told her. \u201cWhat do you say? Movies in the common room? We can go down to the labs, use liquid nitrogen to make ice cream. You know how that always cheers you up.\u201d</p><p>But Liz just stared blankly ahead. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>When I followed her gaze I saw what she was staring at. Interpol had brought a map of the world, and it hung on the wall by their booth. It looked so small, not even as wide as two of our regular dining tables. It looked so big, filled with tiny towns and vast wildernesses. Every good operative knows that the world is small, but the planet is big. No one knew where my mom and Mr. Solomon were. No one knew where the Circle would strike next.</p> <p>Except someone did know.</p><p>I looked at Liz again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Liz isn\u2019t one for snapping, but something in her tone froze me, shamed me. Made me feel small and helpless and weak.</p><p>\u201cLiz, it\u2019s going to be okay. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Cammie.\u201d Agent Edwards was there, walking from the Interpol booth. Closer to me.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to see him. We\u2019d first met at the career fair my sophomore year\u2014when I was still sneaking off to see Josh. History, after all, always repeats itself.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said and tried to walk away.</p><p>\u201cI hope this means you\u2019re considering a future with Interpol. I told you a long time ago that we would love to have you. I meant it then. I still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I managed to mutter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d have room for your friends, too.\u201d</p><p>This made me stop.</p><p>\u201cMs. Baxter and Ms. McHenry\u2014they are interested in fieldwork, are they not? And I think everyone in this room would love to work with Ms. Sutton.\u201d</p><p>When he talked about my friends, it didn\u2019t sound like an offer. It sounded like a threat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Agent Edwards. My friend isn\u2019t feeling well. We\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>But then he stepped closer, blocking me off from Bex and Liz, who had already started moving away.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to speak to your mother. Is she here?\u201d Something in the way he spoke told me that he was measuring his words carefully. He didn\u2019t want to push me too far, too fast. But that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t want to push me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, and my silence made Max Edwards laugh. \u201cI guess not. You know, I\u2019ve been thinking. Funny thing about what happened with Winters, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was very funny,\u201d I told him, but Edwards talked on as if I hadn\u2019t spoken at all.</p><p>\u201cThe gunman disabled the security cameras, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t know what the two of you discussed.\u201d He eased slightly closer. It was supposed to intimidate me, rattle me, make me want to talk. But it didn\u2019t. It made me want to fight. \u201cWhat did Samuel Winters tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou debriefed me the day it happened, remember? I already told you everything I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me again. What did you and Winters talk about?\u201d</p><p>I cocked my hip and stared up at him. \u201cTraitors. The weather. All the usual stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I have to wonder, Cammie. Did the gunman turn on you because of what you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019ve gotten kind of used to the Circle of Cavan trying to kill me. I don\u2019t really stop and ask questions anymore.\u201d</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t true. I did ask questions. All the time. And I almost never liked the answers.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Cammie...\u201d He tilted his head, studying me like I was an abstract piece of art; like he wasn\u2019t exactly sure what to see in me. \u201cWhat else are you hiding?\u201d</p><p>I should have listened to the inflection in his words\u2014heard the tiny voice inside of me that said something was a little off about the question. But we were inside the Gallagher Academy. These were people who were in on the secret, aware of the truth. I was behind our walls. I was safe.</p><p>Or so I thought.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Joe Solomon?\u201d He looked around, as if trying to see all my usual hiding places, peek through the cracks in the mortar.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d I started, but Agent Edwards cut me off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say he\u2019s dead, Cammie. Do not lie to me.\u201d Then Max Edwards held out his cell phone; on it I saw an image of Mr. Solomon walking through a busy train station. He wore a ball cap and sunglasses, but there was no mistaking the man in the picture.</p><p>\u201cThat was taken this morning in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you asking me where he is?\u201d I said, but Edwards only smiled in response.</p><p>With a finger he swiped at the screen, and the image changed. I saw the area just to Mr. Solomon\u2019s right in the photo. I saw that he was holding my mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>A cold feeling filled my chest, and I knew what he was saying\u2014what the photo meant. My mother and my teacher weren\u2019t coming back anytime soon. My mother would be on the run maybe for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cSo there you have it. You know Mr. Solomon isn\u2019t in the mansion. I guess you\u2019ll have to be leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cammie. You know better than anyone that Joe Solomon isn\u2019t the only Gallagher Academy resident who has spent time inside the Circle.\u201d</p><p>The ice that had filled my chest just moments before began to crack. It was like my whole world was shattering, and even though I hadn\u2019t seen Zach enter, some part of me knew what I would see as soon as I turned. He was standing by the Homeland Security booth. He was searching the crowd, looking for me. He was just another teenager thinking about the future until I shouted, \u201cZach! Run!\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was instinct. Maybe it was training. But Zach wasn\u2019t like the stupid people you see in the movies. He didn\u2019t ask what I was shouting about. He didn\u2019t have to be told twice. In a flash, he was bolting down the aisle, running toward the foyer.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d one of the recruiters yelled from the far side of the Grand Hall. He lunged at Zach, but the angle was wrong and Zach pushed him easily aside and kept on powering toward the door. Agent Edwards must have positioned someone there because soon a woman was lunging in front of Zach, trying to knock him off his feet. He dove, sliding beneath her, across the hardwood floor and into the foyer. And when the woman turned to follow, Bex was there.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bex said simply, a warning. Something in her voice stopped the more senior operative cold. Besides, Zach was already gone.</p><p>\u201cFollow him!\u201d Agent Edwards yelled just as I started to jerk away\u2014to go rushing after Zach\u2014but Agent Edwards had an iron grip on my arm. \u201cNo, Cammie. Stay,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I pulled my free arm back, ready to punch and kick and claw my way out of there if I had to, but then a familiar voice stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cAgent Edwards,\u201d Buckingham snapped, \u201cwhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Patricia.\u201d The man tightened his grip on my arm and spun on the Gallagher Academy\u2019s oldest faculty member. But she\u2019s not our weakest. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cYou are a guest in these halls,\u201d Buckingham said. The words were tinged with anger and disappointment, and her accent wasn\u2019t genteel just then. It was frigid. \u201cNow, let go of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are authorized to bring in anyone who has information about the Circle of Cavan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have authorization from me!\u201d Buckingham said.</p><p>Agent Edwards released my arm and pushed me toward two of the goons who had come with him. \u201cI assure you, Patricia, we have no desire to harm the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl is a student of this school and under its protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis school...\u201d He huffed. \u201cThis school has been hiding and protecting Joe Solomon for over a year!\u201d I was inching back, farther away from the man and his fury. \u201cThis school took in a known child of the Circle and then allowed four of its students to attempt to save another!\u201d</p><p>Madame Dabney came running forward. \u201cPatricia, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>But Professor Buckingham never took her gaze off Agent Edwards. \u201cThese men were just leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll leave.\u201d Agent Edwards laughed. \u201cBut we won\u2019t be leaving alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d Professor Buckingham shouted. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to be told twice. I\u2019d been given a direct order from a teacher. I knew what I had to do. I could hear the commotion behind me. Buckingham took a globe from the CIA\u2019s booth and hurled it at Agent Edwards\u2019s head, and when he ducked she brought a knee up into his face, bloodying his nose and knocking him, disoriented, to the ground.</p><p>Madame Dabney tripped one of the two goons who were supposed to be capturing me and pushed the other into the Secret Service\u2019s booth, sending a perfectly scaled replica of the White House crashing to the floor.</p><p>In a flash, the entire Grand Hall was in chaos. It was like a street fight. A brawl.</p><p>Seventh graders jumped onto the backs of FBI agents. Seniors squared off against the CIA. It wasn\u2019t cat versus mouse; it was spy versus spy, and I didn\u2019t turn around to look at the destruction that I was leaving in my wake.</p><p>I was too busy trying to think: Where would Zach go? What would Zach do? He had to get away from the people chasing him, lose them somewhere in the classrooms or halls. Or passageways.</p><p>Hiding would have been easy\u2014he had home-court advantage. But hiding wasn\u2019t going to be enough. If they knew he was at the Gallagher Academy, he wasn\u2019t going to be safe at the Gallagher Academy. Zach was going to have to run.</p><p>And then I knew where he\u2019d be going.</p><p>I grabbed the banister of the nearest staircase and flung myself around, taking the steps two at a time, desperate not to be followed. And then I darted down the narrow hall lined with larger, more private rooms until I reached the only one that wasn\u2019t used by a teacher.</p><p>When I reached the door of Zach\u2019s room I burst through without knocking, which\u2014to tell you the truth\u2014was something of a mistake, because before my eyes even adjusted to the black, I felt a blow knocking me forward, off my feet and into the dresser.</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl,\u201d Zach said. He sounded furious and ashamed, both.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d His hands were on me then, checking my head and my arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cInterpol. CIA. They\u2019re everyone, Zach. And they\u2019re looking for you.\u201d</p><p>There was a backpack on his bed. He never carried it to class, and immediately I knew that it wasn\u2019t for textbooks and homework. He kept that bag packed and ready at all times, just in case he had to run.</p><p>I knew because I had a bag just like it.</p><p>I heard noises, footsteps pounding up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, reaching for his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to disappear.\u201d</p> <p>And then I led him down the hall. When we reached a maintenance closet, I pulled him inside. It was too small, though. I\u2019d never shared it with anyone before, and I found myself pressed against Zach, his arms around me, his backpack at our feet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his room!\u201d someone said. They knocked down the door of his bedroom while Zach and I stayed pressed together in the black. \u201cFind them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to hide me in here forever?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been here,\u201d the men outside said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe\u201d\u2014I ran my hand up Zach\u2019s chest, put my arms around his neck\u2014\u201cI am just going to do this.\u201d</p> <p>And then I pulled the lever. I watched Zach\u2019s eyes go wide as the floor beneath us gave way and together we dropped straight down, sliding through the ventilation system of the school, shooting like a dart away from the people trying to find us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Zach said when we finally landed with a thud two floors down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a good person to know, Zachary. You should have figured that out by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, lovebirds,\u201d said a voice behind us. I turned to see Bex, Liz, and Macey standing watching us, arms crossed. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the time to tease. It wasn\u2019t the place to flirt. So I led the way through the inner workings of the school. We didn\u2019t speak again. Not when we stood pressed together and listened through a vent to two FBI agents discussing Zach\u2019s whereabouts. No one asked for an explanation when I found a length of rope and used it to lower myself into the basement level.</p><p>I thought back to a dark street in D.C. Get her.</p><p>I heard the shots in the prison and the yells of the guards. Find her.</p> <p>I felt the people at my back. Find them.</p><p>And in my heart I knew that the girl I\u2019d been on New Year\u2019s Eve was foolish. It wasn\u2019t yet time for me to stop running.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d I said when we pushed out of the basement and into a small shack that sat near the edge of the trees. \u201cOver there,\u201d I said, pointing to a section of the main fence covered with overgrown rosebushes and thorns. \u201cThere\u2019s another tunnel there. It will lead us to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zach took a deep breath and turned to me. \u201cI guess this is good-bye. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d I said.</p><p>The words hit Zach, and he looked between me and my friends, already knowing what would come next.</p><p>\u201cAnd where she goes, we go.\u201d Liz folded her thin arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cCammie, your mom\u2019s going to come back,\u201d Zach told me, and I couldn\u2019t help myself\u2014I turned and looked back at the school.</p><p>Lights burned in every window. A searchlight swept across the grounds. I heard barking dogs and shouting men. The search would widen and spread, and it wouldn\u2019t stop until it found Zach.</p><p>Found us.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. And they can\u2019t ever come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl,\u201d Zach started, but I cut him off with a nod.</p><p>\u201cThem.\u201d The word was a whisper. \u201cHe said find them. That\u2019s why it isn\u2019t safe for me to stay.\u201d I reached up and gripped his shirt, made him face me as I said, \u201cThink about it, Zach. Winters, Preston, you... They\u2019re coming for anyone who has ever been inside the Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why it isn\u2019t safe for you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was inside the Circle\u2014all last summer. Winters would only talk to me.\u201d I watched Zach shake his head, try to cast aside the thought he didn\u2019t want to dwell on. \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d Bex corrected.</p><p>\u201cFortunately,\u201d Macey added with a smile, \u201cI had the foresight to pack Liz\u2019s van with various essentials.\u201d</p><p>Liz blushed. \u201cI might have helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut...I brought gummy bears,\u201d Liz said as if that should be enough to neutralize any potential problem.</p><p>\u201cIf you leave now, you won\u2019t get to come back. Go to class.\u201d I looked at Liz. \u201cGraduate. Leave, and we don\u2019t know what will happen. Which is why the three of you should stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think we\u2019re going to do that?\u201d Macey sounded like she might laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think the three of you have never run away before.\u201d I looked down at the ground, the only memory I had of last summer flashing through my mind.</p><p>\u201cLeaving can\u2019t be nearly as hard as being left, Cam,\u201d Bex warned. Something in her voice said she still hadn\u2019t forgiven me\u2014that maybe she never would.</p><p>I looked at our stone walls and iron fences, and even though we were perfectly dry, I had to shiver a little, thinking about Rome, about when my friends and I had been stuck on opposite sides of the river, no safe way to cross. I felt like my sisterhood and I were about to be on different sides of a vast expanse. I\u2019d have to keep swerving, dodging, running, hoping someday to meet again.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going, we have to go now,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>And with that it was decided. We couldn\u2019t stay at school forever. After all, we\u2019d spent years preparing for life beyond its walls. We just never knew we\u2019d be rushing out to meet it quite that quickly.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d I said, pulling back the branches of a rosebush that, rumor said, had been planted by Gilly herself during the Civil War. Behind it was one of the oldest passageways at our school. It dated back to the Underground Railroad, and I knew we weren\u2019t the first desperate people to find it, to need it, to enter into darkness hoping to find a little light at the tunnel\u2019s end.</p><p>Zach went first. Then Bex and Macey and Liz. I was supposed to bring up the rear, yet I stopped for a moment, took one last look at the gray stone building, the lacrosse field, and the frost-covered line of trees. In the moonlight it looked almost like a painting. Like a dream. And maybe it had been that for me once. But now, whether I liked it or not, it was time to wake up.</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d someone called through the dark. I turned to see Professor Buckingham standing at the door. She was looking at me. Her hair was a mess and her dress was ripped.</p><p>Part of me thought that I was in trouble, grounded, facing detention for life. But then Buckingham smiled and raised her hand in something that wasn\u2019t quite a wave, not quite a salute. It was more like she was reaching up to grab a fistful of that night air, to hold it like a memory.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d she yelled, then turned and hit a button on the wall.</p><p>Instantly, the sirens began to screech. \u201cCode Black. Code Black. Code Black.\u201d</p><p>Lights swirled. Titanium shutters covered all the windows. Barriers slid into place over every door, blocking me off from my teachers, my school. My home. Locking the men and women who\u2019d been sent to find me inside one of the most secure buildings on the face of the earth.</p><p>There was only one way left to go, so I turned and started down the dark and dusty tunnel. And for the second time in my life, I ran away.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>I\u2019ve never been a fugitive before.</p><p>I\u2019ve been a runaway, a chameleon, an amnesiac. A spy. But fugitive was new to me, though I have to admit, not entirely unexpected.</p><p>We took shifts, driving down two-lane blacktop and interstates, winding mountain roads. We backtracked and sidetracked and did every countersurveillance thing any of us had ever learned. But, most of all, we drove. Not stopping, not resting through the night.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I heard Macey\u2019s voice and felt the van come to a stop, bolting upright despite the weight of Liz sleeping across me.</p><p>\u201cTen more minutes,\u201d Liz mumbled. Part of me wanted to let her go back to sleep. Part of me wanted any excuse I might have to think the night before had been a dream.</p><p>\u201cUh, Macey,\u201d Bex asked, straightening. She scooted up to lean between the front seats. \u201cWhere exactly is here?\u201d</p><p>And then I saw what Bex was seeing. Miles of white-sand beaches stretched out on either side of us. The van sat in the center of a circular driveway. There were intricate iron gates and a massive fountain that was dry and full of leaves. The sky was gray, just like the ocean, and as soon as Macey opened her door I heard the waves crashing into land.</p><p>But all of that paled in comparison to the house. (And when I say \u201chouse\u201d what I really mean is \u201cmansion.\u201d) It was at least three stories tall with balconies and shaker shingles, and something about that moment made me feel like I\u2019d fallen asleep in an old Dodge minivan and woken up in another world. In Macey\u2019s world.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>\u201cMacey...\u201d Bex sounded cautious. \u201cWe probably shouldn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m stopping,\u201d Macey said, spinning on us. \u201cAnd I\u2019m eating a real meal and finding a real bed. So...we can rough it. Or we can rough it.\u201d She pointed at the mansion. \u201cAnd I, for one, need a shower.\u201d</p><p>She was out of the van and starting toward the doors. Bex and I began to run after her, but Zach was already there.</p><p>I don\u2019t think he\u2019d slept. I didn\u2019t remember him eating. He looked exactly how he\u2019d looked the moment we left the school. Alert and alive and more than a little like a cross between Joe Solomon and Agent Townsend.</p><p>\u201cWe have to stay off the grid, Macey. It\u2019s not safe for us to go anywhere anyone might think to look for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d She tried\u2014and failed\u2014to push past him. \u201cIt belongs to some friends of my parents. They\u2019re in the middle of a really nasty divorce and the judge has barred both of them from the premises. The housekeeper isn\u2019t even allowed in, so trust me. We have the place to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just break into a house, Macey,\u201d Liz said.</p><p>But Macey only smiled and reached into a potted plant by the front door. Moments later, a key dangled from her fingers. \u201cWho said anything about breaking?\u201d</p><p>Creeping inside the big, empty house, I had to admit that Macey was right. No one had been there for ages. I looked around the shadowy rooms. Heavy curtains hung over all the windows. Sheets covered the furniture. The refrigerator was empty, but the pantry was stocked, and so we ate soup and crackers and kept the curtains drawn and the lights off.</p><p>We slept all day and paced all night and even the moon felt like a searchlight, sweeping across the ocean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll say this for Macey,\u201d Zach whispered as he walked up behind me, \u201cI like her idea of roughing it.\u201d</p><p>I was sitting in an Adirondack chair on the deserted stretch of beach, looking out at the ocean. I\u2019d pulled the world\u2019s softest blanket off one of the guest beds and was sitting in the dark with it wrapped around my shoulders, my feet buried in the sand.</p><p>\u201cWe have five grand in cash and ten fake IDs,\u201d I said to Zach. I didn\u2019t turn to face him. The facts just came pouring out of me, unstoppable. \u201cWe have six credit cards, but I don\u2019t trust two of them. They can be traced back to the school, so... We\u2019ll need to get the van off the road. Too many people know it. We\u2019ve used it too many times. So that leaves buses, I guess. We\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie.\u201d My name was a whisper on Zach\u2019s lips, and he eased closer.</p> <p>\u201cThe girls did a good job packing.\u201d I didn\u2019t think about when they\u2019d done it\u2014how they\u2019d known. But every spy knows that running away is always a possibility. \u201cWe have basic comms and Liz has enough computers to hack NASA. We still need physical gear, though. Sporting goods. Electronics. We\u2019ll need a hardware store at some point. We should split up for that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam.\u201d Zach kneeled in the sand in front of me. He took my hands. I hadn\u2019t realized how cold they were until he rubbed them in his own. \u201cWe need to talk about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this what\u2019s best for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a team, Zach. We\u2019re going to need this team.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a team to run, Gallagher Girl. I can\u2019t go back because my mom is part of the Circle. You\u2019re in danger because of what the ambassador may or may not have told you. We\u2019ve got to go to ground. You and me. We have to run. Hide. Disappear.\u201d He said the last word more slowly. I knew how big it was and what it meant. \u201cAnd it will be easier if it\u2019s just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ground, Zach.\u201d I\u2019d been thinking it for hours, weighing it. Worrying about it. So I stood and started toward the house. It was like all roads had been leading to that sandy beach for ages. Since I woke up in the Alps. Since I fell down a laundry chute in Boston. Since I pulled a pop bottle out of a trash can and said hello to a boy who had seen me in a crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the first boy who had ever seen me\u2014the real me\u2014and I told him, \u201cTo end it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d I said as soon as I stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re here. We need to figure out a way to make contact with your mom.\u201d Bex was pacing. \u201cMy mum will know how. We just have to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head and read her eyes. \u201cBex, what is rule number seven for an operative in deep cover?\u201d</p><p>Bex knew the answer, but she didn\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cAn operative in deep cover operates alone without risking the safety and security of others,\u201d I said, rattling off one of the many things I\u2019d learned from Joe Solomon. \u201cThere are maybe a half dozen people on this planet we can trust, and if you think they aren\u2019t going to be under constant surveillance, you\u2019re crazy. Which means\u201d\u2014I took a deep breath\u2014\u201cfrom this point forward, we\u2019re on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d The words seemed hard for Liz; the weight of all that was happening was far too heavy for her small shoulders. \u201cWe have to tell someone. About my test, about what the Circle is doing. Someone has to do something about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone is going to do something about it, Liz.\u201d I looked around the group. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, let\u2019s think about this,\u201d Zach told me, and I spun on him.</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to sleep longer!\u201d I heard myself shouting.</p><p>As random outbursts go, that was a pretty good one. I watched my roommates look at each other\u2014at Zach. I watched them try to see what I was saying, so I talked on.</p> <p>\u201cSomething has been bothering me ever since Preston\u2019s dad died. The drugs they used to knock me out on the way to the prison...they wore off too soon. Our theory has always been that the Circle sent a gunman to kill the ambassador before he could talk to me. Silence him. I wasn\u2019t even supposed to be with the ambassador when the gunman came. That was the story, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know, Cam,\u201d Bex told me.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBut what if it was just a story? What if I was exactly where I was supposed to be\u2014exactly when I was supposed to be there?\u201d</p><p>I watched the people I know best look at me like I was a crazy person. Trust me. It\u2019s a look I know pretty well.</p><p>\u201cRemember what you told me in London, Bex? That the Circle doesn\u2019t need me dead anymore because it\u2019s too late to stop me from telling anyone about the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cam,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cYou said that they didn\u2019t need me dead, but they\u2019d probably still try to kill me if it was convenient\u2014just for spite. Remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what if it was convenient? What if someone wanted me in that room? What if someone meant for me to die too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like Max Edwards?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIf I was supposed to sleep for another hour, why did he come check on me when he did? Why take me in to see the ambassador early? I mean...maybe it was all a coincidence....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cThe Circle has moles everywhere,\u201d Liz said. \u201cEven on his task force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they have one leading the task force,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they know?\u201d Zach asked me. \u201cYour mom and Joe, do you think they suspect Edwards is dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure he is,\u201d I said with a shrug. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like him. And I don\u2019t like...it. In any case, there\u2019s no telling who we can trust.\u201d I took a deep breath and steadied my nerves as I went on. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have to go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl, let\u2019s think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have thought about it. And this is it, Zach. This is what comes next. I\u2019m through waiting and hiding. I\u2019m not running or lying low or going to ground or any of the spy terms that can basically be translated as wait for someone else to do something. I am tired of waiting.\u201d</p><p>I looked around, expecting protests, but none came, so I talked on. \u201cPreston\u2019s dad asked for me and he mentioned Liz, so I think she\u2019s right, and I think this thing is happening. I think the Circle is trying to start World War Three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why we call my parents,\u201d Bex countered, and I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cThey have a job, Bex. They have a mission.\u201d I took a deep breath and admitted, \u201cEvery last one of them is busy tracking down the leaders of the Circle. Whether they realize it or not, they\u2019re trying to stop it from that end. And just hearing our voices might be enough to land them in a prison too. So...no. I\u2019m going to try to stop World War Three. And I\u2019m asking you to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do we start?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>I felt them all looking at me\u2014waiting for me to say something, do something. It was the way I always looked at my mom or Aunt Abby or Mr. Solomon. I felt them waiting for orders. And I realized they weren\u2019t going with me on this quest\u2014they were following me. I felt the weight of the responsibility crushing down on me, and my roommates must have sensed it.</p><p>\u201cCam, you\u2019re the one who saw where they\u2019re holding Preston.\u201d Bex was moving toward me. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who heard what the ambassador had to say. And, Cam, you\u2019re the only one of us who has ever been entirely on your own, going after the Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got caught,\u201d I reminded everyone. Especially myself.</p><p>\u201cYou survived,\u201d Bex told me, emphasis on the final word, on the only thing that really mattered. \u201cSo\u201d\u2014she took a slight step back and crossed her arms\u2014\u201cwhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>I felt them waiting, watching, and I wondered if Zach was right\u2014if the two of us would be better off on our own. But it was too late. We couldn\u2019t lose my roommates if we tried. They were Gallagher Girls. They would find us.</p><p>\u201cLizzie.\u201d I turned to her. \u201cWhat happens next? I mean...what\u2019s the next domino?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be any number of things. I built a model, and it\u2019s scanning the Internet for anything that fits with the pattern, and then I\u2019ll cross-reference that against\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort version, Liz,\u201d Bex reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Liz blurted. \u201cBut I will soon. Probably soon. Hopefully soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple days. Maybe sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so in the meantime, we get Preston.\u201d</p><p>I waited for the objections, the questions, the doubts, but no one said a thing until Bex asked, \u201cWhat do we know about this prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Joe left, he told me it\u2019s a maximum-security facility in the Alaskan arctic,\u201d Zach said, taking over. \u201cVery remote. Very extreme. Very secure. Only the highest-level terror targets are taken there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s so remote?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cBecause, officially, it doesn\u2019t exist. Prisoners only get sent there if they are never supposed to leave.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to look at Macey, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. I watched her from the corner of my eye, waiting for her to wince or cringe, but she was stoic. Frozen.</p><p>\u201cHow big is it?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cNot sure.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThe facility was built into the mountain, and I didn\u2019t see the whole thing. It was like a maze. I think you\u2019re supposed to get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the route you took?\u201d Bex asked, and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cEvery step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Macey said. \u201cThere\u2019s a gun safe in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t blast our way in, Macey. No matter how much firepower we bring, they are going to have more. Our only way in is very, very quietly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, okay?\u201d Zach shook his head. Frustration poured off him in waves. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t get it. The temperature and altitude alone make this maybe the hardest target in the country. If you think this is going to be easy, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach\u2019s right,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cI got out,\u201d I said, almost under my breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were lucky,\u201d he countered.</p><p>Until then, I hadn\u2019t really considered how miraculous it was. There had been too much adrenaline, too many wild thoughts inside my mind. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that I couldn\u2019t tell him he was wrong. I could only say, \u201cSo I can get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting out is different than breaking in,\u201d Zach told me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prison, Zach. Keeping people in is kind of the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cBut if we get caught, there\u2019s no getting out. Maybe ever again.\u201d</p> <p>I thought about what Aunt Abby had told me in Rome, that we couldn\u2019t be kids and adults at the same time\u2014that we no longer got to have it both ways. People had already come for Zach. They already wanted me. If we did this it would be official. There\u2019d be no turning back for any of us.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Bex rubbed her hands on her thighs, warming them as if in preparation for where we had to go and what we had to do. \u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201d It wasn\u2019t an argument. It was an order. And none of us had the strength to defy her. \u201cWe\u2019re going right now.\u201d</p><p>Macey walked to a door off the kitchen, threw it open, and switched on the light. Instantly, fluorescents flickered to life, buzzing and glowing and illuminating a massive room filled with rows and rows of shelves covered in skis and down jackets and jumpsuits, cables and tents. Every rich-person toy in the world filled the massive room, and Macey smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p> <p>Turns out sneaking up on a top secret government prison is far more time-consuming than being invited through the front door.</p><p>We left for Alaska the next morning and flew all day. I think the plane belonged to Blackthorne, but Zach didn\u2019t explain, and I didn\u2019t ask. I just sat in the row behind him while he flew and Bex copiloted. By the time we reached the mountains, she was certain she was certified. I, on the other hand, had had too many bad driver\u2019s ed experiences to let her go solo anytime soon. Still, I didn\u2019t have the strength to say otherwise.</p><p>Step two was a chopper into the forest. I recognized the pilot, a girl named Neha who had been a senior when we were seventh graders. But we didn\u2019t exactly catch up. It wasn\u2019t exactly the time. Even though it was only seven P.M., we flew under the cover of darkness to the base of a mountain.</p><p>And then we were gone, out of the chopper and into the snow. It swirled around us as Neha lifted off, her lights disappearing into a black sky filled with more stars than I had ever seen, leaving us alone in the wilderness with nothing but an uphill climb ahead.</p><p>Number of hours we climbed: 6</p><p>Number of times Liz fell down: 12</p> <p>Number of times Liz almost dragged at least three of us down with her: 7</p><p>Number of times we said anything about it: 0</p><p>Number of moments when I had to wonder if we were making the biggest mistake of our lives: Every single one of them</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The way Bex looked around the cave you would have thought it was the Ritz-Carlton. But, in truth, it was a narrow crevice with a dirt floor. Brush covered the entrance. Snow had blown inside, and ice collected in the corners. But it was home, at least for the time being, and I was content to squeeze inside and drop my pack.</p><p>\u201cWe can light a fire here. They won\u2019t see the smoke through the trees, and there\u2019s enough ventilation overhead that we don\u2019t have to worry about suffocating.\u201d Zach pointed up to the ceiling overhead. Cracks ran through the stone, and I could see strips of the starry sky.</p><p>\u201cWe should get some rest.\u201d It was after midnight, and Bex dropped her pack on the ground. \u201cTomorrow, we have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Judging from the aches in my back and the sweat in my boots, we\u2019d already done plenty of work today, but I didn\u2019t think it was the time to argue. Macey, however, disagreed.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d she started.</p><p>Bex cut her off with a look.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get Preston back by running off half-cocked with no plan, Macey. We get him back by being smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing smart,\u201d Macey repeated.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I unfurled my sleeping bag. \u201cNow, get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>As hard as I tried to sleep, I couldn\u2019t. Macey was beside me, too still as she lay on her back, looking up through the cracks in the cave, staring at the stars. They were almost too bright. I wanted to turn them off.</p><p>Bex slept, and Liz, worn out as she was, crashed with her boots still on. I wondered where my mom and Mr. Solomon were. I wanted to know if they\u2019d approve of what we were doing.</p><p>I saw a shadow move near the doorway, inching down the walls. So I pulled my sleeping bag around my shoulders and, silently as I could, I followed.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Gallagher Girl,\u201d Zach said. He didn\u2019t turn to face me. He just leaned against the cave\u2019s entrance, staring at the mountain peak that loomed overhead. He stared so intently at it that I wondered if he had X-ray vision and was trying to see what lay inside. Or maybe he was just trying to see tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou should try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re out here not taking your own advice because...\u201d I didn\u2019t try to finish. I just wrapped the sleeping bag around his shoulders and melted into his arms, rested the back of my head on his chest and leaned against him, staring up at the sky.</p><p>\u201cI never knew there were this many stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see them,\u201d he told me. His breath was warm on my neck, and he kissed the soft skin at the base of my hair. \u201cI just see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of your cheesier lines,\u201d I told him but didn\u2019t move to make him stop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the altitude,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough oxygen in my brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I sighed as his kisses moved higher.</p><p>His arms grew tighter around my waist, and for the first time in hours, I wasn\u2019t cold. I didn\u2019t shiver. I was safe there in that moment and I wanted it to last forever. But it couldn\u2019t. From the depths of the cave, I heard Liz coughing in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have let her come,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf it were up to me none of you would be here.\u201d Zach stopped kissing me. He turned me to face him. \u201cYou know this is crazy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston would do it for us,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWould he?\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell if it was a rhetorical question or not until Zach said again, \u201cWould he really?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and looked back at the top of the mountain. It was below zero, and I shivered even in my insulated clothing. I was half a world away from my summer vacation, but the memories I didn\u2019t have were always there, coursing under the surface. No matter how many times I tried to claim them, they slipped away. The harder I tried, the faster they shot out of my reach, so I didn\u2019t try to grab them then.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it, Zach, but...last summer. I think he saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may not come for him, Cammie. He\u2019s probably safe in there. And...\u201d Zach trailed off. Something in his face told me he didn\u2019t want to finish. Something in my gut told me he had to.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s supposed to be in there? What if Preston is dangerous?\u201d</p><p>I pulled away. Maybe I had to look at him more squarely, or maybe it felt a little like I was temporarily touching a stranger.</p><p>\u201cThis is Preston we\u2019re talking about, Zach. Dangerous isn\u2019t the word I\u2019d use to describe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd people are never more than they appear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave him in there,\u201d I said. \u201cNot if we might need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Circle, Cammie. He\u2019s the next generation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Zach said. A cloud passed overhead, and a shadow crossed his face. \u201cI know he is, because I am too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what my earliest memory is?\u201d he asked with a sad, quick laugh. \u201cMy mom used to sing me this song\u2014about kings and knights and horsemen. All my life, I thought it was just a song\u2014just something mothers sing to little boys. But it wasn\u2019t, Cammie. It was about the government. Coups. Power. I wasn\u2019t old enough to talk yet, and I was already learning who to hate, and how to burn them to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMothers sing songs, Zach. It doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what kinds of songs Preston\u2019s father sang to him.\u201d Zach raised his eyebrows. \u201cI wonder if he\u2019s lying in a cell humming them to himself right now.\u201d</p><p>I should have said something\u2014done something. He was in a dark place, there in the moonlight. But before I could say a word, Zach took a deep breath and looked up at the fortress. \u201cI wonder if I should join him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped and reached for Zach\u2019s hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to talk that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your mom and Dr. Steve were in my head ten weeks ago and you\u2019re not afraid of me. So you don\u2019t get to be afraid of yourself. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Zach.\u201d I pressed up against him, cold and alone. I didn\u2019t want to fight. I wanted to be warm and safe again. \u201cKiss me.\u201d I brushed my lips across his mouth, lightly at first, teasing. Tasting. And then his lips parted and the moment was over.</p><p>Neither of us was thinking about the past.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>I woke because I was freezing. I might have slept forever, there on that hard ground, had I not sensed that something was missing. Something was wrong.</p><p>Someone.</p><p>As quickly as I could, I pulled on my boots; but I didn\u2019t bother calling out his name. Zach wasn\u2019t in the cave, I knew it. He wasn\u2019t outside gathering wood or securing our perimeter. I already knew where he was\u2014what he was doing. And so I ran faster, out of the dry cave and into the snow. I pushed against trees and climbed over rocks, following the tracks, cursing that he hadn\u2019t even woken me to say good-bye. And when I reached the tree line beneath the icy fortress overhead, I knew exactly what I was going to see:</p><p>A lone figure walking through the snow, hands held high above his head in surrender.</p><p>I thought about our plan, but also about what he\u2019d said the night before\u2014that maybe he belonged inside that prison too.</p><p>\u201cZach\u2014\u201d I wanted to yell, but in truth the word was nothing but a whisper. We were already out of time.</p><p>A door was sliding open on the mountain. Men in white jumpsuits carrying rifles were running down the icy banks, their sights never wavering from the person who was walking toward them, yelling, \u201cI\u2019m Zach Goode. And I\u2019d like to turn myself in.\u201d</p><p>One could say it was the cold light of morning that made me see things so differently. But at the top of the world in the middle of winter, there wasn\u2019t that much light to begin with. An eerie gray filled the sky, and I couldn\u2019t help myself; I glanced around, expecting Zach to be there, forgetting he was gone.</p><p>Covert Operations Report</p><p>Operatives McHenry, Baxter, Sutton, and Morgan joined Zachary Goode for a high-risk, potentially high-reward operation in the Alaskan arctic.</p><p>The Operatives also REALLY wished they\u2019d packed extra socks.</p><p>By late afternoon, the sunlight was fleeting. Shadows spread across the glistening white plain that stretched between the line of trees where my roommates and I lay on our stomachs, looking up at the fortress above. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of beautiful,\u201d Liz said, her gaze sweeping over the vista.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be when that gets here.\u201d Bex pointed to the horizon. Clouds churned, blocking our view of the distant peaks. I could imagine the swirling winds and blowing snow of the coming storm.</p><p>A hundred yards of open ground, just snow and ice and some of the most highly calibrated motion sensors and trip wires in the world, stood between us and the compound. Zach\u2019s footsteps from that morning were barely visible, filled in by blowing snow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the time?\u201d Bex asked, even though we all knew the answer.</p> <p>\u201cShowtime.\u201d I looked into the sky. A dark spot was on the horizon just ahead of the ominous clouds. I kept my gaze glued to the helicopter that was no doubt bringing agents to interrogate Zach inside the mountaintop fortress.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Lizzie. Are you sure you\u2019re okay staying here by yourself? It will be totally dark in an hour. If we\u2019re not back by then, I guess...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Liz started slowly, \u201cif this takes more than one hour, then my being alone out here is the least of our problems. Now, go,\u201d she said, and none of us had to be told twice.</p><p>The helicopter grew lower the closer it got to the prison, so we set off running across the open ground beneath the whirl of the spinning blades and the cover of the blowing snow. We\u2019d bleached the gear we\u2019d found in the safe house until everything was white, and we almost blended into the wilderness, bolting over rocks and across ice, up the steep cliffs to the very vent shaft I\u2019d emerged from less than a week before.</p><p>On the side of the mountain, a massive door began to rise up out of the ground, opening to allow the helicopter to land inside the fortress.</p> <p>\u201cDoor closing in four-three-two\u2014\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cThe charges?\u201d Bex asked Macey, who handed her a tiny pack of explosives that we attached to the grate the prison had secured over the airshaft.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, fire in the hole,\u201d Bex said, and the three of us threw our hands over our heads as a subtle pop filled the air. Plumes of smoke and snow blew into the wind, but it was almost untraceable in the quickly coming darkness.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Cam,\u201d Bex told me. She shot a cable, sent it spiraling to the top of the shaft. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>I know air ducts and secret passageways. I\u2019m not even a little bit claustrophobic or afraid of spiders. But the darkness that surrounded me then was unlike any that I had ever felt or seen.</p> <p>I\u2019d been there\u2014in that very shaft\u2014just days before. But then there had been fear and adrenaline. The first time I\u2019d been running away. Now I was climbing toward. I don\u2019t expect most people to understand the difference, but there is one. I didn\u2019t just have to survive\u2014I had to carry. And that made the climbing all the harder. There was time in that quiet place to think, to worry\u2014a nagging, lingering voice that warned that maybe, just maybe we weren\u2019t doing the right thing. Maybe we would be too late.</p><p>But then the shaft leveled off, and soon I was on my stomach, crawling through the hot air of the prison. Sweat beaded at my brow, but I crawled on until I was looking down through a small grate, staring at the same room of monitors I\u2019d seen my last time there.</p><p>Then, on one of the screens, I saw him. Preston was lying on the concrete floor of his cell, motionless. And for a second I thought we were too late\u2014that he was injured. Or worse.</p><p>But then I realized his feet were tucked beneath his bed. I watched as, slowly, he brought his chest off the floor. His fingers rested lightly behind his ears as he brought his right elbow to his left knee. Down again. Left elbow to right knee. Repeat.</p><p>Preston was working out.</p><p>Preston wasn\u2019t giving up.</p><p>Also, Preston kind of looked like a hottie.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the most important thing right then.</p> <p>I craned my head and looked behind me. Macey couldn\u2019t see the screen. She didn\u2019t know what I was looking at, and I didn\u2019t want to risk her seeing Preston and making a sound, getting careless.</p><p>Beneath us, a guard sat watching the monitors, completely ignorant of our presence.</p><p>\u201cGuard Station A,\u201d a scratchy voice said through a speaker in the room below. The guard reached for a microphone.</p><p>\u201cGuard Station A reporting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe interrogation team is here,\u201d the voice said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the boy.\u201d</p><p>I watched the guard push a button. I heard a haunting sound, metal on metal as a door opened. And then, through the vent beneath me, I saw Zach walking down the hall.</p><p>His lip was swollen and his hands were bound. He wore the same kind of jumpsuit the ambassador had died in, and his feet were bare. The message was clear: You\u2019re free to try to run away, but you\u2019ll freeze to death before you make it.</p><p>The guard beneath me stepped into the hall, and that was all the opening I needed. As quickly and quietly as I could, I lowered myself into the office. There were buttons and switches, the same camera feeds that I\u2019d seen my first time there. I walked through the tiny room, not making a noise. Bex and Macey followed.</p><p>I heard Zach\u2019s voice say, \u201cWell, hello. I remember you from this morning. I was hoping we would meet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d a guard said.</p><p>\u201cSo I could do this,\u201d Zach told him. I stepped into the hall just in time to see Zach haul back and head-butt the guard, knocking him to the floor.</p><p>There was another guard with him, of course. I wondered which of the two men had split Zach\u2019s lip, but it wasn\u2019t the time to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you\u2014\u201d guard number two started. He pushed Zach hard against the wall and drew his hand back to punch, but the hand never moved forward. The man whirled as if to question why.</p><p>\u201cHello there,\u201d Bex said, and then she slapped him hard across the face. Not a punch. Not a kick. It was an old-fashioned slap, and the man looked almost amused for a moment before the strength slipped out of his limbs and he crumbled to the floor.</p><p>The other guard was struggling to his feet, but Macey was already on him, attaching yet another Napotine patch to the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Zach said, then he looked at me. He smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to split up. I didn\u2019t want to let him go, but being a spy is at least fifty percent doing unpleasant things, and Zach and I were the only ones who had any kind of home-court advantage.</p><p>In sixty seconds the people waiting on Zach would wonder why he hadn\u2019t reached the interrogation rooms, which, if I remembered correctly, were just fifty yards away.</p><p>In a minute and a half they\u2019d try\u2014and fail\u2014to get the guards on the radio. And, of course, at any time a patrol could sweep the corridor, a camera or sensor could tell someone that something wasn\u2019t quite right. Time wasn\u2019t on our side, in other words, so neither of us wasted a second arguing. We knew Preston was there, and we knew he was alive, and that was the only thing that any of us allowed to matter.</p><p>\u201cDid you see him?\u201d Macey asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut I heard the guards talking. He\u2019s down that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cMacey, you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>And away we went, carefully moving down the branching corridor while Bex and Zach went the other way.</p><p>Most of the cells were empty.</p><p>In one I saw a sleeping man who weighed at least three hundred pounds.</p><p>In another I saw a woman with red hair. She watched me, silent, as if my presence in her window were completely routine.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Macey said. She was reaching for the door, saying, \u201cPreston!\u201d But the door didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cLizzie,\u201d I said through the comms unit. \u201cIt\u2019s cell seventeen.\u201d</p><p>In a moment, I heard Liz say, \u201cAccessing prison system and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny minute now,\u201d Macey prompted.</p><p>\u201cOpen!\u201d Liz yelled, proud of herself.</p><p>The door popped open, and Macey rushed inside.</p><p>\u201cPreston, are you okay?\u201d she asked, but Preston just stared at us as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure whether or not he was losing his mind.</p><p>\u201cAre you here to rescue me, or is this some freaky mind experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRescue,\u201d I said with a nod.</p><p>Preston smiled. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Macey took his hand and dragged him out of the cell. As soon as we stepped into the hall, a guard rounded the corner and Macey dropped to the ground, knocking the man\u2019s feet out from beneath him. Another guard followed so closely behind that they became tangled together, falling. And I had the Napotine patches out and ready. Neither rose again.</p><p>Macey reached for Preston\u2019s hand. \u201cThis way.\u201d She started down the darkened corridor, but Preston held back.</p><p>\u201cIs my dad down there?\u201d he asked. Hope shone through his eyes, and I was certain he didn\u2019t have a clue about his father\u2019s fate. I knew because it was the same look I had been seeing in the mirror for years.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, Preston,\u201d I told him and put my hand on his back.</p><p>\u201cIs he meeting us outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, but Macey just looked at me. Her eyes were wide, and she shook her head, confused. She didn\u2019t understand what I knew. That he might not be able to stand\u2014much less run\u2014if we told him the truth. He might lose the ability to think, much less follow orders. There were things we needed out of Preston still, and that meant Preston needed a lie.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe others are waiting for us.\u201d Then I pushed him out the door.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>QUESTIONS I REALLY COULDN\u2019T STOP ASKING MYSELF (EVEN THOUGH I REALLY, REALLY WANTED TO):</p><p>(A list by Cameron Morgan)</p><p>Exactly how many highly trained government operatives were in that building (and about to be chasing us)?</p><p>How were we supposed to tell Preston his father wasn\u2019t waiting for us safely outside\u2014that he wasn\u2019t going to see his dad in a few minutes? That he was never going to see his dad ever again?</p><p>When had I become someone who could tell a lie like that?</p><p>Did I really want to go back to being someone who couldn\u2019t?</p><p>We were only inside for fifteen minutes. Not a second more. And yet there, at the top of the world in the middle of winter, that was long enough for the sky to descend into black.</p><p>The wind was stronger too, colder. I knew the storm was upon us, because I felt the snow blowing against my face, white streaking through the darkness, and I knew we were almost out of time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Pres,\u201d Bex said, taking his hand and pulling him from the entrance of the narrow shaft I\u2019d found just days before. She handed him a pair of extra boots and a coat that matched the one Zach had already put on.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Bex.\u201d Preston put his hands on his hips, out of breath already. It didn\u2019t matter how many sit-ups he\u2019d been doing, at that altitude, there was a limit to how far and how fast anyone could run.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Zach asked, and I kissed him\u2014fast and hard, not needing it to linger, just so happy to see him free. Behind us, I could still hear the screaming sirens, the flash of the swirling lights. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said.</p><p>The snow blew harder as we ran down the icy, steep incline.</p><p>I saw the main doors to the facility start to open, and I knew it was just a matter of minutes before that mountain would be swarming with guards. Zach and Bex must have known it too, because they sprinted off, not waiting while Macey and I dragged Preston along.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Liz\u2019s voice rang in my ear, and I looked at Macey, who nodded.</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cFire in the hole!\u201d Liz cried, and a split second later a charge ricocheted off the mountain. In the cold, thin air the sound echoed. A puff of smoke and snow blew up from the entrance of the facility, and the doors that had been opening stopped cold. No guards were coming out that way. At least not for a little while.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Fibs, for your lecture on the strategic placement of explosive charges,\u201d Macey said. She looked at Preston, expecting him to appreciate a well-placed explosive charge when he saw one, but he was too cold. Too terrified. Besides, I forced myself to remember, Preston was never trained to be like us.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I stripped off my hat and put it on his head. We\u2019d come too far to lose Preston to hypothermia now.</p><p>\u201cCammie\u201d\u2014Preston\u2019s lips trembled as he spoke\u2014\u201cwhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll meet us when we get there,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cGet where?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>I honestly don\u2019t know what I would have told him\u2014what we could have said\u2014but there wasn\u2019t any time to say anything, because right then Zach and Bex came bursting around a massive arrangement of boulders, each of them behind the controls of a snowmobile that we\u2019d planned to \u201cborrow\u201d from the facility.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Zach yelled, and neither Macey nor I had to be told twice.</p><p>We ran toward them. Macey and Preston hopped on behind Bex, squeezing together.</p><p>Liz was screaming in my ear, begging, \u201cPlease tell me you guys are clear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said and jumped on Zach\u2019s snowmobile just as, overhead, there were cries from more guards, shadows moving in the blowing snow.</p><p>Zach turned, and in a flash we were flying down the mountain.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure at first if it was the speed of the snowmobile or if the storm was just picking up, but the snow burned as it blew. My eyes stung, and I struggled to keep them open, so I didn\u2019t try. I just buried my face against Zach\u2019s shoulder, fighting against the cold.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Zach yelled and, numbly, I nodded, even though he couldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d Liz\u2019s voice was loud and clear in my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re about to have company. Lots of company!\u201d</p><p>I craned my head back and squinted, trying to see through the storm. There were headlights behind us. More snowmobiles. More guards. And guns. They would have lots of guns, and they wouldn\u2019t aim to wound.</p><p>We weren\u2019t in training anymore. The stakes and the bullets were real. It was only February, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that we were already on the far side of graduation.</p><p>\u201cGuys...\u201d Liz yelled again, impatience ringing through her voice, \u201care you clear?\u201d</p> <p>I glanced behind me one more time. We hadn\u2019t gone as far as I\u2019d liked. There was too little space between us and the top of that mountain, but a shot rang out then. Zach swerved. And I knew what the answer had to be.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>Through the comms unit, I heard Liz say one final time, \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d</p><p>And then the explosion happened. Small at first. It wasn\u2019t the size of the charge that mattered, Dr. Fibs had taught us. It was the placement. And Liz had placed that third round perfectly.</p><p>Looking back I saw the white plumes of snow fly up on the hillside. The men didn\u2019t even really notice until the rumble began, a low moan that came too long after the charge itself to be a part of the initial blast.</p><p>No. This was something different. Not man-made. This was Mother Nature\u2019s way of keeping people off her mountains.</p><p>At first, the snow shifted slowly, settling into place. But then it started to grow faster and faster, stronger and stronger, like a tide that swept between us and the men giving chase. Within moments, the mountain was moving\u2014sliding. The avalanche grew and grew, opening like an abyss, cutting us off from the men who had no choice but to turn back. But the tide kept growing faster, threatening to overtake us too.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Zach yelled. He stood, sending the snowmobile up a narrow, ramp-like rock, shooting us into the blowing snow and raging storm, catapulting us into the dark.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>The jump didn\u2019t kill us. At least, my first thought was that we hadn\u2019t died. But I didn\u2019t let myself get too cocky about the situation. After all, we might have been off the mountain, but we were anything but out of the woods.</p><p>Covert Operations Report</p><p>The Operatives utilized a highly controversial, yet effective, exit strategy dubbed \u201cthe blow stuff up and run approach\u201d by Operative Baxter.</p><p>Operative Sutton was quick to point out that blowing stuff up is perhaps her greatest gift.</p><p>Once they reached the bottom of the mountain the Operatives were able to make contact with their Emergency Extraction Team.</p><p>What the Operatives didn\u2019t know was exactly who the Emergency Extraction Team might be.</p><p>\u201cAre we sure about this?\u201d I asked Zach, low and under my breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen a night so black (much less at seven o\u2019clock). But so far north in the middle of winter, the clear sky was like a blanket that couldn\u2019t keep us warm. A crescent moon hung overhead, and I cursed its light beneath my breath. At that particular moment, darkness was our friend.</p><p>Bex leaned against a tree, her head listing to one side. I expected her to be up and pacing, securing our perimeter, cursing the ticking clock. But she sat perfectly still on the cold ground, waiting.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight as rain, Chameleon.\u201d She flashed me her trademark grin. \u201cJust enjoying the scenery.\u201d</p><p>Macey had her arm around Liz, who was shivering. Preston didn\u2019t ask about his father again. Instead, he stared, wide-eyed, across the frozen waters of the lake, almost like we\u2019d pulled him from a dream and he was tempted to go back to sleep. But Zach kept his eyes on the night sky, watching.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we\u2019re at the wrong rendezvous point?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pointed into the distance, and then I heard it: a low rumbling hum. It looked almost like a bird was flying low over the tree line, but it was too big for a bird.</p><p>The lights were off. The pilot was going on instruments and moonlight and sheer force of will as the small plane touched down on the snow-covered ice, gliding on skis toward us.</p><p>Zach turned to the group. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We hunched low and ran across the ice. Liz slid and fell, and Macey reached for her, half-carried her toward the plane.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Zach,\u201d I said as we got closer, \u201care you sure that we can trust this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d a boy said, throwing open the plane\u2019s side door and looking down. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant?\u201d I asked. He must have heard the uncertainty in my voice. It had been almost two years since I\u2019d seen him, after all. I thought back to the semester when a small contingency of students from the Blackthorne Institute came to our school. It seemed like another lifetime, and I stood for a moment, paralyzed wondering exactly how we had gotten so far away from school dances and spying on boys.</p><p>Someone opened the copilot\u2019s window. \u201cCome on, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonas?\u201d Liz cried.</p><p>The boy winked. \u201cWe\u2019re here to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>The plane was small, but we all fit\u2014even if just barely.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Grant told us as he turned the plane on the ice and started building up steam. We bounced and rocked. The wind shifted, and it felt like we were going to topple over before we even took flight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be close!\u201d Jonas yelled when we finally left the ground and headed for the trees.</p><p>I could hear the skis scraping against the icy branches. The engines whined and the plane shook, but we kept climbing, rising steadily into the night.</p><p>And then the silence came.</p><p>We were officially off the grid and in the middle of nowhere. Avalanche or not, the prison guards were going to have a hard time finding us there, and I finally felt myself exhale.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, buddy.\u201d Grant held out a hand, and Zach took it.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d Zach told him. He slapped Jonas on the back. And I felt like I\u2019d fallen into an alternate universe. One where Zach had...friends.</p><p>Neither Grant nor Jonas asked why we were in the middle of nowhere, desperate for a ride. They didn\u2019t inquire as to why we had to fly low across the mountains, out of radar range. This was need-to-know at its finest. We weren\u2019t going to lie to Grant and Jonas, and they weren\u2019t going to lie to us; and we were all perfectly fine with that arrangement.</p><p>\u201cGrant?\u201d Bex asked after the plane leveled off. \u201cDoes this thing come with a first aid kit?\u201d Her voice was softer than it should have been. Her eyes were glassy, and her skin was sallow.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I looked at Bex just as she unzipped her heavy down jacket. Blood stained her shirt, spreading across her shoulder and dripping down her side.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Cam,\u201d my best friend whispered. And then her eyelids fluttered and closed, and I felt my whole world descend into black.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>You never know how you\u2019re going to react to something. To anything. Tragedy, joy, heartache. They affect us all in different ways in different times and different places. There, a thousand feet in the air, I squinted against the dark stain that was spreading across my best friend\u2019s body. I felt the sticky dampness of the blood and watched the way she crumpled, sliding off the plane\u2019s narrow seat and onto the floor.</p><p>I think I might have yelled.</p><p>I think I might have screamed.</p><p>I think I might have cried.</p><p>But to tell you the truth, I\u2019m not exactly sure what I did. I remember ripping off her shirt and staring at the blood.</p><p>\u201cLight!\u201d someone yelled, and soon there was a flashlight shining down on the small hole in Bex\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Zach yelled and dove for her. He held her head. \u201cWake up, Bex. Wake up. Wake up. Wake\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone was crying. It might have been Liz. Or it might have been me. All I know is that Macey was beside me, a first aid kit in her hands. And I was reaching around Bex\u2019s back, feeling the gooey wetness. A gaping hole.</p><p>\u201cExit wound,\u201d I said. Zach pulled Bex into his arms and turned her around and I saw blood. So much blood. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Isn\u2019t that good?\u201d I asked but no one really answered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop the bleeding,\u201d Liz was saying, rattling off facts. \u201cStop the bleeding. Clean the wound.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d heard the words in every lecture on emergency medical procedures that the school doctor and Mr. Solomon had ever given, and yet, I didn\u2019t really think about them. My hands were flying, moving, absent from my mind as I took the alcohol from Macey\u2019s hand and poured it onto Bex\u2019s shoulder. I was glad she was unconscious and didn\u2019t have to feel the pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The gauze bandages were too small\u2014nothing more than glorified Band-Aids\u2014so I stuck them to the entry and exit wounds and unwound my scarf from around my neck, wrapping her body over and over.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die, Bex,\u201d Liz was chanting. \u201cDon\u2019t die. Don\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to die,\u201d I said. \u201cBex won\u2019t die,\u201d I snapped, knowing that Bex herself would never allow it.</p><p>\u201cBex, wake up!\u201d Zach yelled one more time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get her on the ground,\u201d Liz said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get her to a hospital,\u201d Preston countered.</p><p>Then Bex\u2019s eyes fluttered open. She grabbed my hand, held it tighter than I thought possible.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped. \u201cNo hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll find me. Find us,\u201d Bex said, and I nodded, knowing she was right. I pressed against Bex\u2019s wounds.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let them find you,\u201d I promised, and then my best friend drifted away again, her blood still wet and warm on my hands.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Grant and Jonas didn\u2019t ask how I knew where the lake was. No one debated how much longer we should fly. We stayed in the air as long as we possibly could, and when the sun began to creep over the horizon I pointed to the waters below and told them, \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>So we landed. Once we were on the ground, Grant insisted on carrying Bex inside, and my friends and I walked toward the cabin, knee-deep in snow in the predawn light.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Zach asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cCam...\u201d Zach said, his voice a warning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a ranch. Grandpa buys his bulls here. The owners only use this cabin for hunting, though. And nothing is in season now. No one is looking for us here. It\u2019s safe,\u201d I said again, this time the words only for myself.</p><p>Liz and Macey and I stood together in a big crude kitchen with canned goods and a propane-powered cookstove. There was a fireplace and a small bathroom with a shower but no tub, and two bedrooms. One had a set of bunk beds. The other looked like it belonged in an old motel. In every room there were cheap curtains on the windows and no locks on the doors.</p><p>Liz was already unpacking computers and unwinding cords. She looked at me. \u201cPower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a generator out back,\u201d I said but I didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Liz said with a nod. \u201cI still have a backdoor into the NSA satellite system, so I can get that up and running. I need to check on the model, see if there are any headlines. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz.\u201d I tried to stop her, but she just turned on me, a raw kind of desperation in her eyes.</p> <p>It was neither panic nor grief but rather a very grown-up sense of urgency as she told me, \u201cI\u2019m going to find the next domino, Cammie. This thing, I know it\u2019s not my fault. Not really. I know I didn\u2019t sink that tanker or blow up that bridge, but if someone is doing this based on an idea I had\u2014based on my ideas\u201d\u2014she said again, and I knew that that was the hardest part. For someone like Liz, ideas were sacred\u2014\u201cthen I\u2019ve got to stop it.\u201d She stood up a little taller. \u201cThen I will stop it.\u201d</p><p>And I knew right then she would.</p><p>When Zach emerged from one of the bedrooms, Macey said, \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Zach looked down at the ground. \u201cShe\u2019s still out. I thought she might wake when we moved her, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of fever and her pulse is strong. She is strong. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Zach repeated. Then he shook his head and leaned against the cold stove.</p><p>Outside, the sun was rising higher, and, gradually, the cabin filled with an almost iridescent glow, like it was coming back to life. But then a voice cut through the haze, asking, \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>Preston.</p><p>I know it sounds crazy, but I\u2019d almost forgotten about Preston until he looked around the cold cabin, then back at me. \u201cIs my father here, or are we meeting him somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t rush to answer. The truth was just a series of lies I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell: That he shouldn\u2019t worry. That things would be okay. That his father didn\u2019t suffer. But I didn\u2019t want to say any of those things because, for years, I hadn\u2019t wanted to hear them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not coming, is he?\u201d Preston said at last.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Macey admitted.</p><p>\u201cIs he...\u201d Preston started but trailed off. I couldn\u2019t blame him. We were all trained spies, and even we didn\u2019t have the strength to finish that particular sentence. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he coming? Macey?\u201d He looked at her, but she couldn\u2019t face him. \u201cSomeone tell me something! Cammie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Preston,\u201d I said, coming toward him. I took his hands. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I was maybe the only person in the room who knew what he was feeling, but the emotions were too raw for me. When he pushed away, I didn\u2019t protest\u2014didn\u2019t follow. My own wounds were too sore. But I also knew that I was the only one who\u2019d been there. I was the only one who had found my way out.</p><p>\u201cMy father is dead,\u201d Preston said slowly, almost like he was admitting something he was ashamed of. \u201cOf course he\u2019s dead. Wasn\u2019t that what you were trying to tell me in Rome\u2014that people like my dad were dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston,\u201d Macey started, but he was only looking at me.</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d Preston struggled to keep his voice from cracking. He was still slightly frozen and totally numb, and he was trying to hold it all together, trying not to break down and be the weak link as he looked at me. \u201cDo you know how he died?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t aware I was biting my lip until I tasted the blood. I nodded slowly. \u201cHe was shot. In custody. A few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn custody?\u201d Preston asked like he was trying to wrap his mind around the facts, put them all in perspective. \u201cIn that place?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the mountain that was, by then, a thousand miles away.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he died,\u201d Preston said again, like he was still trying the words on for size, trying to make them fit. \u201cWas it your mom?\u201d he asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Zach admitted as if the question wasn\u2019t offensive at all. And I guess when your mom is a psychotic terrorist it isn\u2019t. \u201cCammie was there but she didn\u2019t get a good look at the gunman. He could have been acting on Catherine\u2019s orders. Or maybe the other members of the Inner Circle wanted to eliminate him before he could talk. We aren\u2019t sure which.\u201d</p><p>Preston whirled on me. \u201cYou saw it happen? You were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was dark. I was in the other room, but...yes. I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>\u201cHe asked to see me. I thought I was going to see you, but it was him instead. He told them I was the only person he would talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe said he wanted to talk to me...about the Circle. And he asked me to keep you safe. But when I saw what happened to him, I knew you were never going to be safe in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to be safe out here?\u201d Preston yelled. The shock was wearing off, taking its toll. All that was left was fear and grief and terror. \u201cWhy did they arrest me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Circle,\u201d Macey said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a family business. It\u2019s your family business.\u201d</p><p>But Preston didn\u2019t take the time to process this. He fired back, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m one of the bad guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Macey reached for him, but Preston pulled away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am.\u201d A darkness filled his face. The truth about his father was seeping in, bleeding through his outer layers. \u201cI could kill someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Macey said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Preston pulled a chair out from the table and sank into it. It was like he no longer had the strength to stand.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d I told him. I wanted to keep the facts plain and straight and simple. He\u2019d already heard too much to process any more. \u201cWe think she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Circle is kind of a \u2018by blood\u2019 situation,\u201d Zach explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of thing you marry into.\u201d</p><p>The wind blew and the cabin moaned, and the look in Preston\u2019s eyes made my stomach churn. I thought I might throw up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised about my father.\u201d Preston was tracing circles on the table. I doubt he even realized he was doing it, but he kept doing it again and again. \u201cHe was a member of the Circle,\u201d he said as if trying the words on for size. \u201cShould I be surprised?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Macey, who shrugged. \u201cOur dads are politicians, Preston. Of course we grew up thinking they might be evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston.\u201d I risked moving a little closer, sat down at the table and reached for his hand. \u201cWhen I saw your dad, he told me the Circle leaders are planning something. We think...we think they are trying to start World War Three. And he told me you can help stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Preston sounded genuinely confused. \u201cHow am I supposed to know how to stop World War Three? That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how it sounds. It\u2019s just...have you heard anything? Seen anything? Did your dad give you something for safekeeping or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to. He told me you did. He\u2014it was his dying breath, Preston. Now, think!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam.\u201d Zach\u2019s hand was on my shoulder, but I pushed on.</p><p>\u201cYou know something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Preston was rising, shaking his head. \u201cNo. No. Just...no.\u201d</p><p>Even though the sun was growing higher, none of us had slept the night before. Stress and fear mixed with exhaustion, and I could sense Preston starting to crack.</p><p>Zach must have seen it too, because before I could press again, Zach took his arm. \u201cCome on, Preston. Let\u2019s get you some sleep.\u201d</p><p>I thought I was alone on the porch. Right up until the moment when I felt Zach\u2019s arms go around me. There are many advantages to being romantically involved with a spy, and totally spontaneous and unexpected hugging has to be one of them. I leaned against him, felt the warmth of his body against mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking,\u201d he told me. He turned me to face him, ran his hands quickly up and down my arms. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out here like this.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t the cold that shook me. It was shock or fear or maybe just the sensation of adrenaline draining from my body, so I shook harder.</p><p>Through the window I saw Preston sitting at the rickety little table, rocking slightly.</p><p>\u201cHow many will they send?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor him.\u201d I nodded in Preston\u2019s direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou mean the good guys or the bad guys?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEither,\u201d I said with a shrug. \u201cBoth.\u201d Then I had to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s getting harder to tell the difference.\u201d</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cI know the feeling.\u201d Then he turned, and the sunlight sliced across his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d I said.</p> <p>I brought my sleeve up to touch the scrape near his hairline, but Zach moved away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.

Are we really going to stop the Circle? Is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I\u2019d never heard Zach\u2019s voice so confident and full of strength. But I didn\u2019t let myself believe it. I was too busy rambling on.</p><p>\u201cWhat good will it do? What are we supposed to do if we stop them? We can\u2019t trust the CIA. The FBI. Where are we supposed to go, Zach? Are there any good guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He grabbed me, pulled me close. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at one.\u201d</p><p>And then he kissed me, hard and fast. He pulled back. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s over\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stopped him. \u201cLet\u2019s not think about the future.\u201d I kissed him again. \u201cLet\u2019s just not think.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Light and dark blurred together. Eventually, the sun set and rose again, but I was like a newborn with my days and nights mixed up, and I almost never slept in coordination with the sun. I almost never slept at all. I just stayed by Bex\u2019s bedside, listening as she said, \u201cCammie.\u201d Her lips were dry and cracking, and I dabbed at them with a damp cloth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Bex,\u201d I told her. I felt her forehead, but it was cool. No fever, no infection, just a deep and fitful sleep; and I had to hold her down to keep her from tossing too badly and opening up her brand-new stitches, courtesy of Macey and the Gallagher Academy\u2019s intensive emergency medical procedures training.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find Cammie,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Bex. I\u2019m back,\u201d I said, and only then did I realize that a part of her was still looking for me. Part of her might never stop.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>I turned at the sound of the voice.</p> <p>\u201cThe antibiotics in the med kit that Liz brought with us from school were really strong. They\u2019ve knocked her out. But she\u2019s fine,\u201d I told Preston. \u201cIt\u2019s just her shoulder.\u201d I said again, \u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I could sit with her?\u201d Preston asked from the doorway. He took a step forward, his hands shoved into his back pockets. \u201cLet me rephrase. I\u2019m going to sit with her. You\u2019re going to take a break.\u201d</p><p>When I stood and walked into the main room, my legs didn\u2019t want to work. My head swirled a little, too light on my shoulders. I hadn\u2019t eaten. I hadn\u2019t slept. I\u2019d done nothing for days but worry and doubt and pray.</p><p>A light was flickering in the kitchen. An eerie fluorescent glare filled the room, the bulbs humming and buzzing and clinging to life. Liz lay with her head on the table, laptops sprawled around her, running through lines and lines of code, analyzing news stories and weather patterns\u2014searching for the proverbial needle in the haystack.</p><p>I wanted to wake her up and tell her to go get some sleep in a real bed, but I knew there was no use, so I just took a seat beside her and turned one of the laptops to face me, holding my breath as I called up the website I\u2019d been quietly checking for days. There wouldn\u2019t be anything, I was certain.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe as the website came to life. It was supposed to advertise farm and ranch land for sale in the Sandhills. I still remember my father looking at the site when I was a little girl. He would talk about a future when we would return to Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s and never leave. When we would be safe and sound in Nebraska. All spies have an exit plan, an anonymous city or stretch of abandoned beach. My father was going to have a rock house and a natural spring, good fences and enough horizon so that the spy in him would always be able to see what was coming.</p><p>I blinked twice and read the ad again.</p><p>M&amp;M properties offering twenty acres for sale. Excellent condition. And a phone number I\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>It had been years since my mom had told me about it, put the plan into place. It was just for emergencies, she had said, just in case we ever got separated. Because, deep down, I think we\u2019d both always known something like that was coming.</p><p>I read the lines again.</p><p>M&amp;M properties: Matthew Morgan.</p><p>Twenty acres: Two agents.</p><p>Excellent condition: They were fine.</p><p>And a phone number that\u2014to anyone else\u2014wouldn\u2019t work. But if I added one to every digit, I could finally hear my mother\u2019s voice.</p><p>I ran to our stash of burner phones and dialed without thinking. I couldn\u2019t breathe as the phone rang and rang, and then finally: \u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d I practically shouted. I was on the verge of crying. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear from you. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise Guy and I are fine,\u201d she talked on, not stopping, not caring what I said or how many tears broke through my throat\u2014and I knew she wasn\u2019t listening. She probably didn\u2019t even have that phone anymore. It was just a recording.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re safe. We\u2019re closing in on the Delauhunt heir, we think.\u201d I heard her take a deep breath, static temporarily filling the line. \u201cI heard what happened at school, sweetheart. And I\u2019m glad you left. You\u2019re doing the right thing. I\u2019m so proud of you. But you have to promise me you won\u2019t worry about us. Wise Guy and I...we\u2019ll keep each other safe. You girls...you do the same, okay? Keep each other safe.\u201d</p><p>I thought about Bex\u2019s blood, her fitful dreams. And, finally, I thought about how easily we all could have died on that mountain.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t use this number again, and you should destroy your phone too. We have the dead drop. Use it if you need it. But, sweetheart, just promise you\u2019ll be careful. You\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d Mom said again.</p><p>\u201cAnd, kiddo. Happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>Birthday. I had forgotten my own birthday. Sometime in the past week I\u2019d turned eighteen, and I hadn\u2019t even realized it. I looked down at the phone in my hand. I knew I was supposed to destroy it immediately, but I couldn\u2019t. Instead, I listened to the message again and again and again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>I listened until the words lost all meaning, until I became numb to even my mother\u2019s voice. I listened until I didn\u2019t even hear the words anymore.</p><p>You\u2019re doing the right thing.</p><p>Zach was in the kitchen. He wore old jeans and had bare feet, and I thought that maybe bacon-frying was a pretty dangerous thing to do without a shirt on, but I didn\u2019t say so.</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl?\u201d He looked at the burner phone I carried in one hand, the SIM card I held in the other.</p><p>\u201cIt was my mom,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, then hurried to add, \u201cThey\u2019re fine. They\u2019re closing in on Delauhunt and... It was just a message, Zach. She didn\u2019t tell me what to do. She just said that I was doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell her about Bex or Preston. I couldn\u2019t tell her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He reached me in one long stride, arms going around me, so strong and sure, and I pressed my cheek against his chest. He smelled like soap and bacon. \u201cTell me what she said.\u201d</p><p>So I did. I told him every word, not that any of them mattered. Even Rachel Morgan didn\u2019t know what we were supposed to do next.</p><p>\u201cI forgot my own birthday, Zach. I\u2019m eighteen now,\u201d I said, but I didn\u2019t feel like an adult. I felt like a little girl, alone and afraid and desperate for my mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. Hey.\u201d He wiped my tears away. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing about being a spy: sometimes all you have are your lies. They protect your cover and keep your secrets, and right then I needed to believe that it was true even when all the facts said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Macey said from the bedroom door. At the sound, Liz stirred and bolted upright.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me up?\u201d Liz asked. She yawned and looked down at the laptop in front of her. Two seconds later, her face went whiter than I\u2019d ever seen it. Her lips trembled, and her fingers froze on the laptop\u2019s keys. She looked away, but it was too late. Even without her photographic memory, Liz could never un-see what the computer said.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d Liz pushed her favorite laptop away with so much strength it would have fallen off the table if Zach hadn\u2019t been there to stop it. \u201cIt\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the screen and read the words aloud for no one\u2019s benefit but my own. \u201c\u2018Exiled King Najeeb of Caspia to address protesters outside the United Nations.\u2019\u201d</p><p>As much as I wanted to deny what was happening in the world outside our little cabin, I knew there was no use trying to hide. The facts will always find you. And the scarier they are, the faster they travel.</p><p>Liz was up and moving across the room. She\u2019s always had this habit of bringing her right hand to her mouth, resting her fingertips against her lips while she talks to herself, almost as if learning to read her lips by touch. She was doing it then. She spoke so quickly and so softly that I could barely make out the words.</p><p>\u201cThis is it. This is happening.\u201d Then she seemed to doubt herself. \u201cIs this it?\u201d</p><p>Liz was walking, but it wasn\u2019t with the panic-ridden steps of a caged animal. It was the careful, cautious pacing of a genius who needed time and space to think.</p><p>I risked a glance at Zach, but he was quiet, like he didn\u2019t want to break whatever trance Liz was in, like he too knew she was our single best chance at stopping the Circle.</p><p>Liz paced and talked like it was just another test. Another challenge. She was looking at it like an exercise in probability\u2014cause and effect. It\u2019s the physics of human nature, and to truly understand it, one has to be objective and cool. Two things every operative is supposed to be. Two things I was becoming less and less acquainted with all the time.</p><p>\u201cTension,\u201d Liz said at last. She was still pacing, though, and I knew the word was meant only for her. \u201cThat region is filled with conflict, but the Circle will need to ratchet up the tension. It will have to be something big. And public. Something that is symbolic and practical at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Some people always want to fight. Some are always looking for a reason not to. And Liz was right: For the Circle to cause World War III, they had to take away any cause for diplomacy and caution. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt has to be personal,\u201d Liz said, finally looking at all of us. It was almost like she\u2019d forgotten we were even there. \u201cSomeone has to strike first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by strike you mean...\u201d Zach prompted.</p><p>\u201cAn assassination. The Circle is going to assassinate the king of Caspia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaspia doesn\u2019t have a king anymore,\u201d Macey reminded her, but Liz just shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cKing Najeeb may be living in exile, but he\u2019s still incredibly popular in his home country. If he were to die, then the Caspian government would have a full-fledged revolt on their hands. And the Iranians are banking on a very stable Caspia. That is their largest remaining trade route. If Najeeb dies, then the Iranians will have to move in to stabilize the region.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd break the Treaty of Caspia...\u201d I filled in.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Liz said with a nod.</p><p>World War I ignited after the killing of an Austrian duke. World War II began with German troops crossing a border. Sometimes big things start in small ways. And it was easy to imagine what the assassination of a king might lead to.</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t move Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should move Bex to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure who said what, to tell you the truth. The words were a blur. Were they coming from outside or inside my mind? I could no longer tell. The only things I heard for sure were my mother\u2019s words coming to me over and over again.</p><p>You\u2019re doing the right thing.</p><p>\u201cCammie.\u201d Liz\u2019s voice broke through the fog. \u201cCammie, what are we going to do? They\u2019re going to assassinate the king!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they aren\u2019t.\u201d I turned to see Bex leaning against the door frame, weak as a kitten. But there was a spark in her eyes again. She was utterly and completely Bexish as she said, \u201cThey aren\u2019t, because we\u2019re going to stop them.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>PROS AND CONS OF DRIVING CROSS-COUNTRY TO STOP A POSSIBLE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT:</p><p>PRO: Big elaborate road trips are supposed to be a teenage rite of passage.</p><p>CON: Somehow I don\u2019t think normal teenage road trips involve buying a van from a dealership called Toothless Joe\u2019s Quality Used Vehicles (even though everyone we saw did, in fact, have teeth).</p><p>PRO: It is a whole lot easier to continually bounce your Internet access off of various satellites if you are constantly moving into the range of different satellites.</p><p>CON: It\u2019s pretty hard to remain alluring and attractive to your boyfriend if you spend all your time sleeping and eating and working at sixty miles an hour.</p><p>PRO: Knowing you\u2019re doing the thing you\u2019ve been training to do since you were twelve years old.</p><p>CON: Knowing in your gut that you might not be ready to actually do it.</p> <p>I\u2019m not going to say it was the strangest covert task force ever assembled, but it wasn\u2019t exactly ordinary either.</p><p>\u201cWe should go in from the north,\u201d Zach said, leaning forward and addressing Macey, who drove.</p><p>I looked through the windows at the towering buildings of the Manhattan skyline. The streets were already packed with people carrying picket signs and Caspian flags.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know, Lizzie?\u201d Bex asked. She held on to the back of the front seat, supporting herself more than she usually would, but she didn\u2019t wince or show any kind of pain or fear. She was being brave. I would have settled for her being careful.</p><p>\u201cHis Royal Highness will be addressing the rally at noon exactly. He will make brief remarks from a stage on the street in front of the UN. There\u2019s a little square there for protests and rallies. The NYPD should have the whole area blocked off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going inside?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>Liz shook her head. \u201cAccording to what I\u2019ve gotten off of the UN servers, he can\u2019t. Not really. I mean, technically, the king is a deposed monarch, which means he has no official authority to speak on behalf of Caspia.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. I looked at the people who filled the streets, many of them carrying signs with a royal crown on them, pictures of the king. \u201cYeah. But you\u2019d have a hard time convincing them of that.\u201d</p><p>We drove as far as we could, then Macey parked the van. We left Liz there to run our comms and do her magic with the computer. As we walked toward the East River, the wind blew harder, and the crowds grew heavier with each passing step.</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Macey said, \u201chave you heard anything else from your mom?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, but it took me a second to speak. \u201cI put a post on the message board that we know what the Inner Circle is planning. But she may not get it in time. Or she may be too far away or already engaged in another op or...\u201d</p><p>Hurt.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Imprisoned.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like any of the other possible ends of that sentence, so I didn\u2019t say them. No one blamed me. No good would come from saying them aloud.</p><p>\u201cI think about the Caspia I knew as a child.\u201d A voice came booming through the streets, and my friends and I all stopped to listen. The man\u2019s English bore the accent of someone who was raised in the Middle East but educated in the West\u2014America, or England, maybe. And when he spoke, it was like all of New York fell under his trance.</p><p>There was no denying it: that was the voice of a king.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d Until I said the words, I hadn\u2019t realized how much I\u2019d been hoping that it all might have been just a false alarm, an easy fix. \u201cLiz, I thought you hacked into Homeland Security and told them there was a potential terror threat at the UN this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did!\u201d she countered. \u201cI gave them enough to shut down half the city. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Until then, Preston had been quiet. An observer. A guest. He seemed almost surprised when we all turned to him. \u201cI mean, have you ever seen a politician give up a microphone?\u201d Preston quipped, then shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And I knew he had a point.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re too late,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>The United Nations was right ahead of us, on the other side of a wide avenue that had been blocked off. Crowds stood between us and the long row of flags from all the participating countries. The flags blew in the wind, the flagpoles standing like a hundred sentries guarding the entrance to the building.</p><p>But the people on the street didn\u2019t care about the towering glass-and-steel structure. Their eyes were trained upon the small grassy area that had been cordoned off, a man and a microphone centered on the small stage.</p><p>\u201cThere were hard times,\u201d the man said, \u201cbut there was hope. There was fear, but there was also courage. I think of the Caspia that I wanted for my child, and my heart breaks that Amirah will never know the sunrises over our sea. My soul bleeds to think that all of our children will never know a Caspia without tyranny and fear!\u201d</p><p>The crowds erupted in thunderous applause.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAmirah, crown princess of Caspia,\u201d Liz said through our comms units, rattling off enough facts to make Mr. Smith proud; but the time for tests was over. We were never going to be graded again. \u201cShe\u2019s second in line to the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Liz,\u201d Bex countered. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a throne anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about the security situation?\u201d I asked, this time being more specific.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him out of here,\u201d Macey said.</p><p>\u201cZach, talk to me.\u201d I turned to the boy who had spent more time with Joe Solomon than any of us, and Zach didn\u2019t wait for instructions.</p><p>\u201cSince he\u2019s not an official visiting dignitary, the Secret Service won\u2019t be here. He will have private security and the NYPD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Macey, you and Preston go find the cops and his private security detail. Beg, plead\u2014lie if you have to\u2014but get someone to get him off that stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Macey said. She grabbed Preston\u2019s hand, and together they took off, pushing through the crowds.</p><p>\u201cLiz, get back into the NYPD database and alert all units in the area that we have possible terror activity. If Homeland Security isn\u2019t going to take this seriously, maybe the NYPD will. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get them to shut this thing down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d Liz told me.</p><p>In my mind, I flashed back to another clear day, another charismatic man behind a microphone while crowds cheered. At the time, Macey\u2019s father had been running for vice president, and we\u2019d thought that she was the one the Circle of Cavan was chasing. At the time, Mr. Solomon had spoken about security perimeters\u2014long-range, mid-range, short-range. Zones A, B, and C. And I looked to the horizon.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do about snipers?\u201d I asked, and Zach scanned the skyline. Clear views and light wind. And even without saying a word, I could see it in Zach\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t like the situation.</p><p>He looked at Bex, who shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThat building puts you on top of three different bus routes. It\u2019s a clear shot with great exits. So...nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing we can do about snipers except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him out of here,\u201d I filled in the rest.</p><p>On the stage, King Najeeb spoke on, a somber silence sweeping farther through the crowd with every word. \u201cI do not hate the men who burned my father\u2019s statues. I have forgiven the mob who dragged my mother from her bed.\u201d</p><p>I thought of my own mother. Where was she sleeping? And would she wake one night to the feeling of a cold barrel of a gun against her temple?</p><p>A limousine and two NYPD police cruisers were pulling around the back of the crowd to a small area behind the stage. I felt a tiny bit of hope that maybe it was working\u2014that he was leaving.</p><p>Together, we started pushing through the crowd, trying to make our way to the stage and the man upon it, who kept speaking. If King Najeeb knew the danger he was in, he didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>\u201cThe home I love is gone now, but I do not mourn for it. I pray instead for the promise of a new day, a new era, a new beginning, when peace and love can shine upon all the children of Caspia. A new reign of hope and not of fear, of promise and not of terror. I pray for home. I pray for Caspia. I pray for the future.\u201d</p><p>Applause filled the streets, followed by chants and cries. King Najeeb stepped away from the microphone and waved triumphantly at the crowd. I felt my heart start to beat again, knowing he was finished. He was okay. But he wasn\u2019t safe, and we all knew it. I waited for him to leave the stage, for his guards to hurry him into the waiting car; but the king pushed his guards aside.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man of the people,\u201d I said, citing some article that Mr. Smith had made us read once about all the royals in the world who were living in exile. The former king chose an apartment over a palace, a subway pass over a limousine. And, whenever possible, he liked to walk wherever he went.</p><p>The peaceful, easy chanting of the crowd was changing, morphing from song to roar, as the people parted and the king climbed down from the stage, easing out into the crowd as if intending to shake the hand of every person who had gathered there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go! Make him go!\u201d I yelled to no one in particular. My cries were lost inside the crowd.</p><p>There were guards in dark suits speaking into his ear, but King Najeeb didn\u2019t seem to notice them or care. He was shaking the hands of his people. Blessing babies and waving at the masses like a returning, conquering hero.</p><p>He walked without a worry or a fear in the world right through the heart of Security Perimeter B\u2014the area that was most dangerous for short-range arms and high-powered explosives.</p><p>Was it that thought that made me stop? I don\u2019t know. Maybe my subconscious saw the small, abandoned package before the rest of me could process what it meant. Maybe it was Joe Solomon\u2019s voice in the back of my head or my father\u2019s angel on my shoulder, but in any case I did stop.</p> <p>And I looked at the package on the ground, directly in the king\u2019s path.</p><p>And I heard my own voice scream, \u201cBomb!\u201d</p><p>Looking back, it was like it happened in slow motion\u2014like running through sand. One moment, I was watching the king stroll through his people, shaking hands. The next there was nothing but a cloud of smoke and terror. People screamed. Children cried. But it all sounded so far away, like a TV blaring in a distant room.</p><p>I coughed and squinted. The force of the blow had knocked me to the ground, and my side ached. My hands hurt. It took everything I had to force myself upright.</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d Zach was yelling. I realized there was static in my ear. The blast must have knocked out our comms units. In the smoke, we were practically deaf and blind.</p> <p>\u201cCam!\u201d Bex yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d I said. There was a bleeding woman carrying a child.</p><p>A man stumbled through the crowd, his face so covered in blood that I couldn\u2019t even tell what damage had been done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said, softer, as I pushed against the current of people trying to flee the blast site. I had to see it. The crater where the bomb had begun. The mangled bodies of the guards and the man who was Caspia\u2019s only hope for peace.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m too late.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p> <p>Surely that wasn\u2019t the longest night of my life, but it felt like it.</p><p>Not one of us protested when Liz insisted we stop and clean our wounds in the bathroom of a gas station outside the city. They were inconsequential, really. Scrapes and bruises. I had a pretty nasty cut on my shoulder, but nothing any worse than any of us had had before. We\u2019d been on the perimeter of the blast radius. Ten feet closer to the king, and we wouldn\u2019t have been so lucky.</p><p>Once we were back in the van, I risked a glance at Zach. No one had tended to his scrapes and burns. No one had tried to. He just kept staring out the window, looking for what, exactly, I didn\u2019t really know.</p><p>Maybe a way out.</p><p>Maybe a chance to turn back time.</p><p>We kept the radio of the van turned low. News of the king\u2019s assassination swept across the globe. Riots were spreading throughout Caspia and beyond, crossing borders, a whole region on fire. Chaos was the new norm. The world was a powder keg, and I rubbed my sore body, afraid I\u2019d just felt the spark.</p><p>We drove all night, heading south along the coastline until I was almost convinced Zach was going to drive us out to sea.</p><p>Finally there was a dock with a small ferry that you had to push with a long pole, like it was still 1850. At last there was an island and an overgrown pathway and a house surrounded by tall trees filled with Spanish moss, a massive wraparound porch and a scene befitting Scarlett O\u2019Hara.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this place, Zach?\u201d I asked, but he didn\u2019t answer. He just kicked the front door; but it didn\u2019t put up a fight, splintering easily, swinging open. Liz carried her computers protectively like there might be an alligator or a monster after her hard drive. But Zach said nothing. He just kept looking at the staircase as if waiting for a ghost to descend from the second floor.</p><p>It had been a grand old house once, a mansion. But everything about it had fallen into rubble from decades of disuse and neglect.</p><p>\u201cIs this one of Joe\u2019s houses?\u201d I waited, but Zach was speechless. \u201cIf it\u2019s Joe\u2019s house, Zach, we probably shouldn\u2019t stay. Someone may track us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Joe.\u201d Zach shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBut you know it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question, not a guess. I inched slowly closer. \u201cWhose house is it, Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe.\u201d He turned. \u201cWe\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach...\u201d I reached for him, but he pulled away and walked to the corner of the room, measuring his footsteps carefully, listening until one step sounded slightly different from the others. Then he knelt to the floor and removed one of the boards and reached inside to pull out six birthday candles and a G.I. Joe, a rumpled five-dollar bill and an assortment of broken crayons\u2014and only then did I know where Zach had brought us. After all, that wasn\u2019t the covert stash of an operative; it was the hiding place of a child.</p><p>\u201cThis was your mother\u2019s safe house,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>But Zach just looked around the big, dusty rooms that must have been so grand, once upon a time. \u201cNo. It was her house,\u201d he said.</p><p>Spies aren\u2019t like normal people. No one expects us to have houses and mortgages, tire swings and barbecues on the Fourth of July. But every spy is somebody\u2019s child, and I stepped across those dusty floorboards, wondering what kind of place had given birth to the woman we called Catherine.</p><p>\u201cThis was my room.\u201d He looked into the small space. \u201cThere were bedrooms upstairs, of course, but I didn\u2019t like being alone. I was scared of the dark and the wind and the storms.... There were such bad storms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it be traced to you, Zach? To her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s natural gas on the property, and the rooms are still lit with gaslight. I think there might be a generator. A water well, but no phone. The whole house is off the grid.\u201d Zach gave a gruff laugh. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even know there is a grid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you were here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Ten years ago? Maybe longer. She used to talk about fixing it up\u2014making it like it was in its prime. But I don\u2019t know how it was. I just know this.\u201d</p><p>He motioned around the derelict rooms, and I don\u2019t know if he meant it or not, but it sounded like he was saying he didn\u2019t know anything other than a vagabond way of life. \u201cThis is all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t stay here, Zach,\u201d I tried. \u201cWe could keep driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, Gallagher Girl.\u201d He shook his head slowly. \u201cThe king is dead. There\u2019s nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>I grew up in an old mansion. I know the chill that creeps through stone walls, the sounds a roof can make in a hard wind. But that night was different. Everything creaked and moaned. When the rain started, it fell in heavy waves, beating against the house and dripping through the ceiling. There was a steady, even ping as fat drops fell on the keys of the old piano. And the longer the storm pounded outside, the more I expected the house might blow right off its foundation and out into the waves.</p><p>There must have been debris in the chimney, because when we built a fire, smoke backed into the house, filling it with an eerie haze. We propped open the front door, and for a while the smoke mixed with the wet wind while Preston and Macey surveyed the contents of the kitchen. Liz was unpacking equipment, and Zach stoked the fire.</p><p>But I just sat at the bottom of the stairs, rubbing my palms against my jeans, dried blood smearing onto dark denim, wondering, Is that it? Is it really over?</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d I looked up to find Bex leaning against the banister, looming over me. It was like she\u2019d read my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou should get some sleep, Bex. We\u2019ll probably need to change your bandages and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about my bloody bandages,\u201d she said, then grinned. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Bex...\u201d I started. Suddenly, I felt so tired, so worn.</p><p>\u201cNo, you look. This isn\u2019t the end,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou think I got shot...for this?\u201d Bex snapped. \u201cI\u2019m a spy, Cam. I was born to do this\u2014to be this. It\u2019s in my blood. And I will do it until the day I die. It\u2019s who I am,\u201d my best friend said, then leveled a glare at me. \u201cThe thing I don\u2019t think you realize is...it\u2019s who you are too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bex shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t. If you did, you never would have spent half of our sophomore year dating Josh. You wouldn\u2019t be freaked out at the thought of graduation. You would know what life after spy school means. It means this, Cam. This. And you are better at it than anyone that I have ever known. Now, get up. And tell us what comes next.\u201d</p><p>But I didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s have it.\u201d She held out her hand, waggled her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d my best friend told me. \u201cHand it over.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask again. I just reached into my pocket and pulled out the list I\u2019d been carrying around for weeks.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Bex pointed at the paper. \u201cWilliam Smith. Gideon Maxwell. Two names, Cam. There are only two names left!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Bex demanded.</p><p>\u201cBut the king is dead, Bex.\u201d I felt silly pointing it out, almost disrespectful saying the words aloud. \u201cWe didn\u2019t stop the assassination. We couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Bex didn\u2019t wait for me to finish. She spun and yelled across the room.</p><p>\u201cLiz, has it started yet?\u201d Bex asked. \u201cHave the Iranians invaded Caspia?\u201d</p><p>Liz sat at her computers. She didn\u2019t say a word; she just shook her head. No.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s time to bloody well stop it!\u201d</p><p>I knew she was right. Of course she was. Bex was always right. She knew me better than I knew myself. But then again, isn\u2019t that a best friend\u2019s job?</p><p>\u201cSo tell me what comes next,\u201d Bex demanded.</p><p>I looked up at her for a long time, thinking, praying. My voice was scratchy and distant. It wasn\u2019t like my own when I stood and started to speak.</p><p>\u201cLiz, when we get a secure line let me know. I\u2019ve got to try to contact Mom and Abby.\u201d Macey and Preston came in from the kitchen, and I looked around the group. \u201cAs for the rest of us, we\u2019re going to try to get some sleep. Regroup. And first thing tomorrow morning, we\u2019re going to figure out what happens next.\u201d</p><p>I meant it in that moment. I really did. I thought we would sleep for a few hours and wake up to a new day filled with new possibilities. I thought the morning would bring change. But I should have known that it doesn\u2019t take that long for change to happen\u2014it takes a second. A moment. In a single breath, reality as you know it can simply fall away.</p><p>When I heard a sound on the porch I thought it was the wind rattling the shutters. It felt like the world and its troubles were blowing straight to our door, so I looked at my friends in turn and said, \u201cOkay, everybody, get some sleep, and tomorrow we\u2019ll figure out how to stop the Circle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d A laugh filled the room. \u201cMaybe I can help with that.\u201d</p><p>I spun to look at the woman who stood silhouetted in the door. Wind gusted around her, and bits of hair blew across her face, framing her dark eyes as she looked at Zach and said, \u201cHello, sweetheart. Sorry to disturb you, but I believe you have a walk-in.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>Maybe you\u2019ve never heard the term \u201cwalk-in.\u201d If you\u2019re reading this, though, you probably have. You probably know that it\u2019s the term spy agencies use for when rival operatives come in out of the cold. It\u2019s a phrase that brings to mind hope and fear in equal measures. This could be big, you think. This could be nothing, you know. But whatever the case, it is never, ever something that you ignore or disregard.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why we all sat staring at the door, every one of us gaping at the woman who stood there.</p><p>In a flash, Zach was moving toward her, but Catherine held her hands up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cI come in peace,\u201d Catherine said.</p><p>None of us believed her.</p><p>Zach was almost to his mother, who reached out as if to hug him or touch his face.</p> <p>\u201cI missed you, darling,\u201d Catherine told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown into such a handsome young\u2014\u201d</p><p>But his mother didn\u2019t finish because, just then, I rushed past Zach, toward the woman who had captured me\u2014kidnapped me. I didn\u2019t think as I pulled back my fist and punched with all my might.

Creeping toward the stairs, I saw her below, pacing like a tiny blond blur. The rain must have stopped and the chimney must have cleared, because the air was warm and dry\u2014almost cozy\u2014as I walked down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she want? Presumably not to kill us...because we\u2019re not dead.\u201d Liz was rattling off the facts at ninety miles per hour. \u201cLet\u2019s say we\u2019re looking at a double-agent situation. She\u2019s come to infiltrate us and send our plans back to her bosses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have bosses,\u201d Bex said, but Liz rattled on.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she really is a walk-in. Maybe she has information for us and we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t listen to her, Liz,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Liz started, until Zach cut her off.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just as dangerous in here as she is out there. You got that?\u201d he asked. He looked at Bex and Liz in turn. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>Macey took a deep breath and crossed her arms. \u201cWell, I vote we bind her hands and feet and kick her out of a fast moving vehicle in front of the gates of Langley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do that,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zach asked, like he was seriously considering the idea.</p><p>\u201cBecause the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201d I started for the small room where we\u2019d tied Catherine up the night before, but Zach lunged in front of me, blocking my way.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you question her, Gallagher Girl,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that why she\u2019s here\u2014to talk?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s here to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cam,\u201d Zach said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s our only idea,\u201d I said back.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I heard a tiny voice behind me and turned to see Liz standing there, a truly guilty look on her face. \u201cMaybe not our only idea...\u201d</p><p>Catherine sat in her chair, hands and feet bound, yet she looked like she was waiting on a train, like she\u2019d wait forever if she had to.</p><p>\u201cHello, Catherine,\u201d I said, easing closer. She was across the room, but like a snake, I could feel her coiled, constantly ready to strike.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Cammie,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d Catherine told him, but it was as if she\u2019d never spoken at all.</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl,\u201d he started again, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of his mother.</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d I said, and then my smallest roommate walked forward. She didn\u2019t tremble or shake, but I knew she must have been terrified as she pulled up the sleeve of Catherine\u2019s shirt and injected a clear liquid into the woman\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cTruth serum, girls?\u201d Catherine said. She sounded so disappointed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a tad clich\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stronger,\u201d Liz said, then stepped quickly back. Zach moved between Liz and his mother until Liz was safely out of range of the woman tied to the chair.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Catherine asked as Liz\u2019s concoction entered her bloodstream. It was like she was growing drunk and sleepy. Her eyelids were heavy, and when she told Zach, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so tall,\u201d her words were slurred.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you hunting down the leaders of the Circle?\u201d I asked, and Catherine looked at me for a long time, the tiniest of smiles playing at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Cammie, dear. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we shouldn\u2019t hit her again?\u201d Bex said from over my shoulder. \u201cBecause I totally think we should hit her.\u201d</p><p>I crouched on the floor, looked her in the eye. \u201cYou can talk to me, Catherine. Or you can talk to the CIA. Maybe the moles the Circle leaders have within the agency won\u2019t find you. But maybe they will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead, you know. The leaders. We just have one left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and Joseph and I,\u201d Catherine said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying,\u201d Zach said. \u201cJoe would never work with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course he would,\u201d Catherine told him. \u201cHe\u2019d never admit it, but we want the same thing. We\u2019ve always wanted the same thing. We just have different...methods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike torture,\u201d I said.</p><p>Catherine looked right at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you, Cammie. I really didn\u2019t. But it was the only way. I had to stop them, don\u2019t you know? I had to stop this. You had to help me. And you did help me. And now we\u2019re down to one.... Gideon Maxwell had one son and no grandchildren. His line stops there. There were no other heirs. So it\u2019s possible that there is no Maxwell descendant in the Circle now. Maybe there are just six Inner Circle members instead of seven. Maybe we\u2019re finished. But I doubt it. It doesn\u2019t feel finished.\u201d</p><p>Catherine seemed to think on that for a moment, and I had to admit that I agreed. Something in my bones told me it was still a long way from over.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Maxwell appointed someone else to take his place before he died. But I honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d Catherine\u2019s gaze shifted onto Preston. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d</p><p>Her hands were bound, and still Preston flinched, almost like he\u2019d been slapped. I expected Macey to lash out at Catherine, but instead she turned to the boy beside her.</p><p>\u201cPres?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Preston\u2019s voice cracked and he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Gordon Maxwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon Maxwell,\u201d Liz corrected.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him! I don\u2019t know any of my dad\u2019s friends. Or...I don\u2019t know which of his friends might be in the Inner Circle.\u201d Preston seemed sad when he said it, as if he too had been living a lie. It was just that no one had bothered to tell him. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d I turned back to Catherine. \u201cWhy did you betray the Circle\u2019s leadership?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the betrayal business.\u201d Catherine laughed. \u201cBesides, I like the world the way it is. A world war is a highly inconvenient thing. I prefer my destruction on a much smaller scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they want? What are the Circle leaders planning?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know what they\u2019re planning,\u201d Catherine countered. She sounded almost bored, like we were wasting her time. She looked around Zach, to where Liz stood. \u201cIt was her plan, after all.\u201d</p><p>Liz shuddered but didn\u2019t speak or cringe or cry. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that our little roommate was growing up. We all were.</p><p>\u201cWho is the mole at the Gallagher Academy?\u201d I asked, but Catherine only looked at me as if I were crazy. \u201cHow did the Circle get Liz\u2019s test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThe school has to file all of its admittance tests with the CIA. From there, it was easy enough for the Circle to acquire them just to see if there were any students we wanted to recruit...\u201d She looked at Liz. \u201cEvil plans we wanted to steal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zach asked. \u201cWorld war...what\u2019s in it for them?\u201d He leaned down to his mother\u2019s level. \u201cWhat do they want?\u201d</p><p>Then Catherine looked at her son as if he were the most naive boy in the world. \u201cThey want everything,\u201d she said, and then she cackled. She was insane\u2014there was no denying it. But she was also oddly lucid as she said, \u201cThe government is so big\u2014so powerful. Cavan wanted the Union to fail\u2014that\u2019s why he tried to kill Lincoln. It\u2019s the same agenda. They want what they\u2019ve always wanted. Chaos. Fracture. Pieces so disorganized that no single player can ever have too much power.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cOf course, what they really mean but never say is that they don\u2019t want anyone to have more power than they have. Personally, I like power. It\u2019s one of many reasons I want to see them fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what they\u2019re planning,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what they\u2019re planning,\u201d she countered. She was staring at Liz. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Liz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want war,\u201d Liz said, her voice surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cBut is there war?\u201d Catherine asked.</p><p>No. The answer swept over us all. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cKing Najeeb was a charismatic leader, but he was a grown man in a dangerous business. He still had enemies. His death, while sad, was not that tragic in the bigger scheme of things. And besides...it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe princess,\u201d I said, and Catherine nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA grown man blown to bits is sad.

I don\u2019t know if Liz\u2019s drugs were finally becoming too much, but her voice had a hazy quality as she looked at me. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we...\u201d I started, then something in her eyes made me stop. She shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cYou know where she is, Gallagher Girl.\u201d The words sounded different when Zach\u2019s mother said them. Haunting and dangerous and cruel.</p><p>\u201cAmirah.\u201d I whispered the princess\u2019s name and thought about my first night back at school, about the tiny seventh grader with the big brown eyes and utterly royal countenance. \u201cAmy. She goes to the Gallagher Academy, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>A dreamy smile spread across Catherine\u2019s lips. \u201cGood girl,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt is a school fit for a queen. Now, go. Stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep away from the psychopath!\u201d</p><p>I knew the voice as soon as I heard it, but still part of me was almost afraid to turn around.</p> <p>My aunt Abby\u2019s eyes were on fire, and she crossed the room in two long strides, grabbing my arm and physically pulling me farther from Zach\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cAbby!\u201d</p><p>At first, I was terrified\u2014afraid my friends and I had been caught playing hooky. But then my fear turned to relief as I realized Abby and Townsend had found us. We didn\u2019t have to be on our own anymore.</p><p>\u201cAbby, you\u2019re here! How did you find us? Did you get my messages? Were you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t following you,\u201d Townsend told us. \u201cWe were following her.\u201d He pointed to the woman tied to the chair, eyelids fluttering.</p><p>Finally, Abby released me and moved to examine Catherine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Abby asked. She picked up the empty syringe, smelled it. \u201cIs that truth serum?\u201d she asked, but Townsend just shook his head.</p><p>I could tell he was thinking about his own experience with that particular concoction when he huffed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this precious?\u201d Catherine smiled weakly and forced her eyes open, almost like she didn\u2019t dare drift off in the middle of the party.</p><p>\u201cAbby, Catherine says the Circle is going to target Princess Amirah next,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zach\u2019s mother said with a decisive nod. Then, just as quickly, she shrugged. \u201cI think so. No one knows exactly what the Circle leaders will do. They are capable of anything, after all. But I believe that is their next move. So I came here to tell the good guys so that they can save the day. Isn\u2019t that what you do, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! Just shut up!\u201d Zach snapped. \u201cI will never believe anything you say.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and shook her head, smiled a little as she told him, \u201cYou are so like your father.\u201d</p><p>Then she looked past me and Zach, past Bex and Abby, to where Agent Townsend stood by the door with his arms crossed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think, Townsend, darling? Isn\u2019t he like you?\u201d She looked at Zach again. \u201cI think he\u2019s just like you.\u201d</p><p>And then she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>Things my aunt said: She lies.</p><p>Things my boyfriend said: She lies.</p><p>Things my gut said: She lies.</p><p>Things I couldn\u2019t deny: She was under the influence of truth serum.</p><p>Things we all had to admit: She wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>\u201cZach?\u201d I asked, my voice too quiet in the darkness. The wind was strong and I could hear the waves crashing on the beach. Another storm was blowing in. I could feel it in the air. And as I stepped off the creaking porch and across the yard I tried again. \u201cZach.\u201d But he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I saw a dark shadow moving against the waves, leaning into the wind, so I walked down the tiny path, careful not to trip any of the alarms that had been set inside of him. I rubbed my arms and wished I\u2019d brought a sweater, but Zach just stood in the blowing mist, his gray T-shirt growing steadily darker in the damp.</p><p>\u201cTownsend is looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Zach laughed, a cold, cruel sound. \u201cWell, eighteen years, folks. Glad he finally got around to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach, he didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d he asked but didn\u2019t turn to face me.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zach. Of course not. Why would I know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Joe say anything to you? Did your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t know, Zach,\u201d I told him. \u201cNo one knew.\u201d</p><p>I thought about how Zach and Townsend had always reminded me of each other. They had the same posture, the same grin, the same earnest, serious nature. And now I knew why. I wished I\u2019d seen it before then, and I also wished we could go back in time to before we knew. But we couldn\u2019t do either.</p><p>\u201cShe never told me!\u201d Townsend\u2019s voice echoed from inside. Abby slammed a door, and the whole house shook.</p><p>\u201cHas Abby killed him yet?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cShe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to me, the moonlight slicing across his face. The wetness in the air grew heavier and water clung to his hair as he said, \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me. With her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know about you, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have known! He\u2019s a spy. An operative. It was his job to know.\u201d</p><p>I eased forward, reached out to touch his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou should go talk to him, Zach. He\u2019s a good guy,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re a good guy.\u201d</p><p>But Zach just shook his head. He looked like the saddest boy in the world when he told me, \u201cI\u2019m never having kids.\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s get one thing straight. I\u2019m eighteen years old as I write this. Kids? Totally not on my radar. In that moment, living through the next week was pretty much my only goal. But I can\u2019t say that Zach\u2019s words didn\u2019t stop me. That a part of my brain\u2014the part that was trained to see fifty steps ahead\u2014had to wonder what it meant. For me. For us.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be a good dad.\u201d</p><p>But Zach just laughed. It was a cruel, mocking sound. \u201cBecause I had such good parental role models?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had Joe.\u201d</p><p>Then Zach turned back to the water and the darkness and the crashing, breaking waves. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d</p><p>I could have said, You have me. I could have taken his hand and told him everything was going to be okay\u2014that there was no way the past would repeat itself. Not with us. But I learned a long time ago not to make those kinds of promises. I knew better than anyone that life can change on a dime. That even the best dads sometimes go away forever.</p><p>So instead I just asked, \u201cWhat are we going to do about Amirah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked, like he hadn\u2019t heard his mother at all.</p><p>\u201cThe princess, Zach. She\u2019s just a little girl. And that little girl is going to die. They\u2019re going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>Zach sank down to sit on a rock. He kept his gaze locked on the sea as he told me, \u201cNo, they aren\u2019t. We\u2019re not going to let them hurt anyone ever again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>\u201cCam.\u201d I felt a kick against my leg. A bright light burned my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d Abby snapped. She stood above me, sunshine from the window spilling across her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowtime.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my tennis shoes on over bare feet and raced after her down the creaky stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked, taking a few steps more. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Abby smiled. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t really appreciate things until they\u2019re gone. I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s also true. I\u2019d always known that someday I would leave the Gallagher Academy. We were just months from graduation when my friends and I decided to flee, after all. But even then I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d miss falling asleep in the common room with my classmates, some chick flick playing on the TV. I didn\u2019t know how much I\u2019d miss my classes and my teachers\u2014even homework would have been a welcome change from my new reality. (And don\u2019t even get me started on our chef\u2019s awesome cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.)</p><p>But most of all, I missed the building and the grounds. Some people say the Gallagher Mansion is a house. Some say it\u2019s a school. But for me, in that moment, all that really mattered was that it was my home. And I was coming back to it. But as excited as I was, that didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t nervous.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201d Bex asked. It wasn\u2019t the first time that I had to wonder if she and I might share a brain. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m pretty sure fugitives from justice aren\u2019t supposed to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stay long, girls,\u201d my aunt told us. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lock that woman in the Sublevels.\u201d Abby choked on the words. She refused to utter Catherine\u2019s name. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to pick up Amirah and get her out of there. After that, we hit the road and lay low until this is over. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d we all said in unison, and I couldn\u2019t resist turning around to eye the car that followed us.</p><p>Abby had insisted we split up\u2014boys in Townsend\u2019s car, girls in the van. Maybe she had wanted to give Townsend a chance to bond with Zach. Or maybe she just couldn\u2019t stand the idea of being in the same vehicle as Catherine. (Even if Catherine was locked in the trunk.)</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d Macey said carefully, \u201cwhere will Amirah go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeplace safe, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can\u2019t she stay here?\u201d Liz asked. \u201cThe school is one of the most secure buildings in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we know your mom and Joe have taken out the last member of the Inner Circle. Even then, she\u2019s still the queen of Caspia. She will need protection for the rest of her life. So the best thing for now is to take her someplace where no one will find her.\u201d</p><p>Of course my aunt was right. It was what we had to do. But I thought back to the girl I\u2019d met the first night of the semester. She seemed so young and happy in our halls. I hated that we had to take her away from her school and from her friends. I hated that she was having to grow up so quickly. Largely, I guess, because I totally knew the feeling.</p><p>\u201cPatricia!\u201d Aunt Abby yelled, throwing open the front doors. \u201cDr. Fibs! Madame Dabney, we\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a terribly covert entrance, but I wasn\u2019t complaining when I saw Madame Dabney appear at the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAbby, it\u2019s so good to see you, darling!\u201d She rushed toward us, pulled my aunt into a hug, then turned her gaze past Abby, to my roommates and me. Maybe it was the sun playing tricks on me, but I could have sworn I saw a tear roll down her cheeks. \u201cWelcome home, girls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I turned to the Grand Hall, I saw Professor Buckingham standing in the doorway, frozen.

She bristled and stood up straighter. I could have sworn she actually grimaced as Townsend and Zach dragged Catherine through the front doors. But she didn\u2019t flinch at the sight of the woman, even when Catherine smiled in Buckingham\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hello, Patricia.\u201d Catherine\u2019s gaze moved easily around the foyer and up the stairs. She wore shackles on her hands and feet and yet she examined the mansion as if she had more right to be there than Gilly herself.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so good to be home,\u201d Catherine said, and I had a terrible feeling that Catherine hadn\u2019t lost\u2014we hadn\u2019t captured her. That she was somehow exactly where she had always wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zach snapped, and jerked on his mother\u2019s chains.</p><p>\u201cZachary,\u201d Buckingham warned. \u201cTake her to Sublevel Two.\u201d Then Buckingham turned her gaze to Catherine. \u201cWe have a room all ready for you.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Catherine was gone, I expected the mood to lighten, the tension to ease. But it wasn\u2019t just Catherine\u2019s presence that had everyone on edge. It went far deeper than the awkward silence that coursed between Zach and Townsend. Something was wrong, and I felt it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, inching forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it my mom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour mother is fine, Cameron,\u201d Buckingham told me. \u201cIn fact, she and Joseph are very close to tracking down the Maxwell heir, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d</p><p>But something was wrong, and I wasn\u2019t going to stop until they told me.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s going on? Is it Amirah? Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question, Cameron,\u201d Buckingham admitted. \u201cTo be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t waver or try to skew the facts in her favor. The truth matters\u2014every spy knows that much. And we needed the whole truth right then.</p><p>\u201cLast night after we spoke, we sat Amirah down and told her everything you\u2019d said about her father and the Circle.\u201d She looked at Abby then shook her head as if trying to cast aside her own doubts. \u201cMaybe we should have waited. Her father just died. She\u2019s had so much change and pressure and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it seems we cannot find her.\u201d Buckingham stood a little straighter. \u201cIt seems that Amirah has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>I know this much is true: Bex was right. It is a whole lot easier being the runner than the one left behind.</p><p>There were searches of the grounds and of the mansion. My friends and I spread out and covered every secret passageway a seventh grader could have conceivably found in one year. We interviewed her friends and reviewed the security footage. And when that all failed, we walked through the halls and across the grounds calling out her name. But Amirah never answered.</p><p>Finally, I found myself sitting on my bed. In our room. It was almost like we\u2019d never left, and yet, at the same time, it was like we\u2019d been gone for years. Books sat exactly where we\u2019d left them among unfinished papers and study guides for untaken tests. It felt like I\u2019d entered some kind of archeological dig site\u2014the dorm rooms of Pompeii, a fleeting glimpse of our lives before the fire.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe CIA may already know we\u2019re back\u2014they could be sending a grab team for Preston and Zach, and maybe even you, right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. But we can\u2019t leave her, Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink, Cammie,\u201d Bex ordered. She grabbed me by the shoulders, made me face her. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liz shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Cam? You don\u2019t have to know where she is. You\u2019re supposed to know how she feels.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. It\u2019s true. My friends are geniuses. And I was kind of foolish not to have seen it until then.</p><p>I turned and looked out the window, at our sweeping grounds and tall fences that more than ever before needed to keep one of us safe. And, beyond that, I saw the black stretch of Highway 10 and the lights of Roseville\u2014the other world that existed just outside our reach.</p><p>\u201cNormal,\u201d I whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s just learned she\u2019s never going to be normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy?\u201d I asked, but she didn\u2019t turn. It was almost like she\u2019d forgotten the name she\u2019d used at school. Her American nickname. Her code name. Her legend.</p><p>The tiny girl with the gleaming black hair just stayed seated in the little gazebo in the Roseville town square. As dusk settled around us, the white lights of the square began to glow. It looked like a movie set. A dream. And I remembered why, once upon a time, I had come there, looking for another life. It was why, when my friends and I had divvied up all the potential places where Amirah might have run, I chose that familiar square. It was as good a place as any to play pretend.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Amirah told me when I joined her on the bench.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI guess I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Her legs were so short she could swing them where she sat and they didn\u2019t scrape the ground. \u201cWe missed you. Tina Walters had a pool going on how long you\u2019d be gone. I bet ten dollars that you\u2019d show up at graduation in a helicopter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could stay away a little longer if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Amirah shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back now.\u201d</p><p>Prior to that moment I\u2019d had one conversation with her. Just one. That was all. But it\u2019s true what they say about our sisterhood. It bonds us, forges us together. And with one look in that girl\u2019s eyes I knew that we were more bonded than most.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your father, Amirah. I tried...\u201d I started, but my voice broke. I couldn\u2019t tell her that I\u2019d been there. That I\u2019d failed. I didn\u2019t think I could stand the idea of her hating me as much as I hated myself. \u201cI believe he was a great man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d She held her head a little higher. She didn\u2019t face me as she wiped her eyes. \u201cHe had a duty. A legacy.\u201d</p><p>She almost grimaced with the word, and I knew that, like me, Amirah had been born into a most unusual family business.</p><p>\u201cHis father was hanged in the streets that surrounded our palace. My father was blown up outside the United Nations. But me...I was born in America. Am I an American, Cammie?\u201d She faced me then. \u201cCan I just be an American? Why do these people want to kill me for the sake of a country I\u2019ve never even seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese people...\u201d I stopped and considered my words. \u201cThese people don\u2019t care about you or your country. They just want governments to fall and chaos to rule. They think...they think the world is like a self-cleaning oven and they see you as the best way to turn up the heat.\u201d</p><p>Just like I had been the best way to track down a list.</p><p>It was clear to me in that moment that everyone was wrong about Amirah. She wasn\u2019t just a princess. She wasn\u2019t just a Gallagher Girl. She was me, at the beginning. She was a girl who had stumbled into something so much larger than herself that she couldn\u2019t possibly carry the weight alone.</p><p>\u201cWe should get you back to school, Amy. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe. I know.\u201d But she stayed seated, legs swinging in the glow of the Roseville town square twinkle lights. \u201cI\u2019m not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not right now. But you will be soon. My mother and Mr. Solomon...they are tracking down the people who want to hurt you. And they\u2019re getting close, Amy. I think they\u2019re really, really close. And when they\u2019re finished...then everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cammie. When these people are dead there will be others. There will always be people who want to hurt the queen of Caspia,\u201d Amirah said, even though, right then, she didn\u2019t look like a queen. She looked like a twelve-year-old girl who didn\u2019t want to go home and start her homework. And I, for one, totally couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cYou see that pharmacy?\u201d I pointed to the far side of the square, the old-fashioned sign. \u201cAbrams and Son,\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cI used to date the son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d the girl asked, and smiled wide. She might have giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sophomore year. It was a big scandal.\u201d I thought about Josh. He had been a dream once\u2014a perfectly lovely piece of normal. But that dream was over.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, like she already knew how the story was going to end. And she probably did. She was a Gallagher Girl, after all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWe were really different, I guess. And then I met Zach, and a bunch of terrorists started trying to kidnap me, and I got too busy for a boyfriend.\u201d They were all good reasons\u2014any one of them would do. But it wasn\u2019t the whole truth, and I knew it.</p><p>\u201cI guess we just had different destinies. And I got tired of trying to outrun mine.\u201d</p><p>Amirah nodded slowly, but didn\u2019t say a thing.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou\u2019re not safe here.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands. Sparkly pink nail polish chipping away. \u201cI\u2019m not safe anywhere.\u201d</p><p>And right then I wanted to cry. I wanted to hold her and smooth her hair and tell her everything was going to be okay. I wanted to say all the lies that, for months\u2014for years\u2014I had wanted to hear. And more than anything I wanted to believe that they were true. I wanted to tell her that I was okay\u2014that I was proof that things get better and she wouldn\u2019t feel that way forever.</p><p>But before I could say a word she turned her big brown eyes to me and asked, \u201cAre you okay, Cammie?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been chased, tortured, kidnapped, and almost killed, but I\u2019d survived it. And I knew in my gut that if I could survive spy school, I could survive anything.</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>I took Amirah\u2019s hands and pulled her to her feet. She giggled a little, the sound light and free, dancing in the twinkling lights. I looped my arm through hers, and together we started across the square, toward Highway 10 and my third-favorite secret passage.</p><p>I was walking away from Roseville and sneaking back into school for what might have been the last time, and so I stopped. Nostalgia took hold of me and turned me back to the pharmacy and the gazebo and the square.</p><p>And that was when I saw him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cammie.\u201d Dr. Steve raised the gun in his hand, kept it trained in our direction. \u201cI see you found our girl. Now, why don\u2019t you take me to Catherine?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>It\u2019s sad how accustomed a girl can get to having a gun pointed at her. I didn\u2019t tremble. I wasn\u2019t afraid. There were too many other emotions coursing through me as I stood looking at the man who had played with my mind for months and then sent me to a rooftop to die. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt the blood flow out of my face. My hands tingled. My heart pounded. And I thought for just one second that I\u2019d be sick. There was too much emotion inside of me, and I felt the bile in my gut come to a simmer and then a boil, and I wanted to explode.</p><p>\u201cCammie?\u201d Amirah\u2019s voice cut through the haze. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no one, Amy,\u201d I said, pushing her behind me. \u201cJust someone I used to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks familiar,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him,\u201d I warned. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to him. And do not listen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, Cammie,\u201d Dr. Steve said with a chuckle. \u201cIs that any way to talk to an old friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have enough friends, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhere\u2019s Catherine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school. She\u2019s being held in one of the Sublevels.\u201d</p> <p>He knew to stay back a little, far enough away that I couldn\u2019t kick or punch or wrestle the gun from his hands.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better start walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet Amirah go, Dr. Steve. You don\u2019t need her,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThey need her, Cammie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were on the same side now,\u201d I tried to tell him. \u201cCatherine said you just wanted to stop the Circle leaders and their war. To do that, we have to keep Amirah safe. We have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything, Cammie!\u201d He was shouting. It was like the rage and stress were too much for him, and he wanted it to end as much as I did. But then he stopped. There was a new light in his eyes\u2014a realization that he had the power to change everything.</p> <p>\u201cThe Inner Circle needs you to die,\u201d he said. His gaze fell on the girl behind me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to get her back to school, Dr. Steve,\u201d I tried to tell him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to assassinate you,\u201d he said to Amirah, but she didn\u2019t wince or speak. She just put her hand at the small of my back as I moved to shield her more.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re not going to let that happen, are we, Dr. Steve?\u201d I took a slow step forward, closing the space between us.</p><p>\u201cNo. They can\u2019t kill her if she\u2019s already dead.\u201d</p><p>He raised the gun higher, aiming it over my shoulder, and I knew there were no words\u2014no logic\u2014that could change what he was thinking. So I stopped thinking. I stopped waiting. I stopped planning and fearing and hating the man with the gun. I stopped being afraid for me, and I started caring only about my sister.</p><p>Without a word, I lunged in Dr. Steve\u2019s direction, faster than I ever knew I could move. It must have scared him because he fired. Once. Twice.</p><p>Blinding pain coursed through me, but I didn\u2019t stop. I just kept running toward him, catching his gun hand in my arms and spinning.</p> <p>Was it starting to rain or was I sweating? I didn\u2019t know. All I was sure of was that a pair of headlights had appeared in the dark. The car was racing toward us.</p><p>Dr. Steve fired again, and I kicked, knocking him to his knees. The gun clattered to the ground and I spun, sending him into the street, right into the path of the speeding car.</p><p>I heard the crash.</p><p>I saw the blood.</p><p>And then there was nothing but the sight of Dr. Steve\u2019s crumpled body and the sound of Agent Edwards saying, \u201cCammie? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I must have looked like, between the blood and the falling rain. My hair matted to my head and clung to my face, water dripping into my eyes as I squinted against the glare of the headlights. The windshield wipers of the car sloshed back and forth like a metronome.</p><p>\u201cCammie, you\u2019ve been shot!\u201d Agent Edwards looked from Amirah to Dr. Steve, lying bloody and broken on the ground. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know,\u201d I told him. Amirah was rushing toward me, terror in her eyes.</p><p>I watched Agent Edwards study her, almost as if she were a painting. \u201cAmirah...it\u2019s you. You\u2019re safe. Thank goodness. Now, come on, you two. We\u2019ve got to get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>He threw open the back door of the car, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t bring myself to go to him. Instead, I stooped to pick up Dr. Steve\u2019s gun. It was heavy and cold in my hands.</p><p>\u201cCammie, you\u2019re bleeding. Come on. We\u2019ve got to get you girls back to school.\u201d He looked up and down the dark streets like he was worried about who or what might be coming for us next. \u201cCammie, come on.\u201d</p><p>My left arm felt useless at my side, but it didn\u2019t hurt, and I didn\u2019t move to get into the car. I couldn\u2019t. So instead I just asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Agent Edwards?\u201d I shifted a little, putting Amirah at my back.</p><p>\u201cCammie, I\u2019m scared,\u201d she told me, but I kept my sights on the man in front of me.</p><p>\u201cMs. Morgan, come with me. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did I wake up early?\u201d I asked him. He looked at me as if I were as crazy as advertised. The girl who had been brainwashed, kidnapped. Broken. \u201cIn Alaska, I was supposed to sleep longer. And yet you came out early to check on me anyway. Was it an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Cammie? You\u2019re in shock. We don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want me to wake up early? Did you want me in that room when Ambassador Winters died?\u201d He was frozen as I spoke. \u201cDid you want me to die too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s been bothering me all these weeks. Why did the CIA want Zach? Want me? We\u2019re just kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d\u2014he laughed\u2014\u201cI think we both know you\u2019re more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe CIA had no reason to chase Zach and me...and Liz. But the Circle did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie, you and Amirah need to come with me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go with him, Amirah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said. Her voice didn\u2019t tremble or break. She wasn\u2019t just a queen; she was a Gallagher Girl, as she told me, \u201cI have your back.\u201d</p><p>I raised Dr. Steve\u2019s gun, took aim at the center of Agent Edwards\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that, Cammie,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, my voice even. \u201cI think I do.\u201d</p><p>But the man in my sights just smiled and laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDeep down...I think always. But for sure since the night of the career fair. You shouldn\u2019t have come for Zach and me. That was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed then. \u201cThat was perfect.\u201d</p><p>I was just starting to ponder what he\u2019d said\u2014what it meant\u2014when I heard a sniper\u2019s shots ring out.</p><p>\u201cDown!\u201d I yelled, pushing Amirah behind the car just as the windshield shattered.</p><p>Dr. Steve was right. The Inner Circle wanted Amirah to die, but she needed to die on their terms, and the more public her death the better. Something tragic. Something visible. So I was certain of one thing: Their sniper wasn\u2019t shooting at her. He was shooting at me.</p><p>I turned and, with my good arm, fired in the direction where the sniper must have been.</p><p>With my back turned, Agent Edwards didn\u2019t hesitate. He ran for Amirah, who ducked beneath his grasp and swept at his legs just like we all learned to do during Intro to Protection and Enforcement, but no seventh grader can take down a fully-trained operative, and when Amirah appeared again, Agent Edwards\u2019s arm was around her throat.</p><p>\u201cDrop it, Cammie,\u201d he yelled, backing away, dragging Amirah with him. His gun was pressed against her temple. She trembled but didn\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI\u2019ll shoot her here. I will. I don\u2019t want to\u2014there are so many more interesting ways for her to die. But she\u2019ll be dead either way, so it\u2019s your call. Now drop it.\u201d</p><p>Slowly I let Dr. Steve\u2019s gun fall to the ground.</p><p>The pain in my left arm was growing sharper and the rain fell harder. I knew that if Amirah and I didn\u2019t make it back to school soon, my friends would come looking for me. But I also knew that they would be too late.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to die here, Cammie,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do,\u201d I said, and realized that I meant it. I would die to save Amirah. I would die to stop World War III.</p><p>\u201cCammie?\u201d Amirah\u2019s voice broke, but she smiled. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I said, and then Amirah grabbed Agent Edwards\u2019s arm. And bit.</p><p>I killed a man once. I wasn\u2019t sure how the rifle got into my hands. I hadn\u2019t remembered firing. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing\u2014how. Why.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t like that.</p><p>That night I was aware of everything. Every drop of rain. Every swipe of the wiper blades.</p><p>I knew exactly how long it took for me to fall to the ground and exactly where I\u2019d find the gun. I remember the feel of the metal against my fingers. I was aware of my breath going in and out. And when Agent Edwards fired at me I was aware of that too.</p><p>Pain seared through me again\u2014a hot, burning stab in my gut\u2014and yet my body found a strength I didn\u2019t know it had, correcting as I fell. When I took aim at the very place Amirah had been just seconds before and pulled the trigger, I knew the risk. I knew the cost. And I would do it all over again in a heartbeat if I had to.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Amirah\u2019s screams pierced the air, but she crawled away from the man who was falling to the ground. His blood was on her shirt, but she didn\u2019t seem to be in any pain. Her pain, I knew, would come later. For the moment at least, adrenaline and fear would keep her going, keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d I heard my name ring out in the distance, but I was hearing things, I was certain.</p><p>Blood trailed into my eyes. Pain filled my body.</p><p>\u201cAmirah,\u201d I said, grasping for her. \u201cYou have to get in the car. You have to drive it to the school. Go fast. Go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d I heard the voice again and that\u2019s when I grew certain I was dreaming, drifting slowly away.</p><p>\u201cJust do me a favor,\u201d I said, the words barely louder than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever go anyplace without backup, okay?\u201d I said, then laughed, but the pain was too much, and I crumbled over on the pavement. \u201cIt\u2019s a rookie mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCammie, I can get you into the car,\u201d Amirah told me, but I just shook my head.</p><p>Someone had to stay with Dr. Steve. Someone had to watch Agent Edwards\u2019s body. There were a half dozen reasons I could have given for not getting into that car, but the truth was the one thing I didn\u2019t want to say: I didn\u2019t want Amirah to watch me die.</p><p>My eyes were too heavy then. The ground was so soft; I just wanted to lie there and sleep.</p><p>\u201cGo, Amirah. Go and don\u2019t look back.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Raindrops clung to her eyelashes, and when she blinked, I couldn\u2019t tell if she was crying.</p><p>\u201cCammie!\u201d I heard my mother\u2019s voice again. I hadn\u2019t heard it in so long that it sounded like a ghost, calling to me, coming to take me to my father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCammie,\u201d she said again and then she was there, holding me, pressing against my wounds. \u201cWhere are you hit, sweetheart? Where are you hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d I cried. \u201cYou came for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My mother shook her head. I followed her gaze to the man on the ground. \u201cWe came for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he...\u201d I started, not quite able to bring myself to finish. Something was boiling up inside of me. It took a moment for me to realize that something was hope.</p> <p>Mom smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s the final Circle leader, Cammie.\u201d My mother\u2019s breath came in ragged bursts, almost like she couldn\u2019t believe what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cFinal?\u201d I asked. My voice broke.</p><p>\u201cMaxwell Edwards was the great-great-great-great grandson of Gideon Maxwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought there were no Maxwell heirs,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe was illegitimate. That made him harder to track down. But we did it. We found him. He is the last one,\u201d Mom said. And I looked at the man on the pavement. He was supposed to look bigger somehow, more like a monster. But he was only a man. That\u2019s all any of them were\u2014men and women. People whose anger affected their minds and poisoned everything they touched.</p> <p>Mr. Solomon appeared. There was a gash at his temple and he carried a sniper rifle. Suddenly, I understood why Agent Edwards\u2019s backup had only gotten off one shot.</p><p>I watched my teacher kneel by the body and feel for a pulse.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d Mr. Solomon stood and reached for my mother. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, she\u2019s hit,\u201d Mom said, and I coughed again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Ms. Morgan,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>And I nodded my head, unwilling or just unable to disobey a direct order.</p> <p>\u201cUp,\u201d I said and forced myself upright.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, the ambulance will be here soon,\u201d Mom told me.</p><p>\u201cDr. Steve,\u201d I said and tried to stand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead too.\u201d Mom pressed her scarf against my side, tried to stop the flow of blood. \u201cSweetheart, they\u2019re dead. They\u2019re gone. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>And then I fell to the ground.</p><p>And cried.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>Number of hours I was in surgery: 5</p> <p>Number of hours I was unconscious: 9</p><p>Number of times I dreamed about the night before: 7</p><p>Number of times that, in that dream, I did things differently: 0</p><p>I woke to the sight of a dark figure standing at the window, watching.</p><p>\u201cZach?\u201d I said and tried to move, but my left arm was too heavily bandaged.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Preston leaned into the light. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>He looked like the dorky boy who\u2019d been standing in his father\u2019s shadow, on the verge of becoming the country\u2019s first son. He looked like the terrified kid who had jumped off a roof and had never heard the words Circle of Cavan.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked me. \u201cDo you need the doctor or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m okay. Just...sit. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I watched him pull a chair closer to my bed, lean into the light of the blinking machines and hanging IV bags. He moved like someone who was afraid that I might break.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Preston?\u201d I asked. It was a question I\u2019d been wondering for days, but there had never been a good time to ask it.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m great in comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDeal.\u201d Then he took my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you up. I was hoping you\u2019d be awake before I had to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked down at the bed, at my bruises and my bandages. \u201cYeah. I think it\u2019s probably for the best, you know. Your mom has been great. She offered to try to get me enrolled or whatever\u2014finish out the school year here with all of you, but...\u201d He trailed off. It seemed to take forever for him to look at me again, and when he did it was like I was seeing him for the very first time.</p><p>\u201cThank you for getting me out of that place, Cammie. Have I thanked you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that,\u201d I told him, but Preston just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I really do. I might have died in there. It could have killed me,\u201d he said, and I knew he wasn\u2019t talking about his body. That place was a prison, but it was designed to kill your soul. \u201cAnyway, now I think I have to leave.\u201d He stood slowly.</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled down and squeezed my hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to go be with my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston, wait!\u201d I tried to sit up, to reach for him, but the movement was too much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in pain,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me get the doctor to give you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a button for the morphine, but I don\u2019t like it. It knocks me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s okay to admit a little weakness now and then, Cammie. It won\u2019t kill you. In fact, I hear it makes you stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d Mom cried and held her arms out wide. She acted like she was going to hug me, then thought better of it at the last minute. \u201cHow are you, kiddo?\u201d she asked instead. Her hair was longer and, if possible, shinier. She had more color in her cheeks, like she\u2019d been on a beach or a ski slope\u2014maybe both. I\u2019m not going to say she was glowing, except...well...she was totally glowing. She looked alive and at peace and...happy. My mother looked happy.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized until then the degree of sadness that had always loomed around her before. A subtle, constant hum that coursed through everything she said and did. But it was finally gone.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She pushed my hair away from my face, and her voice was like a cool cloth on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cFine. I think.\u201d</p><p>I tried to sit up, but my mother pushed me back down.</p><p>\u201cEasy, now. You had a close one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d my mother told me.</p><p>\u201cAmirah?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Mom smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine too. She left this morning. We have a team of Gallagher Girls on her. She will be held in a secret location for the time being, but then... She\u2019ll be fine, Cammie. We\u2019ll keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>And only then did I really let myself believe it.</p><p>I watched my mom straighten. It was almost like flipping a switch as she transitioned from mother to headmistress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you dodged a bullet, but you didn\u2019t,\u201d she told me. \u201cStill...you were lucky.\u201d She smoothed my hair again. \u201cDr. Steve shot you in the arm. The doctors expect you to regain full use of it with a little physical therapy. You get to wear that sling for a while, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other bullet...\u201d I tried.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been bad, Cam. It could have been really bad, but somehow Agent Edwards managed to miss all the major organs. You were lucky,\u201d she said again.</p><p>I shifted on the bed. Pain shot through me, and I winced. Lucky wasn\u2019t the word I would have used, but my mother was right. She usually is.</p><p>I heard her talking about security protocols and the chances of attack. Part of me listened to every word as she talked about what Zach\u2019s mom had said, the threat the little girl who called herself Amy was probably under at that very moment.</p><p>But another part of me\u2014the girl part, not the spy part\u2014just kept looking at the simple diamond ring on my mother\u2019s left ring finger.</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d I heard my voice crack.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ms. Morgan.\u201d</p><p>I turned and saw Mr. Solomon walking into the room. He looked like the most handsome man alive as he put his arm around my mother\u2019s waist and kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWell, kiddo.\u201d Mom blushed as she looked up at Mr. Solomon. \u201cThere\u2019s something we need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>I looked from my mother to my CoveOps teacher\u2014my father\u2019s best friend. Once upon a time, he had sworn to take care of me and my mom should anything ever happen to my dad. And he\u2019d done that. Joe Solomon loved me, I was sure of it. But he was in love with my mother. And part of me knew that he always had been.</p><p>\u201cMs. Morgan,\u201d Mr. Solomon started cautiously, \u201cif you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I blurted. Tears ran down my face. \u201cYes, I give you my blessing to marry my mother.\u201d</p><p>Things were supposed to return to normal after that, but they didn\u2019t.</p><p>Maybe it was because, once again, I was lying in a hospital bed. Maybe it was because we\u2019d seen how fragile peace was, how delicate a line we walked. Maybe it was because we were seniors, and Liz had stopped worrying about the fate of the world and started worrying about college admissions. (Thus far, she\u2019d been accepted at Harvard, Yale, Brown, Stanford, MIT, and six other schools she hadn\u2019t technically applied to.)</p><p>But my worries looked different than they had before.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I call him? I mean, I can\u2019t exactly call him Mr. Solomon. Or do I? Do I call him Mr. Solomon? Or Joe?\u201d I looked from Bex to Macey, who shrugged in response, and I talked on. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s still my teacher. But he\u2019s also going to be my stepfather. Do stepfathers get called \u2018stepfather\u2019?\u201d</p><p>But then I saw Zach walking down the hall toward my room, and I couldn\u2019t finish. It felt wrong worrying about my new stepfather when his own paternal issues were still so totally up in the air.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Liz moved from the end of my bed and Zach eased closer, carefully, like I was still entirely too fragile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m supposed to be asking you that.\u201d He leaned down and kissed the top of my head. \u201cRemind me to kill you later for going off like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts when I laugh,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019m not joking.\u201d He didn\u2019t smile but he kissed me again, on the lips, and moved to the window, almost like he was standing guard. He looked like Agent Townsend, but I didn\u2019t say so.</p><p>There was a TV in my room, and the newscasters kept talking about how the riots in Caspia were dying down. The film crews that had surrounded the UN were gone. All that remained, it seemed, were two dead traitors in the streets of Roseville and a bullet-riddled teenage girl. No one seemed to know how close we\u2019d come to World War III\u2014how it might have really happened if Catherine had never come in from the cold.</p><p>Catherine.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Zach?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere is your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy dearest is in Sublevel Two for the time being,\u201d Zach said. \u201cThere has been some debate about what to do with her. The CIA wants her, of course, but until all the moles are out of the agency, your mom and Joe don\u2019t want to let her out of their sight.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t blame them.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Bex?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Bex wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you go to Oxford, then maybe I\u2019ll consider going there too. What are you going to do after graduation?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMI6,\u201d Bex said with a confident nod. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait anymore. I want to get to work.\u201d</p><p>Liz looked at Macey.</p><p>\u201cSecret Service,\u201d Macey said. She fingered the samples of fabric she was holding, looking down at them as if she couldn\u2019t face us while admitting her deepest, darkest secret. \u201cI\u2019m going to join the Secret Service. The president has a teenage daughter. And I can\u2019t help thinking that maybe I can do for her what Abby did for me.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Liz looked at me, but I didn\u2019t have an answer to her question.</p> <p>On the TV, a reporter was outside the Capitol building, talking about the days we\u2019d just lived through. Iranian forces were moving away from the Caspian border. The unrest was almost over, and the Iranian ports would soon be reopened for business. The world at large knew that we had come close to tragedy, but would they ever know exactly how close? And wasn\u2019t that our job\u2014to make sure they didn\u2019t have to?</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean it\u2019s over?\u201d I asked, the words only for myself, but the smartest girls in the world were beside me, and in unison they turned to look at the screen.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Liz said. She didn\u2019t sound hopeful, though. We\u2019d all seen how tenuous the peace was. We knew too well how easily it could all be broken\u2014how quickly it could all happen again. There would always be people who wanted war and power and dominance. They would always be there but, luckily, so would we.</p><p>\u201cPeriwinkle or persimmon?\u201d Macey asked. She held two scraps of fabric out for me to examine, but I was heavily drugged and more than a little skeptical.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cBridesmaid dresses. Your mom said I could plan the wedding. She doesn\u2019t care, and between you and me I\u2019m so relieved. It was going to be really hard to manipulate her into letting me make all the decisions anyway. So, periwinkle or persimmon?\u201d</p><p>I pointed to one, and to tell you the truth I didn\u2019t care which one it was. That\u2019s the thing about getting shot twice, almost kidnapped twice, really kidnapped once, and banged on the head more times than anyone can imagine: It tends to put your priorities in order. And I didn\u2019t care what color my dress was as long as the members of the wedding were happy and healthy and...there.</p><p>As long as everyone I loved was there.</p><p>\u201cSpring in the gardens,\u201d Macey said. Outside the windows, I could see the first sprinkles of green starting to cover the trees. The sun was shining and the sounds of laughing, running girls filled the halls. \u201cAfter graduation.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as if that were our most important mission yet\u2014maybe our final mission on those grounds, all of us together. In periwinkle gowns.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p> <p>\u201cHello, Cammie,\u201d Catherine said as she stood in the shadows.</p><p>Sublevel Two was empty. I\u2019d walked without a sound down the spiraling stone walkway to the room that had become a cell. The door was gone, replaced with a massive clear barrier that was no doubt blast-proof and bulletproof, and the only way in or out of the room that had been Zach\u2019s mother\u2019s home for the rest of the semester. But the semester was ending. Graduation was coming.</p><p>It was time to say our good-byes.</p><p>\u201cThis is such a nice surprise,\u201d she told me. A harsh light burned overhead, casting her face in eerie shadow as she sat on the small mattress that lay on the floor. \u201cBut, of course, I knew you\u2019d come eventually. I knew you had to come.\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to speak\u2014to say something. I wanted to ask her where I had messed up the previous summer\u2014exactly how and when and why I\u2019d gotten caught. I might have begged her to tell me if betraying our sisterhood was worth it. I might have yelled and cursed and cried for all she\u2019d done to me. To Zach. To us. I might have done any of those things, but I couldn\u2019t speak. So I stood, wordless, watching her, almost like looking at a dream.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like my room?\u201d</p><p>She gestured to the stone walls and floor. There were big pads of paper and crayons, two blankets and a pillow without a case, but no chair and no window, just a bare lightbulb that swung overhead.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad for me, Cammie,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m home, after all.\u201d She stretched out on the narrow mattress, looked up at the ceiling. \u201cI always knew I\u2019d come home.\u201d</p> <p>I hated that fact, and she must have seen it in my eyes, because she straightened.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Cammie? Did you forget that we are sisters?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak. Words formed inside my mind, but I couldn\u2019t will my mouth to say them.</p><p>\u201cHow is Zachary? He hasn\u2019t come to see me. Will you ask him to come? I would consider it a personal favor.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not doing you any favors.</p><p>\u201cYour mother comes and sees me every day. She has lots of questions.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she looked like an insane person. Like she had a child\u2019s mind inside that fully grown body. I wondered if it was an act, but then I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cLook, Cammie.\u201d She picked up one of the pieces of paper. \u201cIt\u2019s the mansion, see? It\u2019s our home.\u201d She unrolled the paper and held it toward the glass to reveal a drawing of the mansion made with crayons. \u201cI made it for you.\u201d She rolled the paper up again and slid it through the narrow opening in the glass. I took it, but I didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t our home look like a castle in my picture?\u201d she asked me. \u201cI always thought it looked like a castle.\u201d</p><p>And then she started to sing.</p><p>\u201cAbove the plains up on the hill there stood a castle bold</p><p>A gleaming palace made of white, a pillar to behold</p><p>The horsemen lived in service to the castle and the crown</p><p>But the knights rose up and killed the kings</p><p>And it all burned down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat song.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d said the words aloud until Catherine\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize it, Cammie?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid I sing it to you last summer in Austria?\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I didn\u2019t remember. Maybe she had. But that wasn\u2019t why I knew it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Catherine said, realization dawning. She pressed her fingers against the glass. \u201cI sang it to Zachary. Tell me, dear, does he sing it to you now?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I just inched farther from the glass as if she might reach out, touch me with a spark.</p><p>\u201cThey are going to take me away tonight. Did you know that, Cammie? Did you know I\u2019m leaving?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell her that I did know. I didn\u2019t say that that was why I had come\u2014that I needed to close this final chapter. I wanted to see her there\u2014frail and fleeting and locked inside those walls and the unhinged balance of her mind. I needed to see the woman from the roof in Boston, from the streets in D.C., from the nightmares of Austria that still invaded my mind. I needed to see her caged like an animal and know that it was over.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t dare admit that she still had any power over me. I didn\u2019t give her that one little bit of satisfaction.</p><p>She looked up at the walls and the ceiling\u2014the stone that surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cThey promised me that this would always be my home. That girls like you would always be my sisters. But they weren\u2019t my sisters, were they?\u201d Catherine asked, but then the lunacy broke, a quick and fleeting crack, and through it I saw anger and bitterness and rage.</p><p>I saw the girl who had come to the Gallagher Academy looking for a home and found only a thing to hate. I saw the Catherine who had found, in the Circle, an outlet for her anger. I saw the woman who had tortured me once and who would gladly do it again.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come to us, Catherine?\u201d I asked her, finally. \u201cYou knew you would end up here\u2014like this. Why did you do it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but I guess it was her turn not to answer, to withhold a small sense of power. Instead, she just sat cross-legged on the cold stone floor and began to sing.</p><p>\u201cBut the knights rose up and killed the kings</p><p>And it all burned down.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>That night I woke up to the sounds of sirens.</p><p>\u201cCode Black. Code Black. Code Black.\u201d</p><p>Our graduation gowns hung on hangers from the bathroom door. A few of our things were already in boxes with labels like LIZ\u2019S ROOM and MACEY STORAGE, but for the most part our suite looked exactly like it always did, books and clothes strewn everywhere, like the home of normal teenage girls.</p><p>Except we weren\u2019t normal.</p><p>That was obvious as soon as the sirens broke through the air. Macey was already out of bed and pulling on her shoes. Bex was at the window, staring out across the grounds, but then in the blink of an eye, the view disappeared. Titanium shutters descended, covering the windows and blocking off all chance of us getting out. Or of someone else getting in.</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d Bex shouted. \u201cGet up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Liz asked, voice groggy.</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d I said, my blood going cold. \u201cTonight they\u2019re moving Catherine.\u201d</p><p>The halls were full as we made our way downstairs. The sirens boomed and the lights swirled, and I felt almost dizzy from the noise and the pressure. Protective cases covered all the archives, and I could hear the sounds of yelling, cries booming out through the chaos.</p><p>\u201cDownstairs and into the Grand Hall please, ladies!\u201d Mr. Smith yelled from the landing. \u201cDown the stairs! Yes, please. Slowly, now. No need to rush. No need to panic. Into the Grand Hall!\u201d</p><p>Calmly, my roommates and I fell into step with the tide of girls that was sweeping toward the Hall of History. It was organized chaos, with the swirling lights and meandering half-asleep crowds. It felt less like a drill and more like the zombie apocalypse.</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl.\u201d Zach came rushing up behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Bex asked, and we stopped, stepping into the Hall of History and out of the parade of pajama-clad girls that still moved dutifully down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThey were moving my mother when she got away.\u201d He seemed out of breath. \u201cAll the security staff and most of the teachers are out looking for her. They\u2019ve locked down the mansion, but it\u2019s probably too late. She\u2019s probably already escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, right this way!\u201d Tina Walters was shouting from the base of the stairs. \u201cInto the Grand Hall, munchkins. No. We\u2019re not going to open up the waffle bar,\u201d Tina told one over-anxious eighth grader. \u201cInside, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they really think she\u2019s gone, Zach?\u201d Liz asked, but I could see the answer in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI should have known it was too good to be true,\u201d Zach said. \u201cShe never would have turned herself in if she hadn\u2019t had a plan.\u201d</p><p>The words hit me so hard, I actually had to lean against the railing. I\u2019d been thinking the same thing for weeks\u2014ever since the day when Agent Townsend and Zach walked a shackled Catherine back into our school and she had looked around as if she was exactly where she wanted to be. I thought about the woman behind the glass, the empty look in her eyes, and the cold fury in her words. And finally the song that she had sung to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zach was right. She\u2019d always known we were going to bring her back to the Gallagher Academy. But he was wrong about one thing.</p><p>His mother never intended to leave.</p><p>\u201cIt all burned down,\u201d I sang.</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cWhere did you hear that song?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI went to see your mom last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that, Gallagher Girl. You should never have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach, stop! Listen to me. She\u2019s not leaving.\u201d I gripped his T-shirt and made him look into my eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s going to burn the castle to the ground.\u201d</p><p>I waited for someone to tell me I was crazy, but then the floors shook. For a moment, the sirens stopped. An eerie, hollow silence followed and no one moved.</p><p>\u201cWe have to evacuate the mansion,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Cam,\u201d Macey said. \u201cI mean, the school has state-of-the-art fire protection mechanisms, right? Liz, right?\u201d</p><p>But Liz didn\u2019t hurry to agree. She had her fingers against her lips again, calculating.</p><p>\u201cLiz, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing,\u201d she blurted in a way that meant it was totally something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Dr. Fibs and I have been working on a new kind of power source. We want to take the Gallagher Academy completely off-line in five years, and we think that this has tremendous green technology implications if\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiz!\u201d Bex snapped, bringing her back into focus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an energy source,\u201d Liz said again.</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d Macey prompted.</p><p>\u201cThat means it can also be a bomb.\u201d</p><p>Before any of us could process what that meant, smoke began to rise up the stairs, sweeping through the hallways and filling the Hall of History. The sirens came again, switching from Code Black to the shrill haunting sound of the fire alarms.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d someone yelled from down below.</p><p>I watched the doors and windows, waiting for them to open, but the fire alarm must not have been able to override a Code Black, because they stayed barred, trapping us inside.</p><p>Panic was starting to grow. Girls rushed toward the doors. The windows. Yells turned to cries, screams that pierced the air. And the younger girls were pushing, going nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cTina!\u201d I yelled over the railing.</p><p>Down below she was struggling with the doors, trying to get them to open. Eva Alvarez and Courtney Bauer were trying to break the windows.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re locked!\u201d Tina yelled just as the sprinkler system sprang to life. Water erupted from the ceiling, spraying down on us, drenching us, but no one could move to escape it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all locked!\u201d Courtney yelled to me.</p><p>\u201cNot all of them,\u201d I said.</p><p>I ran down the stairs and to the old bookcase I\u2019d first discovered during the spring semester of my eighth grade year. If you pulled out a book called Spymasters of the Ming Dynasty while pushing on the bookcase\u2019s left-hand side, you could make the whole thing spin around, a revolving door into a dusty tunnel that spiraled down into the depths of the school and finally emerged just west of the guard tower on the north side of the grounds.</p><p>\u201cIn here!\u201d I yelled and Tina rushed toward me. \u201cGo down the corridor. Keep going. It will get you out of the mansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMunchkins!\u201d Tina shouted, her voice echoing over the cries of the screaming underclassmen, and, instantly, the foyer went silent. \u201cFollow me!\u201d Tina yelled, and the girls did exactly as they were told.</p><p>I found another passageway and opened it too, sent Courtney and Eva into that tunnel, doubling the flow of girls fleeing the mansion. And as the halls filled with smoke, they cleared of girls until only my friends and Zach and I were left.</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d Macey shouted. She was half in the tunnel already, looking back at me. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>But I looked around the hallways. The smoke was so thick I could barely see, and yet I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of leaving.</p><p>\u201cI have to find my mom! And Abby! And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re outside looking for my mom,\u201d Zach told me, but I couldn\u2019t believe him. I wanted to check her office\u2014to go search her room.</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl, we have to go. Now!\u201d</p><p>In the Hall of History, there was a crash. A piece of the ceiling collapsed on one of the cases. Sparks rained down over the railing of the balcony like sparklers on the Fourth of July.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I said, pushing Liz and Bex toward the opening. \u201cGo,\u201d I told Zach. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>I always used to joke that I could walk down the secret passages of the Gallagher Academy blindfolded. Well, that night I got to prove it. Darkness swallowed us. The smoke was so heavy in places that we had to pull our shirts up and cover our mouths. My eyes burned and watered, and the air was so dry it was like breathing sand.</p><p>Still, the air grew fresher with every step. The lower we got, the farther we moved from the fires. The passageway was leading to freedom\u2014I could feel it. We just had to keep walking, moving, following the path.</p><p>But then I heard the singing.</p><p>I could see Bex and Zach up ahead with Liz and Macey. No one was behind me, I was sure. And I stopped just to listen\u2014just to make sure\u2014when I heard the voice again, louder now.</p><p>\u201cIt all burned down.\u201d</p><p>That passageway didn\u2019t branch, I was certain. There was nothing down there but old timbers and cobwebs. There was nothing, I was sure. Except the voice was there. I heard it.</p><p>\u201cThe knights rose up and killed the kings.\u201d</p><p>I backtracked and followed the sound of the voice until I reached a place where the passage widened. I\u2019d never noticed it before and I might not have seen it then, had it not been for the smoke, the way it spiraled there, as if caught in a draft.</p><p>I turned to the wall, pushing and pressing until...pop. A door swung open, and there she was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Catherine,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Slowly the woman turned. Her hair was greasy and matted. Dirt and grime clung beneath her nails, and yet she smiled at me as if she were a contestant in a pageant.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cammie,\u201d she said.</p><p>She sounded so calm\u2014but then I saw Liz\u2019s device in her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with that?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing with it,\u201d she said. She pointed to the heavy beams that crisscrossed the ceiling. \u201cEvery structural support in the entire mansion can be traced to right here. Did you know that, Cammie?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve never seen this room before.\u201d And I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>As secret rooms go, that one was massive. I was on something of a balcony, looking down on where Catherine stood below. A rickety staircase led toward her, and I studied the space. I think it might have been a cellar once, cold storage for the pre-refrigeration era. More tunnels spiraled out from where she stood, and I knew that one of them must have led to the lake, because there was a wetness in the air. It probably would have been cool there on a normal day, but with the fires raging above us, the dampness felt more like steam.</p><p>\u201cHow disappointing,\u201d Catherine said, and she sounded like she honestly meant it\u2014like I wasn\u2019t quite the formidable opponent she had thought me to be. \u201cThis was always my favorite room.\u201d</p><p>Candles burned all around her. It was almost like a temple. A shrine. I could see her retreating to that place during her time at the Gallagher Academy, Catherine\u2019s favorite place for hiding. But I imagine that, unlike me, she never had friends who tried to find her.</p><p>\u201cI used to spend so many hours down here. I used to love to get lost. But I don\u2019t have to tell you what that feels like, do I, Cammie? I can see why Zachy likes you. You know what they say, boys always fall for girls just like their mothers.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell her that she was crazy\u2014that she was wrong. But Catherine and I had both retreated to those dark and secret places. We had pushed through the cobwebs and the shadows in search of the secrets of the past. Yeah. She was right. We had a lot in common. But I knew the kind of girl I wanted to be when I reached the end of the tunnel. I wanted to climb out into the light.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019re alike, Cammie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head and, in that moment, I meant it. I really did. \u201cI think you\u2019re angry. And hurt. And vengeful.\u201d I tried to take a deep breath but the smoke made me cough. \u201cI think you\u2019re incredibly vengeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am.\u201d She looked up at me with a smirk. \u201cBut I\u2019m the one with the bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never make it out alive. If you set that off now, you\u2019ll die here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t get it, do you? I won\u2019t die today. And I didn\u2019t die the day I left your precious school\u2014your sisterhood. I died the day I came to it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand hate. I\u2019ve seen its power. I\u2019ve known its wrath. I\u2019ve even felt it coursing through my own veins, pushing me on. But I don\u2019t know where it comes from or why it lasts, how it can take hold in some people and grow.</p><p>I heard a cracking sound, like thunder. Sparks rained down, and I jerked back just as a beam crashed overhead, showering me with smoke and flames, and yet I wanted to run through the falling ash. Stop her once and for all.</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl!\u201d Zach grabbed my arm and jerked me around to face him. I hadn\u2019t even heard him come up behind me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Zachy,\u201d Catherine said from below, but Zach didn\u2019t even look at her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go,\u201d he said, starting to drag me away.</p><p>\u201cZach, we can stop her.\u201d I fought against him with all I had while, down below us, Catherine started singing once again.</p><p>\u201cWe can still save the school!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>A hundred and fifty years of history stood around me. It was the place I loved. It was my home. My destiny. That building was in my veins, and without it, I feared that I might die.</p><p>\u201cZach, we have to stop her!\u201d</p><p>But Zach just held me. He looked at me with shock and awe and just a little bit of wonder. In spite of everything, I thought that he might laugh.</p><p>\u201cGallagher Girl,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou are the school.\u201d</p><p>Then he held my head between his hands and kissed me, hard and fast, breaking whatever trance I was in.</p><p>\u201cZachy!\u201d Catherine called from below.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, mother,\u201d he yelled over the railing. \u201cI will never see you again.\u201d</p><p>Then Zach took my hand and together we ran into the passageway. Smoke swelled and I kept running, away from the fire and the woman, fleeing from the ghosts.</p><p>And when the blast came, it was like an earthquake, a tsunami of stone and timber and dust that we were trying to outrun.</p><p>The passageway crumbled behind us. The beams were rimmed with fire\u2014red sparks shooting through the dry and decaying timbers, racing us toward the cool, clear air of the night.</p><p>I still remember seeing the Gallagher Academy for the first time. I\u2019d just never realized I would someday see it for the last time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cZach...\u201d I started, but the word caught. Was it smoke in my lungs\u2014in my eyes? Because I was crying. I couldn\u2019t stop crying.</p><p>I could hear my mother\u2019s voice, yelling, \u201cCammie! Has anyone seen Cammie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! Mom, I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>Tears streaked down her face, mixing with the soot and the ash.</p> <p>\u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid everyone get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My mother hugged me. \u201cCammie, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>And for the first time in two years I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and I absolutely meant it.</p><p>The fire grew. Flames swept upward, smoke spiraling toward the sky, but I just held tightly to my mother and watched the windows shatter, the floors collapse.</p><p>We stood for hours, watching as the fire raged and the sky brightened. I stood in the middle of a crowd of girls with soot-stained faces and bloody knees, living to spy another day.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>\u201cCourtney Elaine Bauer,\u201d Madame Dabney said.</p><p>Applause filled the stands. Someone whistled. And Courtney looked like an angel as she walked across the stage to take her diploma and shake my mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cRebecca Grace Baxter,\u201d Madame Dabney said, and this time Bex climbed onto the stage.</p><p>I glanced at her parents, who sat in the front row of folding chairs. Her dad had a video recorder out, documenting the entire thing. Her mother smiled and clapped and waved, and I remembered that for a truly exceptional school, graduation at the Gallagher Academy is pretty much like graduations everywhere. There are smiling parents and gushing girls, shapeless black gowns and new graduates standing on the verge of a brave new world.</p><p>The only difference is that our worlds are slightly braver than average.</p> <p>One by one we crossed the stage and shook my mother\u2019s hand. Gilly\u2019s sword had been shielded in its protective case and had come through the fire without a scratch, and like all Gallagher graduates before us, we stopped and kissed its blade. We held our diplomas and moved our tassels and when my turn came I was frozen for a moment, looking back over the crowd.</p><p>There were Mr. Solomon and Zach and Agent Townsend, who held tightly to Aunt Abby\u2019s hand. My teachers smiled back at me. The underclassmen looked up at the senior class in awe. And I squinted against the sun, looking across the grounds at the scaffolding that rose in the distance. I saw the mansion growing, stretching up from the ashes. I saw our fresh start.</p><p>\u201cAnd now a few words from our valedictorian, Ms. Elizabeth Sutton.\u201d</p><p>Liz looked especially short as she stood behind the podium. Macey had forced her to wear heels, and she shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as she adjusted the microphone and started to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a Gallagher Girl?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>She looked nervously down at the papers in her hand even though I knew for a fact she had memorized every word.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was eleven I thought I knew the answer to that question. That was when the recruiters came to see me. They showed me brochures and told me they were impressed by my test scores and asked if I was ready to be challenged. And I said yes. Because that was what a Gallagher Girl was to me then, a student at the toughest school in the world.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and talked on.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is a Gallagher Girl?\u201d Liz asked again. \u201cWhen I was thirteen I thought I knew the answer to that question. That was when Dr. Fibs allowed me to start doing my own experiments in the lab. I could go anywhere\u2014make anything. Do anything my mind could dream up. Because I was a Gallagher Girl. And, to me, that meant I was the future.\u201d</p><p>Liz took another deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a Gallagher Girl?\u201d This time, when Liz asked it, her voice cracked. \u201cWhen I was seventeen I stood on a dark street in Washington, D.C., and watched one Gallagher Girl literally jump in front of a bullet to save the life of another. I saw a group of women gather around a girl whom they had never met, telling the world that if any harm was to come to their sister, it had to go through them first.\u201d</p><p>Liz straightened. She no longer had to look down at her paper as she said, \u201cWhat is a Gallagher Girl? I\u2019m eighteen now, and if I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t really know the answer to that question. Maybe she is destined to be our first international graduate and take her rightful place among Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service with MI6.\u201d</p><p>I glanced to my right and, call me crazy, but I could have sworn Rebecca Baxter was crying.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she is someone who chooses to give back, to serve her life protecting others just as someone once protected her.\u201d</p><p>Macey smirked but didn\u2019t cry. I got the feeling that Macey McHenry might never cry again.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Liz asked. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s an undercover journalist.\u201d I glanced at Tina Walters. \u201cAn FBI agent.\u201d Eva Alvarez beamed. \u201cA code breaker.\u201d Kim Lee smiled. \u201cA queen.\u201d I thought of little Amirah and knew somehow that she\u2019d be okay.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s even a college student.\u201d Liz looked right at me. \u201cOr maybe she\u2019s so much more.\u201d</p><p>Then Liz went quiet for a moment. She too looked up at the place where the mansion used to stand.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there was a time when I thought that the Gallagher Academy was made of stone and wood, Grand Halls and high-tech labs. When I thought it was bulletproof, hack-proof, and...yes...fireproof. And I stand before you today happy for the reminder that none of those things are true. Yes, I really am. Because I know now that a Gallagher Girl is not someone who draws her power from that building. I know now with scientific certainty that it is the other way around.\u201d</p><p>A hushed awe descended over the already quiet crowd as she said this. Maybe it was the gravity of her words and what they meant, but for me personally, I like to think it was Gilly looking down, smiling at us all.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a Gallagher Girl?\u201d Liz asked one final time. \u201cShe\u2019s a genius, a scientist, a heroine, a spy. And now we are at the end of our time at school, and the one thing I know for certain is this: A Gallagher Girl is whatever she wants to be.\u201d</p><p>Thunderous, raucous applause filled the student section.</p><p>Liz smiled and wiped her eyes. She leaned close to the microphone.</p><p>\u201cAnd, most of all, she is my sister.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Six Months Later</p><p>Some girls are looking at me as I write this. Well, not me, exactly. I think they want this table. I can\u2019t really blame them. It\u2019s warm here in the sun with the cool breeze washing over these pages. Every now and then I reach down to smooth my plaid skirt, but then I remember that my plaid skirt days are behind me.</p><p>Some guys throw a Frisbee across the quad. A man in a tweed jacket parks an old-fashioned bicycle near the library. And I sit here, alone and unseen.</p><p>A chameleon.</p><p>Turns out, you can take the girl out of the spy school, but you can never take the spy school out of the girl.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d I tell the guys and send the Frisbee back to them, harder than they must have expected.</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks,\u201d one of the guys tells me. \u201cWow. You\u2019re really strong.\u201d</p><p>He has no idea.</p><p>He\u2019s cute, Bex would say. But Bex isn\u2019t beside me. None of my friends are here, so I\u2019m alone when the guy asks, \u201cHave I seen you before?\u201d</p><p>I gather my things and have to smile.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cSee you around?\u201d the guy asks.</p><p>I doubt it.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know my story. He hasn\u2019t seen my scars. To him, I\u2019m just another freshman, another girl. He can\u2019t possibly understand why I blend so easily into the wave of backpacks that fills the sidewalk. He doesn\u2019t know me, and I realize that maybe I don\u2019t know myself. That I have a lifetime to figure that out.</p><p>People say Georgetown University is prettiest in spring, but the autumn air feels sweet to me. It\u2019s the closest thing to freedom that I have ever felt. When the path branches, I can either walk along the main road to and from campus or go down an overgrown path that runs along the river. Most coeds would be afraid to go down the dark, twisting trail alone, but I don\u2019t think twice about it. I walk on, sun streaking through the falling leaves until I pass beneath a stone archway.</p><p>Overhead, cars and pedestrians and cyclists make their way to campus. They don\u2019t think about what\u2019s down below, but I walk on without another thought.</p><p>When I find the derelict-looking door, I punch a code into a cleverly hidden box and turn the knob. Once inside the cold space, I don\u2019t blink as the red line sweeps across my eyes, reading my retinas. I hold my hand to the sensor and wait for another steel door to swing open. Then I step inside and start down the stairs, two at a time.</p><p>\u201cMs. Morgan,\u201d Agent Townsend yells from below. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I tell him. I hold up my report. \u201cAlmost finished,\u201d I say, but he doesn\u2019t care about the paperwork.</p><p>He nods toward the boy who looks like him. \u201cWe have a lead on a rogue asset outside of Kabul. CIA wants the two of you. If you have the time?\u201d Townsend asks, almost condescendingly.</p><p>The boy looks at me and smiles. \u201cWhat do you say, Gallagher Girl. Do you?\u201d</p><p>I take the file from Townsend\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
