Why had she put him in the dark?</p> <p>The sticky dampness that had dripped through the floorboards above, it covered him, the taste of it thick and ripe in the air. The smell made him nauseous, and he knew he couldn\u2019t stay here any longer, even if his mother was disappointed by his disobedience. Stretching his stiff limbs as far as he was able in the confined space, his wings still crumpled, he pushed up on the trapdoor, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>He didn\u2019t cry out, had learned to never ever cry out.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t make a sound, Jason. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>Digging his feet into the earth, he pushed and pushed and pushed until a tiny crack of smudgy light appeared at the edge of the door, the handwoven mat above thin enough not to blot out the sunshine. Whatever was blocking the trapdoor was heavy, but he was able to wedge his fingers under the lip of the door, touch the mat he\u2019d helped his mother weave after they\u2019d collected the leaves from the flax bushes. It felt rough against his knuckles as he pushed his hand through to the wrist, and the trapdoor hurt when it came down on that wrist, but he knew his bones wouldn\u2019t break\u2014his mother had told him he was a strong immortal, that he\u2019d already grown deeper into his power than she had by the time of her hundredth birthday.</p><p>\u201cSo strong, my baby boy. The best of both of us.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know how long it took to wedge his other hand under the lip of the trapdoor, to twist his body around in the hole, the skin rubbing off his wrists, until he was holding the edge and pushing it up. He just knew he didn\u2019t stop until he shoved hard enough to slide off the blockage, the mat sliding away with it. The door came open with a dull thud, as if it had landed on something soft. Chest heaving and arms sore, he had to wait to attempt to climb out, and even then, his hands slipped, slick with the blood from his torn-up wrists.</p><p>Rubbing them on his pants, he gripped the edge again . . . and sunlight from the sky-window hit his hands.</p><p>He froze, remembering the dark and viscous liquid that had dripped onto him while he was trapped in the hole. Crusted and dried and flaky, it had turned into a kind of rust on his skin. Just rust, he tried to think, just rust, but he could no longer fool himself as he had in the dark. It was blood that covered his hands, his hair, his face, stiffened the black of his wings. It was blood that had seeped through the mat and the wooden slats below, to the special hidey-hole his mother had made for him. It was blood that clogged his nostrils with iron as he gasped in ragged breaths.</p><p>It was blood that had spilled like water after the screams went quiet.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what you hear, you mustn\u2019t make a sound. Promise me, Jason. Promise!\u201d</p><p>Trembling, he forced himself to stop looking at the rust that wasn\u2019t rust, and pulled himself out of the hole, closing the trapdoor with careful hands\u2014and averted eyes\u2014so it wouldn\u2019t make a noise. And then he stood staring at the wall. He didn\u2019t want to turn and see what lay on the other side, what he\u2019d pushed off the top of the trapdoor. But the wall was splattered with the rust that wasn\u2019t rust, too. Tiny bits of it had begun to flake off, baked by the hot sun pouring in through the sky-window.</p> <p>Stomach all twisted and his heart a lump, he looked away from the wall and to the floor, but it was streaked with pale brown, his feet having made small prints on the polished wood. The dirt inside the hole hadn\u2019t been wet. Not until after.</p><p>After the screams went quiet.</p><p>He closed his eyes, but he could still smell the rust that wasn\u2019t rust.</p><p>And he knew he had to turn around.</p><p>Had to see.</p><p>1</p><p>Standing on velvet green grass still sparkling with dew, Jason watched Dmitri cup the face of the hunter he had just made his wife, the dawn sunlight kissing her skin, lighting up eyes that saw only the man in front of her.</p><p>The grounds of the archangel Raphael\u2019s home, Jason thought, the Hudson rushing past beyond the cliffs and a mass of fragrant roses in full bloom climbing the walls of the house itself, had seen centuries pass, but a scene such as this, they had never witnessed and perhaps never would again. A scene in which one of the most powerful vampires in the world took a Guild hunter for his bride.</p> <p>That Honor loved Dmitri was in no doubt. It didn\u2019t take a spymaster to read the incandescent joy in her every breath, her skin radiant with it. What startled Jason was the potent emotion he saw in the eyes of a vampire who had been a pitiless blade for all the centuries Jason had known him.</p><p>Cruelty came easily to Dmitri, maybe too easily in recent times. The vampire was near to a thousand years old and jaded with it, blood and death no longer enough to cause him to break his stride, much less shock. Jason had seen Dmitri wield his scimitar on the field of battle to take off invaders\u2019 heads, glory in the spray of their dying blood, and he had seen Dmitri seduce women with sensual elegance and a cold heart simply to amuse himself.</p><p>Yet the man who touched Honor, who claimed her lips in a kiss of possession, had a tenderness about him that was as dangerous as it was gentle. And Jason comprehended that Dmitri would be a brutal weapon against anyone who dared harm his wife, that the darkness in him had not been tempered but merely leashed.</p><p>\u201cHe cannot deal with the Cadre if he is leashed,\u201d he said to the woman who stood next to him, a hunter with wings of midnight and dawn. Feathers of a rich, silken blue flowed from the pure black at the inner curve of her wings, to segue into a softer indigo and the ephemeral shades visible in the skies when day broke, before becoming a brilliant white-gold at the primaries.</p><p>Elena was Raphael\u2019s consort, and Raphael was Jason\u2019s liege. Perhaps that was why he felt an unexpected kind of ease with her. Or it might be that she was a stranger in the land of immortals, searching for a path that would take her into the centuries to come, as he once had. Or perhaps it was that, unbeknownst to Elena, they were linked by a far bleaker tie, a tie that spoke of mothers and blood.</p><p>Iron rich liquid matting his hair, soaking into his tunic, sticky on his arms.</p><p>Elena looked up, shook her head, the startling near-white of her hair pinned back in an elegant twist, her body clothed in a simple ankle-length gown of a blue the shade of a pristine high-mountain lake. Her only ornamentation came in the form of the small amber hoops she always wore as an outward sign of her commitment to Raphael. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Jason?\u201d she said as the bridal couple broke a kiss that had more than one sigh rippling through the crisp morning air. \u201cHe is only this Dmitri for Honor.\u201d She joined in the clapping and cheering when Honor and Dmitri turned to the assembled guests, well-wishers moving forward to congratulate them.</p><p>Having spoken to Dmitri before the ceremony, Jason waited for the crowd to thin. Elena, too, held her place, giving others a chance to speak to the newly wedded couple. As he\u2019d been with Dmitri before the ceremony\u2014alongside Raphael, Illium, and Venom\u2014Elena had been with Honor, the archangel and his consort having turned over a suite in their home to the bride\u2019s party. That party was composed of hunters, all certainly with a weapon or two hidden beneath the sleek, elegant clothes they wore for the wedding.</p><p>Blue flickered at the edges of his vision, and he turned to see Illium spread his wings for a hunter who had made the request. Clad in the same formal black worn by the groom as well as Raphael and the others of the Seven here today, he had a flirtatious smile on his face. The smile was real as far as it went, but then, it did not go far. Jason had seen Illium love until his heart broke, and he had seen the angel mourn until there was no light in those eyes of molten gold.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said to Elena when she glanced back at him, reminded once again of the capacity others had for endless nuances of emotion. Jason had watched mortals and immortals alike for centuries, was able to glean even the most subtle changes in their emotional equilibrium, for no man could be a spymaster without that capability. Yet, through all that time, he had never been able to feel as they did. It was as if life skimmed across the surface of him, leaving his heart and his soul untouched.</p><p>\u201cYou are the perfect spymaster. An intelligent, gifted phantom unaffected by anything he sees.\u201d</p><p>It was Lijuan who had said those words to him, four hundred years ago. The oldest of the archangels had also made him an offer\u2014riches and women trained in the sensual arts, men if that was what he desired\u2014if he would change his allegiance, put himself in her service. Except Jason had already earned and created enough wealth for a hundred immortal lifetimes. As for the other\u2014when Jason wanted a woman, he had a woman. He had no need for anyone to act his procurer.</p><p>Elena\u2019s wing shimmered lightly over his as she stretched a little, and he didn\u2019t shift away to break the fleeting contact. In many ways, he was the opposite of Aodhan, the angel so broken, he couldn\u2019t bear the slightest touch. Jason, by contrast, sometimes only felt real and not the phantom Lijuan had named him if he had the pressure of another\u2019s skin, another\u2019s wing against his own. It was as if all those years, decades, when he hadn\u2019t felt the touch of another sentient being had created a thirst in him that could never be assuaged.</p><p>A sybarite drunk on sensation, that was what he might have become, but for the fact that those years of excruciating, endless aloneness had left him with other scars\u2014scars that led him to embrace the very shadows he\u2019d hated as a child, scars that meant he meted out trust with a careful hand. Regardless of his need, Jason allowed very few people to touch him outside of the bedroom; for the touch of a friend, it was a far different thing than the caress of a lover taken in the dark of night and left behind when morning broke.</p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful wedding, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Elena said, her eyes soft in the way women\u2019s often were at such things.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish for one?\u201d Marriage was thought of as a mortal thing, but as today showed, some immortals continued to embrace it\u2014Dmitri had been most insistent on the ceremony.</p><p>Startled laughter from Elena. \u201cRaphael and I married above the wreckage of New York, when he fell with me in his arms.\u201d</p><p>Raphael, too, Jason thought, was a different man with his consort, this mortal woman become an angel. Such a weak angel in terms of power, her immortality a flickering flame, and yet she had a strength that spoke to the survivor in him. So he\u2019d taught her how to remain unseen in the sky, watched her push her body to merciless extremes in an effort to achieve a vertical takeoff so soon after her becoming, and listened for threats to her life.</p><p>For Elena was Raphael\u2019s biggest weakness.</p><p>A tiny giggle, a mischief-eyed little girl running to Elena on wobbling legs, curls of bronze-threaded black captured at the sides of her head with ribbons of summer orange. Smiling in unhidden delight, Elena bent to pick up the child in her arms. \u201cHello, Zoe, Warrior Goddess in Training.\u201d A kiss on one plump cheek, Zoe\u2019s flower girl dress a confection of lace over Elena\u2019s arm. \u201cDid you give your mom the slip?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason met the child\u2019s direct gaze as she nodded, saw that she held a silver-edged feather of distinctive blue in a careful fist. The daughter of the Guild Director stared at his wings for a moment before whispering something in Elena\u2019s ear. Jason heard what she said, understood none of it, her language that of very small children.</p><p>Clearly not at the same disadvantage, Elena glanced at him, silver-gray eyes shining with laughter. \u201cThe imp\u2019s coveting more of your feathers for her collection, Jason. I\u2019d be careful.\u201d She was distracted a second later by a tall man with long black hair tied neatly at the nape of his neck, his cheekbones sharp against copper-gold skin.</p><p>Ransom Winterwolf.</p><p>Hunter.</p> <p>It was strange to see so many of the Guild on the grounds of Raphael\u2019s home. Located in the Angel Enclave, on the other side of the river from the gleaming glass and metal of Manhattan, it was undoubtedly elegant, but Jason knew the Sire had offered Dmitri far more stunning locations in which to make Honor his bride. However, the leader of the Seven had been adamant.</p><p>\u201cDaybreak,\u201d he\u2019d said a bare three hours before sunrise. \u201cWe marry at daybreak.\u201d</p><p>In those three hours, Elena and the Guild Director had managed to alert every hunter in the New York area who wasn\u2019t on assignment and was within traveling distance, while Jason, Illium, and Venom stood for the rest of the Seven. Naasir, Galen, and Aodhan had been told, had all three spoken with Dmitri before the wedding.</p><p>United in their loyalty to Raphael\u2014and to each other\u2014the Seven had forged bonds that were unbreakable, but even had there been more time, it was impossible for all of them to ever be in one place at one time. To keep the balance of power in the world, Raphael needed to maintain a presence in the Refuge and in New York, and now, in the lost city of Amanat, home to the Ancient who was Raphael\u2019s mother.</p><p>That three of them stood here to witness Dmitri\u2019s wedding, it was an unexpected gift. There were other invited guests of course\u2014the proud staff who ran Raphael\u2019s home; a number of men and women who worked directly under Dmitri at the Tower, and whose loyalty belonged as much to the vampire as it did to Raphael; two mortal policemen who were considered part of the Guild family. The well-respected man who\u2019d officiated the ceremony belonged to that family, too, having headed the Guild before passing on the mantle.</p> <p>Raphael himself had stood at Dmitri\u2019s side during the ceremony, the friendship between the two men old enough, deep enough, that it was the archangel who had played the second this day. Jason didn\u2019t know of any other such friendships among those who served the Cadre of Ten, the archangels who ruled the world, but he knew this one had endured centuries, through anger and war and even a short defection by Dmitri to Neha\u2019s territory. That hadn\u2019t lasted long, and now Dmitri\u2019s lips curved at something Raphael said.</p><p>While the vampire was dressed in a crisp black-on-black suit, his bride wore a gown of deep, vibrant green that caressed and embraced her curves before rippling in a liquid waterfall to the dew-laden grass, the fabric arranged cleverly at her left hip to give the illusion of waves. When her gaze landed on Jason, she smiled and came toward him, halting at the border of the invisible space that separated him from the world, one hand holding the wildflower bouquet Elena had created using the blooms in her greenhouse.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her happiness so luminous, it outshone the diamonds at her throat, diamonds Jason had seen Dmitri buy as rough stones three centuries ago.</p><p>It had taken the vampire another hundred years to get them finely cut and set into a necklace of exquisite beauty, until the stones appeared to be droplets of captured starfire.</p><p>\u201cWho will you gift it to?\u201d Jason had asked at the time.</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s response had been a sardonic twist of his mouth, the hardness in his eyes akin to the gems he held. \u201cA woman whose spirit dazzles brighter than these stones.\u201d</p> <p>The necklace had graced none but the honey-skinned neck it now encircled.</p><p>\u201cFor this amazing dream of a dress,\u201d Honor continued, stroking her hand down the fabric. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found it so early in the morning. It fits like it was made for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks are necessary.\u201d So much of life he spent on the sidelines\u2014many times out of choice, sometimes because he didn\u2019t know how to belong\u2014but he\u2019d needed to be a part of this day when a man he respected, and who was as close a friend as he was capable of having, claimed this woman for his own.</p><p>\u201cJason can find anything,\u201d Dmitri said, walking over to slide his arm around Honor\u2019s waist. \u201cThe winds talk to him, tell him where to go.\u201d</p><p>Honor laughed, husky and warm, and then she was being embraced by Elena, the hunter\u2019s wings iridescent in the white light of morning. Stepping a little to the right, Jason met Dmitri\u2019s gaze. The vampire shrugged, the words unspoken but not unheard.</p><p>No one will ever believe it.</p><p>No, Jason thought, no one would. Even he had thought himself mad when he was a boy on the verge of adulthood. It had taken reading Jessamy\u2019s history books once he arrived at the angelic stronghold that was the Refuge to understand he\u2019d inherited his mother\u2019s \u201cear,\u201d her ability to sense things happening hundreds of miles away, across oceans and beyond mountains. It was how she\u2019d always had stories to tell him about people in the Refuge, though they lived on an isolated atoll surrounded by the shimmering blue of the Pacific.</p><p>\u201cI will write this story down for you, Jason. You must practice your reading.\u201d</p> <p>He had. Over and over, until the parchment disintegrated, he\u2019d read those stories and the others in the books in the house. Then he\u2019d copied the words out on wood, on flax, in the sand, forcing himself to remember that he was a person, that he should know how to read. It had worked . . . for a while.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Dmitri,\u201d he said now, allowing the ghosts of the past to fade into the background. \u201cThis is my gift to you and your bride.\u201d</p><p>As Dmitri glanced down at the small note card Jason passed across, Honor\u2019s second\u2014a long-legged hunter who had unique gifts of her own\u2014came to join Elena and Honor, and the women laughed and began to talk all at once.</p><p>\u201cA safe place,\u201d Jason said when Dmitri looked up from reading the address on the card, the sun glinting off the simple gold band he wore on the ring finger of his left hand. \u201cWhere no one will find you.\u201d</p><p>Understanding whispered across the sensual lines of Dmitri\u2019s face. Moving a small distance away from the women, he said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised at what you know, and yet I am.\u201d He slid the card away. \u201cHow certain are you of the security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is mine, and no one has found it in two hundred years.\u201d Hidden in the dense forests of an otherwise uninhabited mountain, it could only be reached via a very specific route that he now shared with Dmitri, mind to mind. Even aerial entry is impossible unless the angel in question knows how to find a particular small clearing. He gave Dmitri the coordinates. Without that, severe damage to the wings as a result of the thick canopy\u2014and the safeguards hidden within\u2014is a distinct possibility.</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s eyes gleamed. Good. His next words were spoken aloud. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had another home in this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He had houses he used when needed, but home was a concept that had no meaning to him, though Dmitri likely assumed he considered his apartment at New York\u2019s Archangel Tower home. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe there, and you can be private.\u201d Honor\u2019s transformation from human to vampire would take time, and while Jason knew Dmitri would ensure she navigated it in a deep sleep, safe from any suffering, he also knew the other man would not leave her side during the process. \u201cThere is no need to take a guard unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust those words coming from anyone\u2019s mouth but yours,\u201d Dmitri said, his face angled toward Honor. \u201cI don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll use your gift. I have her promise . . . but I will not rush her on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Unvarnished ruthlessness. \u201cBut you see, Jason, it appears I have a fatal weakness when it comes to Honor\u2014even should she change her mind and decide to remain mortal, I can\u2019t force her and still live with myself.\u201d</p><p>Jason said nothing as Dmitri walked back to his wife, who looked up to offer him a smile Jason had seen her share with no other. Her friends moved away to give husband and wife a moment of privacy, but everyone continued to linger on the luxuriant green of the lawn, the birdsong a delicate accompaniment to the murmur of conversation. Champagne was sipped, greetings exchanged, friendships renewed in the glow of the joy that came off Honor and Dmitri.</p><p>Unlike the others, Jason felt exposed out here in the sunlight, the unrelieved black of his wings a target, but he didn\u2019t give in to the compulsion to fly up high above the cloud layer, where no one could see him. A minute later, when the winds began to whisper, he listened.</p><p>A single word. A name.</p><p>Eris.</p><p>The only significant Eris that Jason knew of was husband to Neha, the three-thousand-year-old archangel, the sole member of the Cadre who had chosen to follow the mortal ceremony of binding. Eris was also her consort, but he hadn\u2019t been seen in public for some three hundred years. Many believed him dead; however, Jason knew the male lived, imprisoned in a palace inside Neha\u2019s sprawling fort. Except for when he\u2019d attempted to escape early on in his captivity, he had not been physically harmed.</p><p>Neha loved Eris too much to hurt him.</p><p>It was also why she hated him so violently for his betrayal.</p><p>Eris.</p><p>Sliding into the shadows of the trees that edged Raphael\u2019s property, a welcome respite from the light, Jason took out his cell phone. In earlier centuries, even with his considerable mental abilities, it had taken him days to communicate with his men and women, weeks to gather a single piece of information. Technology made it so much simpler\u2014unlike some angels of old, and though his chosen weapon remained a sword, Jason did not abhor the modern world.</p><p>Now, he saw that he had a number of missed calls that must\u2019ve come in during the ceremony, while his phone had been in silent mode. All were from Samira\u2014she was a servant with clearance to work in Neha\u2019s private quarters and technically his highest-ranking spy in the other archangel\u2019s court, though Jason had his doubts about her continued efficacy. \u201cSamira,\u201d he said when the call was answered. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEris is dead.\u201d A hushed whisper. \u201cMurdered inside his palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he was found an hour ago. Neha has not left the body. Mahiya is by her side.\u201d</p><p>Jason had never spoken to Mahiya, but having done a subtle investigation when Neha first adopted her just over three centuries ago, he knew the princess was of Neha\u2019s bloodline. That relationship was accepted knowledge, but the facts behind it had long been buried. Many in Neha\u2019s own court chose not to remember, not to see the truth\u2014that Mahiya had been born of Nivriti, sister to Neha and dead as long as her child had been alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No terrible secret that . . . except if you knew the name of Mahiya\u2019s father.</p><p>Eris.</p><p>2</p><p>Though Mahiya was the fruit of Eris and Nivriti\u2019s forbidden relationship, she was, to all outward appearances, treated as a beloved princess by her aunt, the title a courtesy to elucidate her status as kin to Neha. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p> <p>Samira\u2019s breathing went very quiet for a minute, and Jason waited without interruptions or demands, knowing she had to be concerned about being overheard. \u201cNeha is half insane,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI\u2019m worried she\u2019ll release her power.\u201d</p><p>Knowing as he did the depth of the archangel\u2019s emotions where her husband was concerned\u2014she\u2019d neither been able to forgive him his infidelity, nor set him free after centuries of confinement\u2014Jason shared Samira\u2019s concern. And Neha was a being of immense power. If she gave voice to her agony, she could lay waste to cities, and it was near certain she would aim her rage toward those she held responsible for another terrible pain\u2014the execution of her daughter, Anoushka.</p><p>Raphael had delivered the final blow that reduced Neha\u2019s daughter to dust.</p><p>\u201cTell me the instant she makes a move.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, he looked out over the grounds to see the bridal party and guests walking inside for the no doubt exquisite breakfast prepared by the proud household staff, under the butler Montgomery\u2019s dignified guidance. Raphael\u2019s wings glittered in the sunlight, the gold filaments striking against the white. Sire.</p> <p>Raphael didn\u2019t pause, his expression giving nothing away. What is it, Jason?</p><p>Eris is dead. Murdered. He knew Raphael had seen Eris court Neha, win her, and Raphael understood the twisted emotions that had tied the two together.</p><p>The archangel\u2019s reply was swift. Meet me in the study.</p><p>Two minutes later, when Jason slipped into the study through the French doors that opened out onto the lawn, he did so with a stealth that meant no one would\u2019ve seen him, though the sun rose higher on the horizon with every breath. That was as it should be\u2014it was his job to be unseen, unheard, a shadow among shadows. After six centuries, his status as Raphael\u2019s spymaster was no secret when it came to the oldest immortals, though that knowledge gained them nothing and had even less impact on Jason\u2019s activities. While people focused on him, his operatives quietly found places in courts and towers across the world.</p><p>Raphael entered the room at that moment, closing the door behind him. \u201cNeha was already on the edge of madness after Anoushka\u2019s execution.\u201d The archangel\u2019s tone was unforgiving in its honesty. \u201cThis may well push her over.\u201d</p><p>Jason had seen other archangels lose fatal control, had walked through devastated cities full of rotting corpses, watched an entire country fall into a dark age in which all hope was extinguished, children\u2019s eyes dull with despair. Even if Neha chose a target outside Raphael\u2019s territory, the world could not suffer such devastation so soon after the destruction of Beijing without breaking\u2014and regardless, the ensuing archangelic war would engulf them all.</p> <p>His phone purred discreetly at that instant. Answering it, he heard Samira say, \u201cShe\u2019s left the body\u2014her eyes are of madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet her to the room where she has her communications suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, she won\u2019t see reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must find a way.\u201d Every one of his operatives was of cutting intelligence, able to think on his or her feet. \u201cThen get out of the fort and Neha\u2019s territory.\u201d</p><p>Samira took a deep breath. \u201cI might be able to do it if I stretch the truth and say the Cadre wishes to speak to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not linger, Samira.\u201d In this mood, Neha would kill her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave as soon as the words are spoken.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, he looked at Raphael. \u201cIf we make the call now, we have a chance of catching her before she can no longer see or hear through the rage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can divert her,\u201d Raphael responded, \u201cbut it could involve your presence in her territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d While the risk to Samira was now too high, Jason was far stronger, knew he garnered a certain respect from Neha.</p><p>Raphael nodded and waited for Jason to retreat out of view before he input the call on the large screen in one corner of the study, for Raphael, too, understood the value of technology. The answer took so long in coming, Jason thought Samira must\u2019ve failed in her task. But the screen cleared at long last to show Neha as he\u2019d never before seen her.</p><p>The Archangel of India was always elegant, always graceful.</p><p>Now, her black hair hung matted and snarled around her face, as if she\u2019d been pulling at it; streaks of blood slashed across her skin and soaked into the marigold yellow of her silk sari. \u201cRaphael,\u201d she said, her voice so calm it was lethal. \u201cYou circle like a vulture even as Eris\u2019s lifeblood stains my hands.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s response was gentle. \u201cI have never been that, Neha.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile that was of the reptile that gave Neha her name as the Queen of Snakes. \u201cNo, perhaps not. So, do you offer your commiseration?\u201d An almost bored statement, her lashes lowered to shield the wild rage that boiled within.</p><p>\u201cI offer my help.\u201d</p><p>Neha raised a single regal eyebrow. \u201cUnless you have been keeping secrets, I think bringing Eris back to life is beyond your capability. Lijuan herself could not achieve that.\u201d</p><p>Jason wondered if Neha had considered consigning her once-husband to the horror of being one of Lijuan\u2019s \u201creborn,\u201d a shambling, mindless monster fed of human flesh, and couldn\u2019t immediately discount the idea. That only added to the urgency of the situation, because if Neha and Lijuan joined forces, the world would drown in blood and death and screaming terror.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said in response to Neha\u2019s taunt. \u201cEris was murdered inside your fort, thus, you cannot trust anyone within. I have someone with the skill to unearth the murderer for you.\u201d</p><p>The pause was longer this time, the insanity in Neha\u2019s eyes replaced in slow degrees by cold, hard reason. \u201cThat black shadow of yours? The rescued pup?\u201d</p><p>Jason felt no insult, though the latter description was inaccurate. No one had rescued him.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s response, too, was unruffled, the flawless blue of his eyes calm as a glacial lake. \u201cJason\u2019s skill is beyond dispute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is also your spymaster.\u201d Raising a bloody hand, she stared at it, her voice altering without warning to a shaken whisper. \u201cEris bled so much\u2014I did not know he had that much in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sorrow for you, Neha. He was your husband and your consort.\u201d It was a solemn statement, one archangel to another.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The madness returned, swirling and clawing. \u201cHe was also father to the child you helped murder,\u201d she hissed, her eyes changing in a way that was too quick for Jason to truly see before they returned to normal, but that put him in mind of her serpents once more.</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t back down under the venomous attack, didn\u2019t remind Neha that Anoushka had signed her death warrant when she harmed a child in the quest for power. \u201cYou wish to do violence, that much is clear,\u201d he said, \u201cbut rather than lashing out indiscriminately, would it not be more satisfying to torture the one responsible?\u201d</p><p>Neha turned away from the camera to pick up what appeared to be a juvenile python, settle it around her neck. Stroking the creature like it was a cat, she seated herself in a chair of a pale wood carved with infinite patience, polished and varnished until it gleamed like a jewel. \u201cYou think me mad,\u201d she said as the snake raised its head, tasted the air with its tongue.</p><p>\u201cI think you are grieving. And I think this was a cowardly act.\u201d</p><p>A lazy blink, fingers pausing on the python\u2019s sleek body. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEris was not powerful. Beautiful in a way men are rarely beautiful but with little personal strength. This was done to hurt and spite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy poor Eris.\u201d Another lingering caress. \u201cYou are right. I cannot trust anyone within the fort until I know the identity of the assassin . . . but if your spymaster is to enter it, he must bind himself to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Raphael said with a gentleness that took the sting out of the refusal, \u201cI cannot allow, not even for you. He is one of my Seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you protect him at the cost of thousands of lives?\u201d Ice-cold and rational and manipulative, she was the Archangel of India in that moment.</p><p>\u201cLoyalty is not so easily discarded a coat.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that made Neha\u2019s lips curve in what seemed a near-genuine smile. \u201cSo attached to your men. Never have I been able to fault your fidelity.\u201d Her smile changed, became inscrutable. \u201cVery well then, it must be Mahiya.\u201d</p><p>This time, it was Raphael who paused.</p><p>Eris\u2019s child with Nivriti, Jason reminded the archangel, for it wasn\u2019t a topic they\u2019d had much cause to discuss. She is now just over three hundred years old.</p><p>\u201cYou think to compare so young an angel to Jason?\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed. Mahiya is a court trinket, nothing more.\u201d The archangel allowed the python to flick out its tongue at her bloody fingers. \u201cBut as I\u2019m sure the pup has informed you, her lineage is of my family. A blood vow to her will suffice.\u201d</p><p>Raphael held Neha\u2019s gaze. \u201cI will speak to him.\u201d</p><p>Neha inclined her head in regal acquiescence before ending the call.</p><p>Turning to Jason, his wings folded neatly to his back, Raphael said, \u201cShe\u2019s stable for the time being, but it\u2019s a temporary reprieve. The more she stews on the murder, the more dangerous she\u2019ll become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to take the blood vow.\u201d It was an ancient custom, one rarely practiced by even the oldest of angelkind\u2014in swearing a blood vow to Mahiya, Jason would become family in a sense and thus bound to protect that family\u2019s interests. The reason the custom had fallen out of favor was that it skated too close to crossing the line into forced intimacy\u2014for in the distant past, the blood vow had been used to seal the most private of relationships.</p><p>However, like all angelic laws and customs, the blood vow was a creation far more subtle than it appeared at first glance. While the ceremonial tie would stop no one with treacherous intentions, in making the invitation, Neha acknowledged the honor of Raphael and his Seven. If Jason then used his entr\u00e9e into her court to seek and exploit any flaws in her defenses, it would be considered a declaration of war. And once the knowledge of his faithlessness spread, Jason would lose every bit of respect he had earned from the most powerful immortals.</p><p>That was no small thing, especially for a spymaster. Much of his information came to him via those immortals. Worse, his people would be in far more danger\u2014though they were the best, it was inevitable that some were unearthed during the course of their duties. Where once they might\u2019ve been forgiven on the strength of the older angels\u2019 respect for Jason, they would now be executed as a sign of those very angels\u2019 displeasure at the breach of the blood vow.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s wings rustled as he resettled them, the only sign of his surprise at Jason\u2019s agreement with the archaic custom. \u201cYou do not need to,\u201d the archangel said. \u201cThe Cadre may be able to control her now that I have time enough to warn the others. And a blood vow places you at risk\u2014should Neha judge that you have broken it, she can ask for an execution.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou know she agreed too readily to your presence in her territory. She wants you in her power, plans to use you in vengeance against me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jason had seen the calculation in Neha\u2019s gaze, knew the Archangel of India understood what Raphael\u2019s Seven meant to him\u2014if Neha could not reach Elena, could not harm Raphael\u2019s heart, she was fully capable of going after the next best thing. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwhile Neha may be driven by the need for retribution, she\u2019s also a creature of pride. For her to break the promise of safe passage implied by the blood vow stains her own honor\u2014and notwithstanding what she says, that honor matters to her.\u201d It was all she had left.</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to stake your life on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jason had watched Neha for centuries, as he watched every member of the Cadre, so he knew that she wasn\u2019t an archangel who used a heavy hand when more subtle methods would suffice. \u201cNeha is more apt to attempt to turn me against you or to entice me to change camps.\u201d</p><p>Raphael met his gaze. \u201cIt will be a dangerous game of patience and power.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA short one.\u201d Jason already had his ideas about Eris\u2019s death. \u201cWe state the vow is to be considered fulfilled the instant I unearth the murderer.\u201d Neha would expect the stipulation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the custom that bars me from continuing with my other duties, so long as I don\u2019t betray Neha for the duration.\u201d</p><p>Eyes inscrutable, Raphael said, \u201cIt remains a bad bargain . . . unless you want to get inside Neha\u2019s court for reasons of your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something happening within,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cSamira was unable to get close to it\u2014I\u2019m near certain Neha knew she was one of mine.\u201d Permitting a certain level of spying, mostly so they could seed false information, was an amusing diversion to some of the archangels.</p><p>\u201cThe vow,\u201d he continued, \u201cwill get me deep inside the fort, and as I wish only to observe, not interfere in this other matter, I do not risk a breach of the vow.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be able to use any of what he discovered, not unless he could verify the same information through another source, but it would at least confirm that he was on the right trail.</p><p>\u201cA fine line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can walk it.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s next words were pragmatic. \u201cShe will not give you free reign. This Mahiya is apt to be your shadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters little.\u201d Jason was skilled at disappearing in the midst of a crowd, at remaining unseen even when he stood right in front of a person. \u201cShe\u2019s comparatively young, and to my knowledge, has never been beyond the borders of Neha\u2019s palaces.\u201d Surely schooled in the art of court intrigues, there was a high chance she was no \u201ctrinket\u201d\u2014but she couldn\u2019t hope to match a man who\u2019d spent a lifetime learning how to become kin to the dark, until the night was his natural home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never tied your hands,\u201d Raphael said, \u201cand I won\u2019t do so now. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAs for Mahiya\u2014I recall you had doubts about the rumors of her paternity since the whispers of Eris\u2019s infidelity were never proven. Nivriti was also apparently executed for another crime months before the newborn child appeared at Neha\u2019s court. Why are you now so certain she is Eris\u2019s get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wears her lineage on her face.\u201d It was Mahiya\u2019s highly distinctive eyes that gave away her parentage to anyone not blinded by fear of an archangel\u2019s wrath. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard enough fragments from my spies over the centuries to confirm the evidence of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s nod was thoughtful. \u201cNeha has a reputation for not harming children, mortal or immortal, so I can see her adopting the child even in this circumstance.\u201d Glancing up, he said, \u201cI leave the choice to you, Jason. And who knows? Perhaps this Mahiya will prove to be your downfall\u2014they say the intimacy of a blood vow is powerful indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Jason said nothing, but they both knew it to be an impossible thing. Jason had never loved anyone after he dug a grave under a tropical sun, no longer understood the emotion; the boy he\u2019d once been was a faraway mirage in his mind. The closest he came was in his loyalty to Raphael, but he knew from watching Dmitri with his wife, Raphael with Elena, Galen with Jessamy, and long ago, Illium with his mortal, that it was not the same thing at all. \u201cI\u2019ll leave within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d Raphael said in a quiet tone that cut through the air like a blade, \u201cshe is not only the Queen of Snakes, but the Queen of Poisons.\u201d</p><p>And Jason was about to walk into her lair.</p><p>3</p><p>She wears my ring.</p><p>Dmitri watched Honor\u2019s face light up as she laughed at something her clever friend Ashwini had whispered to her. With her sly wit and eyes that saw too much, the other hunter had been a good friend to Honor, and so Dmitri would\u2019ve been inclined to like her, even if she hadn\u2019t provided him with a source of amusement\u2014the game of cat and mouse she and Janvier had played for over two years was as inexplicable as it was fascinating.</p><p>Honor\u2019s eyes turned in his direction, her face holding an unasked question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at my wife,\u201d he murmured for her ears only, running his fingers over her nape as he told himself he really should behave since they were in public. \u201cMy beautiful wife, whom I\u2019d like to peel out of her dress and set naked on my lap so I can do debauched things to her sexy body.\u201d He never had been much good at behaving.</p> <p>A faint shiver. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be let out to torment women.\u201d</p><p>Smiling with a slow deliberation that brought slumberous heat into those eyes of haunting green, he leaned in close, his next words a purr against the shell of her ear. \u201cI only plan to torment one woman for the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse thudded in her throat, the call of her blood an erotic siren song. He drew in a deep breath, took her scent within, but he wasn\u2019t about to rush. Not today. \u201cShall I tell you what I intend to do to you for your wedding night gift?\u201d He wrapped her up in tendrils of chocolate and a sensual promise rich and decadent.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was a laughing refusal, her husky voice entangling him in chains he had no intention of ever breaking. \u201cOr I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m wearing under this dress.\u201d</p><p>He felt like stretching in pleasure, as if he were a great cat that had been stroked, her laughter as precious to him as the rarest of gemstones. About to respond, he caught something out of the corner of his eye, shifted to see Jason walk into the room. \u201cI think Jason has come to say his good-byes.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d he said aloud as the black-winged angel stopped by the table. What has happened?</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid I can stay no longer.\u201d Eris is dead. I must head to Neha\u2019s territory.</p><p>When Jason lifted his forearm, Dmitri clasped it in the way of the warriors they had been in battle together. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you return.\u201d I will remain in contact.</p><p>Jason\u2019s hand tightened on his arm before falling away. \u201cEnjoy your time away.\u201d I have it under control, and you have a wife who will not be pleased by a husband tied forever to his work.</p><p>Dmitri glanced at Honor, his lips shaping into a faint smile. My wife is a hunter and far more likely to join me in riding to your rescue should you need it. Pausing, he added a personal message for Neha, for before Anoushka, she had been a great lady, an archangel he was not ashamed to have once served.</p><p>I\u2019ll ensure she receives it. Jason inclined his head toward Honor. \u201cI take my leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you were able to attend.\u201d Honor\u2019s smile dazzled. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again when we return to the city.\u201d</p><p>Jason left in a sweep of black wings seconds later, and Dmitri retook his seat by his wife . . . who leaned into him not long afterward, her voice a hushed whisper as she asked, \u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Arm around her, he rubbed his thumb over the sensitive arch of her collarbone. \u201cWhen we are alone,\u201d he murmured, body hardening at the idea of her warm and naked in his arms in their bed. \u201cCome for a walk.\u201d</p><p>Honor gave him a narrow-eyed look. \u201cSo you can talk me into your Ferrari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like what you do to me in my Ferrari.\u201d Sultry and hotly feminine, she\u2019d made him her slave the day she\u2019d taken him with such lush confidence.</p><p>A slow, slow smile from the woman who owned him body and soul. \u201cMaybe we should make a detour on our way back to the Tower after the reception.\u201d</p><p>He knew his eyes were gleaming, but he didn\u2019t care. Leaning forward, he captured her lips in a kiss that made the guests around them cheer. \u201cA long detour.\u201d It was a promise.</p><p>4</p><p>Over fourteen hours of intense flight later, Jason used the night clouds to his advantage as he circled the stone and marble of the magnificent fortress perched on a high ridgeline. It was known simply as Archangel Fort, for it was where Neha made her home. Bathed in the light of a full moon that hadn\u2019t yet begun to wane, though morning lay only a few hours away, its defensive walls glowed not the amber gold they were under the sun\u2019s rays, but a pale, haunting silver.</p><p>Having stashed his small bag for later retrieval, he\u2019d earlier flown down toward the dark mirror of a lake at the base of the fort, done a sweep over the slumbering city beyond. From the lower vantage point, the fort had appeared a mirage, a fantasy imagined.</p><p>A fitting throne for the archangel who was queen of this land.</p><p>Flaring out wings of ebony that absorbed the moonlight as they absorbed sunlight, he came to a silent, invisible landing in the shadows cast by one of the great gates that protected the fort, a gate big enough to dwarf an entire cavalry unit. Each gate was hidden from the previous and the next by the angles at which the fort had been built, cutting the sightline and providing no straight runs on which to build up speed that could be used to ram the next gate. As a defensive measure against a mounted attack, it was magnificent.</p><p>Flying enemies required further countermeasures, including the squadron of angels in the sky and the vampires armed with land-to-air weaponry on the ramparts. None of them had seen Jason. That was not to say they were useless\u2014it was the rare guard who ever spotted a man who\u2019d been designed to blend into the night. Jason was fairly certain he\u2019d avoided detection by the satellite surveillance system, too, his ability turning him into an indistinct shadow dismissed by man and machine alike.</p><p>Rather than walking through the gate, he watched in motionless silence until he could predict the watch route and timing of the vampiric guards, then\u2014taking advantage of a fleeting blind spot\u2014flew up and over the gate to land on the edge of the geometrically patterned gardens on the third-level courtyard.</p><p>The fountain in the center sparkled in the moonlight that lit up the courtyard to luminous brightness. Neha\u2019s private palace, he knew, was to the left of his landing position, its marble walls inlaid with ancient motifs created from semiprecious stones. But that was not its most stunning feature\u2014thousands of diamonds had been embedded into the walls, intertwined into the design, until the palace could glitter as hard as the stone itself . . . or shimmer with a fiery heart that awoke wonder in young and old. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf all the buildings I have seen in my lifetime, it is the Hira Mahal that steals my breath.\u201d</p><p>It had been Titus who\u2019d said those words, and the warrior archangel was not a man given to poetry. Jason could understand the urge, for the Hira Mahal or Diamond Palace\u2014also often referred to as the Palace of Jewels\u2014was a work of art unlike any other. Now, rising from his low, crouched position, he once again timed his movements to avoid the guards and reached the glittering door of the palace without being seen.</p><p>The guard who opened it in response to his knock hissed in surprise and went for a weapon.</p><p>\u201cI assume that is the spymaster,\u201d said a feminine voice from within, the language the principal dialect in this region. \u201cDo come in, Jason.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping the guard in his line of sight, Jason walked into the glimmering illusion of the palace to see the Queen of Poisons, of Snakes. Unlike when she\u2019d spoken with Raphael, Neha was now the picture of grace where she sat on a thronelike chair, her body clothed in a sari of palest green rather than the stark white of mourning. She, like the rest of the room, shimmered with the candlelight bouncing off the endless cascade of faceted gemstones.</p><p>\u201cLady Neha.\u201d He swept down into a respectful bow that nonetheless made it clear he was no sycophant and never would be. He\u2019d learned the elegant movement from Illium, and it was useful on the rare occasion when he had to make a public appearance in front of one of the Cadre.</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me.\u201d</p><p>Greeting complete, he met the penetrating brown of her gaze, conscious of the fine emerald-hued snake she wore as a living bracelet. \u201cDid you expect a savage?\u201d he asked in the same dialect, having long ago learned the dominant languages of the world\u2014including variations used in the home territories of the Cadre. Secrets, after all, had no one language.</p><p>Lips painted a sedate blush curved. \u201cYou do give that impression.\u201d Rising from her heavily carved chair of black marble, the carvings inlaid with gold, she came down the three steps to a floor covered by a hand-knotted silk carpet the shade of sapphires under sunlight.</p> <p>When he didn\u2019t offer her his arm, she raised an imperious eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI need both arms free to fight.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s laugh was delicate . . . hiding a shrill note beneath. \u201cSo honest, but then that is a clever lie, is it not? A spymaster can never give everything away.\u201d</p><p>Jason said nothing, having no interest in playing this particular game.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she said with a gleaming smile that held the appreciation of an immortal who rarely lost a battle of wits and who had only shot her first volley, \u201cit\u2019s time to meet the one to whom you will swear fealty in blood. All is in readiness for the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Jason laid out his single condition as they walked. To his surprise, Neha not only made no demur to his stipulation as to the duration of the vow, she welcomed it.</p> <p>\u201cYou are too dangerous a creature for Mahiya.\u201d An unreadable darkness in the archangel\u2019s tone. \u201cThe poor child will likely die of fright unless she knows she\u2019ll soon be free of the chains that bind her to you.\u201d She paid no heed to a large owl flying silent as a ghost just beyond the open outdoor passageway where they walked. \u201cMahiya is not capable of handling such a burden for long.\u201d</p><p>Again, Jason kept his silence. The princess had never struck him as weak, but he\u2019d only ever caught the most fleeting glimpses of her, for she was no power in the court, not at the center of any intrigues, and thus of little interest to a spymaster. Yet he knew it could all be a clever subterfuge, Mahiya a well-hidden blade. It made little sense to charge a fragile \u201ctrinket\u201d with keeping watch on the movements of an enemy spymaster.</p><p>On the other hand, Mahiya might have been the only available choice, the sole known direct descendant of the same ancient bloodline as Neha who was both alive and not bonded to a lover.</p><p>Even as he went over everything he knew of the princess, he took in the liveried and armed guards hidden behind fluted columns of red stone; the way modern lighting had been integrated to appear a seamless part of the centuries-old structure; the lithe loveliness of the ladies-in-waiting out for a night stroll who bowed as Neha led him not across the gardens, but up a level and into the fourth-level courtyard.</p><p>As the exquisite palace on the highest level was used only to house guests the caliber of the Cadre, and otherwise left empty but for the watch rotation, this was effectively the most remote section of the fort, the walls falling off steeply on either side. However, parts of it were newer than the rest of the structure, this level having been altered from its original design roughly three hundred years ago.</p><p>A pavilion, delicate columns holding up the roof, sat in the center of the courtyard. That much was unchanged, but gardens had been added around it in the shape of a single stylized flower, each of the \u201cpetals\u201d planted with different blooms. A fountain created gentle music somewhere, but he couldn\u2019t immediately see it\u2014then he realized the water was cascading down the raised sides of the pavilion to run into fine channels that kept the gardens healthy in spite of the desert climate in this part of Neha\u2019s territory.</p><p>Where once the entire courtyard had been surrounded by interconnected apartments, there were now two separate palaces\u2014one on the side that faced the jagged terrain of the mountains and one that overlooked the city. The remaining two sides appeared to have been part of the older architecture. However, both sets of buildings now stood apart from the palaces, the apartments no longer interlinked.</p><p>The entire section was under heavy guard.</p> <p>Those guards didn\u2019t bow as Neha passed, their absolute attention on their task. Sari whispering in the wind as she walked, Neha kept her wings scrupulously off the clean stone of the pathway that led to the lamp-lit pavilion, the otherwise open sides curtained with gauzy silks currently tied back to columns that reminded Jason of elongated vases, the arches above finely scalloped. A woman stood at the center of the pavilion, and she wore a sari that may have been palest pink, but appeared a creamy white in the soft light\u2014as if she mourned where Neha didn\u2019t.</p><p>Jason already knew that her face was small and pointed, her body softly curved and of a height that would barely reach his breastbone, her eyes a light tawny brown so vivid against her honey-colored skin and black hair that they were the first things anyone noticed about her. The eyes of a lynx or a puma. Eris\u2019s eyes had been blue, but Eris\u2019s father possessed the same distinctive irises that marked Princess Mahiya as illegitimate.</p><p>However, no one in the world had Mahiya\u2019s wings\u2014deep emerald and vivid cobalt with splashes of rich black, the wild spray akin to a peacock\u2019s fan. Except that somehow, Mahiya had managed to remain out of the limelight, until no one mentioned the princess with wings to rival a bird famed for its beauty when they spoke of the most stunning wings in the world.</p><p>She went into a graceful curtsy as Neha approached, bowing her neck to reveal the vulnerable nakedness of her nape, her hair parted down the centre and gathered into a simple knot at the back of her head. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo try not to frighten her too much, Jason,\u201d Neha murmured, the fine filaments of cobalt in the primaries of her otherwise snow-white wings whispering of their blood tie. \u201cShe is rather . . . useful on occasion.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded in greeting toward the woman who made broken razors slash through Neha\u2019s tone, received a curtsy as elegant, though not as deep as the one she\u2019d given the archangel. However, she maintained her silence as Neha lifted a single finger and a turbaned vampire wearing the uniform of the guard appeared from behind one of the columns, a velvet-lined tray in his arms. The crimson fabric was home to a ceremonial knife, its hilt embedded with yellow sapphires.</p><p>Neha picked it up with long fingers clearly at home with the blade. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>The ceremony was an ancient one, the words Neha asked him to speak to Mahiya, and Mahiya to him, unchanged for millennia. Stripped of its ritual robes, the core of it was a promise of loyalty that did not challenge his deeper oath to Raphael, yet that bound him to keep faith with Mahiya and her blood for the duration of his task.</p><p>\u201cI hold your vow,\u201d Mahiya said, speaking the closing words for this part of the rite. \u201cUntil the name of the traitor is known. It is done.\u201d</p><p>Neha smiled into the thick silence after Mahiya accepted their bargain. \u201cYour neck, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d he said without blinking, and turned his arm to reveal his wrist. \u201cBlood is blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not trust me?\u201d A silken question that dripped menace.</p><p>\u201cI trust no one at my neck.\u201d He was powerful enough that he\u2019d most likely survive a beheading, but that didn\u2019t mean he wanted to chance it.</p><p>The head falling from his blood-slick hands to thud onto the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry . . .\u201d</p><p>When Neha\u2019s eyes remained ice-cold, he expected her to bleed him far more than necessary, but she made only the shallowest nick on his wrist, right above his pulse. As a droplet of blood welled onto his skin, she ordered Mahiya to angle her neck and made another cut above the beat of the other angel\u2019s pulse.</p><p>This last act was the final, and for many, the repugnant reason why the ceremony was no longer in favor. \u201cPrincess Mahiya,\u201d he said, stepping close enough to see the taut line of her jaw, her spine as rigid as the tendons in her neck.</p><p>A slight nod, permission for him to seal the vow with the most basic of acts.</p><p>Dipping his head, he flicked his tongue over the ruby red droplet that shivered against her dusky skin, the warm iron of it metallic against his tongue. He stepped back, held up his wrist.</p><p>Mahiya placed both of her hands under his wrist and lifted it to her lips. The touch of her lips on his skin, light as butterfly\u2019s wings. Lifting her head, she said, \u201cThe blood vow is sealed,\u201d her expression unreadable in its very lack of deep emotion. Except for that single betrayal of distaste during the sealing of the vow, it was as if they stood at a cocktail party, exchanging pleasantries, the effect was so curiously shallow.</p><p>Perhaps that was all there was to the princess, but Jason\u2019s every instinct whispered otherwise.</p><p>He turned to Neha, never losing his awareness of the enigmatic Mahiya. \u201cEris?\u201d</p><p>Clapping her hands, she laughed. \u201cOh, what a thing to say directly after a primal act of blood.\u201d A reminder that in times lost to the mists of history such vows had been spoken between lovers, the blood exchanged an erotic kiss. \u201cYou truly are cold, Jason.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been called that many times in his life, and it was a fact he didn\u2019t dispute, though deep within him burned a cauldron of black fire. \u201cIt\u2019s why I am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come.\u201d</p><p>When Mahiya went to drop behind him, Jason shook his head. \u201cI will not have you at my back.\u201d She was an unknown, her threat level as yet a mystery. \u201cWalk ahead of or beside me.\u201d</p><p>A flash of startling tawny brown, but she fell into step at his side . . . a fine, fine hum of tension across her shoulders. It was so subtly camouflaged, even Jason might not have caught it if he hadn\u2019t already been on alert for any sign of the woman behind the mask. Mahiya, it seemed, did not like having anyone at her back either. Unusual for a court \u201ctrinket,\u201d even more so for a princess who should\u2019ve been used to a retinue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Neha said nothing further until they reached the palace that overlooked the city, its wide doors guarded by two angels armed with swords and guns both. \u201cTreat this investigation with the respect my consort deserves.\u201d</p><p>Understanding the archangel had no intention of accompanying them, Jason waited for her to take her leave before he entered the palace through the doors the guards pulled open, their eyes flat with suspicion. The scent of putrefaction hit him the instant he walked in, and he knew at once that Eris still lay within, in spite of the time it had taken Jason to reach the fort.</p><p>Neha\u2019s love for Eris had been such that she would never offer up his violated body as a spectacle, so this must\u2019ve been a rational choice to preserve the scene. He hadn\u2019t expected it of her after the madness he\u2019d seen in her eyes when she spoke to Raphael, and he should have\u2014Neha was strong, not simply in power, but in mind, regardless of her recent losses. He would not forget that again.</p><p>Holding his wings tightly to his back in order to avoid any inadvertent contact with objects inside the palace, he said, \u201cWhere is Eris?\u201d He could have followed the scent of decay to the body easily enough, but he needed to open a line of communication with the woman who stood silent by his side.</p> <p>Mahiya was a mystery, and Jason did not like mysteries.</p><p>So he would solve her.</p><p>5</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Mahiya began to walk, every cell in her body conscious of the black-winged, black-garbed angel keeping pace beside her . . . an angel who fascinated her. The same way a child might be fascinated by the gleaming edge of a blade, wanting to run a fingertip over the metal to see if it really was that sharp.</p><p>Such fascination always ended in blood.</p> <p>Yet she couldn\u2019t stifle her reaction, for he was unlike anyone she had ever before met, a man who wore his sleek midnight hair in a neat queue and was unafraid of an archangel\u2019s anger. If the latter were not intriguing enough, he sported an intricate tribal tattoo on the left side of his face, the ink a rich black against the warm brown of his skin, the swirling curves of it telling a story she wanted to understand but knew instinctively he would not share.</p><p>That face itself was a mix of cultures, the Pacific and Europe entangled to create a masculine beauty that was as harsh as it was compelling.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s spymaster.</p><p>It was what Neha called him. As a description, it was succinct, but it hid as much as it divulged. He was so silent that had she not been able to see him from the corner of her eye, she\u2019d have thought herself alone\u2014a man gifted at becoming a shadow, was Jason, able to navigate the dark secrets of the Cadre unseen and undetected.</p><p>However, he was nothing so simple as a spy who saw and reported. He was one of Raphael\u2019s Seven, that tight-knit band of angels and vampires Mahiya little understood. All she knew was that the seven incredibly strong men had chosen to put themselves in service to an archangel\u2014and that their loyalty was reflected in Raphael\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cSuch a power is Jason.\u201d</p> <p>Neha had murmured those words after Jason agreed to come to the fort, agreed to swear a blood vow to Mahiya. It wasn\u2019t the only thing the archangel had said, her lips twisted into a smile that dripped poison.</p><p>\u201cRaphael\u2019s Tower will be crippled when the spymaster changes his allegiance. And he will . . . for I can offer Jason something Raphael will never be able to match.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya didn\u2019t care about Neha\u2019s vengeful game playing. She cared only about the cold, practical contract that underlay the ceremony of the vow Jason had spoken, her bones filled with a chill determination to complete this task without dropping the mask of inoffensive grace that was her most powerful weapon. No one considered her a threat. Neither would this spymaster.</p><p>Reaching the gauzy curtains of amber and gold that fluttered in the archway leading into the high central core of the palace, she took the time to tie them to the sides before waving her hand inward.</p><p>Jason remained in place.</p><p>\u201cI will not have you at my back.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the prickling at her nape that warned her of lethal danger, she preceded him into the echoing central chamber that rose all the way to the roof. Her stomach threatened to revolt against the stink, but she brought her gag reflex under control through sheer grim determination and practice\u2014Neha had left Mahiya in the palace to \u201ckeep Eris company\u201d for hours after his murder.</p><p>\u201cHe was your father, after all. I give you time to say your farewells.\u201d</p> <p>For once, Mahiya did not think it had been a conscious cruelty\u2014Neha herself had returned to sit with the body until an hour prior to Jason\u2019s arrival, her fingers stroking Eris\u2019s hair, the deep mahogany streaked with lighter strands as a result of all the time Neha had recently allowed him to spend in the searing sunshine of the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cHe is a creature of the sun, born on a clifftop overlooking the Mediterranean.\u201d</p><p>However, this windowless, sunless room with its marble floor overlaid by a thick carpet in swirls of gold and amber had been the place where Eris spent most of his time. The chandelier overhead was a masterwork that glittered light across the entire expanse, made the carnelian in the walls glow with inner fire . . . and the crystallized blood on the floor sparkle with stomach-churning beauty.</p><p>That blood had dripped from a wide divan where Eris had so often mockingly \u201cheld court\u201d when Mahiya came to him with a message. A glass of red wine spilled an ugly stain onto the swirling colors of the carpet, while a plate of fruit\u2014exotic peaches and dark cherries from far off lands of cold and ice, figs and apricots from Neha\u2019s own plantations\u2014sat half eaten.</p><p>Flies buzzed over the silver plate, but they weren\u2019t truly interested.</p><p>No, their attention was taken up by the rotting carcass of the man who lay broken half on, half off the divan, his wings spread out in a final dramatic display and his chest cracked open to exhibit a hollow body cavity. While the blood outside his body had crystallized into a brittle substance akin to shimmering pink rock salt, inside that hollow, it had hardened to the same dark, dark red as the cherries, evidence of the fact his body had attempted to repair itself and failed.</p><p>Death rubies.</p><p>The idea of wearing jewelry created from the blood of a dead angel revolted Mahiya, but it had been an accepted practice in times past, the gems worn as memento mori by the lovers of those angels who died in circumstances that led to the creation of the death rubies. Fitting that Eris should be beautiful in this way even in death\u2014for in life he had been a man who was the embodiment of physical perfection, his skin shimmering gold, his eyes lapis lazuli blue.</p><p>Jason displayed no distaste at the sight of Eris\u2019s mutilated body, his breathing even as he examined the remains of her \u201cfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I have the chance to strangle you in your crib, I would have done so in a heartbeat. Without you, she would\u2019ve forgiven my transgression long ago.\u201d A wineglass smashing onto marble. \u201cBe careful when you sleep, girl. I have friends who may yet snap your neck for me.\u201d</p><p>It was her most vivid memory of the man who had contributed his seed to her creation.</p><p>Ignoring the flies that buzzed around what remained of a man who had once been the toast of courts from ancient Greece to the Forbidden City, Jason leaned in close, making certain of his first impression that Eris\u2019s heart had been removed, as had all his other internal organs. He could see a pile of indeterminate decomposing material to the right, guessed they might be the hacked-up remains of the organs.</p><p>That his head was still attached to his neck was a surprise\u2014though Eris was universally considered too weak to have been consort to an archangel, that weakness had stemmed from his character, rather than the raw power contained within his body. He was more than old and strong enough to have risen by now were his brain intact.</p><p>Jason examined what appeared to be dried blood under one of Eris\u2019s nostrils, the color near black, the substance clotted rather than crystalline. \u201cWas a long needle found with the body?\u201d</p><p>Mahiya shook her head, her expression devoid of the sorrow and distress he might\u2019ve expected from a woman standing by the body of her dead father. \u201cNothing has been taken from this palace since Neha discovered his body.\u201d A pause. \u201cDo you wish me to search this room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bending as she began to do so, he put his hand under Eris\u2019s head and lifted, knocked on the bone with the knuckles of his free hand.</p><p>Mahiya paused in her search. \u201cIt sounds . . . hollow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis brain\u2019s been removed.\u201d</p><p>Sari held neatly off the blood-matted carpet, the princess returned needleless from her search and spoke words he most assuredly had not expected to hear from a woman dressed in softest pink, her every move speaking of elegant femininity. \u201cHow?\u201d Determined curiosity leaked through her facade of distant politeness. \u201cHis head is unmolested.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s interest in Mahiya grew deeper, more intense. \u201cA hooked needle thrust into the brain through the nose,\u201d he said, describing a method used by the people of ancient Egypt as part of the mummification process. \u201cThat needle is then moved around until the brain is in a state that it can be extracted via the same route.\u201d</p><p>From the thick area of dried material directly below the head, the brain might well have been turned into soup, allowed to drip out of Eris\u2019s nose before he was turned back over and posed as he was now.</p><p>A small silence, and he wondered if he\u2019d misjudged the internal strength of this princess raised in the hothouse that was the fort, but who watched him out of those eyes bright as a cat\u2019s with a steely intelligence that fit neither her quiet acquiescence to Neha\u2019s demands, nor the way she\u2019d followed his own commands without argument.</p><p>Then she spoke, and he knew his instincts hadn\u2019t steered him wrong. Mahiya might not be an opponent strong enough to concern him, but she was no pampered princess he could ignore. \u201cSo\u201d\u2014a considering look\u2014\u201cwhoever did this came well prepared, not only with the blade he or she used to carve up Eris, but with the hook, perhaps other tools as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding a garrote.\u201d Jason pointed out the mark on Eris\u2019s necrotic flesh, his sun golden skin now a home for creatures who fed on death. \u201cIt may have been the first attack.\u201d Enough to disable the angel, allow time for the murderer to inflict more debilitating injuries. Because though humans termed angelkind immortal, there was perhaps one true immortal in the world\u2014Lijuan. The rest of them were simply harder to kill.</p><p>\u201cHe was tied up,\u201d Mahiya said, indicating the still-visible marks on Eris\u2019s wrists, the decay of his flesh having exposed bone. \u201cFor the skin to decay that fast\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans the bindings had to have cut through to bone.\u201d It also explained the splatters of crystalline blood below where his wrists hung. \u201cHe was powerful enough to have snapped ordinary rope\u2014this must\u2019ve been infused with metal of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe the killer used extra garrotes as ties?\u201d Mahiya offered, a sudden hesitancy to her.</p><p>Jason wondered exactly what kind of life the princess had lived that she\u2019d made the same dark intuitive leap he had even as he finished speaking. \u201cYes. Could Neha have untied him, gotten rid of the evidence?\u201d The act of a woman who did not want her lover found bound and helpless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Mahiya shook her head. \u201cNo, she only entered the room half a minute ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>Which meant Eris had been left this way on purpose\u2014displayed like a trophy, or a warning. But who would dare play such a game with Neha? Another of the Cadre? It was something to consider. As was the fact that Eris hadn\u2019t simply been killed; he\u2019d been tortured. Again, his suffering could\u2019ve been intended to hurt Neha, but there seemed something deeply personal about this.</p><p>Everything was close contact, from the strangulation to the way the man\u2019s other organs had been removed\u2014by a small blunt knife, if Jason was reading the marks on the bone correctly. He was gut-certain the brain had been left for last, so there was a high chance Eris had remained conscious as the killer hacked out pieces of his body. He\u2019d have drowned in pain and terror . . . which explained the raw flesh around his mouth, the cuts on his tongue and lips.</p><p>A gag of some kind to muffle his screams.</p> <p>Rising, he took in Eris\u2019s silken pants and vest embroidered with traditional designs that would\u2019ve exposed his muscled chest. \u201cDid he dress like this normally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014he was never untidy, never ungroomed, but he had long forgone the formality of court.\u201d</p><p>And instead, Jason thought, chosen to embrace the languid sensuality that would appeal to his wife. A wife who had not forgiven him in three hundred long years. Looking around the room, Jason saw a clean floor beneath the recent bloodshed, polished statuettes, and gleaming walls. Clearly, servants had entr\u00e9e into the palace.</p><p>So, he recalled, did others.</p><p>Kallistos, the vampire who\u2019d sought to kill Dmitri, had known the location of Eris\u2019s home in the United States, though it was a place many had forgotten. There was a good chance the vampire had received the information directly from Eris, either in return for some favor or by putting together discrete pieces of information Eris had let drop. Thus access to this palace was not an impossible thing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough.\u201d He headed toward the archway through which they\u2019d entered, waiting so Mahiya wouldn\u2019t fall behind, though he\u2019d had time enough to assess her level of threat and decide she posed no danger at his back\u2014she might move as quiet as the wind, but she wasn\u2019t quiet enough. More, she had no heavy weapons on her body, her sari falling flawlessly around her form, the curve of her waist naked beneath the drape.</p><p>Her walk was too fluid for her to have a knife in a thigh sheath, and her bangles too thin to conceal a garrote. However . . . the pins in her hair were very, very sharp. Used the right way, they could blind a man, cut his carotid, even stop his heart. They were the weapons of a woman who wasn\u2019t a trained fighter, but who did not intend to be a victim waiting to happen.</p><p>Jason felt a curl of unexpected fascination awaken within him. What other secrets do you hide, princess?</p><p>Stairs wide enough for a being with wings greeted him to the right of the doorway, the fading moonlight falling onto the higher steps colored in the reds, yellows, and blues of a stained glass window that was maybe two handspans across but at least three feet long. Walking up, he ignored the hallway that led to the rooms on this level, and turned right instead\u2014to go through a pair of doors set beside another long window of stained glass.</p><p>They opened onto a wide balcony enclosed on all sides by stone carved into delicate filigree that would\u2019ve allowed Eris to look out into the yard but would\u2019ve hidden him from the view of those below. Exquisite in its workmanship, it wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar form of ancient architecture, though in most cases, it had been used by males to hide their lovers and concubines from the view of those who might covet them.</p><p>Stepping to the stone filigree, he found himself looking out over the city beyond the lake at the foot of the fort\u2014the steep drop that led to it would\u2019ve been a quiet torture to a winged being forbidden to ride the winds. \u201cI heard a rumor that Neha clipped Eris\u2019s wings in truth.\u201d Despite the violation of the rest of Eris\u2019s body, the wings Jason had just seen had been whole.</p> <p>\u201cI was too young at the time to remember it myself,\u201d Mahiya said from where she stood with one hand on the doorjamb, \u201cbut I\u2019ve heard it whispered of by others. However, she didn\u2019t repeat the punishment once his wings grew back . . . and I think she regretted ever having done it.\u201d</p><p>Love, Jason thought, could be the most debilitating of weaknesses.</p><p>\u201cJason, I\u2019m sorry I scared you, son. I did not mean to rage.\u201d</p><p>Walking further down the balcony, he took in the windows along the inner wall, each created with ten red and green pieces of stained glass. The individual pieces were squares roughly the size of his palm, the effect delicate against the stone of the palace. The glass was echoed in the doors that stood open to reveal a bedroom that appeared to occupy most of the second level, its inner walls gently curved to embrace the central core of the palace.</p><p>A magnificent chandelier poured muted, flickering light from the ceiling. Its crystal sconces cradled a thousand candles, many of which had burned down, else the light would\u2019ve been sharper, brighter. \u201cEris didn\u2019t care for modern things?\u201d he asked the woman who\u2019d entered the bedroom from the corridor.</p><p>\u201cNo, he just preferred candlelight in his private chambers.\u201d</p><p>Which meant the room downstairs had acted as his receiving area. \u201cHow many guests was he permitted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depended on Neha\u2019s mood.\u201d An answer that said much about Eris\u2019s existence. \u201cNever any women aside from Neha and myself. Even the servants who worked in this palace were all male.\u201d</p> <p>For a man who had been a favorite of women, it would\u2019ve been akin to having a limb amputated. \u201cDo you think the rule was observed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Eris did not have any wish to anger Neha further.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t answer the question, and the way Mahiya had subtly angled her face away from the light as she spoke told him she knew more than she was saying.</p><p>The stealthy hunter in Jason rose to full wakefulness.</p><p>6</p><p>\u201cA leopard, as they say,\u201d he murmured, his mind working at the question of Mahiya\u2019s true loyalties, at whose secrets she kept, \u201cdoes not change its spots.\u201d Eris had never been good at self-denial where women and sex were concerned.</p><p>An adoring conquest looking up into the face of the golden god who was Neha\u2019s consort, her eyes blazing with shy desire.</p><p>Jason had witnessed that particular scene approximately a century and a half after Neha\u2019s marriage, during a ball given by the archangel Uram. At the time, he\u2019d put Eris\u2019s responding smile of sensual invitation down to male vanity, never considering the other man might ever actually accept such an invitation.</p><p>Yet Eris had needed to have his ego stroked enough that he\u2019d fathered a child upon the sister of the woman he\u2019d sworn to honor. Jason didn\u2019t fool himself that Eris had loved Nivriti\u2014the man had been a narcissist, had cared about no one but himself. And in spite of his trespass, he had survived. What was there to stop such a man from taking another risk and seducing a lover within the walls of his luxurious prison?</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said, pinning Mahiya with his gaze, \u201cDid Eris have a lover?\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had avoided his earlier question, having realized far too late that she\u2019d betrayed a knowledge and a curiosity beyond the woman she was meant to be. Her only defense for the unprecedented failure was surprise\u2014it had been so very startling to speak to someone who watched her without judgment or pity, and who did not divine a lack of understanding simply because she chose to keep her silence . . . but of course he wouldn\u2019t. Jason was a man who guarded his words, yet she had not a single doubt that his intelligence was a piercing arrow.</p><p>Now, looking into eyes a deep, impenetrable brown that stripped her to the bone, she realized it was too late to put the mask back on.</p><p>Jason had already seen her.</p><p>There was a strange exhilaration in showing her true face. \u201cI have no proof of a new infidelity,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there were times of late that I caught a certain musk in the air.\u201d A woman should not know such things about her father, but Eris\u2019s only claim to paternity had been through their shared blood.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Neha.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>Mahiya held that dark blade of a gaze. \u201cI would not be the messenger who bears such tidings.\u201d Neha would\u2019ve struck her down, ended her for it. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to attempt it.\u201d</p><p>His response to the challenge was a calm \u201cLet us see if it proves necessary.\u201d</p><p>The exhilaration in her bloodstream slowly turned to ice as she watched him explore every inch of the palace that had been Eris\u2019s home. She knew his reputation, but it was only now, after witnessing his thorough, meticulous search, that she realized the exact level of Jason\u2019s skill, his dedication . . . and understood that none of her plans would come to fruition should he decide to pledge his skills in service to Neha.</p><p>Gritting her teeth to fight a shiver, she realized the sands had just begun to fall with increased speed through the hourglass. The Seven were meant to be an impregnable unit, immune to enticement from others in the Cadre, but Neha had had a glint in her eye that said she held an ace. If she did . . . Mahiya and her traitorous intent had to be long gone before Jason accepted the archangel\u2019s offer.</p><p>Heart thudding hard enough to bruise against her ribs, she shut the door on those thoughts lest they betray her, and followed Jason into a large bathing chamber below the level that held the receiving area. Curls of steam rose from the clear water. \u201cThis was meant to be turned off,\u201d she said, sensing the fine tendrils of hair at her nape beginning to curl from the humidity. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it after we leave.\u201d</p><p>Not responding, Jason began to walk the edges of a bathing pool so large, it could\u2019ve easily accommodated five adult angels. Ancient by design, the chamber had been put in when the palace was constructed for Eris\u2019s incarceration, and he\u2019d made good use of it. Many a time when she\u2019d been sent by Neha to see if he needed anything, it had been to find him lounging in the bath.</p><p>\u201cHas Neha not slit your throat yet?\u201d A bored sigh, his wings spread as he leaned against the edge, arms lying on the painted tiles carried from Italy by angelic couriers. \u201cA pity.\u201d</p><p>The stab of memory wasn\u2019t enough to distract her from catching the subtle twist of Jason\u2019s hand as he slipped something into his pocket. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>No surprise or guilt on his face. \u201cI assume this is Eris\u2019s?\u201d he said, retrieving the object.</p><p>Walking to stand nearer to him than she had till then, she examined the thick gold ring set with tanzanite, dangerously conscious of the penetrating intensity of the spymaster\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d Only centuries of practice kept her voice from cracking under the silent, inexorable pressure. \u201cNot a favorite, so he may well have forgotten it here.\u201d</p><p>Jason placed it in her hand. \u201cI would not want to be accused of stealing.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya felt color tinge her cheeks at the gentle, lethal words. \u201cMy apologies. I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything of the kind.\u201d What she\u2019d meant to imply was that he was hiding something from her. That, she couldn\u2019t permit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook at her, Eris. She has your father\u2019s eyes\u2014they are so unique.\u201d</p><p>Words Neha had spoken in a venomous murmur when Eris angered her a century ago. By that time, Mahiya had already been well aware of the single reason for her continued existence. However, Eris was now a corpse who could no longer be tortured with the serrated knife that was the presence of his illegitimate child, and Nivriti lay dead in some forgotten grave, her flesh rotted to dust and her bones bleached white.</p><p>The only one left who\u2019d be pained by the mere sight of Mahiya . . . was Neha.</p><p>Mahiya had to keep the archangel from remembering that as long as possible. She was almost ready to escape the fort. Almost. But almost wasn\u2019t good enough when an archangel hated you with a spite that had survived three centuries, a spite that was a caustic flame dipped in poison. The only purpose she currently served was in keeping watch on Jason. The instant she failed in that task, she\u2019d join her mother below the earth, the maggots feasting on her flesh.</p> <p>Jason said nothing to her apology, shifting to walk back out and upstairs to the main door. He didn\u2019t shorten his stride to accommodate her, and she found herself almost running to keep up, the neat folds of her sari flaring out in front of her. Breathless, she wondered if he sought to humiliate her before the guards. If he did, he\u2019d be in for a long wait\u2014the guards had seen her in far more humiliating positions.</p><p>The crack of a whip.</p><p>Fire on her back, sticky liquid trailing down her broken flesh.</p><p>Jason came to a sudden stop ahead of the still-closed doors, his voice shattering the memory of the punishment meted out to her in Neha\u2019s inner courtyard, the whip wielded by the Master of the Guard.</p><p>\u201cMy rooms?\u201d he asked, his voice so pure, she found herself wondering, not for the first time, if he ever lifted it in song.</p> <p>\u201cIn the palace across the courtyard,\u201d she said, barely managing to keep her wing from sliding across his as she halted her own forward momentum.</p><p>Jason was not a man any woman would touch without invitation.</p><p>Now, reaching out, he opened the door and waited for her to exit. Courtesy, she thought\u2014he\u2019d given her his back earlier, had clearly written her off as a threat. She was too practical to be insulted. If Jason wanted to hurt her, she could do nothing to stop him. Hundreds of warriors, angelic and vampiric, might live in the fort, but the only offensive or defensive training Mahiya had came from what she\u2019d been able to glean by covert study of their training sessions.</p><p>And no one, not even a woman determined to protect herself in any way she could, could learn to be a master fighter simply by watching, then attempting to copy those movements in the privacy of her bedroom or up in the isolation of the mountains. However, to ask for help would be to pay a price she couldn\u2019t ask anyone to pay.</p><p>Her first fledgling friendship as an adult\u2014two hundred years ago\u2014had resulted in the angel in question having both his arms and his wings excised for an outwardly unrelated offense. Mahiya would never forget the way his blood had coated the stone of the warriors\u2019 courtyard, darkening the granite to near-black even as his screams echoed off the walls of the surrounding barracks.</p><p>Mahiya had understood the brutal lesson, had never again attempted to build bonds with those in the fort, until many believed her a creature of conceit. Better that than to have their screams ringing in her ears as that young angel\u2019s did to this day, though he was long healed.</p> <p>\u201cNo one ever sees Jason coming. No one.\u201d</p><p>The overheard words reverberating in her mind as she reached the courtyard, she heard him say something to the two angels at the door before he reappeared at her side. She glanced at his wings as they crossed over to the mountainside palace, expecting to see them silvered by the waning moon as were the black filaments in her own wings, but there was only darkness at Jason\u2019s back\u2014if she hadn\u2019t known him for an angel, she\u2019d have thought the spymaster a vampire.</p><p>Blinking, she stared, though it was a rudeness. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask her to explain what she meant. \u201cA natural gift honed by time.\u201d</p><p>Conscious that this predator\u2014fascinating and darkly intriguing\u2014was deadlier than any other she\u2019d faced save Neha, she walked up the steps of the palace where Jason would stay for the duration. Though it wasn\u2019t overtly guarded, only a fool would assume it wasn\u2019t under constant watch.</p><p>When she walked through the open doors and turned to welcome Jason inside, he paused. \u201cYou live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And had done so since she returned from the Refuge school, but it wasn\u2019t home and never would be.</p><p>Soon, she promised herself, soon I will have a home where I will be safe, free from Neha\u2019s bitter hate and the shadow of a father who didn\u2019t know the meaning of fidelity.</p> <p>Lowering her head in an apparent gesture of subservience lest Jason see too much, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you to your room.\u201d</p><p>He followed her upstairs and into the sprawling room that overlooked the courtyard. Once, that had been the room she\u2019d shared with Arav, believing herself loved. Desperate for happiness, she hadn\u2019t wanted to see the truth until it slapped her in the face.</p><p>\u201cYou have been a most amusing diversion.\u201d A laughing, condescending pat on the cheek at her bewildered expression. \u201cAnd rather delightful. But Neha has approved my territorial proposal, and I\u2019m afraid I must return to my lands and cease partaking of your pleasures.\u201d</p><p>That heartbreakingly young, na\u00efve girl was long gone, but Mahiya refused to allow the poison of Neha\u2019s hatred to infect her\u2014she knew full well Arav had only used her as he had because he\u2019d divined her pain would please the archangel. That was a stain against his honor and said nothing of Mahiya\u2019s own. She would love again, and she would love with all her heart, living her life in a brilliance of hope and joy.</p><p>\u201cWill you be needing anything?\u201d she asked the spymaster, who, feminine instinct whispered, was far more dangerous to her than Arav had ever been.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, she pulled the wooden doors shut and walked quickly to her own room, situated right next to his. However, she knew she\u2019d be too late and she was. By the time she opened the doors to their shared balcony, Raphael\u2019s spymaster had disappeared into the gray twilight that was the first harbinger of night\u2019s fading kiss.</p><p>Gliding on the cool winds of the hour before dawn, Jason came to an easy landing on one of the walls of the heavily fortified Guardian Fort. It overlooked Archangel Fort and was considered an extension of it, a place where a considerable number of Neha\u2019s angelic guard made their homes. Seen from its strong walls, Archangel Fort was a great lady yet asleep, though the scattering of lights burning in the windows told him the place never truly closed its eyes. As it should be. The Tower in New York never slept, either.</p><p>He saw an angel come in to land at the lower fort at that instant. From the way he brought himself to a harsh stop with two simple backbeats, Jason pegged the flyer as one of the warrior guards. Those guards were not exclusively angelic\u2014Neha had her share of vampires in all positions, displaying no bias that could be utilized as a vulnerability.</p><p>If the archangel had had vulnerabilities, they\u2019d been named Anoushka and Eris.</p><p>Reaching into his pocket, he retrieved the small object he\u2019d secreted away even as he passed Mahiya the heavy gold ring. He\u2019d taken the masculine ring exactly for that purpose but hadn\u2019t actually expected her to catch the movement. Something else to add to his growing mental file on the princess who watched him with eyes that saw far too much for a woman who\u2019d been cloistered within sumptuous palace walls her entire adult existence. Now, he used his extraordinary night vision to examine the find he hadn\u2019t returned.</p><p>7</p><p>The ring was a woman\u2019s from the look of it: fine strands of gold woven around an opal at the center. Quite aside from the feminine quality of the design, the ring was too small to have fit even the little finger of Eris\u2019s hand. And, Neha was known to dislike opals, considering them a bad omen, so it couldn\u2019t be hers.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s ring finger . . . yes, it would fit. However, he had the niggling feeling that opals were not the princess\u2019s chosen gemstone. Clearly, he\u2019d seen something his conscious mind couldn\u2019t articulate, but that made him certain that should Mahiya be free to exercise her will, she would wear bright, cheerful jewels like citrine and peridot, aquamarine and canary diamonds.</p><p>\u201cAmesyst. Is that how you say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. Here, listen to me say it again. Amethyst.\u201d</p><p>Lashes lowering, rising again at the fragment of memory, he focused on the piece of jewelry once more. It was the sort of quiet, pretty ring a woman might wear constantly, an everyday item, perhaps something with sentimental value. Modest, but with a fine color to the opal and a touch to the design that spoke of a master jeweler Jason knew in Jaipur, it was unlikely to belong to a servant, even had maids been permitted within Eris\u2019s palace.</p><p>And, given Eris\u2019s proclivities, an innocent explanation for the presence of the ring was so unlikely as to be an impossibility. However, if another woman\u2014a lover\u2014had indeed been permitted within the walls of Eris\u2019s luxurious prison, it could not have been done without the goodwill and silence of at least one pair of guards.</p><p>\u201cA silver tongue, he has ever had it.\u201d</p><p>Add wealth to Eris\u2019s gift of charm, plus perhaps a certain history with the guards, for many in the elite unit had served centuries, and it may have been enough to induce them to forget who it was they served. Neha had always draped her consort in the most expensive furs and silks, the most dazzling jewels\u2014if he had \u201clost\u201d a piece or two, the archangel wasn\u2019t even likely to notice, much less care.</p><p>Even without the inducement of money, it might be that the men had felt sympathy for the husband who had strayed. In most angelic unions, it would\u2019ve meant the end of the relationship, not a lifetime of confinement, the sky forever out of reach. Yes, Jason could see how the guards could\u2019ve been persuaded to look the other way while Eris entertained.</p><p>As for the initial contact, a still-loyal servant could\u2019ve carried the messages after Eris caught a glimpse of the object of his attentions through the stone lace of the smaller balcony that faced the courtyard.</p><p>Having memorized the pattern of the ring and ascertained that it carried no engraving on the inside, he slipped it away. He didn\u2019t yet have enough information to uncover the name of the woman who\u2019d worn it, but he knew where to look. Not in the inner court . . . or not in the center of the inner court. She\u2019d be on the edges, a beautiful woman who felt she hadn\u2019t received her due. Someone who\u2019d both be flattered at Eris\u2019s attentions and full of enough pride that she sought to cuckold an archangel.</p><p>After all, she\u2019d been audacious enough to wear an opal in Neha\u2019s court.</p><p>It was a game no one of age and honed intelligence would dare play, so she had to be young and impressionable enough to fall for Eris\u2019s blandishments. To strip the veil off her identity would mean entering the battlefield of court, which Jason had no intention of doing. It was Mahiya of the cat-bright eyes, and silence as haunting as a wolf\u2019s midnight song, who had the necessary skills to navigate that particular terrain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr maybe the killer used extra garrotes as ties?\u201d</p><p>Not much fascinated Jason after a lifetime spent unearthing secrets and listening to the darkest truths, but he found himself returning again and again to the problematic Princess Mahiya, a woman who didn\u2019t fit her environment and who had secrets in her gaze older than they should be.</p><p>It mattered little. She was an intellectual curiosity, one that would lose its luster once he knew every facet of her. Of that he was certain. Nothing and no one had managed to get under his skin since the day he dug a deep hole under the shade cast by happy yellow hibiscus flowers, the seagulls cawing and fighting overhead.</p><p>Stretching out his wings with that truth in mind, he flew off Guardian Fort and along the ridgeline before winging his way high into the dark gray skies, the clouds yet heavy enough to conceal him from detection. It was here, far above land, that he felt more at home than anywhere else in the world.</p> <p>\u201cSlower, Jason!\u201d A hand gripping firmly at his ankle as he tangled his wings and threatened to plummet.</p><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have you, son. Spread out your wings slowly . . . yes, like that.\u201d</p><p>Catching his other ankle, his father pulled him farther into the sky. \u201cI\u2019m going to release you again. Ready?\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Jason said, \u201cYes,\u201d and felt his stomach tumble as his father opened his fingers.</p> <p>He was falling!</p><p>Except this time, instead of fighting the wind, he turned into it, allowing it to sweep him out over the sparkling waters that surrounded their home, a shimmering blue green so clear he could see the darting orange and red stripes of the fish swimming through the coral reef.</p><p>Above him, he heard his father\u2019s joyful exclamation, and he laughed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Jason couldn\u2019t fly. He\u2019d just never had need to practice the more advanced techniques, to go any farther than the roof of their home or up over the trees. However, if he wanted to accompany his father to the small uninhabited island he could just see in the distance\u2014where his father harvested fruits his mother particularly liked\u2014he would have to learn to ride the currents and conserve his energy.</p><p>\u201cFather!\u201d It was a delighted cry this time. \u201cI\u2019m doing it! Can you see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you could do it, son! Well done!\u201d His father swept out in front of him on wings of pure black but for the deep brown at the tips of his primaries, angled against the wind for a second before sliding into another updraft and circling back to their atoll.</p> <p>Copying him, Jason found that it wasn\u2019t hard at all if he did what his father had taught him and thought first.</p><p>\u201cEfficient flight is as much about intelligent choices as brute strength.\u201d</p><p>Now Jason made a conscious decision to change his angle when he realized his father\u2019s greater size gave him an advantage . . . and it worked! Until he felt like he was being carried on the winds. He couldn\u2019t wait to show his mother, and when he saw the pale purple of her tunic in the distance as she flew up to join them, he pushed himself to go even faster, his wings shining blue black in the sunlight. His father said Jason was meant to be a night scout, like he had been in his youth, before he decided to pursue his passion for music and the instruments that created it.</p><p>Jason wondered when he\u2019d be allowed to fly alone during the night. He thought he might like chasing the stars, but it would get lonely after a while. Cold and lonely.</p><p>8</p><p>Standing on the railingless balcony outside his Tower office, Raphael considered the report he\u2019d just had from Naasir. The vampire was currently stationed in the formerly lost city of Amanat, risen to new life in a mountainous region of Japan, a city controlled by Raphael\u2019s mother, an archangel so old, she was a true Ancient.</p><p>The reawakening of Amanat has gathered speed, he said to the woman with hair so pale it was white-gold, the strands catching the light from the surrounding skyscrapers as she flew in a zigzag pattern a short distance from the Tower.</p><p>We expected as much. Elena dipped left. Gimme a second. Ransom asked me to help him trail a troublesome vam\u2014gotcha!</p> <p>His vision acute as a raptor\u2019s, he watched as she spoke into a cell phone, caught the wave of her exultation when the hunter on the ground made the capture. Angelic consorts were a rare breed. Other than Elena, only Elijah\u2019s Hannah could truly carry that title. Even before Eris\u2019s death and though it was polite to refer to him as such, the position occupied by Neha\u2019s husband had been nothing akin to that of either of the women. That wasn\u2019t to say Hannah and Elena were cut from the same cloth. No, they were as distant in their temperaments and views on the world as fire and ice.</p><p>Of the two, it was Raphael\u2019s consort who was considered a peculiar creature indeed.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she continue to work for the Guild?\u201d Favashi had asked the last time they met, genuine puzzlement in her tone. \u201cDoes she not understand the honor of her position?\u201d</p><p>Favashi believes you should give up your penchant for chasing vampires and sit by my side as a proper consort.</p><p>No offense to Favashi\u2014who seems decent enough in comparison to Lijuan the zombie maker\u2014but she knows jack about how we work.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYes.\u201d He caught his consort around the waist as she came in for a high-speed landing. \u201cYou would surely have \u2018brained\u2019 yourself, as you put it, at that velocity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only flew in so fast because I knew you\u2019d catch me.\u201d</p><p>He was a being of immense power, had lived a millennium and a half, and yet she had the ability to stagger him with such simple words, her trust a jewel multifaceted and brilliant. Raising his hand, he ran it over the arch of her left wing, the area exquisitely sensitive. Her shiver was delicate, the pale gray of her eyes going smoky, the developing rim of pure silver around her irises vivid in the night.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, leaning into him with a sigh of bone-deep pleasure, \u201cwhat do you think your mother will do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not yet know.\u201d Caliane was a wild card no one had expected to have to deal with\u2014least of all the son she\u2019d left bloody and broken on a field far from civilization. \u201cWhen she woke, she had no inclination to rule anything other than Amanat, but she is healing into her strength, and there is an open spot in the Cadre.\u201d</p><p>The Cadre of Ten had been so called for as long as angelkind had had written history. Even when there was an absence of a hundred or two hundred years while a new archangel came to power, and only nine ruled, the name did not change. Such gaps were unremarkable in the life of an immortal. The empty chair this time around had been so for less than a fragment of a second, Uram\u2019s execution not yet two years past.</p><p>\u201cCaliane\u2019s return threatens to unbalance the power structure of the world.\u201d While there had been times when archangelic numbers had fallen as low as seven, they had never gone above ten, a natural balance that ensured large enough buffer zones between the biggest predators on the planet. \u201cThere is one who is on the brink of ascending to archangel status\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy brink, you mean . . .\u201d Elena asked, and he was reminded of the mortality so dangerously close to her skin, for immortality was a gift that took time to grow, to settle.</p><p>\u201cA decade, a century.\u201d He angled her face to check a bruise she\u2019d sustained during their earlier sparring session. \u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable at this level of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have time to figure out a solution.\u201d Sliding her arms around his body, she turned her gaze toward her beloved Manhattan. \u201cAnd fact is, it\u2019s not like anyone could stop Caliane if she wanted to rule again.\u201d</p><p>No. His mother was too powerful. She\u2019d also been insane when she decided on her centuries-long Sleep. Now she told him she was sane, and her actions seemed to bear that out\u2014but Raphael knew madness in the old ones could be an insidious thing. Lijuan was the perfect example.</p><p>Jason is worried Lijuan may be creating further reborn. The report had come in an hour ago, his spymaster continuing to control his network of informants even as he hunted Eris\u2019s murderer.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Elena shook her head. \u201cThat makes no sense\u2014those creatures are so infectious they\u2019d become a plague across her lands as well as the lands of others in the Cadre, and she saw how they could turn against her.\u201d Even she\u2019s not that batshit crazy.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I agree. \u201cShe is old, and the old do not always think as they should.\u201d</p><p>Elena took time to reply, her gaze tracking a small troop of angels coming in to land on the balcony below. \u201cShe might have figured out a way to control the rate of infection, some way to make certain of their loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she has, she\u2019ll be unstoppable.\u201d The last time Lijuan had risen, the rest of the Cadre had banded together to execute her, only to inadvertently help her in her strange evolution\u2014now, she was no longer wholly corporeal. \u201cI must find some way to strengthen my new ability.\u201d The sheer life of it, born of his tie to his consort with her mortal heart, was inimical to the death that was Lijuan\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cToo bad we no longer have the element of surprise there.\u201d</p><p>Running his hand down the silken tail of her hair, he smiled. \u201cYou will always provide surprises, Elena. You are my secret weapon.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, eyes dancing. \u201cDid Jason say anything about Neha when he contacted you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood vow means he cannot speak of that which happens in the fort, unless the information becomes public.\u201d It is a matter of honor.</p><p>I understand. \u201cI just hope he\u2019s safe.\u201d Worry was a shadow across the dark gold of her skin. \u201cThe way Neha looked the last time I saw her . . .\u201d A violent shiver.</p><p>\u201cJason is a survivor.\u201d Raphael didn\u2019t know everything of what had happened to Jason as a child, but he\u2019d put together enough pieces to understand the other angel had lived through things no child should ever have to experience.</p><p>Elena glanced up, as if she\u2019d heard something he wasn\u2019t aware of betraying. \u201cYou\u2019re still worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike Dmitri,\u201d he said, releasing her to walk to the very edge of the balcony, his mind filled with images of a young angel with wings of lush black who had barely spoken when Raphael first met him, \u201cJason has never been in danger of becoming jaded.\u201d</p><p>Having come to stand beside him, her wing brushing his in an intimacy he\u2019d accept from no other, Elena said, \u201cYou think that\u2019s changing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. The reason Dmitri became so jaded was that he tasted every sin, drowned himself in sensation.\u201d The endless round of pleasure and pain had been an effort to escape a loss that had brutalized the other man, but the end result was a kind of emotional numbness Raphael had thought nothing would ever break, much less a mortal with a fractured spirit.</p><p>\u201cJason by contrast,\u201d he continued, \u201cimmerses himself in nothing.\u201d Raphael had known him too long not to realize that even the lovers Jason took touched nothing of him beyond his skin.</p><p>Elena blew out a quiet breath. \u201cHe\u2019s like that all the time, isn\u2019t he? Part of the world . . . but apart. A shadow who never becomes too involved.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael had no need to voice agreement, because it was the truth. His spymaster might not be jaded, but he was numb in a far deeper sense. \u201cTo survive eternity,\u201d he murmured, \u201cJason needs to find some reason to exist beyond duty and loyalty.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the face of the woman who was his own reason for being, who made immortality seem an iridescent promise rather than an endless road. \u201cSuch things are powerful and not to be dismissed lightly . . . but they are not enough to thaw a heart that has been encased in ice for near to seven hundred years.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Jason looked out through a window of the palace that was his residence for the time being, his attention on the small enclosed garden on the mountain side of Mahiya\u2019s palace. It was a spot he\u2019d had to cross the center of the house to see, and one the princess had made no effort to point out to him when she\u2019d shown him to his suite. He could see why.</p> <p>Unlike the structured courtyard behind him, this hidden area, tucked between the palace and the high defensive wall that protected the fort, appeared to have been set up as a pleasure garden long ago, complete with irrigation channels that kept the wildly blooming plants luxuriant in spite of the desert sun, then forgotten, allowed to run wild.</p><p>The exquisite tiles visible on the winding pathways between the garden beds told him it had been designed by someone who expected to spend a great deal of time within its environs . . . or perhaps expected someone else to do so, someone about whom they cared enough to create a concealed paradise.</p><p>Eris.</p><p>His mind made the connection it had been seeking\u2014the tiles echoed those he\u2019d seen on the steps of Eris\u2019s palace. So perhaps this palace had originally been meant to be Eris\u2019s prison, the garden his private area. Except Eris had attempted to use his time outdoors to escape, quite possibly from this very garden, thus losing even that modicum of freedom.</p><p>He made a mental note to follow up his theory with the woman who walked the pathways of the wild garden now. She looked up at that moment, and though he was cloaked in the shadows, a faint tension invaded her spine beneath the ice green of her tunic.</p> <p>The hemline of the fitted garment reached an inch above the knee, the splits to mid-thigh on both sides allowing freedom of movement but remaining modest, as the tunic was worn over tapered pants of a fine cotton that hugged her legs. Dark blue, the pants echoed the thick blue border on the ends of her elbow-length sleeves and along the bottom of the tunic.</p><p>Though styles varied, the pants sometimes loose and sometimes tight; the tunics high-necked or scooped, flaring out in a full skirt or cut neatly to the body; and most often worn with a long, gauzy scarf, it was attire he\u2019d seen many a time in this land, as common on laborers and servants as it was on courtiers. The difference was in the fabrics, the cut, and the depth of embellishment. It wasn\u2019t unusual to see one of the court butterflies in a piece hand beaded with tiny pearls or where the embroidery had been created using fine threads of pure silver and gold.</p><p>Mahiya wore lightweight silk, but though the tunic followed the shape of her body, it bore no sparkle, no embroidery. The neck was a shallow scoop that offered a bare glimpse of her shoulder bones, her golden brown skin glowing in the morning sunlight, her hair glinting with hidden strands of red where it hung in a simple, loose braid that reached the center of her back.</p><p>Armor, he thought, Mahiya used formal clothing as armor, and he\u2019d found her stripped of it. Taking advantage, he made certain he was waiting for her on the lower level when she reentered the palace.</p><p>\u201cHave you broken your fast?\u201d he asked, caught by the way a ray of sunlight lit up the tawny brown of her eyes to even more startling intensity.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She betrayed no surprise or hesitation at his presence, as if she\u2019d realized his purpose and used the time between his sighting of her and their meeting to put on her emotional armor, if not the clothing that served the same function. \u201cOne does not leave a guest to dine alone . . . my lord.\u201d</p> <p>Pretty words that meant nothing. \u201cMy name is Jason,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never been a lord nor do I wish to be one in any sense.\u201d</p><p>A blink. \u201cI cannot use your given name.\u201d</p><p>Jason considered the cultural mores of the land where he stood, layered them over the short period of his association with Mahiya, her status as a princess, as well as the unspoken rules of Neha\u2019s court, and understood that for her to use his name in public would breach a barrier, leading others to believe the ritual of the blood vow had segued into a far more intimate relationship. \u201cIn private, then, I am Jason.\u201d</p><p>An incline of her head, followed by a graceful wave as she led him into a sunny room that overlooked the main courtyard. The polished wooden table within, of a size meant to accommodate six, was already set with breakfast\u2014the places situated across from one another. \u201cThere are no servants in this palace except for those who come in once a week to clean,\u201d she said, picking up the elegant silver teapot to pour him a cup after they\u2019d both taken their seats. \u201cHowever, I can have someone assigned to you should you wish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took a sip of the sweet tea rich with milk and spices, and returned the cup to the table, intending to pour himself a glass of water.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s eyes flicked up from where she\u2019d been putting food on a plate. \u201cIt is not to your liking?\u201d Before he could answer, she rose and disappeared through a small door, to return with another pot only minutes later. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll prefer this.\u201d</p><p>The pure taste of fine black tea touched his mouth when he lifted the cup to his lips, the leaves no doubt sourced from the plantations in Neha\u2019s territory. \u201cThank you.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell Mahiya not to serve him, because it told him something else about her that she put down the plate she\u2019d been making to create another one\u2014one much more suited to his tastes, her decision based on nothing but his preference when it came to tea.</p><p>A smart woman with many facets . . . who preferred to give an impression otherwise.</p> <p>Serving herself after passing across his plate, she said, \u201cYou wake early.\u201d A penetrating look. \u201cOr you do not sleep. Did you, perhaps, fly all the hours before dawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mortal.\u201d Angels weren\u2019t immune to the need for sleep, but the older they became, the less they needed. Jason slept perhaps two nights out of a month, and it was enough to maintain his strength. \u201cHowever, you need more sleep than you\u2019ve been getting.\u201d Faint bruises marred the skin under her eyes, bruises that couldn\u2019t be accounted for by a single night without sleep.</p><p>A genuinely startled look before her lashes veiled her expression. \u201cI wake when you wake, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>It was no victory, he thought, the capitulation as meaningless as any of the other pretty words she said to him. This was not the woman who had talked of garrotes and offered to search a room for a hooked needle, shields of polite courteousness having risen to hide the truth of her in the hours since he\u2019d flown into the vanishing night. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, deciding to use not brute force to get past those shields, but rather a subtle enticement to the inquisitive nature she\u2019d earlier betrayed, \u201cabout Eris\u2019s guards.\u201d</p><p>Putting down her tea, she began to speak, her tone one that said she\u2019d expected the question\u2014which meant she had also worked out why he might need the information. It turned out there were twelve guards in total, a unit whose sole task it was to \u201cprotect\u201d Eris by keeping him in his palace. \u201cThe unit is composed of highly trained angels, no vampires.\u201d</p><p>A winged guard made sense for a prisoner capable of taking flight. \u201cWho do you believe killed Eris?\u201d</p><p>Another flash of surprise. This one, she made no attempt to hide, and he understood something else about the princess\u2014she was unused to having her opinions solicited, much less listened to with the respect they no doubt deserved. No one saw more than a person others dismissed as beneath their notice. It was why Jason placed so many of his spies among servants.</p><p>However, Mahiya was not a servant, and he didn\u2019t know her well enough to judge whether or not she played a very clever game with him, her \u201ctrue\u201d face as false as the obvious facade. Only one thing was for certain: Princess Mahiya, with the blade-pins even now hidden in her hair, had just become an even more fascinating creature to his spymaster\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t my place to say\u201d was her smiling response to his question now, the self-deprecation in her tone so natural, most would have accepted it at face value. \u201cI have none of your experience.\u201d</p><p>Jason was used to waiting hours, days, weeks if he had to, to unearth a single truth. \u201cI would see the rest of the fort,\u201d he said, permitting her to believe he\u2019d accepted her carefully calculated nonanswer.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Breakfast finished, she quickly cleared the table, then led him outside. \u201cThe fort is too big to walk\u2014I can give you an overview as we fly, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, show me directly to the area utilized for the formal court.\u201d He would not make himself a target against the painful blue of the sky. Neha had no reason to shoot him out of it, but Neha was also an archangel. The only one of the Cadre Jason trusted was Raphael.</p><p>Mahiya hesitated. \u201cIf you will give me a moment, I must return to my rooms. My lady will be displeased to see me thus in the main court.\u201d</p><p>When Jason nodded, Mahiya knew she was trapped. She\u2019d have to leave the spymaster on his own while she changed, giving him a chance to throw her off once more\u2014but going as she was, was not an option. Neha would deem it an insult, and attracting the archangel\u2019s attention would be a very stupid move on her part at this stage of the plan. No matter what it cost her, she must swallow her pride, bite her tongue, bow her head, whatever it took to survive just awhile longer.</p><p>Thanking Jason for his forbearance, she walked upstairs and quickly undid the small row of hooks at her ankles that fastened the tapered cotton of her pants. Many of the younger generation in the city preferred to wear tight jeans below the tunics, but Neha was an archangel of old, preferred an adherence to tradition within the fort.</p><p>The buttons that closed the wing slits gave her a frustrating moment when they refused to open, but she managed to get them undone and shrugged the tunic to the floor. That done, she picked up not a sari, but another tunic set. Jason was apt to take to the skies at some point, and much as Mahiya appreciated the grace a sari bestowed a woman, it didn\u2019t make for the most appropriate flight wear.</p><p>Of a soft yellow fabric heavily embroidered with white flowers set with tiny mirrors in their centers, the tunic was formal without breaching the mourning etiquette in force since Anoushka\u2019s death. The fine cotton pants that hugged her legs were a contrasting white, as was the long scarf she folded lengthwise and placed over her left shoulder, attaching it to the tunic with a brooch from the jewels available for her to use but that belonged to the fort Treasury.</p><p>Her hair was easy enough\u2014she pulled it back into a neat knot at the nape of her neck, anchoring it with the high-quality blade-pins she\u2019d managed to buy from a traveling tinker without anyone being the wiser, bartering a richly embellished sari in exchange. The tinker believed he\u2019d gotten the better of their bargain, but the pins had given Mahiya a priceless sense of safety in the darkness, a constant reminder that she wasn\u2019t a broken, crushed creature, but a woman willing to fight for her right to live, to exist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face, she left untouched. Her eyes already attracted too much attention\u2014she wanted no more.</p><p>\u201cSuch pretty eyes you have.\u201d</p><p>A half-grown child, Mahiya didn\u2019t know why the words made her sick to her stomach. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile from the archangel who she\u2019d been told was her aunt. \u201cThey are your grandfather\u2019s eyes. The line, it seems, breeds true.\u201d</p> <p>Shrugging off the chill of the memory, she slid her feet into flat slippers, her toes fitting perfectly into the crystal-studded leather, the strap around her ankle similarly bejeweled. No one could ever say Neha didn\u2019t give the child she\u2019d \u201cadopted\u201d every luxury.</p><p>Less than seven minutes after she\u2019d come upstairs, she ran back down\u2014to find Jason standing in front of the courtyard pavilion, his hands behind his back and his attention on the palace that had been Eris\u2019s prison. Relief had her releasing the breath she hadn\u2019t been aware of holding.</p><p>He didn\u2019t fit here, she thought, caught by the starkly masculine beauty of him as she walked to the pavilion. He was too untamed a thing for the polished elegance and polite rules of Neha\u2019s kingdom. From the wildness of the tattoo that covered the left side of his face, to the implacable black of his wings and the clean lines of his clothing\u2014simple black pants, a shirt in the same dark shade, black boots, no jewelry\u2014everything about Jason screamed that he was a man, an angel, who made his own way, forged his own path.</p><p>He might offer Neha his respect, but he would never worship her as a demigoddess, Mahiya thought, her eyes going to the hair in its neat queue at the nape of his neck . . . which was when she noticed he wore a sword in a black sheath along the centerline of his spine, the straps merging into the black of his shirt. \u201cNeha does not allow weapons in her formal court but for the guard.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes locked with her own, and though she knew it for an illusion, it felt as if he was stripping her down to the soul, seeing things she\u2019d never shared with another living being. \u201cNeha,\u201d he said, \u201cunderstands how I work.\u201d</p> <p>Mahiya doubted very much if anyone understood the spymaster in truth, but she gave a small nod, taking the opportunity to end the disturbing eye contact. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>Jason said nothing as they left the courtyard, his silence so profound she knew it must be a part of him, not something created to unsettle her. Strangely enough, she didn\u2019t find it disquieting in the least\u2014Jason\u2019s silence was an honest thing, unlike the lies that came out of so many other mouths. \u201cWe\u2019ll find my lady in the public audience chamber.\u201d</p><p>Neha was always available on this day to those of her land who would speak directly to her, a paradoxically fair queen whether the constituent was an aristocrat or a farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s early enough that we may be able to see her unhindered,\u201d she added as they walked through an intricately painted gate large enough for several elephants to pass through side by side.</p><p>The fort was alive and awake, and Mahiya nodded hello to any number of people. The women were all dressed in soft shades rather than the intense reds, yellows, and blues normally favored in this region, but styles varied dramatically. A number wore day gowns, several vampires neat suits that said they had business outside the fort, while still others wore plain work saris. Then there were those dressed in the uniform of the guard, complete with weapons\u2014Neha did not discriminate when it came to skill and ability.</p><p>Everyone looked to Jason for an introduction, but Mahiya ignored the unspoken requests and continued on her way, well aware he wasn\u2019t a man who would play the polite games of court. She was glad to get out of the thoroughfare when they reached the public audience hall, which was in actuality a large stone pavilion open on three sides. Six rows of seven columns marched across the floor, holding up the curved roof and, above it, a large terrace.</p><p>Neha usually addressed her supplicants from the high throne already set in place, but it stood empty at present. Instead of petitioning the guard standing in front of the door Mahiya knew opened into a staircase that led up to the terrace, she stepped out and flew upward, her wings aching under the strain of the vertical takeoff. Jason, of course, had no such trouble and landed on the terrace before her.</p> <p>Her instinct proved right\u2014Neha stood at the edge where the original lattice wall had been removed to provide an uninterrupted view. Her eyes were on the mountains, the hills a golden brown in the early morning light, the greenery sparse.</p><p>\u201cHis funeral pyre blazes tomorrow,\u201d she said as Mahiya reached her. \u201cYou will not wear white. No one will wear white.\u201d</p><p>It was no loss to Mahiya not to wear the color of mourning\u2014Eris had been less a father to her than a tomcat was to his kittens. As for Neha\u2019s own motivations, the archangel alone knew the truth, but Mahiya had seen her beside Eris\u2019s butchered body, heard her distraught keening. No matter what she tried to portray in her pride, the same pride that meant Eris spent three centuries as a prisoner, Neha mourned.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d she said, a sympathy within her that she didn\u2019t attempt to crush out of existence. Her continued ability to feel for the hurt suffered by another being\u2014especially when that being was the archangel who saw in her only an endless vengeance\u2014was part of who she was, a tenderness of heart she\u2019d nurtured with fierce devotion even when it would\u2019ve been easier to have acquired a carapace of hardness nothing could penetrate.</p><p>Neha turned to face Jason, dismissing Mahiya as another person might an insect. \u201cWhat have you discovered, Spymaster?\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cEris\u2019s palace might have been well guarded,\u201d Jason said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t impregnable.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s lips curved in a humorless smile. \u201cOnly those without care for their lives would\u2019ve broken the rules. Do you tell me there was more than one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can tell you nothing yet.\u201d Jason held Neha\u2019s gaze in a way Mahiya had seen no one in the court dare, not even the archangel\u2019s most trusted advisors.</p><p>Her stomach tensed at the risk he was taking. Though he was a stranger with no call on her loyalty, Mahiya found she did not want Jason bloodied. It would be a desecration of a beautiful, wild creature who should never be caged or broken.</p><p>However, Neha laughed, an appreciative glint in her eye. \u201cAll seven of you, so arrogant.\u201d</p><p>Sensing that she was missing something important, but unable to work out what, Mahiya fell into step behind Neha and Jason as they walked. Neha\u2019s almost wholly ice white wings were a stark contrast to Jason\u2019s black, as was the shimmering coral of the archangel\u2019s simple but exquisitely cut gown.</p><p>\u201cHow is Dmitri?\u201d Neha now asked, the edge in her voice sharp as a scalpel.</p><p>Jason\u2019s reply was unexpected. \u201cHave you still not forgiven him for returning to Raphael?\u201d</p><p>Neha laughed again, the gleaming blade transmuted into the first real amusement Mahiya had heard from her since Anoushka\u2019s execution. \u201cI thought the two feral pups deserved one another, and I was right, was I not?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, she added, \u201cHe should, however, have invited me to his wedding,\u201d the words holding a dangerous politeness.</p><p>\u201cYes, he should have, but a vampire from your court did attempt to kill him only days past.\u201d</p><p>Neha raised her head, her smile as cold as the blood of the cobra curled up in a basket in one corner of the terrace. \u201cDoes he believe I would hide behind one such as Kallistos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Jason said, \u201cDmitri has always liked you better than most of the rest of the Cadre\u2014but, and regardless of the brief truce born of my presence here, you and Raphael are not the best of friends at present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying politics, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good at it.\u201d</p><p>A small silence. \u201cOf course you are.\u201d The anger was replaced by cool approval. \u201cA spymaster who could not understand the nuances would be useless.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t say anything in response to that self-evident truth. What he did say was, \u201cWhen Dmitri discovered why I came to your territory, he asked me to convey his sympathy. He says he will always remember Eris as a swordsman who was a welcome sparring opponent.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had seen Eris dance with a blade within the confines of his palace, the grace of it dazzling. Once, she had even seen Neha and Eris together in the courtyard, their swords and bodies moving with a harmony that\u2014for a single piercing moment\u2014made it painfully clear how the two could\u2019ve fallen in love.</p><p>\u201cI had forgotten,\u201d Neha murmured, \u201cthat Dmitri and Eris had that in common. Two such different men connected by the blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also charged me to ask if you would welcome him and his bride once you are receiving guests again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he spoke so prettily, I would be most astonished,\u201d Neha said, but Mahiya could tell she was pleased by the request, for the leader of the Seven was meant to be a cynical, hard-hearted bastard who trusted no one. Yet he respected Neha\u2019s honor enough to bring into her territory the woman he\u2019d made his wife.</p><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d the archangel said, \u201cthat I will not be displeased if he and his wife should pay their respects. My quarrel is with Raphael, not Dmitri.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cI will pass on the message. Do I keep you from your people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Neha shook her head and stepped a wing-length away. \u201cI have postponed the public audience. You will escort me to Guardian where I plan to remain overnight with Eris.\u201d</p><p>Wings spread, she executed a flawless vertical takeoff, Jason rising at her side. Mahiya was slower, found herself lagging behind, but she made no effort to catch up, her stomach lurching at the thought of being at Guardian. Instead, she let her eyes linger on the gentle bustle of the city below. It had had another name once, but after so many centuries in the shadow of Archangel Fort, it had become Archangel City.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the city reflected Neha\u2019s tastes. Though\u2014aside from the residences of powerful vampires or angels who lived outside the fort\u2014the buildings were mostly small and single leveled; they were graceful structures of stone that had withstood the march of time. Like any city, Archangel had narrow alleys as well as wider thoroughfares, but nothing was broken or ugly, dirty or derelict, the water in the lake running clear and so fresh it was drinkable.</p><p>On Mahiya\u2019s other side, hugging a natural ridgeline, sprawled the fort, and it too bore the stamp of its mistress. Guardian Fort was modest in comparison. It was also connected to the main fort by subterranean passages men had apparently died to keep secret\u2014Mahiya only knew about them because Eris had let something slip on one of the rare occasions when he\u2019d drowned his rage in a bottle.</p><p>\u201cInstead of attempting flight, I should have waited for my opportunity and used the tunnels!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTunnels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Guardian, you stupid girl!\u201d</p><p>Eris had refused to say anything further on the topic, but she\u2019d managed to get Vanhi to confirm the existence of the tunnels. However, the vampire, with her maternal ways, had known of only one entrance\u2014inside the Palace of Jewels, a location that might as well be on the moon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In front of Mahiya, Neha and Jason circled the higher fort, and she was struck by the span of Jason\u2019s wings, by the clean efficiency of his flight technique, not a motion wasted. He wasn\u2019t a man she ever wanted after her in the sky\u2014escape would be impossible.</p><p>Putting on a burst of speed, she came in below them to land in Neha\u2019s private courtyard within the fort that made a chill bead of sweat roll down her spine even now. However, that wasn\u2019t the reason for her descent: It would not do for her to rise higher than the archangel\u2014that lesson she\u2019d learned on the fateful day a hundred years after her birth, when she\u2019d officially crossed the line into adulthood and lost the protection afforded by Neha\u2019s unwillingness to harm the young.</p><p>The lesson had been a brutal one, the Master of the Guard instructed to strip her back of skin. Mahiya had long understood she lived on Neha\u2019s sufferance, having learned the truth from a nanny who thought she should know her place in the scheme of things, the gift of knowledge a rough kindness.</p><p>\u201cNever forget that nothing you do will ever please her. To her, you are not a child to be protected, but a constant reminder of a betrayal that humiliated an archangel. Focus on survival.\u201d</p> <p>As she\u2019d hung from the whipping post, blood trickling down her back, Mahiya had understood something else. That Neha wanted to break her until she was a living warning on the price of disloyalty. Enough people knew the unspoken secret of Mahiya\u2019s heritage that the warning would be understood.</p><p>I will survive and I will survive whole.</p><p>The vow was one she\u2019d made even as the whip fell again and again. And it was one she had kept, refusing to let Neha twist her into an ugly mirror of Neha\u2019s own hatred. Allowing the archangel to believe she\u2019d succeeded in cowing Mahiya was a strategic move on the chessboard that cost her nothing but pride . . . and pride was a useless tool in the fight for her very existence.</p><p>Jason landed after Neha, but that was to be expected\u2014he was clearly acting as her guard in this moment. He ignored Mahiya\u2019s presence, sparing her not so much as a glance.</p><p>Something foul bubbled in her stomach, and she knew herself for the most pathetic kind of fool. What had she expected? That he\u2019d continue to treat her with that inexplicable, alluring respect after it became clear exactly how little she mattered to Neha?</p> <p>\u201cJason.\u201d Neha inclined her head in regal acknowledgment before entering the palace she used while at Guardian, ready to begin her vigil by Eris\u2019s lifeless body.</p><p>Swallowing the anger within her that could ruin everything, Mahiya said, \u201cDo you wish to return to Archangel Fort?\u201d</p><p>A nod, and he rose again, in a burst of blinding speed.</p><p>Her heart leaped into her throat. He was faster than Neha. Her own rise felt childish and painful by comparison, but she got airborne and made her way to the fort through the crystalline blue skies while Jason went so high he wasn\u2019t even a dot in the distance, reappearing at the last minute to arrow down to a clean landing in front of her\u2014their\u2014palace. The area appeared deserted, the guards having decamped after removing Eris\u2019s body.</p><p>Jason folded back his wings, waited for her to do the same. Then he turned to her. \u201cDo you not,\u201d he said in a tone calm and measured, \u201chave enough respect for yourself to not allow Neha to treat you like something scraped off the bottom of her shoe?\u201d</p><p>The shock of the unexpected blow was so absolute, it felt as if he\u2019d punched a fist into her rib cage, crumpling her bones inward where they ripped and tore and made her bleed.</p> <p>Jason realized he\u2019d made a mistake the instant after he spoke, as Mahiya\u2019s face paled to a sickening shade, her breath jagged. It had been a long time since he\u2019d spoken without thought, and he knew he\u2019d allowed his anger at Mahiya\u2019s acceptance of the treatment meted out to her by Neha to color his thinking.</p><p>Shifting a fraction closer, he spread his wings as if stretching them. \u201cWe are watched.\u201d He made his tone a whip. \u201cDo not break.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the harsh order, and then it was as if a rod of steel had been thrust through her spine, her tawny eyes wild with fury. \u201cA test, spymaster? If so, I failed.\u201d</p><p>So at last, I see you again, Mahiya. \u201cI could have spoken with more care, but that would not change the heart of my question.\u201d</p><p>Her fury now tightly controlled, she walked not into the privacy of the palace, but through the delineated pathways of the courtyard garden, the area bright with lush blooms that mocked the desert climate, the water running down the sides of the pavilion offering a cooling wash of air. \u201cAm I meant to thank you for calling me a spineless coward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his own anger far more tempered but no less dangerous. \u201cBut you must know that weakness, real or feigned, only incites predators.\u201d And the archangels were the alpha predators on the planet. \u201cNeha appreciates those who stand up to her\u2014you have the strength to do so.\u201d She was no more spineless than he was stupid. \u201cYou have no reason to play dead.\u201d</p><p>A wash of dark red across her cheekbones, her hands fisting. \u201cDon\u2019t think to know me or my life on the basis of a day\u2019s enforced intimacy, my lord.\u201d Turning away from the garden with those cold words, she led him through a doorway into the cool rooms within the fort, heading downward until he thought they must be on the level that housed the Palace of Jewels.</p><p>They exchanged no further words until she halted by a set of doors decorated with the familiar motif of slender vases, the carvings inset with agate and what looked to be green tourmaline. The doors stood ajar, but the angle meant he and Mahiya were yet concealed from the view of the people within. He took advantage of that to study the room and its inhabitants.</p> <p>Spacious and relatively free of furniture, the room opened out onto a wide balcony, sunlight slanting in through there as well as through the tiny squares of the lattice window to the right. The illumination was bright but not hard, gilding the angels and vampires who stood talking and laughing in pairs or small groupings, all dressed in rich fabrics that sparkled and glittered, diamonds like drops of ice in their hair and their ears.</p><p>\u201cCourtiers,\u201d Mahiya said, her tone frigid. \u201cA private brunch where they can display their finery without offence to Neha. I can make the introductions.\u201d</p><p>Refusing the offer with a shake of his head, he walked a few feet to the right\u2014to a door that, as he\u2019d hoped, led directly to a balcony that paralleled the room of courtiers. Even better for his purpose, it was small, unconnected to the wider balcony he\u2019d observed at the end of the room. Walking out, he leaned against the sun-warmed stone beside the lattice window and settled in to listen, darkly conscious of Mahiya\u2019s silent presence by his side.</p><p>As she\u2019d been silent in Neha\u2019s presence.</p><p>His renewed anger at her behavior was visceral, a raw, bubbling thing. After near to seven hundred years of living with memories that had never faded, he knew the cause of his turbulent response, knew his fury was fed by the memory of another woman who hadn\u2019t fought the violence meted out to her.</p><p>\u201cHe cannot help it, Jason. A terrible darkness has taken hold of his heart . . . but we can bring him back. We just have to love him.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s treatment of Mahiya was nothing so obvious as a physical blow, but it was as effective a weapon in erasing her personality.</p><p>\u201c. . . rumors he had a lover.\u201d</p><p>Clamping down on his anger, Jason focused on the voices.</p><p>\u201cRidiculous. Who would chance execution for something as tawdry as sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKomal might. You know how angry she has been since Neha banished that vampire she intended to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKomal is a silly girl, but she isn\u2019t suicidal.\u201d</p><p>Jason listened for almost an hour, but heard nothing else as explosive as that short conversation. \u201cWho is Komal?\u201d he asked Mahiya once they were well away from the room.</p><p>\u201cA vampire who has been part of the inner court for half a century. Her beauty is considerable, and she\u2019s adept at using it to manipulate men. I think she doesn\u2019t quite understand that Neha is not as susceptible.\u201d A glance that wasn\u2019t as circumspect as he\u2019d come to expect from her, the frost yet present in the tawny brown depths. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to her if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jason felt his own simmering anger spark in response, knew she\u2019d sensed it when she jerked away her head and strode the corridor, her demure demeanor forgotten. Though she could not have meant it to do so, the show of temper soothed his own.</p><p>\u201cThere she is.\u201d Mahiya indicated a woman walking along one of the open hallways that overlooked the cityscape.</p><p>Komal proved to be exactly as described\u2014a sensual invitation with her raven hair and red lips, honey gold skin and dangerous curves. A woman on whom vampirism had bestowed its exotic kiss, and one who was spoiled to the extent that she pouted when Jason didn\u2019t immediately fall at her feet. \u201cWe both know the mouse isn\u2019t going to satisfy you,\u201d she purred with venomous sweetness. \u201cI promise to show you pleasures you\u2019ve never tasted.\u201d</p><p>Jason stared at the hand she\u2019d raised as if to touch him until she paled, dropped it, before shifting his gaze to lush brown eyes that had no doubt led many a man to hell. \u201cWere you happy to oblige Eris, too?\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>Pure, unmitigated panic. \u201cWho has started that rumor?\u201d It was a whispered hiss as she looked around for anyone who might overhear. \u201cNeha will execute me if it reaches her ears. God, she\u2019ll probably torture me first, keep me alive for years.\u201d</p><p>Jason said nothing, watched her turn to Mahiya, her fangs flashing. \u201cTell me, or I\u2019ll have you whipped again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, Komal,\u201d Mahiya said in a tone cool with warning, \u201cI\u2019d forget about making trouble and stay out of sight for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Paling even further, the vampire turned and ran off inside, her figure-hugging gown dragging along the gray stone used in this part of the fort. Jason let her go, certain she had neither been, nor had any knowledge of, Eris\u2019s illicit lover. Her shaken response to the accusation and nasty nature aside, Komal wasn\u2019t smart enough to have pulled off such an intrigue. She\u2019d have boasted to someone, been caught long ago.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you whipped?\u201d he asked the far more complex, intelligent woman by his side.</p><p>No hitch in Mahiya\u2019s stride. \u201cWhich time?\u201d</p><p>His nails dug into his palm. \u201cThe last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was disrespectful to a high-level courtier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he worth respect?\u201d</p><p>Unsurprised at the question from this male who didn\u2019t follow any of the rules of accepted behavior and who\u2019d incited a rage in her that had made her forget herself to a dangerous extent, Mahiya said, \u201cNo.\u201d Pointless to lie to him now.</p><p>\u201cThen the whipping was worth it.\u201d</p><p>It was a strange sensation, being totally liberated of the need to conceal her true thoughts. As if she were drunk. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her fury still cold enough to burn, \u201cbecause after I was beaten and weak, he received what he wanted.\u201d Mahiya had had to prostrate herself at his feet, beg for forgiveness for the slight she\u2019d done him. Only her stubborn refusal to become anything like Neha had kept her from stewing in the bitterness and hate that had sought to bloom in her that day. \u201cI learned to choose my battles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason\u2019s eyes, so very dark\u2014like the finest chocolate, rich and decadent\u2014lingered on her for a long, endless moment before he gave a small nod. \u201cSo long as you continue to fight.\u201d</p><p>Anger surged through her veins once more, until it took everything she had to bite out an outwardly civil response. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>A motionless pause that reminded her she was taunting a man so lethal, he met the eyes of an archangel without flinching. Then he said, \u201cI apologize. I do not know anything of the battles you\u2019ve already fought or the choices you\u2019ve had to make to survive.\u201d</p><p>No man had ever apologized to her, and hearing it from this man shook her enough that she didn\u2019t say a word when he turned and began to walk the pathways of the fort, leading rather than being led. She knew he heard more than she did, saw more than she did, though she walked beside him.</p> <p>He was beyond fascinating.</p><p>Dangerous and unpredictable and frighteningly intelligent. A threat. And yet she wanted to run her finger over the blade of him even if it made her bleed, wanted to dance too close to the flame, wanted to take a risk that could destroy her.</p><p>Her gaze went to the pitch-black of his wings, her fingers aching to explore, as if her silent admission of just how much he drew her had opened a doorway she hadn\u2019t been aware of locking. Except\u2014</p><p>Her eyes skated past him, though she knew he was right there.</p><p>Snapping back to full alertness, she realized most of the guards didn\u2019t even notice his presence, though they all greeted her with curt nods. Watching him with a focus that caused a dull headache to throb behind her eyes, she saw the outline of him, but an instant later, he stepped into a shadow created by a spray of flowers high up on a wall and was gone.</p> <p>Unthinking, she reached out, her fingers brushing the edge of his wing, the feathers sleek and warm under her fingertips.</p><p>He froze, every muscle tense.</p><p>Heat flooded her cheeks, and she dropped her hand as she realized the altogether unacceptable nature of her behavior. \u201cI\u2019m sorry . . . but I couldn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good at remaining unseen.\u201d His voice held none of the displeasure she would have expected after witnessing the way he\u2019d warned Komal off from laying a finger on him. \u201cI\u2019ve had hundreds of years of practice.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him, but it didn\u2019t take a genius intellect to realize the spymaster would not tell her his secrets. \u201cAgain, I apologize.\u201d Her fingers continued to tingle from the fleeting contact. \u201cI had no right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you did,\u201d he said to her surprise, his tattoo a tactile temptation in the sunlight. \u201cI swore a blood vow to you. Skin and feathers are far closer to the surface than blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would never take advantage of the vow in such a fashion.\u201d Fisting her hand in resistance against the compulsion to commit an even worse breach by tracing the wild beauty of his facial markings, she turned her gaze forward and continued to walk. Her skin burned then went icy cold, her heart stuttered . . . and she realized that in spite of her deepening fascination with Raphael\u2019s spymaster, she was afraid.</p><p>Jason, with his quiet voice and watchful eyes, was infinitely more dangerous to her than Neha had ever been. He listened when she spoke, had already learned things about her no one else knew. Such a man wouldn\u2019t use his physical strength to overpower her, nor lies to trick her. He\u2019d just know her so well that he\u2019d get her to contribute to her own downfall.</p><p>Sweat dampening her palms, she realized too late they were headed for a part of the complex Neha would not want him in under any circumstance. \u201cWe can go no further in this direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis area is for Neha\u2019s private use, off-limits except by her invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Flaring out his wings with that suspiciously quick agreement, he made a vertical takeoff so fast that she had no hope of catching him.</p><p>Compelling . . . and deadly.</p><p>It was a truth she could not permit herself to forget, no matter the temptation to touch the blade. Too much was at risk\u2014her entire existence, her very life. Jason was a dream she\u2019d have to save for another life . . . but first, she had to make it out of this one alive.</p> <p>Losing him above the puffy white clouds that had crept across the sky, she returned her gaze to the pathway of red stone and to the small palace she\u2019d warned Jason not to enter. Neha was secluded at Guardian, would not return till morning. Jason had left Mahiya alone. She\u2019d have no better chance to grab the brass ring.</p><p>The trickle of sweat down her spine a chilled bead, she stepped forward.</p><p>None of the guards attempted to stop her\u2014Neha often called her in when she wanted something done. But then, Mahiya only ever entered the front rooms. Today, taking advantage of the fact that no guards were permitted within, she continued down the corridor and toward the room at the very center of the palace, a room within which she could sense things that made her hindbrain skitter in warning, jibbering at her to run!</p><p>Mahiya wrenched the primal urge under control. This wasn\u2019t her first foray into the forbidden section. The last time had been in the depths of the night, while Neha was actually inside the room at the center. It had taken gut-clenching courage and grim determination, her heart pulsing in her mouth with every jagged breath. What she\u2019d seen that night had been disturbing, but the discovery hadn\u2019t been enough to complete her plan.</p><p>Today, the smooth marble walls weren\u2019t encrusted with ice, her breath didn\u2019t fog the air, and her bones didn\u2019t hurt with the pain of extreme cold. Touching her fingers to the marble, she walked quickly and silently down the long final corridor, the door to the room within sight. It had been so hardened with ice the previous time, she hadn\u2019t been able to glean the handle.</p><p>Now, the knob shone bright gold. Mahiya went to put her hand on it, hesitated at the last instant. This was far too easy. Forcing patience, she hid herself in a small alcove while she considered the situation from every angle\u2014to discover what Neha was up to, she had to get inside that room, but getting inside that room might well mean her death. Because Neha was an archangel, with abilities both secret and overt.</p><p>Her most overt one was the way she could control and manipulate reptilian creatures of every kind. Like the golden vine snake wrapped around the doorknob. Mahiya\u2019s heart punched against her ribs as the creature flicked out its red tongue and she realized what she\u2019d taken for an ornate design was a living being.</p><p>A poisonous living being.</p><p>Because one of her more covert abilities was the fact that Neha could create poison glands in nonvenomous species. Touching that knob would have meant a bite that left Mahiya paralyzed and helpless for hours.</p><p>However, that was unlikely to be the only security feature, because while Neha was an angel of old, she was in no way blind to the benefits of modern technology. Now that Mahiya was thinking properly instead of being driven to act by the knowledge of how quickly her time was running out, she realized that even were the door unlocked, Neha would have set it with a silent alarm that alerted her to any trespass.</p><p>Once inside, would an intruder find the room unoccupied . . . or herself surrounded by hundreds of snakes irritated to hissing anger at being disturbed?</p><p>A hint of noise, a whisper.</p><p>Freezing, she hoped whoever it was\u2014a maid?\u2014had only entered to take care of something in the front rooms.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d said a tempered, familiar voice from the left of the alcove, \u201cyou seek to unearth Neha\u2019s secrets.\u201d</p><p>A bolt of terror hitting her bloodstream, she shifted into the light to face Jason. \u201cI came to get something I\u2019d forgotten,\u201d she said, then considered her empty hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>Near-black eyes watched her without blinking. \u201cYou\u2019re very good at lying, but I\u2019m even better at detecting it.\u201d Turning his attention to the closed door guarded by the vine snake, he looked at it for several careful seconds before shifting on his heel and saying, \u201cWe need to talk in privacy.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an invitation.</p><p>Mahiya would\u2019ve liked nothing better than to refuse the order, but if he mentioned this to Neha, she\u2019d be dead and nothing else would matter. Frustration, fear, and anger boiling a caustic brew in her veins, she followed him out into the light, blinking against the brightness . . . to find that he was no longer beside her.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do for Neha to learn that I\u2019d been in there,\u201d he said several minutes later, having rejoined her once she reached a more public area.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d Even as she spoke, she remembered all those guards simply not seeing him.</p><p>His only answer was to glance at her wings, ask, \u201cCan you do another vertical takeoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She was slow, not weak. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Rising into the sky, he held his position until she joined him, then swept out across the city, farther, until they were flying over villages where excited children ran and waved at them, and stacks of blue pottery sat ready to be decorated, while sleepy cattle dozed in a rare green pasture fed by a stream nearly concealed by tall grasses.</p><p>I will miss this.</p><p>It was a thought that made her heart ache with sorrow. This land of desert and color and hidden oases was all she\u2019d ever known. She couldn\u2019t imagine living in a place without rolling sand dunes, the sight of camels with their swaying walk as familiar as those of the regal elephants. Animals were treated with affection and care under rules Neha had set in place long ago, and many roamed over land set aside for them, as with the herd of camels below, their necks bent as they grazed.</p><p>A lone herder, her long skirt and hip-length tunic a sun bright yellow, looked up, raising her hand in a wave. Mahiya waved back, struck once more by Neha\u2019s many\u2014sometimes violently opposed\u2014aspects. She was a queen, could be cruel, but she was also beloved by her people for her generosity and fairness, the angels from her court welcome wherever they went.</p><p>Should Mahiya land in the village below, she would be received with warmth, given tea hot from the pot and savories fresh from the oven. There was fear in the populace, of course, but it wasn\u2019t crippling, simply a quiet acknowledgement that the immortals were stronger and more dangerous, that it was better to live peacefully with them, to serve when called than to rebel.</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t to one of those villages that Jason took her, but to a small, deserted field. Landing under the branches of a tree whose roots went deep enough that it thrived even when there were no rains, its light green leaves lacey and delicate, he folded back his wings, watched her come down. She felt graceless in comparison to his shadow silent descent, her wings rustling, her feet too heavy.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jason said when she\u2019d settled, \u201cwe will talk.\u201d</p><p>The desolate vista in front of her, the land lying fallow, was nonetheless home, and it gave her courage. \u201cWhat would you have me say?\u201d</p><p>Jason looked into Mahiya\u2019s eyes and saw a steely determination. She wasn\u2019t a woman who would easily break . . . and he was not a man who would ever shatter a woman\u2019s spirit. However, there were other ways of getting what he wanted\u2014and he didn\u2019t have time to play games. \u201cWe both know I hold the cards here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou swore a blood vow to me,\u201d she pointed out, though her skin had paled under the soft shade created by the fine leaves of the tree under which they stood. \u201cYou cannot cause me harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the words we spoke,\u201d he said, crushing his primal response to her refusal to surrender. \u201cI am charged only with unearthing Eris\u2019s murderer and protecting your family\u2019s interests as I do so. And it appears you have traitorous intent.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her jaw. \u201cWhat will you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on whether or not we can come to an accommodation.\u201d So long as he completed his task and discovered the identity of the killer, he was not bound to report everything he found to Neha.</p> <p>A hardened jaw, flinty eyes. \u201cAnd what is your price, my lord?\u201d</p><p>The last two words may as well have been an insult. \u201cTell me about that room,\u201d he said, his gaze dropping to lips thin with anger, \u201cabout what goes on within.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she grit out. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to get inside.\u201d</p><p>True enough, he thought, watching a face that was incredibly expressive if you took the time to learn the subtle movements that betrayed her every thought. And Jason had taken the time. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen something.\u201d</p><p>Her wings rustling restlessly, she blew out a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cIce. It coated the walls, covered the door. My breath frosted, and I could feel my blood beginning to freeze.\u201d She shivered. \u201cMy veins . . . they stood out against my skin, and when I pressed down, they felt hard.\u201d</p> <p>Angels were built for flight, and as such, did not feel the cold as mortals did. And what Mahiya was describing was a cold so terrible, it was an impossibility in this particular region. Yet, as far as he knew, Neha\u2019s archangelic abilities did not include the capacity to manipulate the elements.</p><p>\u201cWas Neha alone in the room?\u201d</p><p>The tiniest hesitation.</p><p>12</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her enter with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Very cleverly put, but Jason had been playing this game centuries longer than Mahiya. \u201cHave you heard her speaking to anyone while she\u2019s within?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I tell you everything,\u201d she said in a tone so resolute, it was granite, \u201cit won\u2019t matter if you betray me to Neha. The end result will be the same.\u201d</p><p>Jason considered why a princess might need to hoard dangerous knowledge. \u201cYou need a bargaining chip,\u201d he guessed. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d A hunted look in her eyes, the pupils vivid black against cat-bright irises. \u201cStripping me bare?\u201d</p><p>That look, it hit the part of him he preferred to pretend didn\u2019t exist, but he didn\u2019t back off, didn\u2019t soften. He needed to know who Mahiya had heard in that room with Neha, because if what he suspected was true, the world might yet drown in horror such as no one could imagine.</p><p>The princess twisted away to give him her back, her wings sweeping in graceful arches to the dusty earth, in direct contrast to the rigid stiffness of her spine. \u201cI\u2019m going to die soon if I don\u2019t find a way out.\u201d The words were as stark as the land that surrounded them. \u201cNeha will never voluntarily set me free to live my own life, and she no longer has any reason to keep me alive\u2014I was only ever useful as a means to torment Eris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as a surrogate to punish,\u201d Jason said, all of the pieces he\u2019d glimpsed coming together to form an ugly, twisted whole. \u201cWhere do you plan to go?\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel, showed him two empty palms. \u201cWhere can I go?\u201d Rippling anger in every word. \u201cI want only a life away from this prison of hate, be it in a hovel, but only another archangel can stand against Neha, so it must be one of the Cadre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLijuan is the closest.\u201d</p> <p>Blind terror racking her frame, so vicious and deep that he made the rarest of moves and reached out to touch her, squeezing her upper arm. \u201cMahiya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Lijuan.\u201d Her voice was hoarse, as if she\u2019d been screaming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve attempted it before,\u201d he guessed, the warmth of her skin lingering on his palm though the contact had been fleeting. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d There were a thousand horrors in Lijuan\u2019s court, a thousand nightmares given flesh and blood form.</p><p>Mahiya leaned back against the tree, her profile limned by the light that caught hints of sunset in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to have a conversation with a man who sees everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it\u2019s difficult to manipulate me into seeing what you want me to see.\u201d The truth was, his strength came not from how well he could read her, but from his acceptance of how much he might miss. Even when he\u2019d known someone for centuries, he was always conscious he\u2019d caught but a glimpse of the complex tapestry that was their inner life.</p><p>The woman in front of him had an intricate pattern to her heart and emotions he might never fathom, didn\u2019t have the ability to fathom. All he could do was watch for cues others took for granted, put those cues together to form a picture of her emotions. He knew that wasn\u2019t how the rest of the world did it, knew his inability to connect to those around him on that level was a lack in him.</p><p>It troubled him enough that he\u2019d spoken to Jessamy about it a century ago. The gentle teacher of angelic young had taken time to consider his question. \u201cI think,\u201d she\u2019d said at long last, \u201cyou have the capacity to feel with the same depth as any other immortal. Perhaps more.</p><p>\u201cYou have a heart so powerful, it scares me at times. And the way you keep your emotions under lock and key . . .\u201d An intent look. \u201cThe storm will break one day, of that I\u2019m certain. You\u2019ve never had reason to take the risk yet.\u201d She\u2019d given him a rueful smile. \u201cI know something about avoiding pain, so trust me when I say that.\u201d</p><p>Jason had the utmost respect for Jessamy, knew her words were no lie. Born with a malformed wing that meant solo flight was out of her grasp, she\u2019d suffered anguish such as Jason couldn\u2019t imagine. He would never discount it, never consider it less important than the forces that had shaped him, but he knew the way they had grown and developed was fundamentally different.</p><p>As he couldn\u2019t imagine what it was not to be able to touch the sky at will, Jessamy couldn\u2019t imagine what it was to be alone. Utterly, absolutely alone. Not for an hour, not for a day, not for a year. For decades.</p><p>Until he had forgotten how to speak, how to be a person.</p><p>That endless aloneness had withered something within him when he\u2019d still been a boy with wings too heavy for his body, and unlike Jessamy, he believed it to be a permanent loss. As irrevocable as the fact that the atoll where he\u2019d been born, where his mother had been buried, was gone, crushed by a massive quake caused by an underwater volcanic eruption. It was as if his parents had never existed, as if he\u2019d always carried this aloneness inside him.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Mahiya said into the silence, \u201cI\u2019m outclassed,\u201d having utilized the pause to paint on the mask of a woman who had grown up in a court\u2014where venom was most often delivered with a honey-sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cEnough games.\u201d Though the survivor in him admired her fierce will, he couldn\u2019t allow that to give her the upper hand. \u201cMake your decision and make it quickly.\u201d</p><p>A fine tremor silvered over her skin, and he knew that beneath her stubborn refusal to give in, she was afraid. Jason didn\u2019t like inciting fear in a woman. It brought back too many memories that would not fade no matter how many years passed, his hands tingling as if he\u2019d been pounding on a locked bedroom door in a futile attempt to get out, to stop what was happening beyond.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are mist\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie! I saw the way you looked at him!\u201d</p><p>The roar echoed through time, but haunted as he was, Jason had long learned to dance with his demons. He held his silence even when the quiet grew jagged with the sharp bite of Mahiya\u2019s fear, even when his every instinct snarled at him to destroy the thing that made her afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou need to give me something in return.\u201d Lines forming around soft lips, shoulders squared. \u201cI can\u2019t surrender the most valuable piece of information I have without gaining something equally valuable in return.\u201d</p><p>It was then that Jason understood this princess with her quiet grace had learned to use fear to strengthen herself rather than allowing it to crush her. Some unknown, hidden part of him felt a searing joy, the emotion raw and unexpected and so extreme, he had to use conscious effort to wrench it under control. Even then, it burned, the midnight flames licking at his veins.</p><p>\u201cIf your information is good,\u201d he said, thinking through his violent response to judge that she was willing to risk death to hold on to this final piece of information, \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Hope shot golden light across her face. \u201cWill he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jason would not bargain with lies and half-truths. \u201cNo archangel will start a war over you,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what secrets you possess.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya could feel herself beginning to fracture from the inside out. With a few words, Jason had just destroyed the single precious drop of hope she\u2019d cultivated through humiliation and hurt and a lifetime of knowing she lived on borrowed time. The worst thing was, he betrayed no emotion about any of it\u2014as if her life meant nothing. And this was the man she\u2019d wanted to touch, wanted to learn?</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d she said, clawing her way out of the abyss on a tower built of rage and pride and an agonizing sense of loss for something she had never possessed, \u201cwhat use is your promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA direct defection isn\u2019t the only way to get what you want.\u201d Jason\u2019s tone was harsher than she\u2019d ever heard it, his eyes so dark they were ebony. \u201cYou grew up in a court. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya blinked at his anger, her own emotions skewing sideways.</p><p>\u201cThe information,\u201d Jason demanded before she could unravel the tangled skein of her thoughts.</p><p>In the end, it wasn\u2019t a difficult choice. Because the cold, hard fact was that Jason was right\u2014it didn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d done nothing to warrant incarceration in this gilded prison. Neha was the ruler of this territory, had absolute authority over her citizens. If she wanted to torture Mahiya for an eon, that was her right.</p><p>As Jason had pointed out, no other archangel would step in and risk inciting a war for the knowledge Mahiya currently held. Therefore, it must be Jason. At least, he hadn\u2019t lied to her. Rather, he had a way of being too honest, stripping away illusion and hope. So she would throw the dice and hope he kept his end of the bargain.</p><p>\u201cLijuan,\u201d she said, her chest aching at the remembered sensation of the bone-chilling cold in the corridor that night. \u201cNo one saw her arrive, and no one saw her leave, but as she\u2019s no longer fully corporeal, that means nothing. I heard her speaking with Neha inside the room guarded by the vine snake\u2014and yes, I am certain. Her voice is distinctive.\u201d Screams, that was what lived in Lijuan\u2019s voice.</p><p>Jason was silent for a long, long time, the swirling curves and fine dots of the tattoo on his face stark in the sunlight. When he did speak, it was to say, \u201cI need you to find out if any of the women in the court\u2014high or low\u2014have gone missing. Focus on the ones who aren\u2019t at the center but at the edges.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Startled by the abrupt change of subject, she answered instinctively, \u201cThat should be easy enough to discover. The population inside the fort is tightly controlled.\u201d</p><p>Jason spread his wings, the darkness spilling off them, and she knew it for a sign of dismissal.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d she asked, wanting to grab hold of him, shake him, shatter the obsidian walls that kept him remote from the world. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d So easily, he\u2019d destroyed then forgotten her.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d He rose into the air.</p> <p>Teeth gritted, she pushed herself into a vertical takeoff, knowing the conversation was over. She could never catch him in the sky. Not only that, he was a spymaster. If he wanted to vanish, Mahiya was ill-equipped to keep track of him . . . and Neha had to know that. \u201cA game,\u201d she said through a throat raw with such rage that it threatened to blind. \u201cIt was a game from the start.\u201d Neha had set Mahiya up to fail, set her up to die.</p><p>13</p><p>Dmitri braced himself on one elbow and leaned down to kiss awake the woman in his bed, her silky skin warm. The fathomless green was yet hazy with sleep when her eyes fluttered open. \u201cIs it morning already?\u201d Fingers threading through his hair, she claimed a deeper kiss that reminded him he belonged to her, should he have forgotten. \u201cGood morning, husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, wife.\u201d He would never tire of saying that. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Honor\u2019s response was a husky laugh that wrapped around his heart. \u201cI do think you have an ulterior motive for that question.\u201d</p> <p>Since he\u2019d already tugged down the sheet to display the lush mounds of her breasts, that was a moot question. He caressed her with teasing strokes, in the mood to play with his wife, and when she kicked off the sheets in unhidden frustration, he moved in to settle between her legs.</p><p>Where he teased her some more.</p><p>With his fingers.</p><p>With his body.</p><p>With his mouth.</p><p>Honor arched under him on a soft gasp, her hands clenching in his hair hard enough that it hurt a little. It was an exquisite pain that could grow into an addiction\u2014the pain of her pleasure. Smiling, he rubbed his unshaven jaw against the soft skin of her inner thigh, alert for even the tiniest indication of distress, before prowling up a feminine form rippling with aftershocks of erotic ecstasy.</p> <p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d Only when she obeyed the quiet order did he push into her. Always, always he made certain she was with him every step of the way. Because Honor had been brutalized, and those scars wouldn\u2019t magically disappear in a week or even a year. They were an indelible part of her, but there was no need to make the damage any worse, something he\u2019d once done and would never again so much as chance\u2014he\u2019d carve out his own heart first.</p><p>\u201cDmitri.\u201d A throaty whisper, her lips on his neck, her fingers on his nape, caressing him, kissing him, just the way he liked.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the same as before, when he\u2019d been with Ingrede, and he didn\u2019t mourn that. No, he felt like the luckiest bastard on the planet. Because as Ingrede had loved the Dmitri he\u2019d been, Honor loved the Dmitri he\u2019d become. There was no horror or distaste in her at the darkness he carried within, nothing but an acceptance that told him he was home after centuries in the most barren wasteland.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he warned when she used her body to caress his cock, internal muscles utilized to painfully pleasurable effect. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to finish yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that tone in your voice.\u201d Biting gently at his jaw, she fell back on the bed and interlocked her wrists above her head. \u201cHere I am. With what new torment do you plan to torture me?\u201d</p><p>She was teasing him, the wench, her body a molten fist that squeezed and tempted. Another day, he might have played an erotic game with her, but having kept his wife awake to near dawn, he was feeling as satisfied as a well-fed cat this morning. \u201cA long, slow ride for you I think.\u201d He placed a hand on her breast. \u201cVery slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d Again, that playful light in her eyes. \u201cAnything but.\u201d</p><p>Kissing the smile from her lips and feeling the warmth of it travel through his own veins, he moved his body in a steady, deep rhythm that drew another shuddering wave of pleasure from Honor. Even as she cried out, her body locked possessively around him, he gave in to his own need and pierced the pulse in her neck for the merest taste.</p> <p>\u201cDmitri.\u201d A sigh of sensual delight, and then they were both tumbling into sensation lush and languid, limbs entangled and hearts fused.</p><p>Afterward, he soaped her body in the shower and helped her dry her hair. It wasn\u2019t the kind of tenderness he\u2019d have shown any other woman, had long believed he\u2019d lost the capacity for it\u2014but it made his bones hum in masculine satisfaction that she let him do what he would, her trust blinding. Kisses on his naked chest, her legs twining around his jean-clad ones as she sat on the counter bundled in a fluffy pink robe, she also made every attempt to distract him, and he laughed, threatened to punish her.</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they sat across from one another at the little round breakfast table in the villa on the outskirts of Tuscany that Raphael had gifted them on their wedding. With Michaela in accord with Raphael for the moment, and no one aware of where Dmitri and Honor planned to honeymoon, it was a safe enough location.</p><p>\u201cDmitri?\u201d</p><p>Catching the solemn note in her voice, he glanced up from where he was scanning through messages on his phone. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tower business could wait. Everything could wait. Honor came first.</p><p>She rose, walked around to lean against the table by his side, her fingers playing with strands of his damp hair. \u201cYou haven\u2019t brought up the change . . . to becoming a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Nudging aside the part in her robe, he placed his hand on the warmth of her thigh. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201d He\u2019d once thought to do exactly that, to push her into immortality before she could change her mind, but with the dawn had come the realization he could no more force this on Honor than he could hurt her.</p><p>\u201cI made my choice.\u201d Her tone reminded him she was a hunter, blooded and honed.</p><p>\u201cIt was a choice made in the aftermath of glory,\u201d he said, the emotions from that night vivid in his mind. \u201cI won\u2019t ever try to talk you out of it\u201d\u2014he wanted a thousand lifetimes with her\u2014\u201cbut I find I have just enough of a scrap of goodness inside me to not railroad you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, his wife with her heart that belonged to him, a gift beyond price. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here, that we\u2019re here.\u201d Sliding into his lap, she laid her head against the bare skin of his shoulder. \u201cI keep expecting it all to disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d That was a promise he\u2019d spill blood to keep. \u201cEternity or a single mortal lifetime, we\u2019ll walk the road together.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Having spent the remainder of the day listening unseen to courtiers and soldiers, mortals and vampires, angels young and old, Jason used the cloak of night to conceal himself as he flew over the fort. He was near certain of the identity of the person who had murdered Eris. However, he needed two further pieces of information\u2014Mahiya was currently attempting to gather one of those pieces in the trenches of Neha\u2019s court.</p><p>Sweeping down to land near the exquisite courtyard garden where the beautiful had gathered tonight ostensibly to share their sorrow, he allowed the pool of darkness he\u2019d chosen as his landing place to seep into him. Regardless of what some whispered, Jason couldn\u2019t create shadows from thin air, but he could extend and amplify the smallest tendrils of the dark until he simply didn\u2019t register in most people\u2019s vision, or if he did, it was as a ghost image caught out of the corner of the eye.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t always been so at home in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cHow can I be a night scout if I\u2019m afraid of the dark?\u201d His lower lip quivered as he walked beside his mother, helping her collect shellfish from the beach half a morning\u2019s flight from their home.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s scared of the dark when they\u2019re young.\u201d Tugging him to a shallow rock pool, she showed him a hermit crab crawling around with its home on its back. \u201cYou love the dark sometimes\u2014like on the night flight you took with your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were stars then.\u201d They had reminded him of the sparkly jewels his mother used to wear when the visitors came. No one had visited for a long time, probably because his father was always so angry. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really dark.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s amethyst dress floated in the breeze. \u201cYou already see better in the dark than I do\u2014you helped me find my lost earring two nights ago, remember?\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard.\u201d The black pearl with the pretty blue shimmer had kind of twinkled at him in the dark.</p><p>\u201cNot for you, my smart boy.\u201d Laughing in that way that made him laugh, too, she said, \u201cOne day, you\u2019ll see so well at night, it will be as if you walk in daylight. You\u2019ll never again be scared of the dark.\u201d</p><p>His mother had been right. By the time he was a hundred and fifty, his night vision had developed to the point where he had the sight of a nocturnal predator. The dark was home to him, and now he wrapped it around himself as he stood watch.</p><p>The open space was lit only by the flickering light from hundreds of candles, many cradled protectively in colored glass holders that turned the marble of the buildings around the courtyard into a dreamscape. As for those who stood within\u2014laughter was muted, the hues less vibrant than might be expected in an archangel\u2019s court, but that was the only bow to Eris\u2019s death.</p><p>No one would guess that his funeral pyre blazed tomorrow.</p><p>Yet regardless of the many painted butterflies who held glasses of champagne and spoke with elegant gestures while subtly jockeying for position, he had no difficulty pinpointing Mahiya. Dressed in a silk sari of blue green embellished with a thin gold border, she moved through the crowd with the ease of someone on familiar ground.</p><p>Right then, she halted, angling her head in his direction, her gaze so intent he imagined he could glimpse the brilliant tawny brown even from this distance. There was no way she could\u2019ve sensed him, but he was certain she had. When she moved again, it was with a fine layer of tension across her shoulders. An enigma was Mahiya, with the manners of the court elite and the instincts of a hunter.</p><p>Looking away to sweep the crowd with his gaze, he confirmed that Neha remained with Eris\u2019s body. Jason had had confirmation that she\u2019d granted Eris\u2019s family permission to attend the dawn funeral ceremony, but no one else. Some whispered the archangel was jealous of her consort even in death, but Jason believed Neha mourned too deeply to share her grief.</p><p>Returning his attention to Mahiya, he saw that she was drifting away from the group. He scanned the guests who remained once more before making his way to the palace he shared with Mahiya, catching a glimpse of blue green silk whispering past the doorway.</p><p>Entering behind her, he locked the main doors and made his way upstairs to find her on their shared balcony, her gaze on the courtyard lit only by four quiet lamps. She didn\u2019t startle when he came to stand beside her. A single wide, shallow step separated his balcony area from hers, and where he had columns holding up the roof, the edge open for easy flight, she had a railing, which she now gripped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer name was Audrey.\u201d Quiet words, no apparent residue of her earlier anger. \u201cTall, curvaceous blonde vampire. She\u2019d been part of Neha\u2019s circle for two decades but hadn\u2019t made it into the inner court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did she disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same day as Eris\u2019s murder, though no one else has yet put the two events together. Those who\u2019ve noticed Audrey\u2019s absence believe it\u2019s a simple case of conflicting schedules. No one has bothered to try to contact her\u2014she wasn\u2019t one of the favorites, and the friendships she made were shallow at best.\u201d Hands clenching on the railing, she continued to stare out into the night. \u201cDo you believe she killed Eris?\u201d</p><p>Look at me, princess. \u201cIt\u2019s one conclusion.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers flexed on the railing. \u201cDo I matter?\u201d It was a question with so many nuances, he knew he caught but the bluntest edge. \u201cIn the grand scheme of your existence, does my life matter to you on any level?\u201d</p><p>He was a man used to keeping secrets, but he knew at that instant that he had to answer this, or he risked losing something he wasn\u2019t even aware he searched for. \u201cYes. You matter.\u201d</p><p>A tremor quaked Mahiya\u2019s frame . . . and at last, she turned those bright eyes his way. \u201cThen you will uphold our bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bargain or not, Jason had no intention of leaving her to Neha\u2019s mercies, but he would make her no promises until he knew they would not be broken.</p><p>When he stepped to the edge of his side of the balcony in preparation for taking flight, Mahiya said, \u201cShe isn\u2019t in her chambers. I checked earlier.\u201d</p> <p>Jason wasn\u2019t used to explaining himself to anyone. Even Raphael gave him free rein, but Mahiya\u2019s statement held a brittle pride that said this woman, this survivor, had been pushed to the brink. \u201cGood.\u201d He turned, held her gaze to show that he wasn\u2019t ignoring her. \u201cI have another idea I wish to explore.\u201d</p><p>A pause, then a small nod, her voice no longer cool when she said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for your return.\u201d</p><p>Strange what those simple words did to him as he flew off the balcony and up into the diamond-studded jet of the night sky. There, he hovered invisible against the stars and listened. His gift wasn\u2019t one he could call up on command, but he could put himself into the optimum frame of mind to trigger it. Now, he did just that, the capricious winds whipping strands of hair from his queue and pasting the thin linen of his shirt against his body.</p><p>Whispers began to filter through to his mind minutes later, a thousand small fragments that meant nothing. Patient, he allowed the river of sensory input to flow around him. Then he caught a single whisper that wasn\u2019t a word so much as a sense. Shifting into the wind, he flew over the ridges and valleys of the mountains, following an instinct honed to a keen edge by near to seven hundred years of life.</p><p>Nothing stood out about the valley where the trail stopped cold, but he came down under the moonlight nonetheless, careful to land with a stealth that was as innate as breathing. Swathed in shadows, the land betrayed none of its secrets . . . until the wind shifted.</p><p>Dusty decay, but no scent of rot.</p> <p>Catching the line of the breeze, he traced it back to a tumble of gray stone, some of the rough chunks the size of small cars. The sheer rock face above told him their origin, though enough time had passed that the hardy grasses evolved to survive this harsh climate had grown to above his knee around the rocks.</p><p>It was, he thought, sheer luck that the body had fallen into a crevice when it had been dropped. Or the remnants of it in any case. The long skirt set with hundreds of tiny mirrors would otherwise have been a beacon in the sunlight. As it was, that girlish skirt was shaded by the rocks, the majority of the body caught in a fissure created by two adjoining hunks of stone.</p><p>The blood had dried and flaked over the time she\u2019d lain here alone and forgotten, her long blonde hair dry but paradoxically shiny, her face unrecognizable. However, the shade between the rocks had preserved enough tissue on her face and body that he could speculate as to the fact she\u2019d been severely bruised. The rocks could be responsible for the damage, but Jason would bet she\u2019d suffered the abuse prior to death. Because this killing, like Eris\u2019s, had been about fury, about rage.</p><p>The viciousness of it was such that even the decay and the foraging of small animals and birds couldn\u2019t hide the fact that she\u2019d been stabbed over and over. Where the skeletal structure of her body lay exposed to the elements, he could see the notches the blade had cut into her bones, marks of an ugly violence that would last long after the maggots had cleaned up what remained of her flesh.</p><p>Audrey had clearly not been the strongest of vampires, because while her heart was gone\u2014ripped out by a brutal hand if her splintered rib cage was any indication\u2014her head was still attached to her body. That head had been cracked and damaged, the skin of her neck shriveled to mummylike dryness where it wasn\u2019t missing, but from what Jason could see, the damage had been caused by birds and rodents eating at her flesh, not by an attempt at decapitation.</p><p>Her hands were bone now, no way to tell if she\u2019d worn a ring on a particular finger, but he could as easily glean that from a photograph now that he knew her name. Walking the area around the body, he saw nothing else of note. It went against his every belief to leave her here, but he could not risk bringing her to the fort as yet. Neha\u2019s response was unpredictable\u2014things could get deadly very quickly unless he did this exactly right.</p><p>And Audrey was long past being hurt. He had to consider other lives now.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019ll make sure you get home,\u201d he promised, before shifting back to a more open part of the valley and rising into the night sky.</p> <p>Mahiya\u2019s balcony doors were open as if in invitation, and when he entered, it was to find her seated on a cushion on the living room floor. She\u2019d changed from the sari into a tunic of vivid aquamarine teamed with slim cotton pants in plain black, her hair gathered in its familiar knot at the nape of her graceful neck.</p><p>In front of her sat a low table carved of dark wood and inlaid with the merest glimmer of fine gold around the edges, on top of which stood a pot of tea alongside a tray of mixed savories and sweets, and two cups. He halted, disappointment curling through his body. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting someone.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s laugh was warm. \u201cI am expecting you.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been caught off guard for a long, long time. \u201cHow did you know when I would return?\u201d Swirls of steam rose from the fine black tea she\u2019d begun to pour.</p><p>\u201cA good host learns her guest\u2019s rhythms.\u201d She waved a slender hand bare of rings but circled by two glass bangles the same shade as the tunic, toward the flat cushion on the other side of the table \u201cPlease, sit.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if she sought to seduce him, decided it unlikely\u2014her tunic was too modest, the mandarin collar high, her sleeves elbow length, and her face scrubbed clean. Thrown a little off-balance by the fact she\u2019d gone to all this trouble, he nudged aside the cushion and took a seat directly on the floor, his wings draping over the smaller jewel-toned cushions thrown around, the fabric soft against the bottom of his wings. \u201cYou must have a sensory gift of some kind to have anticipated my arrival with such accuracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d Her startled look transformed with the second word into an honesty so rueful that he knew she would\u2019ve preferred to claim a gift. \u201cI was watching the skies for you. So you see, there is no mystery after all.\u201d</p><p>Except that she had seen him. No one saw Jason when he didn\u2019t want to be seen, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to be spotted coming in to the fort. Which meant Mahiya did have a gift. \u201cWhen did you spot me?\u201d he asked in a casual tone, wanting to gauge the extent of her abilities. \u201cWhen I dropped out of the clouds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume so\u2014I saw you on the horizon just past Guardian.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been high, high in the sky at that point, a black dot against black. The fact Mahiya had developed what appeared to be an acute visual sense at such a young age told him she had the potential to grow into a power among angelkind. He\u2019d erred, he admitted, lulled into complacency by the gentleness of her strength, akin to the quiet but persistent fall of water against stone rather than a violent quake, forgetting the fact she\u2019d been born of two powerful immortals.</p><p>\u201cYour tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said in the same language she\u2019d spoken, received a smile in return.</p><p>When she nudged over the plate of savories, he ate over half of them before halting\u2014he\u2019d missed dinner, was hungrier than he\u2019d realized. All the while, Mahiya watched him with those cat-bright eyes of hers, and he searched for the poisonous hatred that should\u2019ve infected her . . . only to find an incisive intelligence and a sweetness of spirit she couldn\u2019t hide, no matter how good she was at court masks.</p><p>Fascination entangled with a pride he had never expected to feel for the Princess Mahiya, for she had to have the will of a lioness to have managed to hold that poison at bay, though it dripped on her each and every day.</p><p>\u201cDid you find Audrey?\u201d</p><p>Jason considered the question, decided to trust her with the truth, measure her response. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she? And she was most likely the woman warming my father\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>The speed and accuracy of her conclusion made Jason still. \u201cYou know who killed Eris,\u201d he said slowly, realizing he\u2019d erred in more than one way. \u201cYou\u2019ve always known.\u201d She was far too smart, far too good at listening to what was unspoken, not to have put the pieces together.</p><p>In the process of placing her teacup on the table, she jerked, had to act quickly to stop the fine porcelain from tipping over. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Setting his own cup on the table, he reached for the pot and poured her more tea. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>Fingers trembling, she didn\u2019t dispute the order. By the time she put the cup back down, her expression was acute with determination. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>Jason saw no reason not to acquiesce when they both carried the same knowledge. \u201cPerhaps others could\u2019ve bribed their way in, but we both know only one person could have walked out of Eris\u2019s palace soaked in blood and not been stopped by a single guard.\u201d Guards who professed not to remember a single unusual detail from that murderous night\u2014and who Neha hadn\u2019t executed, though they had permitted the death of her consort.</p><p>Mahiya picked up a sweet that was a combination of sugar and milk spiced with cloves and topped with slivers of almond, ate it with great deliberation. \u201cYes,\u201d she said at last, her tone rough silk, \u201cthat was my first thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would . . . Your presence, it makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Jason thought, why would Neha invite him to solve a murder she herself had committed and for which no one would ever hold her to account? That was a far more powerful mystery than why Eris had died. It was either madness or fatal arrogance that had led the male angel to believe his wife wouldn\u2019t discover his affair with Audrey. Or perhaps Eris had sought death after three hundred years of imprisonment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason discarded that thought as soon as it arose. Eris had been too self-centered, too much a man of ego to have ever chosen suicide, especially by such a convoluted method and in a way that left him violated and stripped of pride and beauty.</p><p>Porcelain clinked on porcelain as Mahiya put her cup on the saucer. \u201cNeha would subvert you from Raphael. Perhaps that is the reason why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not when Neha had met him soon after he arrived at the Refuge. \u201cShe must surely know I will never serve a woman who did such to the one she claimed to love.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s gaze grew piercing, as if she\u2019d heard the history that drove his declaration.</p> <p>\u201cAnd she is too proud to lie and claim you broke the vow in order to have you executed. Which does not leave us with any answers.\u201d Reaching forward, she topped off his tea. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>He considered each of the facts he currently had, both together and as separate pieces. It wasn\u2019t the murder that was the most important. That Neha and Lijuan were involved was problematic, but the two were neighbors\u2014a friendship between them was not incomprehensible. Without further details, he remained in the dark as to the nature of their secret meetings.</p><p>And . . . he hadn\u2019t yet worked out how to gain Mahiya her freedom. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya nudged forward the savories again. \u201cDo you expect me to lie to her when she asks what you have discovered?\u201d</p><p>He ate two more of the baked pastries filled with a sweet and spicy vegetable mix. \u201cShe won\u2019t listen to the truth from you,\u201d Jason spoke the merciless words knowing Mahiya had already come to the same conclusion. \u201cRather, she\u2019ll use it as an excuse to kill you.\u201d</p> <p>Mahiya ate another sweet, her expression unruffled. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so certain.\u201d In killing Mahiya, Neha would be killing a child she\u2019d helped raise, and angelkind revered the bond a child had with his or her parent or guardian. For a guardian to kill that child . . . it would break a taboo so deep, it was a racial imperative.</p><p>Jason, more than anyone, understood that such taboos could be broken, but doing so came at a price. \u201cExecuting you without due cause, and while she is clearly sane, would make her a pariah among our kind.\u201d And Neha was a social creature, one who valued her connections around the world.</p><p>Sipping at tea that must be tepid by now, Mahiya met his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my silence, but your reputation precedes you. As the days continue to pass with no result from you, she\u2019ll become suspicious.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, coming up with a way to allay Neha\u2019s distrust was the one thing Jason didn\u2019t have to worry about\u2014because the crimson of blood violently spilled hadn\u2019t yet stopped flowing.</p><p>Shock and sorrow both colored Neha\u2019s eyes when she joined Jason beside the crumpled body discovered on a rooftop terrace on the other side of the courtyard from the Palace of Jewels. The weak postdawn sunlight washed everything in soft gold, made it appear a macabre painting. In the center of the painting lay a vampire dressed in a pair of black silk pajamas, the straps of her camisole ripped to expose heavy breasts, her skin gray with death.</p> <p>Her legs were twisted and broken, as if she\u2019d fallen or been dropped from a height. However, the position of her body made it impossible to confirm whether she\u2019d begun her descent from the sky or from one of the small ground-to-air defense towers mounted around the fort\u2014the nearest one was at the right distance. Jason would speak to the guard who\u2019d been on duty in the predawn hours, but instinct said the victim had never been in the tower, her fall arranged by an angel.</p><p>In spite of her exposed breasts, the attack didn\u2019t appear to have been sexual. The damage to her clothing had most likely occurred during the struggle. Unlike Audrey, this victim\u2019s head wasn\u2019t attached to her body; it had rolled to settle against one of the latticework barriers where he\u2019d seen several exquisitely dressed women leaning and laughing yesterday as they looked out over the edge into the courtyard below. Today, the only sound he could hear was that of a woman\u2019s jagged sobs, while in his line of sight lay splatters of congealed rust red where the head had bounced and rolled after being dropped.</p><p>She was looking at him from the other side of the room, her pretty dark brown eyes filmed over with a whiteness that was wrong. The stump of her neck was crusted with blood where it sat on the table in the corner, as if placed there for just this purpose.</p><p>Unsurprised by the echoes of horror that resonated through time, Jason locked the memory shut behind shields he\u2019d had a lifetime to build, and continued to look at the body that lay in front of him, not one long gone from this earth.</p><p>This woman\u2019s chest had been left unmolested, her heart still within her flesh, but in one thing, this body and Audrey\u2019s were identical. Though the crush injuries caused by the fall obscured most of the bruises, Jason could tell the victim had been beaten with pitiless brutality before death. When he turned her over to look at her back, he saw that her spine had been ripped out to lie broken against blood-encrusted skin. He eased her back down with gentle hands, certain she\u2019d been conscious for the beating, the torture, paralyzed and helpless as a babe.</p><p>Rage and violence, the killer\u2019s fingerprint was unmistakable. \u201cDo you recognize her?\u201d he asked Neha, aware she had only just returned to Archangel Fort after Eris\u2019s mountaintop funeral. From the heavily damp hair scraped into a knot at her nape and her simple tunic of pale blue paired with white pants, she\u2019d been bathing afterward as was custom, when she received word of this death.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Shabnam.\u201d The archangel\u2019s tone held raw grief. \u201cShe was one of my longest-serving ladies-in-waiting.\u201d Crouching down beside the vampire\u2019s head with its ravaged skin, uncaring that her wings scraped the cool marble and the blood that stained it, she reached out to close Shabnam\u2019s eyelids over hazel eyes dulled in death, using a dot of power to make sure they remained so. \u201cI scattered Eris\u2019s ashes less than an hour ago while his mother sobbed, and now I must inform Shabnam\u2019s people of her murder.\u201d</p><p>Jason heard the anger beneath the grief, and it was another puzzle. \u201cWill you tell me about her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was a butterfly,\u201d Neha said, rising to her feet, her movements heavy, as if she was weighted down with sadness. \u201cA pretty ornament who cared for glitter and sparkles. She was not dark of heart or wise of politics. The only reason she made it so high in my court was that I enjoyed her sense of innocence.\u201d A twist of her lips. \u201cOf all the women who serve me, she was the most harmless.\u201d</p><p>Yet she had been killed with terrible cruelty. Jason wasn\u2019t arrogant enough to think he could read all of Neha\u2019s moods, but her sorrow appeared genuine. And while he could see her murdering Eris in a jealous rage, it beggared belief that she\u2019d spill innocent blood while preparing to say her final farewell to her consort. Even if she had done so in a grief or guilt-fueled madness, she had no need to pretend. Brutal as it was to say, Shabnam had been Neha\u2019s to kill.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe it to be the same person who murdered Eris?\u201d Neha asked, the cold blade of an archangel\u2019s anger a faint nimbus of light burning off her wings.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Jason rose from his crouched position beside the body. \u201cOr it could be an attempt to use Eris\u2019s murder to cover an unrelated crime.\u201d Shabnam had surely been a stunning woman in life. \u201cDid she have a lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But Tarun is gone to Europe on a task for me\u2014he could not have done this.\u201d</p><p>Jason made a note to confirm Tarun\u2019s whereabouts himself. It might be a truism, but the lover was most often the one responsible for the murder of a woman, mortal or immortal. Some darkness knew no boundaries. \u201cAnyone else who might hold a grudge against her?\u201d</p><p>Neha walked to the part of the terrace that flowed down a wide step to a covered pathway that, if followed, led to another, lower terrace. \u201cShe was a lady-in-waiting, Jason. I know little of her life.\u201d</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Unlike the Seven, Neha\u2019s ladies-in-waiting were there to entertain, amuse, and otherwise see to Neha\u2019s comfort, dismissed from the archangel\u2019s mind the instant they were out of sight. \u201cMay I have access to the others who serve you?\u201d He would also contact Samira, gain her impressions of Shabnam and Tarun.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Neha flared out her wings. \u201cMahiya will know where to find them.\u201d With that, she rose off the terrace, an angel of grace, power, and . . . centuries of blood that stained her hands to ruby blackness.</p><p>Jason found Mahiya in the courtyard below the terrace, and though he\u2019d given her no instructions, she said, \u201cMost of the ladies-in-waiting are even now gathering in their private garden. I would, however, recommend you speak to them one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. However, seeing how they act as a group may prove helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d She turned left, her mint green tunic crisp against her skin. \u201cWord travels fast in the small city that is the fort,\u201d she said, answering the question he hadn\u2019t asked. \u201cI knew about the discovery of Shabnam\u2019s body perhaps five minutes after the guard made it.\u201d Fixing the pin that held her long white scarf neatly over her left shoulder, she shot him an assessing look. \u201cHe says you arrived seconds later. Dropped out of the sky like a black arrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I killed Shabnam?\u201d He knew he was capable of murder should he ever have anyone of his own to protect. But that, of course, was an academic consideration.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d An answer far more resolute than he\u2019d expected. \u201cHowever, everyone wonders how you knew.\u201d</p><p>The winds had whispered a name, tugged him in a certain direction, but that wasn\u2019t a secret he could tell this princess who saw things no one should be able to see . . . and who made him think impossible thoughts about always being welcomed home as he\u2019d been last night. \u201cI was flying above the fort, saw the guard running in a panic. It wasn\u2019t difficult to sweep down, find out why.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya raised a single eyebrow but kept her silence, and a minute later, they walked through one of the cool passages inside the fort to exit a few feet from gardens clothed in a profusion of fragrant blooms. Five women stood in a knot in one corner, blooms of another kind. When Mahiya would\u2019ve moved out from the passageway, Jason stopped her with a hand on the silken warmth of her arm, the scent of her a caress to the senses. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe body language is interesting, is it not?\u201d Mahiya\u2019s quiet comment echoed his own thoughts, her wing brushing his as she leaned in so he could hear her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move away. \u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>The tallest lady, an angel, had positioned herself so she didn\u2019t fully face any of the others. Another angel, her wings the dusty brown of a sparrow\u2019s, was holding on to a sylph of a vampire with the broken desperation of someone who isn\u2019t sure her legs will support her, while a dark-eyed angel and a vampire with pale skin wiped at their eyes with what appeared to be lace handkerchiefs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe sparrow,\u201d he murmured, \u201cshe actually grieves.\u201d The rest indulged in theatre.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sympathy in the single soft word. \u201cShabnam and she were both inducted into their positions at the same time, and rather than competing for Neha\u2019s attention, they became friends who helped each other navigate the politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should there be politics? They occupy the same rarefied position.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya shot him a frowning look. \u201cAre you making fun?\u201d</p> <p>Jason hadn\u2019t ever been accused of that, even by the irrepressible Illium. \u201cStrange as it may seem,\u201d he said, \u201cI have never had reason to know about the inner workings of a group of ladies-in-waiting.\u201d He had operatives who were far more capable in that arena and who kept him apprised of any necessary information from such quarters.</p><p>\u201cA lady-in-waiting has certain access to Neha.\u201d Mahiya appeared to have decided to take him at his word, though the suspicion in her eyes didn\u2019t totally dissipate\u2014and for some reason, that made a quiet amusement warm his blood. \u201cNone of them would be stupid enough to risk their position by actually asking for anything, but occasionally, if a lady is particularly favored, Neha will grant her a boon.\u201d</p><p>Even a small boon from an archangel, Jason understood, could change the balance of power in a given situation. \u201cDo they represent different groups in the court?\u201d He looked at the women with new eyes, seeing iron butterflies, their wings edged with razors of ambition and greed.</p><p>\u201cNot simply the court, but the territory.\u201d</p><p>Thus, they all had puppet masters at their back, tugging strings, situating each for maximum gain . . . doing the dirty work.</p> <p>\u201cLisbeth holds the most power at present.\u201d She indicated the dark-eyed angel. \u201cShe\u2019s very intelligent. They all are.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in acknowledgment of the warning. \u201cI take care to never underestimate an opponent, but I may have in this case.\u201d Like the others around her, Lisbeth looked . . . frothy. Clothes of a gauzy fabric that caught the wind and glossy brown hair done up in an intricate mass of curls, jeweled combs in the strands, features painted with an artful delicacy that highlighted her ebony-skinned beauty. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wish for me to organize interviews for you with the ladies?\u201d Mahiya asked once they were back in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d find them on their own when they didn\u2019t expect to be questioned. Right now, he wanted the answer to a different kind of question. \u201cYou\u2019ve become cooperative beyond the call of duty.\u201d</p><p>A shallow court smile\u2014one he realized he despised after having glimpsed a real one last night when she admitted to watching for him. \u201cYou,\u201d she murmured, \u201care my best hope of escaping this hell.\u201d</p><p>It made him wonder just how far she\u2019d go.</p> <p>16</p><p>\u201cTell me who gains from Shabnam\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya felt a sudden, frustrated urge to scream when Jason used the haunting clarity of his voice to speak those words. She\u2019d deliberately baited him with her sweetly poisonous reply, wanting to incite a response, to shatter the obsidian ice that surrounded him until it felt as if she spoke to a black mirror.</p><p>\u201cIs there a lady who waits to take her position?\u201d he clarified when she remained silent.</p><p>\u201cThere are always those who wait.\u201d She wrenched the strange madness under control, for what did it matter to her if Jason preferred to live a step distant from the world? \u201cBut Neha chooses who she will\u2014an aspirant could kill off the entire group and fail to gain a place.\u201d Her scarf lifted on the wind as they walked upstairs to take the high terrace path, flicked over Jason\u2019s arm, his chest, before falling back neatly by her side.</p><p>I am jealous of a piece of fabric. Foolish when he does not even see me. \u201cSorry.\u201d Last night on the balcony, when this deadly shadow of a man had made the clear effort not to hurt her feelings, her fascination with him had altered into something both tender and far more dangerous. The way he\u2019d looked at her after his return, she\u2019d hoped . . . but clearly, his actions had been nothing more than a quiet kindness.</p><p>The realization made her heart ache.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot leash the wind,\u201d he said, his gaze an impenetrable depth she couldn\u2019t fathom.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I suppose not.\u201d She broke the eye contact that was too much, too strong, too visceral. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been better had Shabnam disappeared if this action was politically motivated,\u201d she said, forcing herself to concentrate. \u201cHer killing may well make Neha sympathize with her intimates and choose the next lady from within their ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight they gain an extra boon?\u201d Jason\u2019s wing was so close, she could see the fine black filaments that made up each midnight feather.</p><p>Her fingers curled into her palms. \u201cNo.\u201d Though she was in no doubt that were such a thing a possibility, Shabnam\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d might well have sacrificed her with cold-blooded calculation. \u201cShabnam was worth more alive\u2014she\u2019d been with Neha a long time, had her trust and liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wings are dragging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh.\u201d Cheeks heating at the reminder one might give to a child, she raised her wings so that the edges no longer trailed on the red sandstone of the terrace.</p><p>Then he spoke again, and her embarrasment transformed into the most bittersweet of emotions. \u201cYou need to work on strengthening your wings in every detail. If Neha\u2019s temper turns, it may come down to a race to a safe hiding place until I can work out a political solution to your freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am just over three hundred years old, Jason,\u201d she said, using his name of her own volition for the first time, the small intimacy filling her mind with all the other fragile moments she\u2019d dreamed of experiencing with the nameless, faceless lover she\u2019d imagined in her darkest hours. One with whom she\u2019d fly, see the world, build a life, build a home, fill it with laughter and love and happiness such as she\u2019d never known.</p><p>\u201cEven were I to have trained for endurance flying every day of my existence,\u201d she said, holding onto that dream with every ounce of her strength in the face of harsh reality, \u201cI couldn\u2019t outfly Neha, even for the shortest flicker of time.\u201d Neha was an archangel who had lived millennia, her power vast. She\u2019d crush Mahiya like an insect and never notice.</p><p>\u201cAnd a hiding place?\u201d Mahiya shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t let her bury me again. Better I die fighting for my freedom than to turn into Eris, dead in chains.\u201d It was a fierce vow. \u201cI will not allow her to pin my wings to the wall as Lijuan does to the butterflies she collects.\u201d</p><p>Jason felt a dark wildness come to life within him at Mahiya\u2019s impassioned declaration, but the response that came out of his mouth was almost icily calm, the words he\u2019d wanted to speak hidden deep inside the silence that had been his existence for so long. \u201cLijuan would like to add me to her collection.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya stumbled on a rough part of the terrace, would have fallen if he hadn\u2019t shot out a hand and gripped her upper arm. Ignoring his hold, she stared at him. \u201cDid she say that to your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch unique wings you have, Jason. A pity if you should die in battle, those midnight wings destroyed. A quiet, measured death in the arms of a lovely girl ripe with her womanhood would be so much easier, do you not think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe offered me a peaceful death.\u201d He forced himself to release Mahiya, his need for touch a clawing thing inside him. \u201cShe\u2019s been much more vocal about Illium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue tipped with silver, yes, his wings are stunning,\u201d Mahiya murmured. \u201cI saw him once when he accompanied Raphael on a visit.\u201d</p><p>Jason glanced down into eyes bright even in the shadows of an archway, and had the sudden realization the brilliance was an indication of emerging power. One no one had noticed because the change, like every aspect of Mahiya\u2019s power, had to have been incremental. \u201cYour own wings are just as unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d Mahiya\u2019s tone went flat. \u201cMy mother had the same.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known that, and if wings of such beauty had been forgotten, it meant someone had buried the information. Neha, it seemed, had wiped her sister out of existence as well as out of life. Now she attempted to do the same to the child who bore wings the exquisite sapphires and emerald greens of a peacock\u2019s spray.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . Have you seen Lijuan\u2019s Collection Room?\u201d</p><p>Jason halted, watched Mahiya rub her hands up and down her arms, as if they did not stand in sunlight thick as syrup. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI have.\u201d The Collection Room was located within the stronghold where Lijuan had first created her reborn, and kept permanently cold to preserve the bodies that hung on the walls, their wings spread out in magnificent display.</p><p>Some, Jason knew, had died in circumstances where their wings had remained undamaged, but others . . . others had simply vanished from the world. \u201cIf you saw that room,\u201d he said, driven to touch a single finger to Mahiya\u2019s cheek, \u201cyou\u2019re lucky to be alive.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t shrug away the touch. Flattening her hand over her belly, she said, \u201cI thought I could bargain service for sanctuary. I convinced myself it would be akin to being a servant, that I\u2019d be free aside from my duties.\u201d A shiver wracked her frame. \u201cI think the only reason Lijuan returned me to Neha rather than keeping me as a trophy was that she was deeply offended by the fact I would dare run from the archangel to whom I \u2018owed duty.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you a cat,\u201d he murmured, his mind on the massive cold-storage room behind the Collection Room, filled with drawers big enough to hold angelic bodies, \u201cI would say you are now poorer by at least seven of your nine lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d It was a whisper dancing over his skin.</p><p>\u201cMany things I cannot unsee.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s words continuing to circle in her mind, heavy with a lingering darkness that tugged at the vulnerable core of her in spite of her conclusion that he felt no such need in return, Mahiya parted from him several minutes later. \u201cI must attend to Neha,\u201d she said. \u201cI am meant to be spying on you after all.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s response was as unexpected as the fleeting touch that had anchored her to the here and now when the nightmare of Lijuan\u2019s stronghold threatened to suck her under. \u201cYou\u2019re not hard enough for such a task\u201d\u2014almost gentle words\u2014\u201cand I honor the strength it must\u2019ve taken to fight the bitterness, to refuse to allow your heart to petrify to pitiless stone.\u201d</p><p>No one else had ever understood that truth, understood the conscious will it had taken to remain untainted and unbroken. Shaken at the way he could reach her so deeply when he remained so distant, she said, \u201cI must go,\u201d and turned to walk away.</p><p>When she looked over her shoulder seconds later, he was gone, the sky showing no sign of the spymaster who threatened to strip her to the soul. \u201cWho are you, Jason?\u201d</p><p>The wind held no answers for her.</p><p>Lowering her gaze from the sky, she took a deep breath and replaced the emotional armor Jason had disassembled with nothing but a touch, a few words. She could not go to Neha vulnerable and exposed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ten minutes later, when she located the archangel, it wasn\u2019t within the cool confines of her private palace, but walking the ramparts, looking down at the city that was her own. Keeping her wings neatly to her back, her emotions under rigid control, Mahiya watched the archangel nod to the visitors walking or riding up the steep, curving path to the fort. Neha didn\u2019t allow modern vehicles on the pathway or within the fort itself, but elephants, camels, and horses were considered acceptable means of transport.</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten who it is you come to speak to?\u201d It was a silken question.</p><p>\u201cI apologize if I have misstepped, my lady.\u201d Once, the words would\u2019ve been knife shards in her throat. Now, they were nothing but tools she used to distract the archangel while she worked to break out of this prison.</p><p>Silence. Neha\u2019s wings a sweep of cool white scattered with a rare few jewel blue filaments that echoed Mahiya\u2019s own feathers. The familial connection showed itself in other ways, too, but only to someone who knew what it was they searched for, and those old enough to deduce the truth also knew never to speak of it.</p> <p>To everyone else, Mahiya was a distant descendant of Neha\u2019s the archangel had taken in out of kindness after the death of her unnamed parents. That the newborn child had appeared eight months after Eris\u2019s incarceration and Nivriti\u2019s assumed execution had further distanced any connection that might\u2019ve been made by most. Few could imagine that Neha had been cruel enough to have kept her sister chained through the months of her pregnancy, but Mahiya had heard the story from Neha\u2019s own lips.</p><p>\u201cA gift on your hundredth birthday.\u201d The archangel\u2019s smile caused a chill along Mahiya\u2019s spine. \u201cThe history of your becoming.\u201d</p><p>Angels didn\u2019t easily die, but a female angel was most vulnerable after childbirth, especially a childbirth where her womb had been cut open with a rusty blade, her baby literally torn out of her by uncaring hands, her internal organs left to spill to the floor. Add in a lack of food and water, and the thin, thin air at the top of the distant mountain fort where her mother had apparently been held, and Nivriti had stood no chance.</p><p>Even then, powerful as she\u2019d been, it must\u2019ve taken her years of agony to starve to total death.</p><p>\u201cYou give offense by existing,\u201d Neha said at last, and it was an almost absent comment. \u201cTell me about Jason.\u201d</p> <p>Mahiya did, and it was the truth . . . what she spoke of it in any case. As Jason had pointed out, she could hardly accuse Neha of murder and hope to live. \u201cHe appears to be upholding the vow,\u201d she concluded, \u201cand working to unearth the identity of the murderer or murderers.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s eyes focused on some distant aspect Mahiya couldn\u2019t see, the silk sari Neha wore now a cool champagne bordered in bronze, the folds pinned with neat precision on her shoulder by an antique brooch. Her blouse was a bronze that echoed the border, the cut perfect, the intricate back work necessary to accommodate wings done with such precision that the fit remained flawless.</p><p>No one, Mahiya thought, could say the Archangel of India was not the most elegant of creatures, but Mahiya alone understood the vindictive depth of hatred that had driven Neha for so long. It hadn\u2019t surprised her in the least when Anoushka was found guilty of crimes against a child\u2014the angel had watched her own mother raise a child for the sole purpose of vengeance after all. Kindness to a thousand other children could not eradicate the evil taint of that single heinous act.</p><p>\u201cDo you mourn your father?\u201d Neha asked into the silence.</p><p>\u201cI mourn who he could\u2019ve been.\u201d There had been promise in Eris, and perhaps if he\u2019d had better guidance as a youth, as a husband, he might have fulfilled it. That was as much forgiveness as she could give him, because he\u2019d been an adult, too, had made his own choices.</p><p>\u201cIn that we are in agreement, child of my blood\u2019s blood.\u201d</p> <p>Mahiya went motionless\u2014it never augured anything but ill for her when Neha referred to the ties that connected them. However, today, the archangel simply tilted her face to the burning heat of the sun, allowing it to wash over the golden brown of her skin, imbuing it with warmth. At that moment, Mahiya could imagine why her people saw her as a benevolent goddess.</p><p>\u201cI first met him when I was an angel of a thousand.\u201d The words were soft, her gaze on a past long gone. \u201cAt four hundred, he was barely an adult to my mind, and I treated him as such. Irresponsible, I thought, but beautiful and with such masculine charm. Our paths did not cross again until I had become an archangel, and Eris a man elegant and confident.\u201d</p><p>A hot desert wind waved over them a second later, breaking Neha\u2019s reverie. \u201cHave you ever loved, Mahiya?\u201d</p><p>Knowing what was coming, she steeled her spine. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even Arav?\u201d</p><p>There it was, the blow that reminded her of a humiliation that had crushed her young heart, threatened to fracture her fledgling spirit. \u201cI was a child then. What did I know of love?\u201d However, she\u2019d learned that pretty words were not to be trusted\u2014and that she had a strength she\u2019d never before understood.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter is dead,\u201d Neha said, in an apparent non sequitur, \u201cand so is my husband and consort. Some would say I am being punished for what I did to you and your mother.\u201d Dark eyes on Mahiya\u2019s face. \u201cDo you think I am being punished, Mahiya?\u201d</p><p>If you believe so. For your karma is of your own making.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not my place to think such things, my lady.\u201d Mahiya used every ounce of skill she\u2019d picked up from her years in the court to hide her thoughts, keep her voice expressionless. \u201cI am only grateful for your kindness in giving me a home.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s lips curved, but the ice in her gaze remained frigid. \u201cA pretty speech. Perhaps you will prove interesting, after all.\u201d A slight motion of a slender hand, and Mahiya knew she\u2019d been dismissed.</p><p>Walking the wide pathway along the ramparts until she came to steps that led down into the sprawling main courtyard\u2014built at a time when ground armies were mounted on elephants\u2014she made her way down with slow grace, though she wanted nothing more than to spread her wings and fly off into the mountains. That deadly chance was one she\u2019d save for last, when she had no other hope.</p><p>\u201cYes. You matter.\u201d</p><p>Hugging Jason\u2019s quiet words to her heart, her faith in his integrity an instinct she had no will to fight, Mahiya crossed the stone of the courtyard with measured steps. Open as it was, with only a few miniature trees in large planters on the edges, she could feel a hundred eyes on her\u2014guards, courtiers, servants.</p><p>She acknowledged those who acknowledged her, but stopped for no one . . . until a tall, handsome angel with skin of darkest brown and eyes of smoky gray walked into her path, his wings a mottled brown two shades paler than his skin. And she understood why Neha had spoken of the man who had taught Mahiya her first and most lasting lesson about love.</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cMahiya, my sweet.\u201d Arav went as if to take her hand in preparation for lifting it to his mouth, but she halted that by the polite expedient of a small bow, hands clasped together in greeting in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d she said, and in her mind, it was an insult. \u201cI did not know you visited my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I visit Neha.\u201d A charming smile he\u2019d once convinced Mahiya was for her alone.</p><p>Now she trusted no man\u2019s smile . . . and was starting to trust a man who smiled not at all. It was an impossible thing, but there it was. She had more trust in an enemy spymaster than she had in any other person in this fort\u2014Jason\u2019s truths might be dark and often brutal, but they were never lies wrapped in acidic sweetness that could corrode.</p><p>\u201cShe and I are friends of an age.\u201d Arav\u2019s gaze lifted to where Neha stood on the ramparts, her gaze cityward. \u201cAnd of course, I have not seen you, my favorite lover, for many a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no longer your lover and have not been for centuries.\u201d She felt defiled by the memory of how she\u2019d allowed him to take her innocence with a satisfaction she\u2019d then mistaken for care. \u201cI wish you a good visit, but I must be on my way.\u201d</p><p>Arav blocked her when she would\u2019ve walked around him. To insist would be to cause a scene, and while Mahiya had no compunction against slapping Arav if need be, giving in to the urge while Neha stood so close could be dangerous. Because in one thing Arav did not lie\u2014he and Neha did have a friendship.</p><p>To this day, she didn\u2019t know if Arav had been acting under orders when he seduced then threw Mahiya away like trash, or if it had been simple chance, the male in front of her taking advantage of an untutored girl who did not enjoy her archangel\u2019s favor and thus had no one from whom Arav might fear reprisal.</p><p>\u201cI hear you share rooms with one who has sworn a blood vow.\u201d Arav\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cRaphael\u2019s pet mute.\u201d</p><p>Mute? It was an insult so incomprehensible as to have no impact. Jason didn\u2019t chatter, but he wasn\u2019t a wholly silent creature\u2014he simply chose not to speak until he had something to say. \u201cNeha,\u201d she said, with glacial politeness, \u201cappears to hold him in high esteem.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted in a reflection of the putrid inner self she hadn\u2019t seen until it was too late. \u201cShe is grieving.\u201d</p><p>Ah. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here? To offer solace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a friend\u2019s prerogative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend who wishes to take Eris\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am stronger than he ever was.\u201d Arrogance backed by fact; Arav was one of Neha\u2019s generals. \u201cWhen I am consort,\u201d he said, gripping her jaw between thumb and forefinger before she could flinch away, \u201cI will ask Neha to give you to me as my special pet.\u201d</p><p>Fool. Mahiya twisted out of his grip, heedless of whether it might attract Neha\u2019s attention. Because if there was one thing the archangel had never done, it was to overlook the mistreatment of women in her court. Any man found to have forced, beaten, or coerced a woman was summarily punished by having parts of his body amputated\u2014the worse the assault, the more he lost, until some didn\u2019t survive to regenerate.</p><p>It did not matter if the woman was in favor or not, rich or poor, peasant or courtier. The rule was absolute and part of what made Neha such a beloved queen. But that Neha, Mahiya thought suddenly, a prickling of cold along her spine, might not be the one who ruled now . . . at least not where Mahiya was concerned.</p><p>\u201cSome would say I am being punished for what I did to you and your mother.\u201d</p><p>Stifling the chilling realization, she favored Arav with a scalpel-sharp smile. \u201cNeha values loyalty in a man above all else. If she ever thinks you have plans to touch another while bound to her, Eris\u2019s torture and disemboweling will seem a gentle punishment in comparison.\u201d</p><p>Paling until the loss of blood was obvious even under the darkness of his skin, Arav took two quick steps away from her. Mahiya was already gone, having used his momentary shock to skirt past and down the pathway toward the stables\u2014petting the horses she so loved would go some way toward calming her. She felt Arav\u2019s eyes boring between her shoulder blades until she disappeared around the corner, and knew that where he had previously seen her as a toy, he now saw her as something he wanted to break. She\u2019d made an enemy this day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Three hours after the discovery of Shabnam\u2019s body, and having completed a number of other crucial inquiries, Jason had intended to interview the ladies-in-waiting, but found he had need to speak to Neha. \u201cVenom asks permission to enter your territory.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s lips kicked up a notch where she walked beside a large outdoor mural of a lissome maiden carrying a water pot on her head. \u201cSo, the prodigal returns,\u201d she said, the grief and anger in her voice leavened by warmth. \u201cIs he on his way to the Refuge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he would not dare pass by without paying his respects.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s laugh echoed off the marble around them. \u201cThough he did dare run off to Raphael as soon as his Contract was complete.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you would\u2019ve been disappointed had he not shown spine enough to forge his own path.\u201d Though she would not be pleased to know exactly how powerful the vampire had become in the years since.</p><p>Smile deepening, Neha said, \u201cI assent to his visit, so long as he accepts the vow that binds you also includes him while he is here. Let us hope he has brought a gift that will soften my anger at his defection.\u201d</p><p>What Venom brought was nothing expected. No exotic snake or a necklet in the shape of a cobra, no jeweled comb or rare wine.</p><p>\u201cExplain this,\u201d Neha said in a cool tone when he unveiled the mechanical monkey that beat drums and crashed cymbals with manic glee as it walked in circles on the sapphire-hued silk carpet in front of Neha\u2019s throne.</p><p>Venom turned off the toy. \u201cIt is a smile, my lady.\u201d Glancing up from his crouching position, he allowed the sunlight pouring in through the windows to hit the shocking green of eyes that were not human in any sense, the slits contracting against the brightness. \u201cI thought you needed one more than jewels. Especially on this day.\u201d</p> <p>Neha said nothing for a long minute before she sighed and gestured for him to rise. \u201cPut that in my private chambers,\u201d she said to the servant who stood discreetly to the side, and Jason knew the danger had passed, Venom\u2019s gamble at referring to Eris\u2019s funeral paying off.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said once the servant had departed, \u201cof what you have been doing in Raphael\u2019s Tower.\u201d</p><p>It was a loaded question, one that asked Venom to divide his loyalties, but the vampire fielded it without lying\u2014and without betraying any secrets. \u201cLearning to be stronger, better. Now I go to work under Galen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that one is a man who understands patience, as you have never done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my nature.\u201d Venom shrugged, and Jason knew he referred to the impulses that had been seeded in him by the Queen of Snakes, of Poisons.</p><p>A faint smile curved Neha\u2019s lips, the calculated gleam of her earlier question replaced by amused affection. \u201cWhen does that barbarian weapons master expect you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am early. If I may beg your indulgence, I would stay and talk with friends I have not seen for many a year.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s eyes shifted in that quicksilver way, now brown, now a jagged, slitted green, the speed such that Jason could almost believe he\u2019d imagined it. \u201cSo, Raphael thinks to plant a second spy in my court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou insult Jason, my lady.\u201d Disarming charm. \u201cI would be a great thumping elephant to his sleek cobra.\u201d</p><p>An exasperated shake of Neha\u2019s head, the archangel appearing more indulgent than Jason had seen her with anyone but Eris and Anoushka. \u201cStay, play your games, but, Venom? Do not forget who I am.\u201d</p><p>Venom bowed over her hand, pressing his lips to her knuckles. \u201cMy lady, never will I forget who you are\u2014you did not Make a fool.\u201d</p><p>Later, when Venom and Jason walked up onto the wall above one of the magnificent fort gates, Jason saw the vampire sigh as he looked out over the city below, the homes hugging the earth for the most part, but even the smallest with a door painted in a bright shade, or shutters of red, a roof of blue. \u201cYou miss this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times,\u201d Venom said, his hair lifting in the breeze that tugged at Jason\u2019s queue. \u201cThis land is where I was born, this fort where I was Made. It\u2019ll always have a claim on my heart, though it is Raphael who has a claim on my loyalty.\u201d</p><p>Jason thought of the palm-edged sands of the Pacific, of the remote island that was his own, where he went when he wanted to disappear from the world. Though it wasn\u2019t the place where he\u2019d been born, it was close enough that it made his heart ache. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRaphael thought you might appreciate a familiar face, someone you can trust to watch your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he said, thinking of a woman who lived in a fort surrounded by hundreds of others, but who was and had always been alone, without anyone of her own.</p><p>Even he had memories of love to keep him going. Mahiya had nothing. And still she had hope in her heart, the capacity for tenderness of the soul. Strong, she was so strong, stronger than him, for where he\u2019d had to shut down to survive, she\u2019d managed to do so intact.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Venom said, \u201ctell me what has happened\u2014I won\u2019t betray your vow, and Raphael won\u2019t expect it of me.\u201d</p><p>Jason had never believed otherwise. \u201cThere is something wrong here.\u201d He told Venom of the triple murders, of the details that didn\u2019t quite fit. \u201cYou still know many people in this court intimately.\u201d Friends the vampire had stayed in touch with, some out of true affection, others because they were useful\u2014Venom could be coldly practical beneath his charm. \u201cFind the connection if you can.\u201d</p><p>The murders bore too familiar an emotional fingerprint to be the work of disparate entities, and yet Neha had no need or apparent motive to murder her lady-in-waiting in such a violent fashion. Regardless of all else, he simply could not see her breaking her vigil beside Eris\u2019s body in order to commit the act, not when those were the final hours she\u2019d ever spend with him.</p><p>Venom gave a thoughtful nod, sliding his mirrored shades back over his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can, but I\u2019ll have to leave in three days at the most. Neha will not give me her indulgence beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a better judge of her mood than I\u2014go when you need to.\u201d Getting Venom\u2019s nod, he asked the vampire a question that had nothing to do with his task at the fort. \u201cHow is Sorrow?\u201d The girl had survived an attack from a mad archangel, come out of it infected by a toxin that had changed her from mortal to something other, her abilities erratic.</p><p>Venom\u2019s jaw went taut, tendons pushing against the skin of his neck. \u201cJanvier has taken over her vampiric training for the time being,\u201d he said, referring to the vampire who had worked directly under Dmitri on any number of operations and whose loyalty to the Tower was unquestioned\u2014though until now, it had been more useful to have him out in the world as an apparent free agent.</p><p>\u201cYou know how good Janvier is,\u201d Venom added, \u201cbut I\u2019ll have to return periodically to do the speed dances with her.\u201d</p><p>Venom could move with snake quickness, a skill Sorrow shared, though hers came from a different source. \u201cCan she call it up on command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And if she doesn\u2019t learn to do that, she\u2019ll die.\u201d Unforgiving words. \u201cBut Honor\u2019s right\u2014she needs to get the basics down first before I start pushing her again, or she\u2019ll make stupid mistakes speed alone can\u2019t cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s undertaking her physical training with Honor out of the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshwini.\u201d Venom\u2019s face thawed, his lips twitching a fraction. \u201cYou know what she did to Janvier the last time they met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney was involved.\u201d Jason had watched the hunter and the vampire spar since their first meeting, never quite understanding their relationship\u2014they were adversaries one minute, determined to run each other to the ground, and allies the next. It was Janvier Ashwini had taken with her when she\u2019d needed to work in Nazarach\u2019s dangerous territory, and it was Janvier whose sapphire pendant the hunter wore around her neck. Yet, as far as he knew, they had never been bedmates.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just sleep with one another?\u201d he asked Venom, wondering if he\u2019d missed a subtle nuance in their relationship.</p><p>Venom\u2019s chuckle was quiet, his eyes eerie in the sunshine as he pushed his sunglasses to the top of his head. \u201cThat is an enduring mystery.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cWho is that very pretty woman coming this way?\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t need to follow Venom\u2019s gaze\u2014he could feel Mahiya\u2019s presence as a gentle heat against his wings. \u201cThe Princess Mahiya, and she is mine.\u201d He had no right to make such a claim, but Venom had a way of charming women when he was in the mood, and Jason discovered he did not wish Mahiya to be charmed.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The vampire turned and jumped off the gate with an insouciant carelessness that had Mahiya\u2019s hand slapping over her heart.</p><p>But Venom came to a crouching landing on his toes, lithe as a cat. Landing beside him, Jason watched Mahiya rather than Venom as the vampire rose and bent over her hand. \u201cImpossible as it seems, I do not believe we have ever met.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s fascinated gaze lingered on Venom\u2019s eyes as he lifted his head and released her hand. \u201cNo . . . but I have heard of the vampire with the viper\u2019s eyes. You were based at the Delhi court in the main.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Venom agreed, \u201cbut I visited here more than once. You must\u2019ve been studying at the Refuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I believe you had sworn allegiance to Raphael by the time I returned to the fort.\u201d</p><p>Jason caught the fine tremor that rippled over Mahiya\u2019s skin as she spoke of a homecoming that must have been a terrifying experience for a young girl, and spread his wing just enough that it brushed over her own. It was an intimacy, and one she had not offered, one he\u2019d never have initiated had he stopped to think about it, yet instead of flinching, she relaxed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to finally make your acquaintance,\u201d she said to Venom, genuine warmth in her tone. \u201cNeha has always said you were one of her proudest Makings.\u201d</p><p>Venom\u2019s grin was sharp, his next words directed at Jason. \u201cShall we meet over dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to Mahiya\u2019s palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil then.\u201d He kissed Mahiya\u2019s hand again before departing.</p><p>Jason traced Mahiya\u2019s profile with his gaze as she watched the vampire leave. \u201cYou had no hesitation in allowing him to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was the shock first of all\u2014those eyes . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAnd then I saw he was your friend.\u201d</p><p>A fine crack, something fundamental breaking inside him.</p><p>Mahiya continued to speak when he didn\u2019t reply. \u201cNeha has tried to recreate the effect you know, and some of her Made have the slightest sense of it, but never has she succeeded as she did with Venom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be pleased to know he is unique,\u201d Jason said, examining the fissure she\u2019d created in his shields, the damage deep, repair no simple matter.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s bright eyes smiled at him. \u201cYou go to speak to the ladies-in-waiting?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took so long in replying her smiled faded, her expression intent. And he knew that he would touch her again should she give the slightest encouragement, his body hungry not just for sensation, but for the mystery and\u2014when her guard dropped\u2014the inexplicable sweetness that was Mahiya.</p><p>18</p><p>Mahiya watched after Jason\u2019s black-winged form as he rose up into the sky, the tiny hairs on her arms still standing up in reaction at the look she\u2019d caught in his eyes. The primal response wasn\u2019t fed by alarm or fear, but a passion that was no simple physical craving. Jason fascinated her on many levels. He was a rough-edged carving, a beautiful man she had the sense no woman had ever come close to taming.</p><p>It would be a shame were that ever to happen. His wildness was an integral part of him\u2014perhaps others would not deem it so, not given the cool distance with which he viewed the world, but Mahiya understood . . . she carried the same wildness within. Just because it had been imprisoned and confined and controlled didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there. Jason wore his nature in his skin, in the curving lines of a tattoo she wanted to trace with her fingertips . . . her lips.</p> <p>It was a dangerous admission, but lying to herself served no purpose. Better she accept she had a vulnerability where the inscrutable spymaster was concerned, so she could guard against the weakness. The only problem was, Mahiya wasn\u2019t certain she wanted to turn away from the shimmering dark of the nascent flame between them.</p><p>Jason landed behind Lisbeth where she sat on a marble bench in a small enclosed terrace garden off the palace that housed the ladies-in-waiting. Men were strictly forbidden in this area except if sent on business by Neha herself, all of the guards\u2014angelic and vampiric\u2014female.</p><p>The tiny woman jumped to her feet with a gasp. \u201cSir, I realize you are my lady\u2019s guest, but you cannot be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeha will not be displeased with you.\u201d She might be with Jason, but since she hadn\u2019t specifically barred him from talking to the ladies-in-waiting in their private quarters, he broke no rules. \u201cI wish to speak to you about Shabnam.\u201d</p><p>A change on her face, a quickness of thought. \u201cWe are distraught.\u201d Her eyes watered, the deep brown turning into shimmering topaz, her beauty luminous. Lifting a delicate lace handkerchief to her face, she dabbed at the crystalline purity of her tears.</p> <p>\u201cI am sorry to cause you further sorrow.\u201d He pitched his tone to soothe.</p><p>While he couldn\u2019t mimic emotion anywhere near as well as Lisbeth, he was proficient at using his voice as a weapon. Once, he\u2019d used it in song, but the songs in his heart had gone silent long ago, and he knew that one day so would his voice. A man who had nothing inside him eventually had nothing to say.</p><p>Wings of midnight blue and vivid green, a smile that saw too much, stirred things that had not been touched in an eon.</p><p>Lisbeth\u2019s voice tangled with the unexpected images whispering through his mind. \u201cIt is all right.\u201d Sniffing with a delicacy that did nothing to mar her beauty, she said, \u201cYou ask for help to seek Shabnam\u2019s murderer?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cDo you know of anything that may shed light on the matter?\u201d</p><p>A calculated hesitation before she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is dead.\u201d Jason added gentle, warm notes to his voice. \u201cWhat you say cannot hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, Lisbeth wrapped her arms around herself as if cold. \u201cIt is not done to speak ill of the dead, but . . . Shabnam was not faithful to her lover.\u201d The words were shaped with utmost sincerity, yet Jason knew them for a lie. Still, he allowed her to continue, wanting to see how black she would paint the victim. \u201cShe was generous with her favors . . . particularly when it came to the guards\u2014I believe she thought to ease her way into places we are not meant to go.\u201d</p><p>An adroit accusation of spying, perhaps even treason. \u201cDo you believe one of the guards may have become jealous?\u201d he asked, acting obtuse on purpose.</p><p>The faintest hint of impatience flittered across her face, fracturing the thus far flawless illusion of beautiful sorrow. \u201cI\u2019m sure for all her airs, Shabnam was nothing but a diversion for them. But her family, they\u2019re proud. They may have considered her actions shameful.\u201d A demure downsweep of curling black lashes. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing them of anything, and I\u2019m sure they would never . . . but you asked. And I just wanted\u2014 Oh, forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your trust. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She could not quite keep her smug satisfaction out of her voice. \u201cI only hope I helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very much.\u201d Excusing himself, Jason rose into the air. It didn\u2019t take him long to track down the rest of the ladies-in-waiting. They were creatures who did not like to go too far from their habitat, fearing another would take their place or gain some favor from which they were excluded.</p><p>Everyone but for Shabnam\u2019s sparrow-winged friend, Tanuja, attempted to malign the victim. One even insinuated that she\u2019d seduced Eris. However, Tanuja was adamant that Shabnam had been a faithful lover and no spy.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a nice person,\u201d Tanuja sobbed, skin of soft brown blotchy from her distress. \u201cToo nice for this pit of vipers, and the fact that she was a favorite with Neha only made the others act uglier toward her. She used to laugh and say they were jealous witches, but now she\u2019s dead.\u201d A hard stare out of red-rimmed eyes. \u201cLisbeth may not like getting her hands dirty, but she comes from a family that doesn\u2019t mind blood.\u201d</p><p>The sky was the lush gray of a balmy evening when he came in to land on the balcony outside his suite. Ignoring his own doors, he knocked on Mahiya\u2019s. She opened the left side a fraction, her wary expression changing the instant she saw him. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you!\u201d Smile reaching her eyes to light them to tawny brightness, she pulled the doors fully open.</p><p>At that instant, Jason felt something slam into him, a powerful, amorphous realization that he tried to capture, to examine, but it was so much smoke, wisping out of his hand yet leaving an imprint behind. \u201cWhy were you worried?\u201d he asked, feeling as if he\u2019d been marked in some immutable way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Mahiya shook her head. \u201cCome in first. The food is hot.\u201d</p><p>Walking inside when she turned away, he shut the doors at his back. She didn\u2019t startle at the act, the silverwork on the pale pink of her fitted tunic and on the ankle cuffs of her white harem-style pants catching the light from the tiny crystal chandelier above. The comb in her neatly bound hair was intricately worked silver set with diamonds, the gauzy white scarf thrown over her shoulders from her front embellished with threads of the same metallic shade at the ends. \u201cYou dress formally.\u201d</p><p>Taking a graceful seat on the flat cushion in front of the low table, her wings spread out behind her in a glory of emerald and peacock blue with splashes of jet, she picked up the water jug. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to dress, too. Neha has summoned us to a formal dinner. But we have time enough to eat and drink.\u201d</p><p>He took his place opposite her, noticing the color on her lips, the skillful use of other cosmetics to highlight her cheekbones while playing down her eyes. This, too, he thought, was a subtle mask. \u201cThe food at dinner will not be agreeable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food will be exquisite, but the conversation will curdle my stomach. And you will be too busy watching and listening to everyone to eat more than a bite or two.\u201d</p><p>He thought perhaps the strange sensation in his chest might be amusement. Illium occasionally incited the same response in him, but this was somehow gentler, more tender. \u201cIn that case, I thank you for your thoughtfulness.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sharp look, eyes narrowed. \u201cBe careful or I\u2019ll stop feeding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great punishment indeed.\u201d And it would be; this fragile ritual of homecoming was important to him in a way she could not comprehend. \u201cMay I have some water?\u201d he said, absently noticing a little bag of carrots set on a small table that held an unlit lamp, as if Mahiya had put the bag down, then forgotten about it.</p><p>\u201cSince you asked so nicely.\u201d Lips twitching, she poured it for him, then removed the lids off the trays that sat between them. \u201cI was in the mood to cook, so you have several choices. Do you want to try a little of each?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He knew he should protest the way she served him, but she seemed to take pleasure from it . . . and so did he. So he stayed silent, took the plate she made up for him. As they ate, his mind cascaded with memories of how he\u2019d tried to cook after he was alone, how he\u2019d burned everything, lived on fruits and raw cassava root for a time until his stomach rebelled.</p><p>Later, when he\u2019d arrived at the Refuge, he\u2019d demanded to be treated as an adult regardless of his chronological age, and no one had argued. Until Mahiya, he wouldn\u2019t have said he\u2019d missed such a quiet indication of care as someone bothering to notice whether he ate or not.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, after they\u2019d cleared away the plates and she\u2019d poured them both mint tea, refreshing and strong, \u201ctell me if the reason your stomach will curdle is the same one that made you afraid to open the door.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya looked at him over the top of her teacup, tendrils of steam caressing her lips. \u201cAre you always this persistent?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, and her lips parted in a quiet laugh. \u201cOf course you are. How else would you have become the best spymaster in the Cadre?\u201d Cupping her hands around the tea, she said, \u201cArav . . . a man with whom I had a relationship when I was little more than a girl\u201d\u2014the laughter leaching out of her eyes\u2014\u201cis in the fort, and he\u2019s being persistent, too, in an unwelcome way.\u201d</p><p>Black fire, cold and deadly, formed in his bloodstream. \u201cDid he touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly my hand.\u201d Putting down her cup, she rubbed at that hand. \u201cHe caught me in the courtyard an hour ago when he had no reason to be on this level of the fort. I know he did it to remind me of his presence, to intimidate\u2014I walked away from him earlier, and no one does that.\u201d</p><p>Jason listened as she told him of her morning encounter with the angel, the black fire within tempered a fraction when she added, \u201cIt may not have been the smartest move to deliberately antagonize him, but it was satisfying, and I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d She set her jaw, as if expecting censure.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a hundred and twenty-three,\u201d Jason said, making a note to pay Arav a visit in the darkest hour of night, remind the other man of the acrid taste of fear, \u201cI asked Michaela to dance.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because he\u2019d been drunk on her beauty\u2014he\u2019d always seen the truth of her selfish heart\u2014but because he\u2019d wanted to experience that drunkenness, wanted to feel more than the remote distance that was his normal mode of existence. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t an archangel then, but still a queen, her power immense.\u201d</p><p>Eyes huge, Mahiya leaned forward. \u201cWell?\u201d she demanded with unhidden impatience. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was so astonished at my gall she said yes.\u201d And he\u2019d had his question answered; whatever it was that was broken in him, even the proximity of the most beautiful woman in the world couldn\u2019t fix it. \u201cAfterward, Raphael told me she could just as well have taken offense and killed me on the spot . . . but I wasn\u2019t sorry, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mahiya laughed again, the vivid clarity of her eyes sparking with flecks of gold that captivated him, because he\u2019d never before glimpsed those flickers of shimmering metal. And he thought that perhaps the young man he\u2019d been might have been wrong, that perhaps even a frozen heart might one day be awakened.</p><p>\u201cSurely,\u201d she said when she caught her breath, \u201cyou were legend among your peers.\u201d</p><p>Jason hadn\u2019t had many friends back then, but he\u2019d had Dmitri and Raphael. \u201cRaphael poured me a glass of a thousand-year-old Scotch then, together with Dmitri, toasted me on my balls.\u201d It had been another link in his relationship with the two men, a link that had been further strengthened over the years, each of the others in the Seven adding their own pieces to create a chain that held him to the world, to life.</p><p>\u201cI do not think Neha has ever been so informal with any of her court,\u201d Mahiya said. \u201cThough I didn\u2019t know her when she was as young as Raphael must\u2019ve been at your first meeting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Lijuan the next time we cross paths.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s eyes flicked up, widened, then sparkled once again. \u201cYou do know how to laugh!\u201d She lifted a single finger to lips curved in mischief. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will believe you in any case.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya put down her cup, the tea almost spilling. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you made me giggle,\u201d she accused between gulps of air.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t move his eyes away from the luminous joy of her, his fingers itching to grip her chin, tug her across the table so he could taste lips shiny wet from her last sip of tea. \u201cWho else will be at this dinner?\u201d he asked, as her smile faded to be replaced by a hectic flush of color on her cheekbones.</p> <p>Swallowing, she dipped her head in the guise of pouring more tea, but he saw her fingers tremble, his every hunting instinct roaring to the surface. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a small group, I think.\u201d She went through a concise list of possible guests, while he struggled to contain the primal urge to shove the table aside and quench the thirst he had for this princess with her stubborn hope and her heart untainted by poison and her way of looking at him that said she might just accede to his every demand.</p><p>\u201cWhether she wears mourning white or not,\u201d Mahiya added without meeting his gaze, \u201cNeha grieves for Eris\u2014even as she continues to hate him. So it will be a solemn affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>The centuries-old echo was a chilling reminder that love and hate were often intimately intertwined\u2014in a way that might be incomprehensible to a child, but that the man understood too well. As that man understood the embers of need in his gut would not go cold until he\u2019d gorged himself on the soft skin and pleasure-riven cries of the Princess Mahiya.</p><p>\u201cMahiya.\u201d</p><p>Fingers tucking back a tendril of hair. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said, reaching across to cup her chin, brush his thumb across her lower lip, \u201cyou must decide something tonight.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>Mahiya tidied away the tea things after Jason left to change, carrying them down to her small private kitchen. Where she poured herself a glass of ice-cold water. \u201cDear God.\u201d</p><p>Jason was . . .</p><p>Shuddering, she rolled the cold glass over her neck. But, in spite of the sexual fire that smoldered between them, threatening to turn her bones molten, she had no rose-colored lenses clouding her eyes and her judgment, understood that Jason was a top-of-the-food-chain predator with loyalty to a rival archangel. More, he was a spymaster with centuries of experience at intrigue, could well be playing her for reasons of his own.</p><p>But . . . he made her no promises, and thus, he would not break them. He listened to her. Treated her as someone with worth. And if that worth was only in the information she could give him, he was truthful about that, too. She took it as no insult, for Jason was in the business of information.</p><p>As for the lack of love words and pretty courtship? Mahiya shook her head. She would far rather be with a man who was honest in his desire than with one who brutalized her with the sweet lies of seduction. Jason had more honor in a single bone of his body than Arav would know in a lifetime.</p><p>Heading back upstairs, she refreshed her makeup before pressing a sparkling silver teardrop to her forehead, centering it between her eyebrows. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered to her reflection. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d</p> <p>The single knock came just then, as if he\u2019d heard her. Slipping her feet into flat silver sandals, she took a deep breath and walked out of the bedroom and across the living area to open the door\u2014to reveal Jason\u2019s harsh masculine beauty showcased in a flawlessly fitted black suit worn with a steel gray shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d Beautiful, his hair in that neat queue she felt a sudden urge to undo. \u201cNeha will be pleased.\u201d Jason\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, and yet she knew\u2014\u201cYou care nothing of what Neha thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said, letting her precede him down the stairs.</p><p>Her nape prickled, not in warning, but with the awareness that he was watching her body move. It made her breath catch, her skin stretch taut over her flesh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never a smart idea to enrage an archangel,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut while she may demand it, Neha will never admire subservience.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya shook her head as they exited the palace. \u201cYour opinion is colored by your strength.\u201d A strength she knew he\u2019d had from a very young age. \u201cYou can afford to rouse her anger, for she sees you, if not as an equal, then as someone intriguing enough not to summarily kill. You do not know what it is to fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t always the man I am now,\u201d Jason said, a door unlocking inside his mind, spilling a cold shadow across his soul.</p><p>She looked at him from the other side of the room, her pretty dark brown eyes filmed over with a whiteness that was wrong. The stump of her neck was crusted with blood where it sat on the table in the corner, as if placed there for just this purpose.</p><p>He didn\u2019t scream. He knew never to scream. Instead, he looked at the chunk of meat that had been blocking the trapdoor. It wore a silk sheath of brilliant amethyst.</p><p>Amethyst. That\u2019s what his mother always called her favorite color. Amethyst.</p><p>It had taken him a long time to say it right, and she\u2019d always laughed in delight when he used the word, her shining black hair dancing in the sunshine.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d A softly feminine face lit to glowing warmth by the lamps along the pathway, concern in every line. \u201cYou . . . weren\u2019t here. Where did you go?\u201d</p><p>Brilliant white sands beneath his small feet, burning hot. The wind waving through the palm trees, sending a coconut plummeting to the sand with a dull thud. The gulls gossiping up and down the wet sand, leaving three-clawed footprints the sea erased with its next crashing arrival.</p><p>\u201cJason! Come in and eat your lunch before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA place that no longer exists,\u201d he said gently, and removed the hand she\u2019d placed on his chest . . . to resettle it around his upper left arm, where it wouldn\u2019t get in the way if he had to reach for his sword. \u201cAbout Arav,\u201d he said, while they were still private, \u201cyou have no cause to fear him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very strong.\u201d The concern in her eyes lingered, grew. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly how strong he is.\u201d Though they\u2019d never met, the fact the man was one of Neha\u2019s generals meant Jason had made it a point to learn about him\u2014and, in spite of his arrogance and posturing, Arav was no peer of Jason\u2019s. \u201cHe is like a peacock, spreading his feathers and squawking loudly to distract you from the fact his body is but weak.\u201d</p><p>A stifled laugh, genuine delight that was a kind of music. \u201cI propose a rooster would be the better analogy,\u201d she whispered, \u201cstrutting and pecking anyone who gets in his way.\u201d Releasing his arm, she lowered her voice even further as they entered corridors peopled by servants and courtiers both. \u201cHe is merely the first. Many will come, hoping to take Eris\u2019s place, or at least the place he would\u2019ve had but for his inability to keep his lusts in control.\u201d</p><p>He saw the speculative glances they attracted, made no move to widen the distance between them, the occasional brush of her wing against his a welcome caress. \u201cDid you ever consider Eris your father in truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after I realized he wanted me dead.\u201d A false smile for the benefit of those who watched, but the woman with mischief in her voice was gone, washed away on the waves of memory and the cruel reality of life. \u201cI was a child. It broke my heart to realize the handsome man Neha took me to meet every week hated the sight of me. I didn\u2019t understand then that she was using me as a weapon.\u201d</p><p>Jason had always dealt in information, until gathering it was part of his very nature, but he wished he\u2019d remained silent this night and allowed Mahiya\u2019s eyes to laugh awhile longer.</p><p>\u201cAre you close to your father?\u201d she asked, rifling the pages of his own memory.</p><p>\u201cHere, son. You use the string to pull it forward so. Do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Before his father had been eaten away from the inside out, the progression of what Jason thought of as a disease so slow and stealthy that no one who had seen him had realized the true depth of the demons he fought. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her fingers alighted for a fleeting instant on his forearm, and he felt the touch all the way to his bones.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d He\u2019d learned to live with the ghosts. \u201cTell me about Anoushka,\u201d he said, closing the door on the memories. \u201cOf her relationship with Eris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they may have been close when she was young,\u201d Mahiya said slowly, the scent of her a subtle blend of exotic flowers and some bright spice that fascinated. \u201cBut when I knew her, she held him in contempt, considering him weak and spineless. I never saw her betray that to Neha, however.\u201d</p><p>No, Jason thought, Anoushka had been too smart to alienate her mother that way.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Mahiya halted before the Palace of Jewels.</p><p>What appeared to be a thousand candles flickered along the outer wall, in alcoves and on special stands, each flame refracted by the diamonds that studded the palace, until the entire building was ablaze, an astonishing work of art. \u201cThis,\u201d he said with utmost honesty, \u201cis stunning.\u201d No wonder Neha preferred it over larger, more ornate palaces.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mahiya\u2019s reply was soft. \u201cIt fascinated me as a child.\u201d</p><p>Something there, a hitch in her voice. But he had no chance to follow up on it, because they\u2019d been seen by the guards. Opening the doors, the two vampires bowed deeply as they passed. Jason was unused to such subservience\u2014Raphael\u2019s Tower functioned in a far different fashion\u2014but he was no longer the uneducated boy-man who\u2019d made his way to the Refuge by shadowing other angels.</p><p>His father had chosen an island out of the way of angelic sky roads by design, and so it was the rare angel indeed who had passed over Jason after he was alone. He\u2019d tried to hail them, but he\u2019d been too small and weak to fly up high enough to catch their attention before they were out of range. So he\u2019d survived, grown stronger . . . and after a while, he\u2019d stopped his attempts to alert others to his existence, and simply waited\u2014until he knew he was strong enough to fly for a full day and night without failing, should there be no islands where he could rest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the interim, he\u2019d lived in silence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame the boy\u2019s a mute. The instruments he makes are things of such virtuosity, you\u2019d think he\u2019d learned from Yaviel himself.\u201d</p><p>Jason had never been mute. He\u2019d just needed to remember how to speak. And he\u2019d done that by watching and listening. Those skills would hold him in good stead tonight. The room in front of him was warm with candlelight, a table of honey-colored wood polished to such a high sheen that it glowed like amber set upon the carpet, the seat cushions of the matching chairs a rich claret. It was a contrast to the pale colors chosen by the guests, the conversation muted, for no one was yet ready to dance on Eris\u2019s grave.</p><p>Save perhaps a man Jason identified as Arav from the way he\u2019d made a place for himself at Neha\u2019s side, a charming, elegant companion as the archangel played gracious hostess. Jason knew she hid a terrible sadness behind that persona, but in itself, it was no lie.</p> <p>\u201cI have never been to a court as gracious as the one Neha keeps.\u201d Dmitri played a knife through his fingers, one of three he\u2019d brought back from Neha\u2019s territory. \u201cShe truly believes in giving honor to a visitor.\u201d He threw the knife at Jason.</p><p>He threw it back as Venom added, \u201cThough she might have that guest neatly executed while the court sleeps.\u201d</p><p>Venom\u2019s response was as accurate as Dmitri\u2019s\u2014Neha was no two-dimensional caricature. No archangel was, and to believe otherwise was to set yourself up for a nasty surprise. Jason had no intention of falling prey to such blindness. Some mortals might seek to see divinity in the archangels, but Jason saw them for what they were\u2014creatures of violent power who\u2019d had millennia to hone their every lethal edge.</p><p>Right then, the Queen of Snakes, of Poisons, turned, met his gaze.</p><p>Jason inclined his head but didn\u2019t move toward her, and she returned the greeting before shifting her attention to the guest who stood in front of her.</p> <p>\u201cThe vampire heading this way,\u201d Mahiya said sotto voce after the silent exchange, \u201cis Rhys, one of Neha\u2019s trusted inner council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met him in the Refuge.\u201d However, he didn\u2019t know anyone in the room as well as Mahiya did, intended to ask her for her opinions after this was done.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d A polite nod before Rhys turned his attention to Mahiya. \u201cYou are looking lovely, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s response was warm enough that he realized she liked Rhys. \u201cThank you, sir. Is Brigitte well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, indeed, though you know her.\u201d A smile shared between the two. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my beloved is not a court creature,\u201d he said to Jason. \u201cHowever, she is so good at her job as a cryptographer that Neha forgives her the eccentricity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of her work.\u201d Everyone in Jason\u2019s profession knew her name. \u201cI\u2019ve even attempted to lure her away a time or two.\u201d</p> <p>The other man laughed, his eyes twinkling. \u201cAh, I must admit, I was aware of that. She was very flattered, but we are loyal.\u201d</p><p>While the spymaster in him was disappointed in that fact, the Jason who was one of the Seven understood the decision.</p><p>\u201cNow Neha tries to lure you away.\u201d Rhys\u2019s tone was warm, but the icy calculation in his eyes made it clear he considered Jason a threat to the security of the fort.</p><p>Jason said nothing to that\u2014silence was often a better weapon than words. Instead, he chose to direct Rhys\u2019s attention to another threat. \u201cThe fort hosts a visitor who wants to be consort, it seems.\u201d</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t turn to look at Arav. \u201cThere are always pretenders.\u201d A hardness in his tone betrayed the blooded general beneath the mask of courtesy, before he excused himself to talk with a female angel Jason knew to be another one of Neha\u2019s inner council.</p><p>\u201cTell me about him,\u201d Jason said to Mahiya.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s response was quiet, with an undertone of steel. \u201cI have come to realize exactly how much you like to give orders.\u201d</p><p>Jason considered her words as he watched the intriguing flow and interplay of the people in the room. \u201cYou aren\u2019t my equal,\u201d he said, and it was a test.</p> <p>She fisted, then flexed the hand he could see. \u201cI carry the information you need about the people here.\u201d The smile she sent him was a creation of such feminine complexity he knew he was seeing and understanding only half of it. \u201cAt least for this moment\u201d\u2014a shadow flitting over her eyes\u2014\u201cI hold the cards.\u201d</p><p>Jason had no reference point for how to behave with a woman who was not his lover and yet already knew him better than any lover ever had. Such intimacy, he thought, was a thing of give and take and constant balance.</p><p>\u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making breakfast. Yavi!\u201d</p><p>His father with his arms around his mother\u2019s waist, twirling her around the kitchen, their wings sweeping out to send Jason\u2019s hair back from his face as he sat playing with his blocks on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPut me down!\u201d A laughing command. \u201cYavi! The pancakes are burning.\u201d</p><p>Bending her over his arm, his father claimed a smiling kiss. \u201cSay please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about him . . . please,\u201d he said to this woman with whom he might never dance, but who had a claim on his loyalty nonetheless.</p><p>Shooting him another impenetrable look, she turned her face forward, and he thought he\u2019d missed something, a moment, an emotion slipping through the cracks, water through his fingers . . . as his mother\u2019s severed head had once slipped from his hands to hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part, Rhys is what he appears.\u201d Mahiya\u2019s voice cut over the dull thud of sound that had followed him through time. \u201cHe has been with Neha for over six centuries and is not ambitious\u2014except if anyone dares threaten his position at her side.</p><p>\u201cEris as consort-in-name posed no such threat,\u201d she added as the same thought passed through his mind. \u201cRhys knew that when it came time to discuss politics and war, power and strategy, Neha would seek his own counsel. Arav, however, is a very able general himself, has led Neha\u2019s troops in battle. More, he is as efficient at dealing with angelic politics as Rhys.\u201d</p><p>The other man looked up at that instant, as did Neha. This time, the archangel flowed toward Jason. \u201cI have never seen you dressed thus,\u201d she said, her approval patent. \u201cAll of Raphael\u2019s Seven do clean up well, even that barbarian general of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell Galen you said as much,\u201d Jason said, knowing the weapons master didn\u2019t give a damn about what any woman but one thought of him.</p><p>Gaze shifting to Mahiya, Neha said, \u201cYou do not greet Arav,\u201d in a tone rimmed with frost.</p><p>20</p><p>\u201cWe met in the courtyard.\u201d Mahiya kept her voice even, refusing to give Arav the satisfaction of seeing her stumble. Maybe her courage came from having Jason\u2019s dark strength beside her\u2014but she didn\u2019t think so. Arav was the one individual who could make her forget reason and step perilously close to insult.</p><p>\u201cInsult to a guest is an insult to me.\u201d</p><p>Something Neha had said long ago to the child Mahiya had been when she\u2019d returned to the fort for a visit during a break in her schooling. She\u2019d never liked those visits, her time at the school with Jessamy the happiest of her life. The censure that particular day hadn\u2019t been personal, and yet the way the archangel had looked at her had made the tiny hairs on the back of her neck prickle in warning.</p><p>The instant Neha had left, she\u2019d run back to the nanny who looked after her when she was at the fort, the same one who\u2019d later told her nothing she\u2019d ever do would please Neha.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the lady like me?\u201d</p><p>Her nanny\u2019s stern face set into a frown before she gave a curt nod. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to know. Though you must never repeat this in public, your father is Eris, Neha\u2019s consort. Your mother was Neha\u2019s sister, Nivriti.\u201d</p><p>She was small, didn\u2019t immediately understand. \u201cThey shared a consort?\u201d</p><p>Horror filled her nanny\u2019s expression. \u201cNever speak such filth, child.\u201d Putting away the tunic she\u2019d been folding, she shut the dresser. \u201cYour mother seduced a man who was not her own, and she bore the fruit of their ugliness.\u201d</p><p>Me, Mahiya thought, the fruit is me. \u201cI\u2019m ugly?\u201d</p><p>A sigh, a softening in her nanny\u2019s face. \u201cYou are not ugly, child, but you remind my lady of that ugliness. It is a testament to her kind nature that you are given all the rights and privileges of a princess.\u201d</p><p>The latter, of course, was a lie. But even Mahiya would concede that Neha\u2019s treatment of her while she\u2019d been a minor had been scrupulous. Perhaps there\u2019d been no warmth, but there\u2019d been no abuse, either. She\u2019d attended the Refuge school, studied in its libraries\u2014and there, she\u2019d had access to Jessamy\u2019s kindness and guidance, felt what it was to be loved, for the Teacher loved all her students.</p><p>Then she\u2019d come \u201chome,\u201d turned a hundred . . . and learned that Neha\u2019s cruelty had simply been saved for the adult that hopeful, innocent child had become. The man who stood beside Neha was proof enough of that cruelty\u2014even if the archangel hadn\u2019t ordered the seduction, she hadn\u2019t warned Mahiya about Arav\u2019s duplicitous courtship, either, making certain that Mahiya\u2019s first taste of romantic love would be a bitter one.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you had spoken with Mahiya.\u201d Neha\u2019s voice was silk over steel.</p><p>Arav\u2019s cheeks creased in a smile that glowed with charm. \u201cWe passed as I was on my way to speak to you.\u201d He favored Mahiya with a condescending look of approval. \u201cI did not say how glad I am to see you looking so well.\u201d Raising his glass, he took a sip of wine, the square ring on his index finger flashing vivid blue in the candlelight, the stone a rare form of tourmaline.</p><p>\u201cHe is like a peacock, spreading his feathers and squawking loudly . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said with a smile so dazzling, it took Arav visibly aback.</p><p>Small crystalline sounds silvered through the air as the glass bangles on Neha\u2019s wrist moved against one another. \u201cCome. Let us be seated.\u201d Her gaze landed on Jason. \u201cAs guest at the fort, you sit on my left. Arav can entertain Mahiya\u2014they are great friends.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya felt an ineffable tension radiating off the man next to her, though his expression remained opaque, and she knew it was because of her. She also knew she couldn\u2019t allow him to make an enemy of an archangel in an effort to spare her from Arav\u2019s attentions. \u201cActually,\u201d she said with a quick smile, \u201cI see scholar Quinn across the room. I\u2019ve just read his newest treatise, and I promised him I would talk with him about it.\u201d</p><p>Neha didn\u2019t bristle\u2014the vampire was one of her favorites. That mattered less than the fact that Jason was no longer a blade about to be unsheathed.</p><p>\u201cAll in all,\u201d Mahiya said to Jason after the tea had been served and they were readying themselves to return to their palace, \u201cit was not so terrible a dinner party.\u201d Quinn had been a lovely companion, and Neha had been so engrossed in conversation with Rhys and Jason that she\u2019d ignored Arav most of the night. \u201cArav has no idea who he\u2019s dealing with\u2014Neha\u2019s playing with him as a cat does with a mouse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason\u2019s response to her murmured supposition was silence. She didn\u2019t read anything into it. He was, she thought as they walked out and began to cross the courtyard, thinking about the subject before he replied. \u201cTemperature\u2019s dipped.\u201d Still, the night air was relatively balmy\u2014though when she glanced up, it was to see the stars hidden by fat clouds that threatened rain.</p><p>When something fell from that sky, she thought it must be a bird, it was such a tiny thing. But then it grew bigger and bigger and\u2014\u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>However, Jason had already seen. Instead of running toward the body that had just crashed to the earth in a splatter of blood and bone that sprayed guests closer to the impact site, he shot straight up into the air, chasing the one responsible for the carnage.</p><p>Mouth dry, Mahiya watched him go, a black arrow soon invisible against the night, then made her way to the body, taking care not to step in the gore. She shut out the sound of a woman screaming about the blood on her face, the deeper voices of the men who called out to one another in a panic, the snap of the wind as others took off in pursuit, and swallowing her gorge, she focused only on the identity of the body.</p> <p>That square ring of rare blue tourmaline, those mottled brown wings . . .</p><p>For a second, her brain couldn\u2019t quite process what it was she was seeing, and then all her synapses fired, connections made, and she realized the angel without a head and likely without internal organs, was . . . \u201cArav.\u201d</p><p>Jason was fast, an ace at vertical takeoffs, but his prey had disappeared by the time he breached the heavy layer of dense waterlogged clouds. Given the limited time frame and Jason\u2019s speed, he guessed the killer had flown just out of visual range, then dropped in a steep dive to slip into a hiding place.</p><p>Cocking his ear to the wind, he listened to where it had been interrupted, used it to track as one of the hunter born might use a scent. The ephemeral trace ended abruptly in the mountains just beyond the fort. Conscious his quarry had had enough time to take a low flight path, backtracking while Jason was above the cloud layer, he nonetheless landed and began to scan the rocky ground around him. There was no overt sign that anyone had landed, nothing but darkness\u2014</p><p>Shimmering blue green caught by a ray of silver before the moon was hidden behind a cloud again.</p> <p>Sliding the feather into his pocket for later examination, he flew up and back to Mahiya, confident that no matter her shock, she would not have broken.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Rather, she\u2019d nudged one of the senior guard into organizing a perimeter around the splatter, though Jason expected the guard thought it all his own idea. \u201cGood girl,\u201d he murmured, and was almost expecting the raised eyebrow.</p><p>Then she shook her head, and he thought perhaps they\u2019d just had a conversation.</p><p>Storing the moment to reflect on later, he sent two of the guards to find either high-powered portable lamps or torches. While they did that, he took in the bloody ruin of Arav\u2019s body, weighed it against the wider situation. Shabnam\u2019s murder could perhaps be put down to a smart copycat using Eris\u2019s death as cover, but Arav\u2019s?</p><p>It stretched the bounds of coincidence that a second hunter had been waiting to take advantage of the circumstances. There had to be a hidden connection between the victims he wasn\u2019t yet seeing. Also, given how determined Arav had been to act Neha\u2019s port in a storm, it must\u2019ve been a strong temptation indeed that had drawn him up into the skies, away from those who might oppose his bid to be Neha\u2019s next consort.</p> <p>Jason considered the way Arav had looked at Mahiya when he\u2019d thought himself safe from other eyes toward the end of the dinner, his mask slipping to reveal an ugly possessiveness that said he saw Mahiya as nothing but a trophy, a thing to be taken and used.</p><p>As Jason had already decided to teach the other angel a lesson in fear he\u2019d never forget, he wasn\u2019t particularly motivated to discover Arav\u2019s killer. However, Shabnam had done nothing to deserve the death meted out to her, and so it was for her that he began to consider the hows and whys of this crime.</p><p>A man such as Arav might well find himself unable to control the impulse to take what he wanted should the chance arise. Yet in spite of the feather Jason had found\u2014been meant to find?\u2014Mahiya had never left Jason\u2019s sight, couldn\u2019t have lured Arav into the skies.</p><p>Another woman?</p><p>Arav wouldn\u2019t be so stupid, not now.</p><p>That left politics. It was a surety that Arav had had a spy of his own in the court. Again, however, the timing didn\u2019t make sense\u2014why would the angel choose to meet his spy now? Yes, he\u2019d disappeared outside for a cigar, but it had been clear to Jason that the other man was merely passing time until Neha finished speaking to her guests.</p><p>With Rhys having left earlier, Arav had had a clear run at lingering to be the last remaining guest. He would never have chanced missing that opportunity and the associated privacy to advance his embryonic courtship, regardless of any temptations of the flesh.</p><p>Rhys?</p> <p>It had surprised Jason when Neha\u2019s senior general had taken his leave while Arav was still buzzing around the archangel, but the move would make perfect sense had Rhys planned an ambush. Rhys wouldn\u2019t even have to worry about skirting the attention of the guards. He was a general known to hold the loyalty of his men\u2014because he did not mind getting blood on his own hands.</p><p>\u201cWere you here when Arav stepped outside?\u201d he asked the closest guard, an angel who stood stiff backed and at attention, facing outward from the body.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I was flying past when he plummeted, came to see if I could help.\u201d A small pause as he glanced around at the other guards present. \u201cI think Ishya and Gregor\u2014who went to get a lantern\u2014would\u2019ve been on the doors at the time.\u201d</p><p>Jason spoke to the petite, competent Ishya next, was told that yes, she and Gregor had seen Arav walk outside for a cigar. \u201cHowever,\u201d the vampire said, \u201che didn\u2019t remain by the palace. I heard him comment to another guest that he\u2019d walk off the dinner while he waited to speak to Lady Neha.\u201d Ishya nodded at the courtyard garden, left in heavy darkness as a frame for the glittering Palace of Jewels. \u201cAs our task was to monitor the door, we didn\u2019t follow his path. Jian was on the other side of the courtyard, may have seen more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the glow of his cigar in the dark,\u201d Jian confirmed, his uptilted eyes speaking of the edges of Neha\u2019s territory, where it brushed up against Lijuan\u2019s, his wings a dusty white speckled with amber at the edges. \u201cOnce I recognized him as an invited guest, I continued on in my perimeter check. He\u2019d vanished by the time of my next pass.\u201d</p><p>Gregor returned with the portable outdoor lamps then, and Jason waited until the strong light sources were set up to talk to the vampire. He supported Ishya\u2019s story but added, \u201cI did see someone fly down toward Arav as he disappeared out of view, but he didn\u2019t raise an alarm so I thought it must be a friend.\u201d When asked for specifics about the second angel, all he could say was, \u201cA woman . . . maybe. Or a slender man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Leaving the mangled remains lit to garish brightness, raw red and wet pink over broken feathers of mottled brown, he nodded at Mahiya to make certain no one disturbed the scene, and walked inside the Palace of Jewels. Neha paced within, her anger so frigid it had frosted the mirrors.</p><p>So.</p><p>\u201cGames,\u201d she hissed. \u201cSomeone is playing games in my court.\u201d</p><p>Yes. It was only the pattern that was proving elusive. Eris had been Neha\u2019s consort, Audrey the woman who\u2019d thought to cuckold an archangel, Shabnam a lady-in-waiting Neha had mourned with genuine sorrow, and Arav a suitor the archangel had been playing on a leash for her own amusement.</p><p>Jason accepted his initial conclusion had been false; Neha was innocent of the murders of Eris and Audrey. Rather, she\u2019d been framed with a cunning that had fooled him and Mahiya both. A smart opponent, then, and one with enough skill and power to evade elite guards and lure both a lady and an experienced general to their deaths.</p><p>\u201cA woman . . . maybe. Or a slender man.\u201d</p><p>It could still be either. The lure didn\u2019t have to be sexual, not when immortals played games of power.</p><p>\u201cYou will find the person responsible,\u201d Neha ordered, her breath white in the chilled air. \u201cYou have the resources of the fort at your command.\u201d</p><p>He understood he was being given freedom beyond that which he\u2019d first been offered. \u201cAre you aware of any reason why Arav might have been a target?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was not even meant to be here,\u201d Neha said, wings sweeping across the frost-lined floor, the tips glittering with broken-off flecks of ice. \u201cHe came to pay his respects after hearing of Eris\u2019s death, stayed to press his suit.\u201d She shook her head, her voice becoming strangely quiet. \u201cHe must\u2019ve believed me cold of heart indeed, to think I would welcome a courtship when I stood vigil over my husband\u2019s funeral pyre only this morn.\u201d</p><p>Arav\u2019s murder had been a chance opportunity, then, no finely tuned plan. \u201cThis will take longer than I initially estimated,\u201d he said. \u201cI may have to leave your territory for a period to take care of certain other matters.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s eyes hit him full force, her skin incandescent with the lethal power that made her one of the Cadre.</p><p>21</p><p>\u201cDo not break your word and my faith, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never lied to you,\u201d he said, noting the ice that had begun to crawl up the walls, just as Mahiya had described. Mastery over the elements had never before been part of Neha\u2019s repertoire.</p><p>It seemed many archangels were evolving.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said at long last, the chill in the room retreating a fraction. \u201cUnexpected for a spymaster, but you have honor. It is why I accepted your blood vow.\u201d At that instant, she was the Neha of old, before Eris, before Anoushka. A deadly immortal, but one with a mind unclouded by bitterness or rage. \u201cIf you do need to be absent, make it fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll attempt to negate the need.\u201d Already working out how that could be done, he took his leave and exited to find that Rhys had arrived, along with a forensic team that was as modern as the fort was not.</p><p>He would\u2019ve preferred his own team, but his instincts argued against Rhys\u2019s involvement in the murders. Jason had studied the man, understood he was an angel from another time. Though he was imminently capable of killing Shabnam, he wouldn\u2019t have left her with her breasts exposed. \u201cAny signs of life?\u201d Arav was a very powerful immortal\u2014he could conceivably regenerate his head, missing arm, and torn-off wing.</p><p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it the night, but his blood\u2019s begun to crystallize. He\u2019s not rising from this.\u201d</p><p>Jason sensed the same. The insult from the high-velocity fall had obliterated the other damage, but he had the feeling Arav\u2019s internal organs had been ripped out, along with his spinal cord. Jason could survive such an insult to his body, was certain Rhys could, too, but Arav hadn\u2019t been in that league. \u201cDid the same forensic team cover Shabnam\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014the report would\u2019ve been ready tonight but for this,\u201d Rhys answered. \u201cHowever, Neha allowed no one to touch Eris. He was cremated without any kind of a forensic examination.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before, when all signs had seemed to point to Neha, that oversight hadn\u2019t mattered. Now . . . \u201cI need them to retrieve another body,\u201d he said, making the decision to risk trusting the other man, \u201cand I need everyone to stay silent on it.\u201d</p><p>Rhys\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cMy lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCannot know.\u201d Jason told Rhys what he suspected about the woman whose crumpled body had lain exposed to the elements for far too long.</p><p>Rhys thrust a shaking hand through his hair. \u201cThe fools!\u201d It was a judgment spit out in a low tone that wouldn\u2019t reach beyond Jason. \u201cAudrey was a woman of little wit, but to attempt to make a laughingstock of an archangel? Had she found out, Neha would have\u2014\u201d He bit off his words, suddenly the grim-faced general whose loyalty was to Neha.</p> <p>\u201cThis\u201d\u2014Jason nodded at Arav\u2019s body\u2014\u201cchanges things. I do not believe her involved in any of the murders.\u201d</p><p>A shuddering exhalation that sounded like relief. Jason didn\u2019t understand the reaction, not when Neha was an archangel, violence part of her nature, until Rhys said, \u201cNo matter her rage, if she had murdered Eris, it would\u2019ve eventually driven her mad. My lady loved true.\u201d</p><p>Jason had seen the madness of love firsthand, scrubbed its rust red imprint from the walls, smelled the smoky remnants of the inferno, knew the damage it could do. It was the most dangerous, most destructive emotion of them all.</p><p>\u201cThe world,\u201d Rhys added, \u201ccannot afford a second insane archangel.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan, Jason completed silently, was more than enough.</p> <p>Having left her watch over the body once Jason arrived, Mahiya returned to her rooms, her skin sticky with the scent of death. It took twenty minutes under the pulsing spray of near-scalding water before she finally felt clean. Dressed in a simple black tunic with tapered pants of a deep blue that echoed part of her wings, she dried and loosely pinned up her hair before going out onto the balcony.</p><p>It was impossible to think about anything other than the carnage that had turned the fort into an abattoir, images of Shabnam\u2019s violated flesh and Arav\u2019s crushed and savaged body burned onto her irises. Without the evidence of what remained of Arav\u2019s wings, as well as the heavy ring that had survived on a miraculously unshattered finger, she\u2019d never have known it was him.</p><p>A quiet footfall.</p><p>Leaning over, she saw a servant passing along the softly lit pathway below, called out for him to halt. When she went down to join him, asking whether the servants had heard anything regarding Arav, his face closed up, his expression formal. \u201cIt was with great sorrow that we learned of General Arav\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will punish you for speaking ill of him,\u201d she said, \u201cleast of all I.\u201d Everyone knew of her humiliation\u2014she\u2019d worn her heart on her sleeve during her involvement with Arav. \u201cThe lady\u2019s fort is being painted bloodred and she wants answers.\u201d Mahiya didn\u2019t mourn Eris or Arav, and Audrey had made her own bed, but Shabnam had been an innocent. \u201cDid Arav cause insult?\u201d</p><p>It was clear the servant was torn between obeying the dictates of the archangel who was his liege and self-protective distance. The former won. \u201cHe was heard speaking to one who is loyal to Rhys, offering the man a position he did not yet have the ability to provide on the condition the other switch loyalties.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I am consort . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was he overheard?\u201d Arav wouldn\u2019t have broached the subject of such treachery in public.</p><p>Lashes coming down, head bowed, the servant backed away into the dark. At first, she thought he was refusing to answer, then she realized it was his answer. No, Arav hadn\u2019t been stupid, but he\u2019d been arrogant, an angel of nine hundred who considered weaker beings beneath his notice. \u201cI see,\u201d she said as the servant reappeared from the shadows. \u201cWas Rhys aware of Arav\u2019s attempts to subvert his people?\u201d</p><p>Another falling of shutters. \u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Rhys knew. He knows everything that happens in this fort.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she said to Jason when he returned much later, \u201cRhys has always been far more elegant in eliminating his enemies.\u201d Stepping out onto her half of the balcony where Jason waited, she handed him the cognac she\u2019d poured from the bottle kept for guests.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m beyond tea tonight.\u201d</p><p>The words had felt inexplicably intimate.</p> <p>\u201cI eliminated Rhys as a suspect before I knew this piece of information, but even with it, I still do not believe him to be the killer.\u201d He sipped at the dark amber liquid, his throat muscles working. \u201cThe way Shabnam was exposed\u2014Rhys, I think, is not capable of such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019d never treat a woman with such disrespect, even in death.\u201d</p><p>Taking another sip, Jason reached back to put the glass on the window ledge behind them, before turning to lean his bare forearms on the balcony railing. He\u2019d showered and changed, too, wore a plain black T-shirt and jeans, his feet bare. Behind him, his wings fell gracefully to the floor, shadows kin to the night. She\u2019d never seen him this . . . relaxed, as if he\u2019d taken off part of his armor.</p><p>Her eyes went to the tie at his nape, the brown skin beneath colorless in the night, and she remembered the brush of his thumb across her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI think, you must decide something tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her womb clenched. She hadn\u2019t trusted her body to a man in an eternity, and Jason . . . he had never lied to her.</p><p>\u201cMay I undo the tie on your hair?\u201d</p><p>He went motionless at her soft request, until he could have been the most beautiful gargoyle ever created, his wings of jet. Heart thudding in her throat, she waited . . . until at last he inclined his head in a small nod.</p><p>Her fingers trembled as she reached out. Taking care not to touch his nape, not to assume a deeper intimacy, she undid the tie and slid it away. A silken black waterfall spilled across his shoulders, the strands cool but no longer damp, the night air just warm enough to have sucked the moisture away. Unable to resist, she ran her fingertips lightly over the strands before dropping her hand to her side.</p><p>\u201cHow far would you go?\u201d</p><p>Startled at the murmured question, she jumped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you said, I am your only way out\u2014so, how far would you go?\u201d</p><p>Her skin flushed hot then cold. \u201cI was baiting you,\u201d she admitted. \u201cEven to attain my freedom, I would never barter away the one thing that has always been mine.\u201d Her body, her desire.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ve made your decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Breath tight in her chest, she raised her hand, hesitated.</p><p>\u201cTouch me, Mahiya.\u201d</p><p>It was all she needed. Giving in to the need, she ran her fingers through his hair. It felt akin to petting a tiger that had, for quixotic reasons of his own, decided not to bite her hand off. She made no mistake that this showed a crack in the obsidian shields around Jason\u2019s heart, indulged in no daydreams of a deeper relationship.</p><p>Still . . . it felt good to be close to a man who had never once treated her as disposable. Even at the very start, he\u2019d given her a formal kind of respect. Now, she saw true respect in those eyes of dark, luxuriant brown. It saddened her deep within that the fragile bond between them would break when this task was done.</p><p>Jason, she knew without asking, wasn\u2019t a man who allowed anyone as close as a familiar lover would become. Her chest ached at the knowledge of the hurt that must have shaped him to such endless aloneness, but she also knew she must be so, so careful not to fall for him, not to seek more than the dark sexuality that swirled between them, hot and beautifully violent as a desert storm.</p><p>Jason knew he was walking a dangerous edge with Mahiya, but he also knew he craved her touch too much to turn back. Clenching his jaw to control his shudder as her fingers touched his scalp, stroked down, he forced himself to remain motionless when all he wanted to do was turn, pin her to the wall, and thrust into the lush heat of her body.</p><p>He heard the bones in his jaw grind against one another as she stroked again, and suddenly, her touch was gone. \u201cI\u2019m distressing you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d An edge of horror in her tone. \u201cI would\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pushing off the railing, he halted her apology by the simple expedient of taking her delicately lovely face in his hands. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Her breath rasped in her throat as she sucked in air, her eyes huge. But instead of flinching at the rough speed of his touch or pushing him away, she fisted one hand in the soft cotton of his T-shirt . . . and rose up on tiptoe.</p><p>It took every ounce of control he had not to accept the silent invitation at once. \u201cYou must understand,\u201d he said, and his voice was a harsh scrape, \u201cthis won\u2019t make me stay with you, won\u2019t make me commit. I don\u2019t have that ability.\u201d To bond, to open his heart, to trust that the one he gave it to wouldn\u2019t savage it.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s breath whispered over his lips as she maintained her position. \u201cI know.\u201d Soft words. \u201cI also know that I\u2019d like to share myself with a strong man who doesn\u2019t court me with lies, is honest in his desire.\u201d</p><p>He saw her swallow, knew she wasn\u2019t as confident as she was attempting to appear. \u201cBe certain. You\u2019ll never be able to take this back.\u201d And he would not taint an innocent with his darkness, would not turn her bitter because of the lack in him.</p><p>Her lips brushed his.</p><p>Thrusting both hands into her hair, the strands beginning to unravel, he slanted his mouth over her own, intent on devouring . . . when he felt her spine go taut.</p><p>Slow Jason. Slow. She is not a bedmate who is accustomed to seeking pleasure.</p><p>It took gut-deep self-control, but he gentled the kiss, suckling her upper lip into his mouth and releasing it, only to court her with sipping kisses that enticed rather than demanded.</p><p>Her fingers flexed on his waist, her muscles losing their tautness. Having gone down flat on her feet, she now rose up toward him again, her wings beginning to open. Coaxing her with another petting kiss, he nudged her into her living room, the area lit only by the glow from a single table lamp. He\u2019d used his abilities to cloak them from curious eyes thus far, but the ability required focus, and all of his was now on Mahiya.</p><p>Breaking the kiss once they were inside, he murmured, \u201cThe front door.\u201d</p><p>Pulse a stutter in her throat, she gave a jerky nod and walked to lock the doors into her suite as he shut and locked the ones to the balcony. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014\u201d Her words ended in a gasp, his chest pressed to her back, his head bent over the curve of her neck.</p><p>22</p><p>Placing his hands on her hips, he held her in position as he tasted her skin, as he drowned in the sense of connection, of being real, if only for the fleeting slice of night he\u2019d spend with the woman in his arms. Her scent, that wild spice, it made him drunk, her skin so soft and warm, her body all graceful curves. He wished she wore a sari so he\u2019d have only to stroke up his hands to caress the naked skin of her waist.</p><p>Her wings, trapped between them, shifted in tiny, restless movements as he reached up to remove the remainder of the pins she\u2019d used to hold her hair in place. It tumbled over his hands in a cascade of unexpected curls, lush and thick and satiny soft. Fisting one hand in the strands, he tugged back her head, arching her neck for his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A tremor quaked her frame, her fingers splaying against the wood of the doors.</p><p>The flick of his tongue, the intoxicating taste of her.</p><p>Her pulse thudded a rapid staccato, her wings moving in as erratic a rhythm. Lifting his free hand from her hip, he closed it firmly over the edge of her left wing and stroked down.</p><p>A choked-off sound, her pupils hugely dilated when her lashes flicked up. \u201cJason.\u201d</p> <p>Halting the intimate touch before it became too much, he spread his hand flat on her stomach. \u201cHow do I get you out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe buttons that hold the wing slits closed.\u201d Husky words. \u201cThere\u2019s also a hidden zip at the side.\u201d</p><p>Wanting her skin against his own, he took a single step away and swept her hair off her back and over her shoulder. The buttons were faceted black crystals, shimmering in the soft light. Slipping out the top buttons without touching the sensitive arch of her wings, he reached down and found the matching buttons at the bottom of her wings.</p><p>The center panel at the back fell down, over her lower curves and he watched as she tugged the front section off her arms, holding the crumpled fabric to her chest with a modesty that paradoxically made him burn. Using her free hand, she reached up to her side and pushed down a concealed zipper that went from her ribs to the slit at the bottom of her tunic.</p><p>Heat met his knuckles as he brushed them down the centerline of her back, fine tremors traveling over her skin. Were he a better man, he would stop this\u2014Mahiya didn\u2019t respond like a woman who\u2019d had lovers enough to lose her shyness.</p> <p>\u201c. . . who doesn\u2019t court me with lies, is honest in his desire.\u201d</p><p>His desire held no deceit, was a fist in his gut.</p><p>Not forcing her to release the front of the tunic, he put his hands on the curve of her hips and pressed up against her again, his wings spread wide behind them. She shuddered at the intimate contact, because while she\u2019d been busy with her tunic, he\u2019d peeled off his T-shirt.</p><p>The softness of her feathers against his naked skin rushed sensory information through his mind, a molten river that held him captive. Bending to the sleek slope of her neck once more, he used a finger to brush aside an errant strand of hair, felt her responding shiver through the place where their bodies connected. Even as he pressed his lips to her sensitive skin, he stroked one hand down her arm to close his fingers over the ones she had fisted on her front, holding the tunic in place.</p><p>He didn\u2019t force, just gave a gentle tug.</p><p>The tiniest hesitation before she uncurled her fingers and allowed him to take one hand, stretch it out to press against the door. When he traced his return journey down the slender warmth of her arm, she kept her hand where he\u2019d put it. Switching sides, he swept her hair over to the other side with luxuriant slowness . . . because now that he was touching her, the fever in him had transformed into a dark sexual patience that promised crushing pleasure.</p> <p>She knew what was coming this time when he stroked down her arm to her remaining fist, her breathing fast, shallow. Leaving his fingers over her own, he smoothed his free hand over the curve of her waist as he laved her neck with his lips before kissing the slope of one graceful shoulder, his face brushing the upper arch of her wings.</p><p>Trembling, she uncurled her fingers from her tunic and allowed him to ease that hand to press flat on the door, too. He caressed his way back down her arm just as slowly, kissing the temptation of her skin the entire time. Then he put both hands to where the tunic bunched at her hips and tugged.</p><p>It slipped down to pool at her feet. She stepped out of the fabric, let him kick it away. \u201cThe pants have\u201d\u2014a swallow, as if her throat was dry\u2014\u201chooks at the ankles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll keep,\u201d he said, rising to take in the picture she made, her wings slightly spread, her body naked to the waist, the lush curls of her hair falling over one shoulder. \u201cNo need to rush.\u201d Reaching out, he ran his knuckles down the naked center of her back again, this time with deeper pressure, her soft cry a fist around his cock. \u201cClose your wings.\u201d</p><p>The second she did, he pressed close and shifted his hand around the waistband of her tapered cotton pants to undo the string-tie that held them up. Only allowing the garment to slide down to her hips, he redid the tie. Her abdomen quivered against the hand he spread on her satiny skin, his ring finger brushing the top edge of her pants . . . which just barely concealed the slick tightness of her.</p><p>His body pulsed, thick and hot.</p><p>Sensing it, she shivered but didn\u2019t attempt to pull away as he slid his free hand up from her hip to just below her breasts. He didn\u2019t cup the small, ripe mounds, just brushed his fingers along the underside before plucking at one taut nipple.</p><p>The sweet need in her responding cry whispered over his skin like a tactile caress. Rewarding her with another teasing brush, another tug that made her tremble, he insinuated his other hand just under the top of her waistband. Her navel tensed, relaxed with a shudder as he caressed her breasts once more.</p> <p>Kissing her neck, so very sensitive, he moved his hand lower, under the silky roughness of fine lace to touch the delicate curls between her thighs, the damp heat of her the most exquisite temptation.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d Dropping one hand from the door, she reached behind her to touch his hair. \u201cKiss me.\u201d It was a whispered request.</p><p>He halted his erotic exploration and spun her around, her wings spread out in magnificent display behind her as she faced him, a woman with a blush of red over her cheekbones and taut breasts topped with dark nipples he knew he\u2019d soon taste.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he murmured, closing his fingers over one breast, \u201care lovely.\u201d Bracing his free arm beside her head, while her own arms wrapped around him as she rose on tiptoe again, he gave her the kiss she\u2019d asked for. It was a naked, wet melding of mouths that had her rubbing against him, her abdomen sliding over his cock.</p><p>His hold on the reins slipped.</p><p>Reaching between them, he undid the tie on her pants, broke the kiss and her grasp to push them down. Her navel was a lure he couldn\u2019t resist, the kiss he pressed there making her fingers fist in his hair before he ran his thumbs over her hipbones and pulled away. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he murmured, pressing a kiss to the inside of one satiny thigh.</p><p>Mahiya sucked in desperate gulps of air, the cadence of her desire music in his blood. It urged him to rip off her pants, but he grit his teeth and took the time to undo the hooks, forcing himself to go slow, to not overwhelm his lover with her sweet passion and willingness to trust him to lead the dance.</p><p>Finally the pants were off. He ran his hands slowly up her calves, her thighs, the white lace that was all that covered her now. By the time he rose to his full height, the scent of her musk perfumed the air. \u201cTake them off.\u201d He wanted to see her slick and ready, to taste her in the most erotic of kisses, but first he would have this indication that she remained a willing participant.</p><p>Her breath hitched . . . but she ducked her head and hooked her thumbs into the sides of the scrap of lace. He stepped back to watch her push that scrap down and off, because the visual sensation was a feast\u2014though nothing could ever triumph touch for him, tactile pleasure his one true addiction.</p><p>Heat blazing over every inch of her skin, she pushed the crumpled lace aside with a slender foot, her lashes hiding her gaze. He reached out, ran the back of one finger over a pebbled nipple. She jerked. Unable to resist, he dipped his head, took part of her breast into his mouth, sucked.</p><p>Her knees buckled. \u201cJason, oh please . . .\u201d</p><p>Holding her up as he released her sensitive flesh, he soothed her with a languid kiss that poured fuel on the black storm of his own passion. \u201cLike that,\u201d he murmured against kiss-swollen lips as he continued to seduce her with his mouth, \u201cjust like that.\u201d Cock painfully hard, he slid one hand between her thighs and stroked lightly down the centerline of her sex with a single finger.</p><p>Over and over . . . and over again.</p><p>Her breath turned into jagged gasps, the tip of his finger slick with her need, her hands gripping at his arms. Dazed eyes locked with his own as he broke the kiss, and he knew the pleasure was building in her, a slow crescendo.</p><p>\u201cFly.\u201d It was rough encouragement as he demanded another kiss, craving the contact. \u201cI have you.\u201d He continued with his slow, relentless caress, touching the glistening nub at the apex of her thighs with each stroke now that she\u2019d spread her thighs farther in an effort to deepen the intimate contact.</p><p>Her fingernails dug into his arms, her neck arched.</p><p>Bending her over his arm, he took part of her neglected breast into his mouth, ran his teeth over the taut flesh as he released it . . . at the same time that he captured the sensitive nub between her thighs in his fingertips and pressed hard.</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>Raising his head, he removed his hand before the pleasure racking her body became painful. \u201cI have you,\u201d he repeated, nuzzling his face against the side of hers. \u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>Only when she stopped trembling did he shift his hold to her hips and raise her until she could wrap her legs around his waist. Her eyes were lazy, sated, her kiss languid. Arms twining around his neck, she opened for him with a sensual generosity that made him want to devour, her fingers weaving through his hair. He reached between them to undo his jeans, grip his cock, and position himself at her entrance.</p><p>A soft gasp into his mouth as the head of his cock rubbed against her passion-swollen flesh and then he was pushing into the silken welcome of her sheath.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Mahiya gripped him tighter with every part of her body, her internal muscles continuing to ripple with trailing waves of her pleasure.</p><p>Shuddering, he dropped his forehead onto her own as he fought the urge to shove. Her body was telling him it hadn\u2019t been used in such a way for a long time, her muscles struggling to stretch around him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Jason.\u201d Fingers on his cheek, kisses gentle and tender and unexpected. \u201cI want you so much.\u201d</p><p>He drew in a ragged breath, pushed a fraction deeper. A bit more. Scalding heat, feminine muscles pulsing on his rigid flesh. The pleasure was almost pain, the bite exquisite. Turning his mouth to brush against her own, he continued to work his cock into her, slow and relentless.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>Flexing his hips at the whimper of sound, he forced himself to halt. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>A dazed look. \u201cIt burns and yet it feels good. I want you in me.\u201d</p><p>That was all he needed to hear.</p><p>Sliding his hands under her thighs, he lifted her legs off his hips and pushed her knees up and wide, his strength more than enough to keep her pinned as he thrust into her to the feel of her nails digging into his back as her body spasmed around him, bathing his cock in molten desire.</p><p>Then he began to move.</p><p>23</p><p>Honor sat in sunlight rich as honey and as languorous, a glass of orange juice in hand and Dmitri\u2019s white shirt loose and comfortable around her, watching her husband pace back and forth across the sprawling gardens that surrounded their private villa. He held a phone to his ear, gave clipped orders in a tone that said he expected to be obeyed.</p><p>He\u2019d asked her if she wanted to explore the countryside, but all she wanted was to be with Dmitri. They made love in the sunshine and in the dark, played bedroom games that caused her to blush, and fed each other treats they had delivered from a discreet grocer in the nearby village. It was a lazy, hazy existence, and she was glad for it after the horror of what had gone before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, Dmitri couldn\u2019t disconnect completely from the Tower that had been his responsibility for centuries, nor had she expected it of him. What mattered was that the instant she looked at him in a way that said she needed his attention, the phone went off. There was no doubt in her mind that she was the most important part of her husband\u2019s life . . . important enough that he would give up immortality should she choose a mortal existence. Because that was something else she understood; her Dmitri would not choose to go on after she died. He\u2019d survived once, wouldn\u2019t again.</p><p>Striding back to her, he placed his cell phone on the wrought iron table that held a plate filled with slices of fruit she\u2019d cut for them to share. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d He leaned down, hands on the arms of her chair. \u201cYou\u2019re tense.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d figured that out from meters away, while she\u2019d believed him engrossed in his conversation. \u201cI almost wish,\u201d she said, putting down her juice and tucking her feet up in the chair, \u201cyou hadn\u2019t given me time to rethink my choice.\u201d</p><p>His head dropped, and it was instinct to stroke her fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m a bastard, Honor.\u201d Fierce voice, his eyes locking with her own. \u201cWe both know that.\u201d When she would\u2019ve spoken, he shook his head and continued. \u201cI damn well rigged your original decision\u2014maybe I thought I was giving you a choice, but by asking you when I did, I made sure that choice was the one I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Trailing her fingers down his neck and over the faded gray of his T-shirt, she said, \u201cWas that meant to shock me? Hmm?\u201d</p><p>His lips, so sexy and tempting, curved. \u201cYou realize most people are intimidated by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d It was a blatant tease. \u201cHow strange.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, her Dmitri who had never laughed like this when they\u2019d first met, with the light in his eyes. \u201cYou are definitely not Ingrede.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wondered if he truly understood that when they married, understood that while she carried the soul and the memories of the woman he\u2019d danced with on a field of wildflowers, she\u2019d been shaped by the winds of another life. Now she saw the knowledge in his eyes, saw, too, the heart-piercing love he had for the woman she was in this lifetime, a hunter scarred but no longer broken. \u201cOh?\u201d she said with a smile she could feel in every cell of her body. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to recall your first wife accepting your every word as law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do believe your memory must be faulty.\u201d Eliminating the inches that separated them, he claimed an unashamedly sexual kiss that melted her bones. When he trailed his lips over her jaw and down to the pulse in her neck, she fisted her hand in his hair.</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d It was an offer she\u2019d make only Dmitri. \u201cYou haven\u2019t fed today.\u201d</p><p>But instead of sinking his fangs into her willing flesh, he lifted his head, frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to weaken you. I can have some blood packs delivered\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You feed from me.\u201d He was hers to care for, hers to adore.</p><p>\u201cHonor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a high-calorie, high-iron, high-fluid, high-everything diet for a reason.\u201d She\u2019d had a long conversation with a Guild physician before they left for Italy. The elderly and somewhat cantankerous man was used to dealing with vampiric-human pairings and had given her guidelines to follow if she intended to be one of those \u201cpossessive females.\u201d \u201cIf you tell me you prefer a bag of old blood to my neck,\u201d she muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll bite you myself.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t soften at the joke, continuing to lean dark and dangerous and a bit pissed off above her. \u201cI\u2019ll get the packs delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDmitri\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you have your way in every other thing you want, but I won\u2019t compromise your health.\u201d His voice was steel. \u201cI\u2019ll allow myself to feed from you once a week.\u201d</p><p>Honor narrowed her eyes. \u201cEvery second day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a negotiation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. It\u2019s a marriage. So negotiate.\u201d</p><p>His arm muscles turned rigid where he held on to the chair. \u201cTwice a week,\u201d he gritted out, \u201cand you\u2019ll take an iron test every five days.\u201d</p><p>Tapping her finger on his wrist, she saw the implacable resolve in his expression, knew the negotiation was at an end. It had gone better than she\u2019d hoped\u2014after all, Dmitri was near to a thousand years old and arrogant with it. \u201cFine,\u201d she said with a pretend scowl, \u201cbut if you ever stop giving me the little bites when we make love, I\u2019m filing for divorce.\u201d The erotic blood kisses were all about sex, not feeding.</p> <p>This time, his smile was of the very bad man she had in her bed three times a day at the very least. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll never stop doing that. If you ask nicely, I might even bite you on that spot on the inside of your thigh that you like so much.\u201d</p><p>Honor shivered. Once, the idea of a bite on her thigh would\u2019ve made her throw up, and even Dmitri could only do it if she was in a certain position, where she could kick him away if need be . . . but when it went right, when the horrible memories of what had been done to her didn\u2019t overwhelm her . . . oh wow. \u201cYou are a menace.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside so I can corrupt you some more.\u201d</p><p>Impossible, but he gets sexier with every passing minute.</p><p>Tugging him down, she kissed those sensual lips, received a loving that made her breasts swell, her nipples tighten. \u201cCome sit with me,\u201d she said before she forgot her intent, \u201cso we can talk about my decision.\u201d</p><p>Sprawling into the chair on the other side of the table, he reached for a slice of sweet white peach with a desultory hand. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to talk you out of vampirism. I\u2019m only being this good because I don\u2019t want you to hate me.\u201d</p><p>She nibbled on a piece of apricot. \u201cNoted.\u201d Twisting around, she put her feet on his lap, her toes\u2014currently painted a vivid blue green\u2014shimmering in the sunlight.</p><p>His hand stroked over her in an absent caress. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever be like the monsters,\u201d he said quietly, speaking to her deepest fear. \u201cNever, Honor. That\u2019s not in you.\u201d</p><p>It choked her with blind terror that she might become like the soulless creatures who\u2019d caused her such heartbreaking harm not in one lifetime, but in two. But then she looked across at the man who had loved her both those lifetimes, and she saw not simply the darkness he wore so close to his skin, but also the truth that he\u2019d maintained a claw hold on honor even as he sank into sin and depravity. Dmitri had never brutalized a woman, and he\u2019d never hurt a child . . . not after he\u2019d had to break their son\u2019s neck to save Misha from unimaginable horror.</p><p>Unlike Dmitri, she wouldn\u2019t be going into this new life through an ugly act of coercion, broken and twisted and tortured. She\u2019d be ushered into it by a man who adored her, would spend eternity discovering every changing facet of him. Never would they become jaded with one another\u2014never. It was a quiet truth deep within her, born of a love that had survived death and time itself.</p><p>\u201cDmitri,\u201d she said into the sunlit silence. \u201cWhere is your heart?\u201d</p><p>Her question could\u2019ve been taken many ways, but her husband knew what she meant. \u201cIn your hands, where it\u2019s always been.\u201d</p><p>Luminous joy in her every breath, a sense of peace in her soul. \u201cAnd you hold mine. So you see, I only have to worry about your heart, not my own.\u201d As his heart was her most precious treasure, hers was his. He would love and care for that heart with every bit of his dangerous strength, would never permit her to lose the compassion and humanity he cherished in her. \u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d she said, \u201cbegin the process.\u201d</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s hands tightened on her legs. \u201cThis is it, Honor. No more chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dmitri. Now we\u2019ll have an eternity of chances.\u201d</p><p>24</p><p>Mahiya felt bruised in places she hadn\u2019t known it was possible to have bruises, muscles sore in a way they\u2019d never before been sore. Jason was . . . a storm.</p><p>Slow.</p><p>Relentless.</p><p>Inexorable.</p><p>She\u2019d thought he\u2019d be satisfied after that shockingly carnal union against the door, but he\u2019d brought her back to her bed, allowed her only a small respite before he took her again.</p><p>Mahiya wasn\u2019t complaining. Never would, not so long as he came to her bed.</p><p>\u201c. . . this won\u2019t make me stay with you, won\u2019t make me commit.\u201d</p><p>A twinge in her heart as she opened the bedroom window to the bright morning sunshine, that of a woman who wasn\u2019t only in sensual thrall to Jason, but who was fascinated by the glimpses she\u2019d had of the man behind the spymaster . . . and that man, he was a dangerous, complex, fractured creature she hungered to know. But it wasn\u2019t an opportunity she\u2019d ever have, wasn\u2019t an opportunity Jason would give her. She wasn\u2019t even certain if he\u2019d return to her bed.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Mahiya.\u201d Watchful eyes.</p><p>She wanted only to sleep wrapped around the strength and heat of him, but she satisfied herself with a final caress of her fingers over his cheek, having the haunting sense of setting a wild creature free. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning.\u201d</p><p>A rustle at the door shattered the whisper of memory. Then Vanhi was bustling in through to the bedroom, her rich ebony hair tamed in a severe knot at the back of her head, her body clothed in a sari of black dotted crimson. Only she could get away with such bold shades while the rest of the fort wore the faded colors of semi-mourning. Because only Vanhi had been alive since before Neha.</p><p>The vampire with her green eyes and skin of deep bronze had the appearance of a stunning woman in her thirties, but the manner and ways of a grandmother. She\u2019d rocked Neha and Nivriti in the nursery as she\u2019d later rocked Anoushka, then Mahiya. She was the only being Mahiya had dared love after the brutalization of the single friend she\u2019d made as an adult.</p><p>Crimson on the stones, slick and thick, blood-drenched wings lying lifeless beside the unconscious form of a man whose only real crime had been kindness.</p><p>Even the beloved mare Mahiya had helped raise from a foal had been given away\u2014to Arav\u2019s new lover, the cruelty a conscious one. However, Vanhi held Neha\u2019s affection and thus was safe to love, though even the vampire wasn\u2019t permitted to spend too much time with Mahiya without finding herself sent on holiday to another part of the territory.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Vanhi now said, \u201cthat spawn of a she-goat is dead then.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya was unsurprised at the judgment. \u201cI won\u2019t be mourning Arav, but the way he died . . . I would not have wished that on him.\u201d</p><p>Vanhi snorted. \u201cHe should\u2019ve been castrated for the advantage he took of a young girl barely fledged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI allowed him to take that advantage,\u201d Mahiya replied, the argument an old one. \u201cI was a fool.\u201d Willing to accept dross for gold. \u201cI won\u2019t be one again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d Vanhi raised an eyebrow as she picked up a jet-black feather from the carpet. \u201cYet Raphael\u2019s spymaster is welcome in your bedroom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe tells me no lies.\u201d</p><p>The quiet statement made Vanhi still in her energetic movements around the room as she settled this, straightened that. A heavy sadness in her expression, she laid a soft palm against Mahiya\u2019s face. \u201cI wish you would expect more, Mahiya child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d Mahiya promised, \u201cI\u2019ll have the chance to dream bigger dreams. Until then, I must work with what I have.\u201d False hope could be more devastating than unvarnished pragmatism\u2014she\u2019d learned that during her attempt to find sanctuary with Lijuan years prior to the archangel\u2019s \u201cevolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly girl.\u201d Lijuan\u2019s dove gray wings swept the floor as she waved her hand, dismissing the guard who\u2019d escorted an exhausted Mahiya into a cavernous room that echoed with sound. \u201cYou ask me to make a ruin of my friendship with Neha for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I ask only sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>Eerie eyes of a strange pearlescent gray, staring at her out of a face with skin so pale, she imagined she could see the skeletal structure beneath. \u201cEither you are feeble-minded,\u201d Lijuan said, \u201cor you are being disingenuous.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya fought the ice invading her bloodstream to say, \u201cYou are far more powerful than Neha. She would not put your relationship in jeopardy for so insignificant a thing as I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt follows that I have no need of you. You offer me nothing.\u201d A smile that made Mahiya\u2019s stomach clench, her bones rattle. \u201cYour wings . . . hmm, perhaps I will keep you after all.\u201d</p><p>That was when Lijuan had \u201cinvited\u201d Mahiya to view her Collection Room, watching with that same inhuman smile as Mahiya bent over and threw up what little food there was in her stomach.</p> <p>\u201cJu will clean that up.\u201d The man who shuffled out of the darkness was . . . wrong. Jerking up, Mahiya ran the back of her hand over her mouth as Ju produced a mop and wiped away all evidence of her lack of control, his eyes black and dull, his movements that of a marionette.</p><p>\u201cHe was a strong man once, but I broke him. Still, I cannot let him go.\u201d Lijuan reached out to stroke Mahiya\u2019s wing.</p><p>Twisting away, she waited to be reduced to ash for her insolence, but Lijuan smiled. \u201cA pity I cannot take you for my collection. Better I think, to return you to Neha. I will be patient, and ask her to give you to me when you are dead. I would not want such beauty lost to rot.\u201d</p><p>One night and one day.</p><p>That was how long Mahiya had spent in Lijuan\u2019s stronghold, a nightmare span of hours it chilled her to the bone to think of even now. \u201cVanhi,\u201d she said, forcing her mind back to the present, \u201cwhat are your thoughts on Arav\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat piece of elephant dung may have insulted someone, or he may simply have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d Vanhi shrugged, picking up a sari Mahiya had left out to air.</p> <p>Walking to take the other end of the slippery fabric, Mahiya worked with Vanhi to fold it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It all seems calculated somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you one thing, Mahiya child.\u201d A solemn tone. \u201cGames are one thing, but to play them against Neha?\u201d Shaking her head, Vanhi used her fingers to draw an ancient sign meant to ward off evil. \u201cOnly bad things will come of this.\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Exiting the palace half an hour after Vanhi\u2019s departure, Mahiya found an unexpected visitor about to take the steps to her door. \u201cVenom.\u201d</p><p>A smile lazy with charm, his eyes hidden from view by mirrored sunglasses that reflected her own face back at her. Dressed in black pants and a white shirt, his damp hair combed neatly, he appeared one of the more dangerous courtiers\u2014the ones who had the brains to scheme and collude.</p><p>\u201cLady Mahiya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Mahiya,\u201d she said, soaking in the morning sunshine cascading from such a pure blue sky, it seemed obscene it might yet bear witness to further carnage. \u201cIf you\u2019re searching for Jason, he is elsewhere.\u201d As Neha had expanded his mandate, Mahiya was no longer expected to act the spy and report back on his activities.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d She stepped out onto the balcony, fighting herself not to touch him now that the night had passed, not to attempt to claim rights of possession\u2014it would be as foolish as attempting to own a storm. \u201cWill you have breakfast before you go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I have a meeting I must make.\u201d He spread his wings, paused. \u201cI will see you when I return.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was a silly thing, but it meant a great deal to her that he\u2019d knocked on her door instead of simply vanishing into the dawn, her spymaster who always walked alone.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve called ahead,\u201d Venom said, his voice fracturing the memory, his smile that of a man who knew how to coax and beguile women. \u201cMay I offer you an escort to your next destination?\u201d</p><p>The playful flirtation made her smile. \u201cI go to Neha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe private audience hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mahiya frowned. \u201cThe message asked me to meet her near Guardian.\u201d Looking up, she sought out the more spartan fort that overlooked Archangel Fort. It was isolated, with no one within hearing distance but Neha\u2019s troops\u2014who\u2019d see nothing and do nothing should the archangel decide to eliminate the annoyance of her consort\u2019s illegitimate child.</p><p>In truth, it would be no different than being at this fort. Except . . . Jason was here.</p><p>No, she told herself sternly, do not spin hopes out of air and a dark sensuality that had marked her deep within. Jason had promised to help her escape, but she had no further claim on his protection. \u201cSo you see,\u201d she said to Venom, \u201cI must leave you here.\u201d</p><p>The vampire frowned. \u201cAre you certain the message was from Neha? I saw her flying down toward the city not long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We are to meet at the ruined temple just outside the walls of the fort.\u201d Still, uneasy with the unexpected choice of venue, she reached into a hidden pocket in her tunic to retrieve the small card. \u201cIt is her hand.\u201d</p><p>Taking the card, Venom rubbed his thumb over the script. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. But her writing\u2019s not so ornate as to be impossible to forge. I don\u2019t like the feel of this.\u201d</p><p>All at once, she knew why Venom had come to the palace, and her heart twisted. \u201cJason told you to watch over me.\u201d It did something to her to know that Jason cared enough about her to have asked another of the Seven to keep her in his sights. No one had watched over her since she left the Refuge and the protection of those who undertook the welfare of angelic young. She was not so proud as to refute the emotions his care engendered in her.</p><p>Venom gave her a faint smile in answer. \u201cIt says you have fifteen minutes till your meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought to arrive early.\u201d Give myself room to settle so that nothing Neha does will goad me into a fatal mistake.</p><p>\u201cIndulge me,\u201d Venom said, \u201cand arrive exactly on time.\u201d</p><p>Glancing up, she raised a hand and plucked his sunglasses off his face before he realized her intent. The way he moved away from her was a sinuous, beautiful, fast thing, but she held her position. \u201cYou had only to ask,\u201d he said, pushing back disordered strands of hair as he rose from his combat-ready crouch, his green eyes vivid and hypnotic against the desert brown of his skin, warm and of this land.</p><p>\u201cI thought to read your eyes.\u201d Mahiya handed back his sunglasses, a faint niggling at the back of her mind. \u201cBut that was foolish,\u201d she said, the odd sense that she was missing something gone before she could pursue it. \u201cI do not know anyone who might read such eyes.\u201d</p><p>Sliding the shades back on, Venom began to walk away from her. \u201cRemember, arrive exactly on time.\u201d Then he picked up his pace and was gone in a quicksilver snap of movement that was nothing human.</p><p>Yet no matter how fast he was, he could not make it to Guardian before she did. Even so, she flew up to the palace roof to wait, having decided to give him the time he\u2019d asked for, her sense of \u201cwrongness\u201d amplifying the more she thought about the situation. But not attending the meet wasn\u2019t an option, not when it had most likely been Neha who\u2019d sent the note\u2014the archangel knew Mahiya had a sickening fear of Guardian . . . and she knew why.</p><p>Please no! Please!</p><p>It was the only time she had ever begged. It was also the only time she\u2019d seen an expression of horror on Neha\u2019s face, as if she could not believe her own actions. It hadn\u2019t stopped her though . . . and Anoushka had been standing beside her all the while, her mother\u2019s cold-eyed shadow.</p><p>Only two minutes to go till the meeting.</p><p>Spreading out her wings, she swept off the roof and up into the clouds, angling toward the ruined temple. In this, Neha had erred. Though Guardian made Mahiya\u2019s skin sticky with fear sweat, the temple held only happy memories.</p><p>Those memories a talisman, she swept over Guardian and its sentries. Some distance from the fort\u2019s protective walls to the south lay the crumbling ruins of a temple that had been built long ago to honor the archangel who had ruled here before Neha. Neha wasn\u2019t responsible for the destruction. It had simply fallen out of use some years after the archangel in question had been killed in a battle against another of the Cadre.</p><p>While one entire side had collapsed, the roof having crashed onto the paving stones below, the other half was more or less upright. Ten sturdy columns held up the remainder of the roof, the holes in it scattering sunshine over the floor below to create a mosaic of light and shadow.</p><p>Landing outside the temple, Mahiya took a deep breath of the thinner mountain air and folded her wings . . . just as a step sounded behind her. She twisted on her feet to find herself face-to-face with a Venom whose skin gleamed with sweat, his formerly pristine white shirt now damp and molding itself to sleek muscle, his unshielded eyes narrowed against the sunlight.</p><p>Astonished, she stared. \u201cNo one\u2019s that fast.\u201d</p><p>A flash of fang as he grinned. \u201cI beg to disagree.\u201d</p><p>Brain kicking into gear, she looked beyond him to the flat walls of the fort, snapped her head back. \u201cYou know the tunnels.\u201d From what little information she\u2019d been able to scrape up, the subterranean passages that connected the two forts had been built up over millennia, had to be a maze.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Brushing past her with a speed that was in no way human, he ran up the temple steps.</p><p>\u201cVenom!\u201d She stepped into the dappled light of the temple on his heels . . . and was overwhelmed by a sense of peace. This had been her favorite playground when she\u2019d been a child angel on visits home from the Refuge. She\u2019d had a thousand adventures within its broken, tumbled-down walls, written her name with a charcoal stick on one of the columns before guilt made her return to rub it out.</p><p>The memory had her lips kicking up at the corners even as she searched for any sign of Neha and found none. However, Venom stood not far in front of her, checking a shadowed alcove. \u201cYou have to step out before you make yourself a target.\u201d Neha would not tolerate the fact that Mahiya was being escorted by a vampire who remained something of a favorite, regardless of his choice to serve Raphael. \u201cYou can easily keep watch from a concealed position.\u201d His help would be welcome should her sense of wrongness not be her imagination running riot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm? No, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drag you out if I have to.\u201d He was Jason\u2019s friend, and Jason, she knew instinctively, was a man with few friends. Venom couldn\u2019t be allowed to throw his life away.</p><p>Venom\u2019s response was low voiced. \u201cCome look at this, Mahiya.\u201d</p><p>25</p> <p>Caught by the odd tone of his voice, she crossed through a beam of sunlight and came to a dead halt. Within the alcove in front of Venom sat a box wrapped in sparkling gold paper tied with a silver bow. When the vampire gingerly slid out the card tucked in under the silver ribbon, it proved to contain nothing but her name in the same script as that on the note commanding her to be here at this time.</p><p>\u201cI may not be a spymaster like our Jason,\u201d Venom mused, \u201cbut I would hazard Neha did not send that note.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had to agree, her mind trying to make sense of the bizarre circumstances and failing. \u201cLet\u2019s take the box outside before we open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t open it at all until Jason and I have a chance to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a strong vampire, your hearing is acute,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cDo you hear ticking? Anything to indicate it may contain an incendiary device?\u201d If an explosion hit either of them right, it could decapitate and kill.</p> <p>Venom angled his head, finally gave a reluctant shake. \u201cNo. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, there is a high chance you have an excellent sense of smell.\u201d She\u2019d seen him \u201ctaste\u201d the air with his tongue. \u201cSmell anything suspicious?\u201d The fact was, she knew if she walked away now, either Venom or Jason would take the risk. And that, she refused to allow. \u201cChemicals, anything?\u201d</p><p>Gritted teeth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either, and if this is the murderer,\u201d she said reasonably, \u201che or she has no reason to play such games.\u201d An angel strong enough to annihilate Arav could break her in half. \u201cSomeone else could have stumbled upon this\u2014a guard on a break, a curious child\u2014and none of the murders so far appear to have been random.\u201d The latter was arguable, but her gut said there was a connection between the four victims, and she knew Jason agreed.</p><p>The slitted black pupils of Venom\u2019s eyes narrowed as he considered her. \u201cI thought you were a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know that an archangel\u2019s court is far more dangerous than the streets of New York.\u201d She picked up the box before he could and took it, very carefully, into the sunshine. Making her way around to the side totally hidden from Guardian, she placed the box on a clear patch of grass a good fifty feet from the temple, on the theory that she didn\u2019t want the walls collapsing on top of her. \u201cGo stand in the distance.\u201d</p> <p>A raised eyebrow. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish,\u201d she said, deciding she liked Venom not only because he was Jason\u2019s friend, but because he looked at her as if she were the dangerous creature. \u201cIf something does happen to me, you\u2019ll be unaffected and able to summon help. Or would you rather be injured at the same time?\u201d</p><p>His lips curved. \u201cThat logic holds if I\u2019m the one to open the box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue\u2014but I have a higher chance of survival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cYou might be an angel, but I\u2019m stronger than you are. And Jason is stronger than both of us.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and I will not have him hurt, no matter if that is a silly emotional decision. \u201cSo you\u2019d wait for him?\u201d When he didn\u2019t reply, she said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I thought. This box was meant for me, Venom. I\u2019ll allow no one else to open it\u201d\u2014to be hurt\u2014\u201cand you can\u2019t follow me in to the sky should I take off with it. Wouldn\u2019t you rather I stay here?\u201d</p><p>Another hard stare. \u201cObviously, I need to study princesses further.\u201d With that, he turned on his heel and jogged to crouch behind a large rock.</p><p>Going to her knees, she undid the ribbon after examining it for hidden wires, realizing as she did so that the box wasn\u2019t wrapped in gold foil\u2014the cardboard was actually painted the metallic shade, so once she had the ribbon off, all she had to do was lift the lid. \u201cVenom! Do you see any branches nearby?\u201d There was a tree not far from him.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d A minute later, he threw over a sturdy branch at least four feet long. \u201cI\u2019m happy to know you\u2019re not suicidal.\u201d</p><p>No, I plan to live, to love, to fly . . . and if he\u2019ll let me, dance again with a spymaster with wings of jet. \u201cHere I go.\u201d Flattening her body to the ground to ameliorate the impact of any blast, she reached out with the stick and flicked the lid off.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Blowing out a trembling breath, she got up and padded closer, aware of Venom jogging across to join her. Both of them stared at what lay within the box before Venom crouched down. \u201cNothing smells off.\u201d He held up a hand when she would\u2019ve reached for the object. \u201cWait, let me make sure it\u2019s not sitting on something.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya waited, patient, until he nodded at her to go ahead.</p><p>\u201cSeems you have a secret admirer,\u201d he murmured as she examined the fluffy pink teddy bear with white paws and face. \u201cMaybe I scared him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She searched the whole toy, but could find no hidden compartment. \u201cI admit this is so strange a thing I have no idea what to make of it. Maybe Jason will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I might suggest that I carry it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s better if I\u2019m not seen with it. If you are, it\u2019ll be assumed you\u2019re courting a lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a reputation, it seems.\u201d A statement smooth as silk, but for the bite of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to be blind not to notice your sensuality.\u201d Dangerous and languid at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain you don\u2019t ever have to go to an empty bed unless you choose it.\u201d Regardless of the eerie \u201cotherness\u201d of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCareful\u201d\u2014taking the box and its cargo, he rose, the movement liquid with grace\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll make Jason jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not let this crush you, but you aren\u2019t my type.\u201d Though she framed it as a joke, the fact was, she saw Neha too deeply in Venom. His eyes were of her creatures, his movements the same\u2014and that was why she said what she did next, for she refused to allow Neha to spoil the friendships she might make. \u201cI do think we\u2019ll be wonderful friends.\u201d</p><p>A single raised eyebrow, sophisticated cool in his next words. \u201cWe will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Admit it, you already rather like me even if I did win our argument.\u201d</p><p>A faint twitch of Venom\u2019s lips. \u201cWhen I first met you, I couldn\u2019t understand the attraction, but I do believe Jason has met his match.\u201d</p><p>It took effort to keep her tone steady. \u201cI\u2019m going into the city for a short time. I\u2019ll see you when I return to the fort.\u201d It was a fuzzy memory at best, from over two years ago, but if she was right, there was a slim chance it might provide them with an answer of some kind.</p><p>Venom scowled. \u201cJason gave me strict orders to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hitched at the direct confirmation of her guess. Some women might have chafed at the protectiveness, but for Mahiya, who had never mattered much to anyone, such a thing was no unwanted chain, but a welcome indication of care. That didn\u2019t mean she intended to stop thinking for herself. \u201cIt\u2019s daylight,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t plan to linger in any dark alleys and will in fact be in a busy market district.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome princess,\u201d Venom muttered, but dug in his pocket to retrieve a cell phone. \u201cThis is a spare. I\u2019m inputting my number and Jason\u2019s. Call if you have any problems.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, she swept down over the city. Her target was a sunny yellow building with an old but gleaming treadle sewing machine in the window and a dusty child in short pants playing on the doorstep.</p><p>His eyes widened at the sight of Mahiya. He was off like a shot the next instant, running into the house yelling, \u201cMa! Ma!\u201d</p><p>Making no effort to hide her smile, Mahiya waited politely on the street, aware of other shopkeepers poking their heads out of small storefronts and/or workshops, and of customers congregating on doorsteps across the narrow lane. Six or seven shops down, a camel chewed cud, while his owner fiddled with a saddle that bore little silver bells and pretended not to watch Mahiya.</p><p>Angels filled the skies of this city, but an angel in this street of the market district was a rare thing. It wasn\u2019t snobbery that kept her kind away, for angels were as curious as mortals when it came to exploring a city\u2019s hidden byways. It was because the shops here were tiny, with no room for wings. The only reason Mahiya even knew about this particular one was that the owner had been invited to showcase her goods at the fort in a trade exhibition.</p><p>Now, the young mortal appeared in the doorway. Of course, Mahiya thought, youth was a relative thing. This woman who had lived but twenty-seven, perhaps twenty-eight years, was old enough to have a little boy hiding behind her skirts. At the same age, Mahiya had been a babe not much bigger than the boy.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d The toymaker bowed, her hands fisting in her apron. \u201cI would welcome you inside but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe intent is enough,\u201d Mahiya said with utmost gentleness in the informal local dialect. \u201cI will not disturb you long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, let me bring you a cup of tea at least.\u201d Entreaty in eyes of melted chocolate. \u201cI cannot send an angel from my doorstep without courtesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Tea would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>A shaky smile lit up the woman\u2019s face. \u201cI have a pot on the stove. A minute, no more.\u201d As she turned to go, the little boy found the courage to stay behind, eyes of the same melted chocolate as his mother gazing at Mahiya in wonder.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Mahiya said, and since he didn\u2019t bolt, asked, \u201cWhy are you not at school?\u201d</p><p>His eyes became even rounder, and he sucked his thumb into his mouth. When she didn\u2019t say anything further, he withdrew that thumb with slow carefulness, as if not trusting her silence. \u201cI\u2019m not as big as Nishi yet.\u201d A pause, then he added, \u201cNishi goes to school,\u201d as if to make sure she understood.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you be old enough soon?\u201d</p><p>Lines on his forehead. \u201cNot too soon. Maybe almost soon.\u201d</p><p>Biting back her smile at his flawless childish logic, she saw his eyes go to her wings. \u201cYou may come closer if you wish.\u201d</p><p>Thumb in his mouth again, he padded out to stand only inches from her, examining her feathers with the frankness of the very young. When his mother appeared in the doorway, cup in hand, she went to call him back, but Mahiya shook her head. Accepting the tea, she said, \u201cHe is smart and brave both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The proud woman beamed, her thin face beautiful. \u201cTakes after his father.\u201d</p><p>Only then did Mahiya ask her question. \u201cI saw someone with a toy bear\u2014pink and white, with an embroidered collar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf white daisies.\u201d Quickening excitement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, exactly. I thought it may have been your work.\u201d Hand sewn and embroidered, the eyes a lovely blue crystal, and the stitch work exquisite.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember if it had a tiny yellow star on the left foot?\u201d</p><p>Mahiya thought back. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it is mine for certain. But I\u2019m sorry, my lady, I don\u2019t have another.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a pity. Do you keep many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, only one of each kind.\u201d The woman smoothed her hands down her apron. \u201cI sold Daisy a week ago. Oh, let me take your cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. The tea was delicious.\u201d Rich, milky, flavored with cardamom and sweetened with honey. \u201cDo you remember to whom you sold Daisy? I may see if they are willing to sell it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire. Unfamiliar, perhaps a guest at the fort.\u201d The woman bit her lip, shook her head. \u201cHe gave no name, but his hair was scarlet, his skin like fine bone china.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA difficult man to miss.\u201d Yet she knew of no vampire with such hair and skin in the vicinity.</p> <p>Another mystery.</p><p>Jason had spent the morning collecting information from quarters closed to others, and now landed in a farmer\u2019s fallow field, heading to the shade cast by a hut likely used as a resting place during the planting season. He needed the whispering silence to think, to put all the pieces together.</p><p>The fact was, though he\u2019d said nothing to either Venom or Mahiya, he had the amorphous feeling that Mahiya was the key. But while she\u2019d had relationships of some kind with both Eris and Arav, nothing significant connected her to either Audrey or Shabnam. Yet, his instincts persisted\u2014as if he\u2019d seen or heard something he hadn\u2019t consciously understood.</p><p>Frustrated, he took out his phone, deciding to pursue the answer to another question.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d The warmth of Jessamy\u2019s smile traveled through even the tiny screen. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d It was Jessamy who had first helped him remember what it was to be a person again.</p> <p>Standing outside the place where he\u2019d watched the baby angels go to learn things, he waited for the last lingering student to disappear before he slipped inside.</p><p>The woman within looked up, her eyes gentle with a kindness that wasn\u2019t pity. \u201cI have something for you,\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d been waiting for him, as if she knew he\u2019d been listening to her lessons from the shadows for many days.</p><p>Walking over, she handed him a set of hard books with big letters on the pages. \u201cTo help you remember.\u201d</p><p>He touched the cover, turned the pages.</p><p>He\u2019d once had books like this, had read them over and over even after he was alone, but then they\u2019d crumbled, and after a while, he\u2019d forgotten he was supposed to know how to read. Until today, when Jessamy\u2019s newest lesson had turned a key in his mind, unlocking the sound of his mother\u2019s voice as she taught him his letters.</p><p>Taking the books, he left without a word.</p><p>It had taken him months to break his silence, but Jessamy, with her wise eyes and kind heart, had never pushed, always left him room to breathe. Now, he said, \u201cI have a question for you.\u201d</p><p>A tilt of her head.</p> <p>\u201cYou know Lijuan has evolved, and Raphael has gained a new ability. There are now signs that something may be happening to Titus, though I cannot yet say what.\u201d The warrior archangel\u2019s people were fiercely loyal, and Jason\u2019s spies had only been able to ascertain that Titus was battling an illness. As archangels did not get sick, Titus must be undergoing a transformation of some kind.</p><p>Neha\u2019s ability to wield ice wasn\u2019t public knowledge, thus he couldn\u2019t speak of it without breaking the blood vow, but he had further evidence of a Cadre-wide phenomenon. \u201cYou remember Astaad\u2019s erratic behavior.\u201d The archangel had beaten one of his beloved concubines to a pulp, when he was known to be indulgent with his women to the point of spoiling them. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing is that he\u2019s stabilized and may have gained nascent abilities over sea creatures.\u201d</p><p>Jessamy\u2019s expression was thoughtful. \u201cAt the time, his behavior was explained by the disruption caused by Caliane\u2019s awakening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe awakening of an Ancient is nothing to ignore,\u201d Jason said, thinking of the lost city of Amanat risen in a place far from its origin. \u201cBut could Caliane\u2019s awakening have been triggered by a more dominant force?\u201d Lijuan\u2019s dark evolution had predated Caliane\u2019s waking by mere months, both events shifting the course of the world\u2019s history.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no\u2014\u201d Jessamy went silent. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>When she returned, it was with an old bound book she held with such care, it was clear it was fragile. \u201cThis history mentions an event called the \u2018Cascade\u2019 and states: \u2018And the archangels were not who they should be, and bodies rotted in the streets, and blood rained from the skies as empires burned.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Expression solemn, Jessamy glanced up. \u201cThis Cascade was over twenty-five thousand years ago. I\u2019ll begin to search the archives for further information, but though her exact age is disputed, I believe there is one archangel awake who would\u2019ve experienced it firsthand.\u201d</p><p>Caliane.</p><p>Ending the call soon afterward to make another, he rose on a flight path toward the fort, aiming for the office Rhys kept near the barracks that housed most of the guard. The other man was overseeing a training exercise from his balcony, but he had the forensic reports.</p><p>\u201cNothing we didn\u2019t already know,\u201d he said to Jason. \u201cThere was no finesse, no attempt to hide anything. Audrey appears to have had her organs removed, while Shabnam\u2019s head was torn off. Arav, too, was ripped apart\u2014tendons sheared, muscles snapped.\u201d</p><p>Jason scanned the reports, saw the note about Shabnam\u2019s head, read that Arav had indeed been ripped apart\u2014by bare hands. Not a single mark that could be attributed to a weapon had been found on his body. That told Jason something important. Very, very few angels had the strength to physically rip out another angel\u2019s spine, much less wrench off his head.</p><p>And to do that in flight against a general of Arav\u2019s abilities? It would require near-archangel level strength or an unknown new ability. He needed to have his people begin to covertly check the power status of certain angels, get an indication if they, too, were being impacted by this strange evolution that seemed to be affecting the Cadre.</p><p>Flipping back, he rechecked the report on Shabnam. Though the pathologist had been unable to confirm, given the nature of her injuries, it was his considered opinion that her face had been raked with claws of some kind. Jason had witnessed Neha\u2019s fingernails elongate into claws, but it wasn\u2019t an ability limited to her alone. Still, it was another piece of the puzzle.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, retaining his copy of the forensic findings. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing important here.\u201d Rhys might be Neha\u2019s man, but he wasn\u2019t Jason\u2019s.</p><p>26</p><p>Raphael considered the discussion he\u2019d just had with Jason, and made the decision to put through a call to Caliane. His mother had initially been resistant to utilizing any kind of modern communications equipment, but after he\u2019d refused to communicate with her using raw power, she had finally acquiesced to a small suite Naasir and Isabel had put in place.</p><p>Now, Raphael waited as the angel on duty went to retrieve Caliane.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d Eyes shining with love, she reached out toward the screen as she always did, as if she would touch him. \u201cMy son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d So long had he thought her forever lost that each time he spoke to her, it was a kick to the gut, an ache in his heart. \u201cI would ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you must answer one of mine.\u201d The order of an archangel who had been alive for an eon before her Sleep. \u201cWhen can I next expect my son\u2019s presence?\u201d She waved her hand. \u201cAnd I do not mean through this device.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot leave the Tower until one of the senior Seven return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beautiful blue one. He is certainly not weak.\u201d</p><p>No, Illium was in no way weak, but his power had been growing in unpredictable jolts; enough that he didn\u2019t quite have a handle on his new strength. \u201cMother,\u201d he said gently, for he would give her honor until and unless her terrible madness returned, \u201cI am your son, but I am also Cadre. Do not attempt to run my Tower, and I will not attempt to run your city.\u201d</p><p>Caliane\u2019s gaze burned a dramatic blue flame, the glow deadly. \u201cAnd should I decide to visit you, what then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI and my consort would welcome you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you intend to continue the liaison? I could break her in a finger snap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would have to kill you\u2014as I will do if I ever consider you a threat to Elena.\u201d His mother was an Ancient, used to getting her way and to seeing him as a child. She needed to remember that the boy she\u2019d left bleeding and broken and heartsick on a green field far from civilization was long gone. \u201cI am not who I once was.\u201d</p><p>The glow dimmed, melancholy in every line of her face, and he knew she relived the same memories. \u201cAsk your question, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>He spoke to her of the \u201cCascade,\u201d saw immediate comprehension. \u201cSo\u201d\u2014a whisper that held the weight of too much knowledge\u2014\u201cit\u2019s true. I\u2019d begun to sense the signs but had hoped I was wrong.\u201d Hair the shade she\u2019d bequeathed him tumbled over her shoulders as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is exactly what the Refuge Historian believes it to be\u2014a confluence of time and certain critical events that has ignited a power surge in the Cadre. Some will gain strength, while others will be reborn with new abilities. There is no way to predict the outcome, and many of these abilities will be erratic at best, have catastrophic effects at worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Cadre may be able to weather the change successfully now that we have this knowledge.\u201d</p><p>Caliane\u2019s expression was suddenly old, so very old that he could believe Lijuan was right, that his mother had lived two hundred and fifty thousand years. \u201cYes, but you see, it was during the last Cascade that I believe I first became touched with madness, though I did not know it then, for it was an insidious intruder hiding within. There is no way to protect against such a change.\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>Venom, his legs hanging over the side and his mirrored sunglasses in place, was sitting on the part of the balcony outside Jason\u2019s room when Jason returned to the palace. A steaming cup of coffee sat next to his left hand.</p><p>\u201cI had to beg,\u201d the vampire said when he saw the direction of Jason\u2019s gaze. \u201cYour princess considers coffee an insult to the taste buds.\u201d He raised his face to the sky, drinking in the sun with sinuous pleasure. \u201cDid I ever tell you I hate the cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery winter.\u201d Jason passed Venom the forensic reports. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchangel strength or near to it . . . or maybe an ability of some kind,\u201d Venom said, because he\u2019d been trained by Jason to see such things. \u201cPuts a whole new spin on recent events. Lijuan?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe could\u2019ve done it and been gone before we ever knew she was here.\u201d The Archangel of China had the ability to dematerialize her body, though as Raphael had shown in the battle above Amanat, she wasn\u2019t as omnipotent as she went to great lengths to make everyone believe.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Venom said, \u201cbut she\u2019s always had a cordial enough relationship with Neha. And to kill Eris in that way? I\u2019ve seen the sick things Lijuan has done, but this was personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Catching a whisper of some unknown flower intermingled with spices bright and opulent, he turned to see Mahiya step out of her suite. Part of him went motionless, waiting to see if she\u2019d come to regret the passion they\u2019d shared in the hours before dawn.</p><p>Her smile lit up her eyes. \u201cI heard your voice.\u201d</p> <p>It took intense concentration not to reach out, part her soft lips with his own, taste a smile that was a kiss against his senses. \u201cWhat did you discover today?\u201d</p><p>Venom rolled up to his feet before Mahiya could reply. \u201cLet\u2019s talk inside.\u201d</p><p>It seemed natural to follow Mahiya into the cool comfort of her living quarters, the low table on the floor set with food. \u201cI thought you might be hungry since it\u2019s after lunch,\u201d she said, but Jason\u2019s attention was riveted by the pink teddy bear sitting beside the lamp.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Venom closed the doors and said, \u201cI have a story about that.\u201d</p><p>Jason stayed silent as Venom relayed the strange tale. \u201cA scarlet-haired vampire?\u201d he asked Mahiya once she\u2019d added her findings. As for her taking the risk that she had with the box, they\u2019d discuss that in private.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d A fiery glint in her eye. \u201cUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t ask anyone else in the area if they\u2019d seen the man\u2014it would\u2019ve caused too many ripples.\u201d</p><p>Jason looked at Venom.</p><p>Sipping at his coffee, the vampire gave him a lazy grin. \u201cYes, I went down to the city, made some enquiries.\u201d Leaning back against the wall, he said, \u201cOur buyer doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d blend into the general populace, yet no one has any knowledge of him. Then again, my contacts are\u2014relatively speaking\u2014on the younger side. Might be he\u2019s an old one who\u2019s just come out of seclusion.\u201d</p><p>Angels Slept when immortality became too heavy a burden. While vampires lacked that ability to put their bodies in a state akin to suspended animation, they could and did sometimes retreat into isolation accompanied only by their \u201ccattle.\u201d It was what the old ones called the humans who were addicted to a vampire\u2019s kiss and remained with them as a ready source of food.</p><p>For the older vampires, the term was one of affection, the donors treated with the same respect one might show a beloved pet. Those cattle quite often recruited replacements as the decades passed\u2014Jason had known one vampire to remain in seclusion for three hundred years and counting.</p><p>\u201cHe might be from outside the region,\u201d Mahiya said.</p> <p>\u201cHe sent you what could be a courting gift. That argues otherwise.\u201d According to everything she\u2019d told him, her trip to Lijuan\u2019s stronghold had been her only foray beyond the borders of Neha\u2019s territory since her return from the Refuge. \u201cDid you see anyone who might fit the description while you were in China?\u201d</p><p>A tiny shiver rippled across her shoulders. \u201cNo. Red wings, yes, red hair, no. No one with that skin tone, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRefuge?\u201d Venom asked. \u201cCould be he saw you when you were younger.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAny visitors to Neha\u2019s court who\u2019ve paid you undue attention of late?\u201d Hair color could be altered.</p><p>\u201cThe usual meaningless court flattery. Nothing that would lead to such a convoluted scheme to pass on a gift.\u201d</p><p>And the gift itself, Jason thought, was unusual for an immortal, most of whom would woo a woman with jewels or unusual treasures. As for this particular woman, he found the idea of another man courting her incited in him a dark violence he\u2019d spent a lifetime learning to contain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Nene!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not! Why won\u2019t you listen? He\u2019s a friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you disappeared with him for an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was showing him the atoll while you spoke with his father!\u201d A sobbing sound of frustration. \u201cI hate this ugly jealousy of yours, Yavi. It\u2019s killing us.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s prophetic words ringing through his mind, Jason turned to Venom. \u201cSee if you can dig deeper without it reaching the wrong ears.\u201d</p><p>Venom bent to put his empty cup on the table before flowing to his feet with a supple grace that was a thing of beauty to some, an indication of danger to others. \u201cI think I\u2019ll jump off the balcony, scare the guards hiding outside.\u201d With that, he was gone.</p><p>Jason stepped closer to Mahiya. \u201cYou should not have taken that risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a considered one.\u201d Her tone was resolute. \u201cI would do it again in a heartbeat. I will not barter for my life with yours or Venom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Gripping her chin, Jason looked into an unflinching gaze bright as a jungle cat\u2019s. \u201cI do not wish to scrape up the remains of your broken, violated body.\u201d It was a confession from a part of his self that hadn\u2019t seen the light in an eon. \u201cSo you must allow me to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had been ready to fight arrogance, found herself bewildered by the quiet request so potent with emotions unspoken. \u201cI won\u2019t take any unnecessary risks,\u201d she said, closing her fingers over the bones of his wrist, his skin hot under her touch. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the weakest one of us, Mahiya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she whispered, asking him to understand, \u201cI am not weak. I cannot be that and survive.\u201d</p><p>Her black-winged lover said nothing for a long, motionless moment before releasing his hold on her. She forced herself to let go of him, feeling bereft. \u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cEat with me before the food goes cold.\u201d</p><p>Jason caught her wrist when she would\u2019ve moved to the table. \u201cYou don\u2019t treat food as other immortals do.\u201d His thumb moved over her knuckles. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>Snakes hissing all around her, fangs sinking into her skin, poison in her bloodstream.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s fingers curled into her fist, but she held her ground. \u201cNo, Jason. I will not allow you to steal all my secrets while you hoard your own.\u201d He knew so much about her, while she did not even know where he made his home.</p><p>His fingers flexed, and he tugged her closer, until they stood toe to toe. \u201cDo you know the story of Yaviel and Aurelani?\u201d</p><p>It was the most startling of questions. \u201cOf course.\u201d Theirs was one of the great angelic romances. \u201cThey were born of warring families from different sides of the world. Yaviel was a singer turned artisan, Aurelani a scholar gaining renown.\u201d Both families had been painfully proud of their children, but when the two fell in love, centuries-old hate had overwhelmed the tenderness of their devotion, and they\u2019d been torn apart.</p><p>\u201cIt is said Yaviel survived torture to break into Aurelani\u2019s home to steal her away and that they disappeared to build a life together, far from the vicious power of their families.\u201d The romance of it had made her girlish heart sigh. Even now, as an adult, her soul ached at the idea of being loved with such devotion. \u201cYaviel\u2019s musical instruments continued to appear in the Refuge, so there were some who knew where the lovers lived, but it was a secret never betrayed.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s voice was rough as he said, \u201cHe called her Nene, and she called him Yavi.\u201d</p><p>A chill over her skin, a vision of suffocating darkness.</p><p>\u201cNene couldn\u2019t abide the cold, and Yavi loved her so that he found them an uninhabited atoll in the warm waters of the Pacific, far, far from any sky roads to civilization.\u201d His fingers tightened on her wrist, but she didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t dare breathe. \u201cTrusted friends came and took Yavi\u2019s creations to the Refuge, where they sold for amounts that meant he could buy his Nene whatever she wanted. She loved amethysts, and he showered her with them . . . but what Nene loved most was her Yavi.\u201d</p><p>A tear trickled down her cheek though he\u2019d said nothing awful, yet the sadness in him, it was a heavy weight she thought might crush a lesser man. \u201cShe must have loved you, too,\u201d she whispered, seeing in his face the history of two different clans who had eventually ended one another in a rage of violence.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Haunted eyes meeting hers. \u201cI was well loved by my parents.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya wanted to ask him why he used only the past tense, why he carried such black sorrow within, what had happened to Nene if Yavi was dead, but she couldn\u2019t hurt him when he was already so terribly hurt deep inside. \u201cI never ignore food, because I know what it is to starve.\u201d</p><p>The profound sadness in Jason changed, became a black blade licked with flame. It took a great deal for an older angel to starve, but an angel of Mahiya\u2019s age remained vulnerable. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Mahiya swallowed, her fingers curling on his chest. \u201cAfter Lijuan had me escorted back from her territory. Neha threw me into a windowless cell up at Guardian, and then she locked the door.\u201d</p><p>The fear that emanated from her was too violent a thing for the slow pain of starvation. And Jason knew. \u201cYou weren\u2019t alone in the room, were you?\u201d</p><p>Tears welling in her eyes, teeth sunk into her lower lip, she shook her head. Releasing her wrist, he locked his arms around her. But she didn\u2019t sob, the princess he held. Breath ragged, she said, \u201cThere were so many of them. Pit vipers and spitting cobras, rattlesnakes and taipan.\u201d</p><p>Venomous snakes.</p><p>Their poison couldn\u2019t kill an adult angel her age, but it could cause excruciating pain, convulsions, even temporary blindness and paralysis. \u201cTell me one thing.\u201d He cupped the back of her head, pressed his cheek to her temple.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could kill Neha, would you?\u201d A spymaster knew a great deal, such as when an archangel might be most vulnerable to attack by her enemies.</p><p>Mahiya shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d Shifting so they were eye to eye, she whispered, \u201cIn making that my goal, I\u2019d become just like her, a woman driven by hate until there\u2019s this knot of bitterness inside her that infects everything she touches.\u201d</p><p>Anoushka, Jason thought, hadn\u2019t become who she was in isolation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find my vengeance in living a life overflowing with happiness,\u201d Mahiya vowed. \u201cIn drowning myself in love, not hatred.\u201d</p><p>In that instant, her eyes incandescent against the golden brown of her skin, she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and he knew that she was too fine a thing for him, that the black emptiness within him would ruin her. And still he said, \u201cThe skies will be clear tonight. Will you fly with me?\u201d</p><p>Her smile glowed, the horror erased by a fearless joy.</p><p>The hours passed with a leaden slowness. Jason retraced his every step in the search for the murderer, but it was his interview with the guards who\u2019d been on Eris\u2019s door when he was killed that proved the most intriguing. When Jason had believed Neha the murderer, the fact the archangel had said she\u2019d stripped their minds and found nothing hadn\u2019t been a surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t understood she meant that literally.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d the first guard said, a stricken expression in his eyes. \u201cAt the time, I had no consciousness of it, but later, when I was asked, I realized I had no memory of several hours of the night.\u201d</p><p>The second guard told the same story.</p><p>Jason knew Venom had the capacity to mesmerize people\u2014the vampire had gained it during his Making by Neha.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know of anyone else who possesses it?\u201d he asked Mahiya that night.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family trait,\u201d she responded. \u201cMy mother was said to share it with Neha, though her abilities were otherwise dissimilar. I didn\u2019t inherit it, but Anoushka did. Neha\u2019s bloodline is an ancient one\u2014I don\u2019t know of any direct descendants with Anoushka dead, but there are some old ones who came before her who do not Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jason made a few calls, tracked down those forbearers. \u201cThe relationship is distant, and they\u2019re all too weak to have killed even Shabnam.\u201d The lady-in-waiting had been no power, but like all courtiers, she\u2019d had a certain level of strength.</p><p>Mahiya frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone else who is known to have that ability, but some angels are secretive about their strength.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Jason thought, especially if the impact of the Cascade was rippling beyond the Cadre. \u201cDid you discover anything?\u201d She\u2019d spent the last hours navigating the maze of afternoon and early evening court functions.</p> <p>\u201cA sense of unease,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is scared he or she will be the next target, and a number are making plans to leave the fort, but that\u2019s all hot air. Neha will not forgive desertion, and they\u2019re too self-obsessed to lose their place in the court.\u201d She blew out a breath, rubbing at her forehead with her fingertips. \u201cMy head hurts from the inanity of it, and I have not one good piece of information to show for my efforts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Jason said. \u201cWe both need to spread our wings. Come.\u201d</p><p>He allowed Mahiya to set the pace, to set their direction, shadowing her vibrant wings as she swept across the skies with the ease and grace of someone who knew the vagaries of the winds in the mountains, understood how the land interacted with the sky. She wasn\u2019t the most technically accomplished flyer, but there was a lingering happiness to her every movement that was impossible to miss and that made her striking to watch.</p><p>\u201cFree,\u201d she said to him when they came to a stop on a high hill overlooking the twinkling lights of the city. \u201cIn the sky, I have always been free.\u201d</p><p>Observing the naked pleasure on her face, Jason had to fight the urge to wrap her in his wings, hide her from the sight of those who would turn that joy to despair, using her love of the sky to torture her. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>Closing the small distance between them, Mahiya put a hand to his chest in a gentle feminine invitation he knew he had only to step back to reject. In spite of her vivid emotions, she wasn\u2019t a woman who would pursue a man who made it clear he didn\u2019t want her . . . or one who knew that in taking her, he might destroy the very brightness of spirit that caught him in delicate chains, agonizingly painful in their hope.</p> <p>28</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said, \u201calways careful, but you . . . now I know why you are such a great spymaster.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand her meaning, the warmth of her touch seeping through the thin black shirt he wore to linger on his skin. Drinking in the sensation, he ran his fingers down the line of her neck, hot satisfaction in his blood when she shivered. There was a deeper pleasure in this, in knowing what made her sigh, learning the intimacies of her body. Yet it was a pleasure he\u2019d denied himself for hundreds of years.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d Wounded eyes, blue and wet. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d Couldn\u2019t give her his heart.</p><p>Fist clenching in the sheet she held to her breast, tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cI thought . . . when you kept returning . . .\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been so young then, very good at his job, but far behind his peers when it came to emotions, to relationships. He\u2019d thought that long-ago lover had understood he spoke the naked truth, never realizing the secret dreams brewing in her heart. A heart he\u2019d broken without meaning to, without even knowing he held the power to do so. It had soon healed for she\u2019d been young, too, and he thought that she might no longer even remember the black-winged angel she\u2019d once pleaded with to stay with her.</p><p>But he\u2019d never forgotten the lesson, and he wondered if Mahiya had truly heard what he\u2019d said to her the night before or if she, too, harbored dreams of fixing the broken pieces of him. The truth was, no matter how she compelled him, she would soon realize what was shattered in him was nothing that could be healed, the damage done at such a young age that it had become part of his very psyche.</p> <p>Yet instead of backing off, he did a selfish thing then. Lowering his head, he claimed the lush intoxication of her kiss, his hands thrusting into her hair to tumble black silk over his skin. She opened for him with a sweet sensual generosity that enticed without design, made him want to caress her every secret pleasure point until her desire was a shimmer across her skin and he knew her like no other man ever would.</p><p>\u201cJason? You\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>Tugging back her head with the hand fisted in her hair, he forced himself to release lips swollen from his kisses. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d It was a harsh order.</p><p>Thick lashes rose to reveal tawny eyes hazy with passion. \u201cI see you, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you see?\u201d He stroked his free hand up her side, rubbed his thumb gently back and forth over her nipple through her clothing.</p><p>Her breath caught, but she didn\u2019t break the eye contact. \u201cA man who is a storm, who belongs to no one and who will never be tamed. To expect otherwise would be to ask for agonizing disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Open eyes, he thought, she had wide-open eyes. \u201cSome might say you\u2019re attempting to seduce me in order to lead me on a leash.\u201d</p><p>Laughter, warm and startled, spilled over the hilltop. \u201cOnly a fool would attempt to contain or direct a storm. I\u2019m far too smart.\u201d</p><p>He took her lips in an open-mouthed kiss in an attempt to drink of her laughter, steal some of her dazzling warmth of spirit to hoard inside him. Her nails dug into his chest through his shirt, her breast pushed into his hand, and her scent, it tangled around him in an exotic wildness.</p><p>The gut-deep sense of connection was an intense shock that made his nerve endings burn. He had never felt more real, more a part of the world.</p><p>Breaking the kiss only long enough that she could gasp in air, he slanted his mouth across hers again, licking and tasting and sinking into the carnal pleasure. Her nipple was a hard point beneath the fabric of her tunic, and when he squeezed it between forefinger and thumb, she jerked, pulling away from his touch.</p><p>Folding back wings that had become fully unfurled, he watched her attempt to resettle her breathing. \u201cNot here,\u201d she said at last, her chest rising and falling in an erratic rhythm. \u201cWill you come to my bed?\u201d</p><p>It was such a polite invitation, and yet her lips were wet from his kiss, her cheeks flushed with sexual need. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said yes, but Jason left after escorting Mahiya back to the palace, having received a message on his phone he had to follow up on at once. Sensual frustration tearing through her veins, she decided to take care of a task of her own and headed to Vanhi\u2019s apartments using busy internal passageways. If she was a target, it\u2019d make it difficult for anyone to cut her from the herd.</p><p>Vanhi was reading when she arrived. Mahiya bent down to kiss her smiling cheek before taking a seat in one of the comfortable armchairs in the vampire\u2019s living area. \u201cI\u2019m disturbing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you are always welcome.\u201d Vanhi slid an intricate metal bookmark between the pages and put the book on the coffee table. \u201cIt worries me, Mahiya, the look I see in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanhi\u2014\u201d</p><p>The vampire held up her hand. \u201cI know you too well, my dear. I rocked you when you cried as a babe and when Arav shattered your heart as a young woman.\u201d Sighing, she reached out to take one of Mahiya\u2019s hands in her own, squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting your whole life to love someone, my sweet girl. I don\u2019t want you to squander the power of that beautiful heart on a man who will not value such a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand him, Vanhi.\u201d Never would she forget the terrible sorrow she\u2019d tasted in his tale of Nene and her Yavi, until it hurt her to imagine the cause. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting anything but what he can give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that, but you\u2019re deeply vulnerable to kindness, to any indication of care.\u201d</p><p>The emotional blow stung. \u201cYou make me sound like an abused pet.\u201d</p><p>Rising to her feet, Vanhi walked over to the dining area to pour two glasses of wine. \u201cI do not begrudge you happiness.\u201d Care in every syllable as she retook her seat, having handed Mahiya the second wineglass. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you hurt again.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya gave the other woman a crooked smile. \u201cIf the hurt is an honest one, I will survive.\u201d Perhaps she had spent her life waiting for someone to love, and Jason . . . he needed to be loved, as a wildflower needed sunlight.</p><p>Vanhi shook her head. \u201cI bear fault in this\u2014it is to my sorrow that I couldn\u2019t be there for you, couldn\u2019t give you the love every child should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did all you could.\u201d What Mahiya knew of kindness and affection came from Jessamy and Vanhi. \u201cShe is an archangel.\u201d And your loyalty is first to her. It was a truth Mahiya had accepted long ago.</p><p>A bleak sadness in Vanhi\u2019s expression. \u201cTell me why you come to me so late, Mahiya child.\u201d</p><p>Setting aside her wineglass, Mahiya spoke of the teddy bear, and the vampire with hair of scarlet and skin of porcelain. Vanhi rubbed at the furrows that had formed between her eyebrows. \u201cOh, I know him.\u201d A frustrated sound. \u201cIt\u2019s flitting at the very corner of my eye, his name, but I cannot quite grasp it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep on it.\u201d Exhilaration made Mahiya want to push, but Vanhi was thousands of years old, carried a million fragments of memory. \u201cIf it comes to you tomorrow morn, send me a message.\u201d</p><p>Lines still marring her forehead, Vanhi gave a slow nod. \u201cHe was not important, I think. But always there, at the edges. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so hard to remember.\u201d A rueful smile. \u201cTruly, I am getting old. So many pieces of a lifetime\u2014sometimes I think they are hidden in secret corners of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish my memory were as good as yours.\u201d</p><p>Vanhi\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI wish you could\u2019ve known your mother, child.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s spine went rigid. \u201cShe slept with a married man. A man who belonged to her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Vanhi gave a solemn nod. \u201cThey were ever in competition, Neha and Nivriti.\u201d Drinking deep of her wine, the vampire held Mahiya\u2019s gaze with eyes of vivid green. \u201cIt was Nivriti whom Eris first courted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words were a fist punching against her ribs. \u201cNeha was the one who committed the initial betrayal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never that simple.\u201d Vanhi\u2019s eyes shut, opened again to display steely resolve. \u201cI never before spoke to you about this, because what good would it have done? The past is gone, buried.\u201d Finishing her wine, she played the stem of the glass between her fingers. \u201cNow I see I was wrong. You must know where you came from if you are to take charge of your own destiny. And if I will not share these secrets with you, who will?\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s skin felt as if it would burst with all the questions she had inside her, but she kept quiet, intent on listening with every cell in her body.</p><p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d Vanhi murmured, \u201calways calls Nivriti the younger sister, and she was . . . by five heartbeats.\u201d</p> <p>Her silence shattered. \u201cTwins? How can that be? No one ever mentions it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeha was always stronger, until Nivriti was thrown into the shade. She was also the more innocent of the two, and as the centuries passed, people forgot the truth and just thought of her as younger.\u201d Vanhi\u2019s voice was grave with age, with history, as she continued. \u201cAs children, they didn\u2019t fight or compete\u2014Neha used to take great care of Nivriti, and theirs was a bond I thought nothing would break.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya could barely absorb what Vanhi was telling her. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge, time, life.\u201d A shake of her head. \u201cMaybe it was jealousy on Nivriti\u2019s part, arrogance on Neha\u2019s, or maybe it was simple sibling rivalry, but they began to play a game. It started out as a battle of wits and devolved into something so ugly it hurt my heart to stand witness.\u201d</p><p>Vanhi\u2019s eyes shone wet. \u201cFirst, if Nivriti asked the seamstress to make her a special dress, Neha would steal the design, get an identical one made in a shorter time and wear it prior to Nivriti\u2019s big event. Nivriti would retaliate by hiding Neha\u2019s gems so her sister would be forced to appear drab, while she glittered. After a while\u201d\u2014a hitching breath\u2014\u201cthey began to play the game with people as their chess pieces.\u201d</p> <p>Mahiya\u2019s gnawing curiosity twisted into a knot in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cIf one of them made a friend, the other would either charm that friend away or seed the relationship with vitriol until it curled up and died. It was such a foolish, foolish waste of their talents and gifts.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya rubbed a fisted hand over her belly, for she knew it was about to get much worse. \u201cI\u2019ve heard my mother\u2019s strongest ability had to do with things that flew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The shadow of a smile, lush red lips curving in memory. \u201cShe assured me the birds spoke to her and that she could see through their eyes. Falcons came to roost on her shoulders without aggression or anger . . . though as her bitterness grew, she no longer took joy in admiring their wild beauty, but began to use them as weapons.\u201d</p><p>The wet spilled from Vanhi\u2019s eye to trickle down to her lips. \u201cI once saw her send a falcon down to claw the eyes out of a vampire\u2019s head. He\u2019d been her lover, had taken a position in Neha\u2019s new-formed court. When I reached him, his face was a mask of red, his screams of agony piercing me to the bone.\u201d</p><p>The adult Mahiya had never believed her mother a fairy-tale maiden who\u2019d been wronged . . . but she\u2019d had hopes\u2014that Nivriti had been better than Neha, that Mahiya\u2019s birth hadn\u2019t been an act of ultimate hate. However, shatter her dreams though they might, she craved the truth, would hear all of it. \u201cSo Eris wasn\u2019t their first battleground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he was the first they both loved.\u201d Vanhi\u2019s wineglass cracked under the force of her grip, sending a trickle of blood down her palm. Waving off Mahiya\u2019s cry, Vanhi put the broken pieces on the coffee table and dabbed at the wound with a handkerchief. \u201cI am sorry to say Eris was not worth either one of my girls\u2014or of the daughters he helped create.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanhi, let me get a bandage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, child. It\u2019ll close up soon enough.\u201d A smile that took the sting out of the chiding. \u201cBut you can pour me another glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya did so, glad to see the vampire had indeed stopped bleeding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to believe Eris courted Nivriti first because she was the more accessible,\u201d Vanhi said, taking a sip of the crisp white wine. \u201cNeha was already an archangel, but your mother was a power in her own right\u2014I say to this day that she would\u2019ve become Cadre had she lived. It was just that her development was a slow burn in comparison to Neha\u2019s blaze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce Eris had her trust,\u201d Mahiya guessed, having no illusions about the man who had fathered her, \u201che used that connection to reach Neha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if she knew he belonged to Nivriti at first.\u201d Vanhi\u2019s words were soft, poignant with love for the girls she\u2019d helped raise. \u201cI think Neha fell so deeply for Eris because she was unaware of the truth\u2014had she been driven by the game, she would\u2019ve made certain to armor her heart so she could discard him once he\u2019d left Nivriti. As for Eris . . . love was an interchangeable token to him.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had nothing to say to that\u2014she\u2019d known her father too well.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time,\u201d Vanhi said, \u201cNivriti didn\u2019t make any kind of a fuss. My poor child was heartbroken, even left the part of the territory she ruled as a powerful queen, and went away for many years to the lands Favashi now calls her own. I had never seen her so defeated. Neha, too, felt for her sister\u2014I suppose she thought she had won the prize and could be the bigger person. The games stopped.\u201d</p><p>Anger, clean and bright, bubbled under Mahiya\u2019s skin. \u201cMy mother obviously decided to change the status quo long after Neha\u2019s marriage.\u201d Putting in motion events that had led to her daughter growing up motherless and trapped.</p><p>But Vanhi shook her head. \u201cNo, it was no game. Nivriti never felt about another man as she did about Eris.\u201d The vampire put down her glass as if afraid she\u2019d fracture it, too. \u201cIt is one of the world\u2019s great injustices that he, of all men, had the keeping of two such strong women\u2019s hearts.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s anger shattered into a painful understanding for the mother she\u2019d never known, because behind the ugliness of infidelity was an abiding love. Eris hadn\u2019t been worthy of it, but that Mahiya had been conceived in love, at least on one side, it changed the very nature of her history.</p><p>\u201cYou cry.\u201d Vanhi touched her fingers to Mahiya\u2019s tears, wiping them away. \u201cAh, my sweet girl. I didn\u2019t mean to make you sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wondered if she even cared I was taken from her,\u201d Mahiya said, her vision blurred by the tears that kept falling. \u201cNow I think that maybe she would have, that maybe I meant something to her.\u201d</p><p>Distress bloomed on Vanhi\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean something to her. You meant everything.\u201d Cupping Mahiya\u2019s face, she said, \u201cI have kept another secret from you, one I was enjoined by your mother to keep, for I was there at your birth.\u201d</p><p>29</p><p>Mahiya blinked away her tears, her world a kaleidoscope. \u201cI was not ripped from my mother\u2019s womb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Vanhi\u2019s distress grew. \u201cI made sure Nivriti\u2019s birthing was as easy as it could be for a woman who lay in a cell.\u201d Fingers trembling, she brushed back Mahiya\u2019s hair. \u201cIt was after the birth, when you\u2019d been taken from her that I was alone in the room with your mother for a bare few moments. She whispered to me that she would leave her child a gift, and she made me promise to give you that gift at the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, trembling at the idea of a link to her mother.</p><p>Vanhi\u2019s laugh was waterlogged. \u201cMahiya, such a beautiful name, don\u2019t you think? One I suggested to Neha.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had always taken her name to be a cruel joke on Neha\u2019s part, for it meant happiness, joy . . . and sometimes, beloved. \u201cMy mother gave me my name?\u201d It was a gift no one could ever take away from her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but the second part, I had to keep secret for Neha would not have permitted it.\u201d The anguish of a woman who loved the archangel but saw the lack in her.</p><p>Mahiya leaned forward, a hundred butterflies in her blood. \u201cWhat is the second part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeet,\u201d Vanhi whispered. \u201cYour name is Mahiya Geet.\u201d</p><p>Joyous song . . . beloved song.</p><p>Her heart shattered from the inside out. Far from being a mockery, her name was a treasure, a last gift from a mother who hadn\u2019t, she knew without asking, been allowed to hold her newborn daughter. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered to Vanhi through a throat swollen with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI thought to tell you earlier . . . but you weren\u2019t ready,\u201d Vanhi said, taking her into her arms. \u201cNow you are. I think the world will tremble to hear your song, sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>Beloved song.</p><p>Mahiya squeezed the railing of the balcony and turned to look at the man who was the only one other than Vanhi who knew her true name. She\u2019d had to tell someone, and Jason . . . he would keep her secrets.</p><p>Close to midnight, the skies were empty aside from the sweep of the outer sentries. Here, within the walls of the fort, it was quiet but for the night insects, the wind still as a glassy pond, the air cool but not cold. The man beside her was a part of the night, his wings near indistinguishable from the shadows.</p><p>\u201cIt suits you,\u201d he said, one of those wings brushing her own as he spread them behind her.</p><p>Biting back a responsive shiver, she laughed, the sound soft and intimate in the dark. \u201cI am not the most gifted of singers, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>A tug in her hair, Jason\u2019s fingers unraveling the neat knot at her nape with exquisite patience, each golden pin put on the railing in order, until they shimmered in the dark and her hair tumbled down her back and over her wings. Mahiya trembled. She had been born in a time when a woman did not put down her hair in front of anyone but her lover, and some part of her was that girl still.</p><p>It was an intimacy they shared beneath the starlit sky.</p><p>When he slid his hand under her hair to close over her nape from behind, she expected him to tug her back for a kiss, but he just rubbed his thumb over her skin before running his knuckles down the centerline of her back and returning to lean on the balcony on his forearms, his wing lying heavily against her own. \u201cI can sing.\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing she\u2019d expected to hear from him, this man who threatened to splinter her defenses until she repeated her mother\u2019s tale of love unrequited. Yet now that he\u2019d spoken, her mind whispered with half-remembered fragments of conversations overheard.</p><p>\u201cA voice more beautiful than Caliane\u2019s they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . made my heart break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurity, that is Jason\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><p>The speakers had all been more than four hundred years old. \u201cI would hear you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI have not sung for many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid something happen to still your song?\u201d she asked, unwilling to back away when this was the first time he\u2019d spontaneously offered her a glimpse into the mystery of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His reply was slow in coming, but she didn\u2019t take his silence for anger, knowing Jason was a man who felt no need to clutter the air with words. Instead, tempted by the way his head was below her own as he leaned down, she reached out to undo the tie that held his hair in its usual queue. It fell like black water around his face, and he didn\u2019t stop her when she began to smooth it back to lie over his shoulders. \u201cYou have such beautiful hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer yours.\u201d</p><p>His hand fisted in her hair, his lips on her throat.</p><p>Thighs clenching, she ran her fingers over his scalp. \u201cThen we are well matched.\u201d</p> <p>He arched a little into her touch. \u201cThe only songs in my heart were ones that made the Refuge drown in tears. So I stopped.\u201d</p><p>Having not expected such an unvarnished answer, she was momentarily thrown, her fingers going motionless. She had the panicked feeling of a chance slipping through her fingertips, an opportunity forever lost. \u201cDid it hurt you to stop?\u201d she asked, grabbing at that chance with grim determination.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt was akin to cutting off a limb, but such song was not good for me.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she parted her lips to ask why, then stopped. Jason was a man draped in shadows\u2014to give voice to the darkness within . . . yes, it would not be good for him to drench himself in it. \u201cIf you ever find something worth singing for again,\u201d she said, a silent, fierce hope in her heart for his song, \u201cI hope you will invite me to listen.\u201d</p><p>Jason pushed off the railing to stand at his full height, folding his wings to his back at the same time. Already, she missed the warm weight against her, but then he dipped his head and the warmth turned into a black fire that kissed her bloodstream and spread into every cell of her body.</p> <p>There would be no forgetting Jason.</p><p>He\u2019d led her into the bedroom, but when he stopped at the foot of the bed, she raised her fingers to the buttons of his shirt after undoing the strap of the sword harness across his chest. The way he\u2019d taken control the previous night, she worried he wouldn\u2019t accept her desire to discover what pleased him, but he played with her hair as she unbuttoned the shirt to display the beauty of his body.</p><p>Each soft tug on her scalp as he twisted a loose, heavy curl around his finger, released it, made her heart skip a beat. But it was the ridges and valleys of his body that had her sighing in feminine pleasure as she pulled the sides of the shirt apart to splay her fingers over his skin. His hand fisted in her hair, but he didn\u2019t call a halt to her exploration.</p><p>Delighted, she shaped the heated steel of him, caressing the heavy muscle that spoke to his strength and speed. It was a quirk of angelic biology that the incredibly powerful muscles needed to support flight didn\u2019t overwhelm the upper body. Instead they lay subtle and fiercely strong beneath the skin.</p><p>But Jason\u2019s body, it told a different story, that of a warrior who needed to do maneuvers in the sky flight muscles alone wouldn\u2019t accommodate. \u201cCan you use your sword in flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be useless as a fighter otherwise,\u201d he murmured, lifting her fingers to the straps on his shoulders that helped hold the sword harness to his back.</p> <p>Taking the silent instruction, she undid the sleek but strong buckle, repeated the act on the other side, the leather soft from use. \u201cAre you ever without your sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Removing harness and sword, he placed them beside the bed.</p><p>Within arm\u2019s reach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my primary weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d Pushing aside his shirt, she rubbed her fingers over the light red marks created by the leather. Such a thing would be nothing to an angel of Jason\u2019s strength, but she did not like seeing his body abused in even so small a way.</p><p>Having kicked off her sandals in the living area, where Jason had left his boots, she rose on bare toes to press her lips to one of the marks. Jason\u2019s free arm came around her waist, but he didn\u2019t halt her movements when she kissed her way across to the other marks. \u201cI could do this for hours,\u201d she said, addicted to the feel of him, the taste of him.</p><p>Jason\u2019s response was again unexpected. \u201cIf that\u2019s your wish.\u201d</p><p>It made her shiver, the idea of having this man in her bed, hers to explore. Dropping down flat on her feet again, she didn\u2019t give him time to change his mind and walked around to undo the plain buttons that held the wing slits closed. His shirt fell to the floor seconds later, his wings stunning arcs of heavy black.</p> <p>She ran her fingers over the shadowy perfection of his feathers, suddenly shy. But he was already unbuckling his belt, the metallic sounds harsh, intimate in the quiet of the bedroom. Breathing ragged, she walked around to take over the task, her fingers brushing his. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d It was a whisper, but Jason\u2019s hand fell away . . . to rise, undo the buttons on the shoulders of her tunic.</p><p>Sliding his belt out of the loops, she dropped it to the floor, cooperated with him to strip away her tunic. Her breasts, small as they were, didn\u2019t need support, and she wore only a camisole beneath. It took Jason but a moment to remove that from her body, run the back of his hand over one taut mound. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>A tremor rippling over her skin at the low murmur, she undid the button of his jeans, ran her fingers along his navel. His muscles contracted. It intoxicated her, his response, and she had the craving to know every touch, every caress that made this strong, sensual man shudder in pleasure. Swallowing at the enthralling thought, she brushed her fingers over his zipper and the hard ridge beneath.</p><p>Jason\u2019s demanding mouth was suddenly on her own, his grip on her hair holding her in place. She didn\u2019t know how it happened, but her pants were stripped from her seconds later, and she found herself lying on her back on the bed with Jason between her legs, the heavy denim of his jeans rubbing against her skin as he devoured her mouth.</p><p>She hooked one leg around his hip, opened her mouth to the wet seduction of his kiss, licked her tongue against his in molten desire. Groaning, he settled more heavily against her, the cold metal of his zipper pressing into the skin of her abdomen as his wings spread above her in a caress of midnight.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d A husky word against her lips. \u201cYou can touch all you wish later.\u201d</p><p>The rough promise made her melt. \u201cI intend to.\u201d</p><p>His hand on her breast, squeezing a fraction too softly. Perhaps it was shameless, but she put her hand over his, increased the pressure. Her reward for such brazenness was piercing pleasure, his lips hot and damp on her neck as he petted her breast, rubbed her nipple. Holding his head to her, she twisted against him, frustrated by the fabric that separated them. \u201cJason, your jeans.\u201d</p><p>A sudden chill as he rose to get rid of his remaining clothing. The sight of him in the faint moonlight that entered the room through a high window, formed of fine designs cut into the stone itself, stole her very breath. He was a work of art, every part of him honed to a deadly edge. Raising her arm, she held out her hand, calling him back to bed.</p><p>He returned in a primal wave of heat that took her over. Kissing his way down her body, he hooked his fingers into the satin and lace of her panties to tug them off, throw them aside.</p><p>A wet, suckling kiss pressed just above her mound before he spread her thighs . . .</p><p>Mahiya arched off the bed under the stark intimacy of his next caress, his mouth tasting her most delicate flesh with lush eroticism as his hands held her open for his\u2014their\u2014pleasure. Her hands gripped at the sheets, her wings fluttering like creatures trapped, and her breath, it became a sob.</p><p>He deepened the kiss, one of his fingers sliding into her sheath.</p><p>The sensual intrusion tipped her over, the pleasure so intense, it stole her voice.</p><p>Moving up her quivering body with a slow attention to detail that left no inch of her skin untouched, untasted, her nipples hard little berries for him to roll against his tongue, her breasts left slick and wet to rub against the muscled beauty of his chest as he reached her lips at last.</p><p>First, he kissed the corners of her eyes, tasting the salt of the pleasure that shimmered over her skin still. But when she turned her lips to his, he accepted the invitation with raw hunger, one of his hands running down her waist to grip her thigh, bring it over his hip, opening her for him.</p><p>And then he was pushing into her, slow and insistent. She gasped, her flesh swollen, but there was no hurt. Only a near-painful need to have him inside her. Wrapping her other leg around his body, she pressed, urging him deeper.</p><p>\u201cMahiya.\u201d</p><p>Her spymaster\u2019s control fractured.</p><p>30</p><p>In the hours before returning to Mahiya, Jason had flown a considerable distance out from the fort to speak to an angelic couple just returned to the territory after a sojourn in the Refuge. Having received his message, they\u2019d asked him to meet them at the lodge where they rested, as they planned to begin the second leg of their journey at first light\u2014to their home at the other end of Neha\u2019s territory.</p><p>He\u2019d been lucky to locate the pair; they spent much of their time exploring the world, having earned a respite from their duties after millennia of service. Though the two were unquestionably loyal to their archangel, they also had an unhidden fondness for Raphael.</p><p>\u201cWe watched him grow from a child into an archangel. He was never too proud to talk to those of us who were weaker, even when his power eclipsed ours while he was but a babe.\u201d</p><p>That fondness extended to the Seven, and the two had been happy to answer Jason\u2019s questions about the vampire with scarlet hair, though he\u2019d made the pattern of questioning such that the most important query was but one among many. He didn\u2019t want a careless word to spook their prey. What he\u2019d learned had been . . . interesting, until he could almost taste the answer on his tongue.</p><p>A shift against him, Mahiya\u2019s fingers flickering on his chest. Her hair slid across his arm and shoulder at the same instant, one of her wings half on, half off his body as he lay on his back, both hands under his head.</p><p>\u201cHow long did I sleep?\u201d she asked without lifting her head from his shoulder, her voice husky.</p><p>He glanced at the moonlight filtering through the high lattice window and said, \u201cNot long. Perhaps an hour.\u201d An hour as he listened to her breathe, as he traced quiet patterns on her skin and felt his heartbeat slow, lulled by the rhythm of hers. It had been an unexpected thing, and it had caused a violent response in him, a raw urging to get out, to get free.</p><p>But Jason was almost seven hundred years old, understood what drove him\u2014he\u2019d looked into the abyss of his soul, seen the lonely, forgotten boy looking back at him. He knew that boy trusted no one and nothing, knew he looked upon any kind of an emotional bond with suspicion, expected nothing but pain from any such relationship.</p><p>That boy, he was so afraid.</p><p>It was a truth about himself Jason had come to terms with long ago. That scared boy didn\u2019t rule his conscious mind, but was so embedded in his subconscious that he often didn\u2019t know why he acted as he did until the deed was done and his mind cleared again. Tonight, he\u2019d fought the urge to leave when it hit him, because being in bed with a sleeping Mahiya was a pleasure all its own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He liked that her scent warmed and seemed to soak into his own skin, liked that he could twine her hair lazily around his fingers and play with it as he thought, liked that she made tiny little noises and burrowed deeper into him every so often\u2014as if she adored being with him. He almost felt real, as if he was a normal man, one capable of loving a woman and holding her close.</p><p>It was an illusion, but it was an illusion he was willing to believe in for this night.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Reaching down, Mahiya tugged up the sheet tangled around her thighs to her waist, before placing her hand over his heartbeat again. Her wing rose a fraction as her mouth and jaw moved against his skin in a yawn, and the silver light of the moon kissed the feathers to jewel brightness.</p><p>Before she\u2019d fallen asleep, those wings had shimmered in his vision as she spent an hour touching and kissing his body with unhidden pleasure. Drunk on the tactile sensations, he\u2019d had to coax her to straddle him, his shy Mahiya, but once there, she\u2019d used her position to caress him with sweet feminine delight.</p> <p>Living in the illusion, he moved one hand to run his fingers over the sensitive arch. She shivered, her wing floating down to lie across his body once more. \u201cYou could make me agree to commit a great many sins with those fingers, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no sins in pleasure.\u201d It was something Dmitri had once said to him, a sardonic twist to his mouth, the mockery directed inward.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s soft laugh changed the words, turned them sensual and playful. \u201cI think I shall make that my motto when I am free, and live the life of an unabashed hedonist.\u201d</p><p>Images of her clothed in raw silks and exquisite cashmere, her body petted and smoothed with exotic creams, her lips closing over a delicious morsel as she lay on satin sheets flashed through his mind. Sliding a fingertip down her spine, he spread his hand on her lower back, his fingers just brushing the curves below. \u201cI would be happy to massage you with scented oils.\u201d Until her skin gleamed and she lay boneless beneath his touch.</p><p>Her laugh was startled this time, huskier. Rubbing her cheek against his skin, she said, \u201cDangerous man\u2014I\u2019m not certain I\u2019d survive the pleasure.\u201d Pushing up against his chest, she looked down at him, her hair tumbling over one smooth shoulder, her breasts hidden by the sheet she\u2019d pulled up to hold against her chest. Always so modest, though as a lover, she gainsaid nothing he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cVanhi,\u201d she said, expression becoming solemn, \u201csaid something else important. I forgot to tell you with everything else. She thought she might have seen the vampire with bone-pale skin and scarlet hair once. Long ago.\u201d</p><p>Jason listened, added that fact to the information he already had.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she prompted when he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cI know you were out doing what you do earlier. What did you learn?\u201d A scowl. \u201cDo not think to keep me in the dark, Jason.\u201d</p><p>He should\u2019ve reminded her she held no cards to play, but he knew that would hurt her, and he didn\u2019t want to hurt this princess with her heart strong enough to survive three hundred years with an archangel who saw her only as a means to an end. \u201cThere is plenty of moonlight.\u201d</p><p>Making an exasperated sound, she dipped her head to kiss him, sinking her teeth into his lower lip in a bite that didn\u2019t so much as sting. \u201cThis is not the time for spymaster humor.\u201d</p><p>Were she another woman, he\u2019d have thought she attempted to use the afterglow of sex to sway him, but this was Mahiya\u2014who had grown up in a hotbed of lies but chose not to use those tactics. Caressing her with the hand he had on her lower back, he said, \u201cI found a couple who remember seeing a vampire who fits the description in Neha\u2019s court three to four hundred years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be more certain?\u201d she asked, a humming kind of tension in her frame.</p><p>\u201cAt five thousand years old . . .\u201d</p><p>Mahiya sighed. \u201cLike Vanhi, their memories are tucked away in secret corners of their minds.\u201d A thoughtful pause, before she said, \u201cJust over three hundred years ago, Eris was exiled to his palace, and my mother was executed.\u201d</p><p>After being kept alive long enough to give birth to the child she carried in her womb.</p><p>The words hung unspoken between them.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t the only ones,\u201d Jason said, wondering how much she knew. \u201cThose who had known of the affair and helped Eris and Nivriti were executed; others who were simply loyal to Nivriti were exiled.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya pushed away from his chest to sit upright, her wing brushing across his body, the warmth of her suddenly gone. \u201cA man on the edge of their circle,\u201d she murmured, \u201cwould\u2019ve been considered a hanger-on. Exile, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a workable conclusion.\u201d To focus only on one possibility when it wasn\u2019t yet a certainty was to create blind corners where the enemy could hide. \u201cThe question is, why would he expose himself to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA sense of residual loyalty perhaps.\u201d Tawny eyes vivid as a cat\u2019s in the darkness met his, the potential locked within her body a luminous brilliance. \u201cBut there is another question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d Jason got the same sense of power from Mahiya that he had from a young Illium. It might take her longer than the blue-winged angel to grow into that power\u2014her mother\u2019s daughter in that perhaps, but given room to breathe, to develop, Mahiya would become an angel to be reckoned with . . . and he had the sudden, blinding thought that he wanted to witness the change, watch her spread her wings.</p><p>\u201cHow,\u201d she said now, \u201cdid he get the box to the temple?\u201d</p><p>It was an astute question. \u201cSome vampires can climb like spiders,\u201d he said, having seen a grinning Venom scale the Tower one moonless night after he and Illium made a bet, \u201cbut the chances of being caught would\u2019ve been very high.\u201d Not only did angelic guards sweep the area, the sentinels who watched over Guardian Fort had a wide field of view.</p><p>\u201cHe could\u2019ve used the tunnels\u2014Venom said he didn\u2019t see any other footprints along the route he used, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a labyrinth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have him check them again.\u201d He reached for the cell phone he\u2019d placed on the bedside table after pulling it from his discarded jeans.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best time.\u201d No one would worry overmuch over a vampire walking about in the night, much less one known to be favored by women.</p><p>As it was, he heard a soft female sigh in the background when Venom answered. \u201cNo problem,\u201d the other man said. \u201cI\u2019ve just fed, have plenty of energy.\u201d</p><p>Jason heard the satiation in the vampire\u2019s tone, knew he\u2019d fed from the vein\u2014and assuredly from a very willing female. \u201cWatch your back.\u201d Sex could cloud even the sharpest mind, and while Neha liked Venom, he remained one of the Seven.</p><p>The sound of rustling, as if Venom was getting out of bed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She\u2019s a delicious playmate, but all she wanted to pump was my cock, not my brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be able to check every possible route up to Guardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get it done before dawn.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up soon afterward, Jason said, \u201cYou think the box was flown there,\u201d to the woman beside him, her expression pensive.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mahiya took the sheet with her as she got off the bed, the filaments of her feathers a thousand soft kisses across his skin. Disappearing into her dressing room, she returned clothed in a vivid blue robe tied at the waist.</p><p>He\u2019d already pulled on his pants, though he\u2019d left off his shirt and sword\u2014the latter within reach, as it always was. Putting his back to the solid wall beside a small window of stained glass, he watched her walk to open that window and look beyond, bathed in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cA teddy bear, it\u2019s either a silly romantic gift,\u201d she whispered at long last, \u201cor the kind of thing you give to a child.\u201d</p><p>He thought of the feather of blue green he\u2019d found the night of Arav\u2019s murder, of the fact that Nivriti had inherited the ability to mesmerize, and he could not discount the impossibility behind the troubled look on Mahiya\u2019s face. \u201cWhat has Neha told you about your mother\u2019s execution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she began her death screaming and begging for her life.\u201d Her fingers tightened so hard on the window ledge that her bones pushed up against skin. \u201c\u2018I watched my dear sister\u2019s organs spill out of the gaping hole that had been her womb and the blood pour off the stubs of her wings, then left her to starve to death.\u2019 That\u2019s what Neha said to me when I asked about my mother.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cVanhi says she lied about the manner of my birth, but Vanhi had to leave after I was born. Neha could have done exactly as she said.\u201d</p><p>Warmth, a hand on her cheek, a thumb on her jaw, the pressure gentle but inexorable. Turning, she found herself the focus of eyes of near obsidian that burned with a dark flame that had her heart skipping a beat.</p><p>Jason\u2019s thumb moved gently across the dip of her chin. \u201cAs we see from Eris, from you, Neha knows how to hold a grudge.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya sucked in a breath, for she\u2019d expected Jason to argue against the painful hope inside her chest. \u201cBut to have kept my mother alive all this time out of spite?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same reason she did it to Eris\u2014love and hate intertwined. You tell me Nivriti was her twin. That is a bond of the soul.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya thought back to a day she\u2019d come upon Neha and Eris in the courtyard when they\u2019d believed themselves alone. She should\u2019ve turned, walked away, but she\u2019d been caught by the tableau they made: Neha, her expression young and vulnerable in a way Mahiya had never seen, allowing Eris to tip up her chin with his finger, tease a smile from her lips.</p><p>Of course, that moment hadn\u2019t lasted, the past too crushing a weight to allow such fragile seeds to sprout, but\u2014\u201cI think if he hadn\u2019t died, Neha would have allowed him out. Perhaps even soon.\u201d She turned to face Jason, his hand sliding to cup the side of her neck. \u201cAnoushka\u2019s death hit her hard. She began to visit Eris more and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were rumors she was trying to get herself with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you an answer as to the truth of that, but what I believe is that she needed the comfort of the man who\u2019d fathered her child\u2014and Eris, to his credit, did give her that comfort.\u201d How much had been real, and how much a fantasy created in order to get into Neha\u2019s good graces, she didn\u2019t know. Whatever it had been, it had given Neha some surcease\u2014and who was Mahiya to gainsay the choices of a man who\u2019d spent three centuries locked in pretty chains, even if he had made his own bed?</p><p>Releasing his hold on her, Jason shifted to lean one shoulder against the wall. \u201cI\u2019m not certain how long any freedom would\u2019ve lasted. I\u2019ve been able to confirm that Audrey was warming his bed.\u201d A pause. \u201cIf she was the first and he lasted three hundred years before breaking\u201d\u2014Jason\u2019s tone made it clear he thought otherwise\u2014\u201cthen he may have been a stronger man than we credit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mahiya thought again of that vulnerable look on Neha\u2019s face and wondered if a woman with so much love in her heart would\u2019ve eventually been able to forgive every trespass. \u201cIt matters little now. Eris is gone, and someone is either playing a sick game with me, or . . .\u201d The words lodged in her throat, too heavy, too important to come out.</p><p>I hope she lives.</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t speak the thought aloud, but regardless of how many complications it would create, he hoped that Mahiya got a miracle. He understood what it was to grow up without a mother, but he\u2019d at least had a whisper of time with his own.</p><p>\u201cJason, baby, what in the world are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>He gave his mother a long-suffering look and paused in his labors. \u201cPlanting coconut trees.\u201d</p><p>A solemn nod. \u201cI see.\u201d Going down on her knees, she picked up one of the coconuts he\u2019d collected. \u201cPerhaps you should plant them a little farther up the beach.\u201d</p><p>He patted the sand over the coconut he\u2019d buried, the sound of the waves lapping at the wet sand a familiar music. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sea might wash them away otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Considering that, he decided she was right. \u201cWill you help me carry them?\u201d</p> <p>Her smile made him feel warm inside in a way nothing else ever did. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d ask.\u201d</p><p>Jason could barely remember what that warmth had been like, the echo of his mother\u2019s love faded and dull, but he knew it had been something piercingly beautiful to the heart of the boy he\u2019d been, and so he knew such beauty existed. Mahiya didn\u2019t even have that. For her sake, he hoped that Neha had found herself unable to execute her twin, as she\u2019d been unable to execute her consort.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell Neha?\u201d Mahiya\u2019s question was nearly silent. \u201cWhat we\u2019re considering? That. . .my mother might be alive?\u201d</p><p>31</p><p>\u201cNeha alone knows the truth of our supposition,\u201d Jason said, thinking through the matter, \u201cand if we are right, and your mother is already free, telling Neha cannot disadvantage her.\u201d The vampire with scarlet hair was unlikely to be the only one of her people Nivriti had found, gathered together. \u201cNeha may also have an idea of where Nivriti might have located her base of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mahiya made a sudden tight sound in her throat. \u201cIf it is my mother, I know why she killed Arav.\u201d</p> <p>So did Jason. The man had hurt Mahiya, hurt Nivriti\u2019s child, deserved punishment. Jason found he had no argument with that, and the realization made him halt, consider who Mahiya was to him. He had no answer to that, but he suddenly saw one to her earlier question. \u201cI will not speak to Neha about this.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya shuddered, shook her head. \u201cNo. If she murdered Shabnam, I can\u2019t protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about protecting Nivriti.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s eyes searched his face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Closing the distance between them, she placed her hand on his chest. There was tenderness but nothing proprietary or possessive in the touch, and he knew she spun no moonbeams in the air, expected nothing from him but the man that he was.</p><p>Something tense and waiting in him relaxed. He didn\u2019t want to end this with Mahiya, but it was a decision he would\u2019ve been forced to make had she sought to claim him, sought to see in him a future he couldn\u2019t build with her. Not in the way Dmitri had with Honor, Raphael with Elena.</p><p>\u201cA hostage,\u201d he said, his hand on her lower back. \u201cIf we give Neha this information, we give her a hostage.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s eyes widened in pained understanding, but she shook her head. \u201cYou risk breaking the blood vow, Jason.\u201d A fierce whisper. \u201cIt could mean your death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is time yet.\u201d Until he was certain Nivriti lived, this fell under his mandate, his silence no threat to the vow. \u201cAnd I will not put you in harm\u2019s way.\u201d He\u2019d made his choice, and it was this woman with her eyes as bright as a creature wild and dangerous for whom he\u2019d raise his sword, not an archangel full of centuries-old hatred.</p> <p>Mahiya\u2019s lower lip quivered. \u201cYou must not.\u201d Her fingers brushed his jaw, her mouth soft on his own. \u201cThank you for putting me first. No one else ever has, and I will never forget that you did so.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cBut you yourself said Neha might know where my mother might be hiding. I cannot buy my life with Shabnam\u2019s blood screaming for justice. If we are right, then my mother killed her as surely as she killed Arav. But this time, for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a reason\u2014Shabnam was Neha\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya lifted a trembling hand to her mouth. \u201cAkin to a child destroying a sibling\u2019s favorite toy out of jealousy or spite.\u201d</p><p>A scream ripped through the fort on the heels of her horrified words.</p><p>No angelic or vampiric body awaited them this time, but there was carnage nonetheless. Thrown across what seemed like every inch of the public audience hall were the limp, mangled bodies of at least twenty of Neha\u2019s pet snakes, the columns that held up the structure splattered with blood.</p><p>\u201cThis took time.\u201d Mahiya knelt down beside the thick body of a tree boa whose dry leathery skin continued to gleam a dramatic green. \u201cThe snakes aren\u2019t tame as such\u2014they come only to Neha\u2019s hand. Tracking and patience, this required both.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the sadness in her tone, Jason met her gaze in wordless question.</p><p>\u201cAfter Guardian,\u201d she said with a tight smile, \u201cI can\u2019t avoid the fear that curdles my stomach at the sight of Neha\u2019s creatures, but I will not allow that fear to rule me.\u201d Grim determination. \u201cI try to remember what I\u2019ve always known\u2014that left alone, these creatures would avoid me as I\u2019d avoid them. They did not deserve to be slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>A wash of wind, Neha coming to land behind them, the anger on her face shot through with grief. Not saying a word, she stepped to the edge of the audience hall and simply looked, as if taking note of every single snake that had been butchered. And they had been. The boa Mahiya had been crouching beside appeared an exception, but closer examination showed it to be only half of the snake.</p><p>After being hacked into pieces, the reptiles had been flung around the audience hall. Such a thing would be impossible to do in daylight, but this particular area would\u2019ve been all but deserted in the darkest part of night\u2014the early discovery had occurred because of a lover\u2019s spat that had sent a male vampire aimlessly wandering the fort.</p><p>\u201cDo their bodies tell you anything?\u201d Neha asked with frigid politeness.</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cOnly that the blade used was most probably a butcher\u2019s cleaver.\u201d A simple, sharp cut. \u201cIs there any pattern to the ones who were harmed?\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s gaze lingered on several of the mutilated snakes. \u201cThey were the most docile\u2014older pets who had become used enough to humans that they wouldn\u2019t have slithered away at being approached.\u201d Her wings held neatly off the blood-streaked floor, she said, \u201cI must care for them.\u201d Reaching back, she took a woven basket from the lady-in-waiting who\u2019d arrived with her.</p><p>Not saying a word, Mahiya took a second basket and helped Neha gather up the remains. The silence was acute, Neha\u2019s anger a pulse he could almost sense against his skin. But that wasn\u2019t what Jason listened for, what he watched for. Because he was almost certain that out there in the shadows, within sight of the audience hall, stood someone who laughed at Neha\u2019s distress.</p><p>However, not even his eyes, with their extraordinary night vision, could penetrate the thick clouds of black that coalesced inside the arches and doorways he could see from this vantage point. Starting a search for the watcher would be pointless. He or she had the advantage of having planned an escape route, would be long gone by the time Jason reached their hiding place.</p><p>Instead, he stood guard, never losing sight of where Mahiya was at any moment, regardless of his focus on the shadows.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Neha said nothing else as she took flight, basket in hand.</p><p>Mahiya rose after her, and Jason followed, rising above them both in order to keep watch. However, Neha didn\u2019t go far, landing on a small mountain plateau perhaps five minutes later. In the center of the open space stood a flat gray stone set atop a number of other stones shaped to brick smoothness and slotted in to create a squat pyramid.</p><p>Placing both baskets on the flat stone, Neha bent down and whispered something so soft, the wind buffeted her words away before they reached Jason. The first tendril of smoke appeared from below the baskets a second later.</p><p>By the time Neha stepped away from the little pyre, flames licked out of the baskets, and he understood the archangel had gained power not just over ice, but over fire. Ice could harm, but fire . . . fire was annihilation and violence on a level beyond. And Neha could now drop the flickering yellow orange death from the sky.</p><p>32</p><p>Dmitri ensured Honor was comfortable in the four-poster bed she\u2019d made up with sheets of crisp white speckled with tiny blue forget-me-nots. Returning to the country with as much stealth as possible, they\u2019d headed immediately to the house Jason had told Dmitri of on his and Honor\u2019s wedding day. The instant Dmitri saw the place, he understood why Jason had been so certain no one would ever come upon them unawares.</p><p>It was a fortress created by nature itself.</p><p>The mountain had no roads\u2014he and Honor had hiked in up the highly specific path Jason had shared. Any deviation from that path would\u2019ve sent them to impassable cliffs, dangerous rock faces loose with gravel, hidden traps. Built of stone and wood, the house was a part of the environment, while up above was a dark green canopy that let in stray beams of sunlight while concealing the house from aerial view.</p><p>Added to that was a sophisticated security system that would alert Dmitri to anyone in the forest or in the sky.</p><p>It was the safe place Jason had promised, a place where Dmitri\u2019s wife embraced her new existence as a near immortal. The toxin that would turn her into a vampire had been introduced into her system three hours earlier, with Raphael having left New York under cover of night to fly here to perform the task\u2014a task the archangel would do twice more several weeks apart.</p><p>Dmitri would\u2019ve trusted no one else with Honor\u2019s Making, and Raphael had kept his faith, treating Honor with utmost courtesy. Now, only two neat fang marks on her wrist remained as a memento of a choice that would alter her existence, but Dmitri knew the toxin had already begun to reshape her cells, though she wouldn\u2019t feel the burn of the process for another few minutes.</p><p>He intended her to be under by then. Everything was ready. From one honey golden arm ran a saline drip he\u2019d set up using medical knowledge he\u2019d accumulated out of curiosity, staving off the boredom of an immortality that had been forced on him. There was another line, one that led to a carefully calculated drip of morphine, intended to offset the pain of the transformation.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he whispered as the haunting midnight green of her eyes began to blur. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you wake.\u201d It would take roughly three months for the process to complete this way, but it would be a gentle change, not the agony that had turned him into an animal bound in chains that rubbed his skin raw, his flesh exposed to the filth of the room where he\u2019d been kept. \u201cDream of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs if,\u201d she whispered with a sleepy smile, \u201cI would dream of anyone else.\u201d Her lashes fluttered shut, her breathing falling into the even rhythm of deepest sleep.</p><p>Caressing fine strands of hair off her cheek, he checked to make sure her vital signs were as they should be. Now came the hardest part\u2014the waiting. Honor would need no nutrients for the first few days, and her body had stopped producing waste the instant the toxin hit her bloodstream, everything burning up in the massive surge of energy needed to begin the transformation.</p><p>After those first three or four days, depending on how fast the change progressed, he\u2019d bring her to a hazy wakefulness so she could drink just a few drops from him. The blood kiss was a step he\u2019d repeat, until her final feeding would be a true one. For most Candidates, it was a clinical process, the blood introduced via a feeding tube, but for Honor, it would be an intimate journey.</p><p>His wife would always wake in his arms, safe and loved.</p> <p>\u201cCome back to me,\u201d he whispered in the language of their long-ago homeland, part of him deathly afraid now that he couldn\u2019t hear her voice, the husky intimacy of her laughter silent.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how he would bear the quiet, but he\u2019d find a way, because she would hurt if he initiated a premature waking. And Honor was never, ever to be hurt. Not so long as Dmitri lived.</p><p>33</p><p>Two and a half hours after discovering the mutilated bodies of Neha\u2019s pets, Jason called Raphael from a mountaintop touched with the dawn. \u201cOne of my people just sent through a report that indicates the possibility of Lijuan making the reborn again is now in the near-certain range.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s man was situated not in Lijuan\u2019s home fortress, but at another of the archangel\u2019s strongholds. The distance from the origin made every piece of information suspect, but this particular rumor had been gaining momentum for weeks, until the highly intelligent vampire was sure it had been born in truth. The most recent whispers had been dangerously explicit in their detail.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot believe her a fool.\u201d Ice in Raphael\u2019s voice. \u201cIt was one of her reborn who first attacked her in Beijing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being whispered that she\u2019s no longer choosing candidates from within her court, but from the peasants, those who look upon her as a demigoddess.\u201d Lijuan was a good empress in many ways\u2014her people always had enough to eat, and she meted out justice with a fair hand. However, she preferred to keep the majority of her people in a cultural and technological state that had remained unchanged for centuries.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I create discontent by permitting them to know of things beyond their reach? It is not as if they live long enough for it to matter.\u201d</p><p>Words she\u2019d spoken to Raphael four hundred years ago while Jason had been in the room, her decision that of an archangel who\u2019d been alive millennia and who considered mortals little more than a disposable workforce. Yet age alone couldn\u2019t account for her choice. Caliane was far, far older, and from all the reports Jason had had from Naasir, her people were well-learned and within her city lay a sprawling library open to all.</p><p>No, the desire Lijuan had to keep so many of her people in ignorance came from within her, as did her power to reanimate the dead to shambling, horrifying life. And it was this archangel who might well be teaching Neha how to handle her destructive new abilities. Jason had to find out the content of those lessons.</p><p>If Lijuan had groomed herself an ally to assist her in her malignant games, the earth might yet become a place of endless horror. A place where fire fell from the sky and the dead hunted the living for flesh, warm and blood drenched.</p> <p>Mahiya was sitting on a bench in the pavilion in the courtyard in front of her palace, her magnificent wings spread on the marble behind her when he returned from speaking to Raphael. She said nothing until he came to stand beside her. \u201cI keep thinking of her.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t need her to tell him who she meant. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural thing. Nivriti was your mother.\u201d</p><p>Her head lifted, a slight hesitation to her as she said. \u201cYour mother, Aurelani, is she alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up, wake up, wake up!\u201d</p><p>Hidden from prying eyes by the spread of her wing and the columns of the pavilion, she reached a hand up to close it around his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve made you sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. It happened an eon ago.\u201d His emotions had aged, taken on a hue he couldn\u2019t describe.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me about her?\u201d Tawny eyes looked up at him, her lashes casting lacey shadows on her cheeks.</p> <p>Until Mahiya, he hadn\u2019t ever spoken of his mother to anyone, and even then, it had been in the guise of a romantic tale. He didn\u2019t know if he could speak of her, of the mother the famed Aurelani had been to him, the scar tissue inside him a jagged barrier. \u201cAsk me again another day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d With that gentle agreement, Mahiya leaned her head against his side. \u201cI asked Vanhi to tell me stories about my mother this morning.\u201d Her fingers squeezed his. \u201cShe told me many things, including about the lake palace that was her favorite place in all of this land. It\u2019s not so very far from here. An hour\u2019s flight.\u201d</p><p>Jason looked down at the black silk of her hair, his mind filling with images of a desolate building covered with moss, its windows and doorways gaping maws. \u201cAbandoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. When my mother was supposedly executed.\u201d A quiet exhale. \u201cIt was made to last, the palace. Built of marble within the crater of a mountain, the \u2018lake\u2019 is filled by the monsoon rains. I don\u2019t know if it still stands\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d He told her of his previous flight to this territory. \u201cI came in as the sun was setting, and something caught the light. When I turned and circled, I saw only the shimmer of water\u2014it took me a minute to find the building half hidden within the lake.\u201d Covered by moss as it was, the water palace merged into the deep dark green of the lake, its camouflage perfect.</p><p>\u201cWe have the whole day,\u201d Mahiya said, her body warm against his own. \u201cNeha is in seclusion\u2014I do not know for whom she mourns, if it is for the people lost or her pets, but I\u2019ve seen her like this before. She won\u2019t reemerge before dark, will not think to ask where we have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may take me a few passes to locate the palace.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya stared down at the building that had become a chameleon over the centuries, hiding in plain sight. Covered not only by a dark green moss that echoed the color of the water, but by fine vines of the same shade, it appeared nothing so much as a floating clump of greenery. Desolate as this place was, few angels would pass over it, and those that did wouldn\u2019t be tempted to linger. It was a testament to Jason\u2019s curiosity that he\u2019d discovered it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have time to land then,\u201d he said, hovering beside her with an ease she envied. \u201cWe can\u2019t count on its stability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll hold,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt was built to withstand water, to endure through centuries.\u201d Diving without waiting for him, she headed toward what she guessed had once been a large balcony or courtyard that hung out over the water. A dark blur passed her a second later, and Jason had landed, his wings folded back, before she touched down.</p><p>A storm swirled in irises gone a turbulent black. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t smart, Mahiya.\u201d</p><p>Fascinated, she stared. Never had she seen him angry, and the leash he kept on his anger even now made her wonder at the depth of his control. \u201cI knew you were faster,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that you would\u2019ve stopped me had you glimpsed anything that indicated danger.\u201d</p><p>The storm crashed, dark and violent. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have such faith in an enemy spymaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I have it in you.\u201d Reaching out to touch his wing, she smiled at this man who was an enigma she would never get the chance to solve and yet who grew deeper into her heart with each breath. \u201cLet\u2019s explore.\u201d</p><p>Jason should\u2019ve held his ground, forced Mahiya to acknowledge that she\u2019d acted with rash impatience, but he had the thought that unleashing his anger on her at this instant would be akin to smashing the most fragile glass. He saw the confusion behind the eagerness, saw that she didn\u2019t know if she wanted her mother alive or not, for if Nivriti lived, she had a sadistic streak of violence.</p><p>\u201cStay close.\u201d Reaching back, he drew his sword from its sheath.</p><p>Mahiya raised a hand as if she\u2019d touch the obsidian blade that seemed to roil with black flame, before dropping the blade and falling in step beside him. Deciding against using the vine-shrouded door in front of them, he walked with quiet steps around the side of the palace. They had to be careful of their footing, the moss slippery.</p><p>The palace had been designed to sit above the water level, but it was clear the monsoon rains had been strong enough to overwhelm it in years past. The marks of those deluges were waves of brown on the discolored marble of the building. It was probable the lake had some mechanism by which the waters could be bled off to other waterways\u2014he\u2019d seen such in other parts of Neha\u2019s land. But this palace and its surrounds had lain fallow for over three hundred years, any blockage in the system untended.</p><p>A doorway allowed sunlight to spill into the room beyond.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He entered with care, taking in every desolate corner before nodding at Mahiya to enter.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here.\u201d Disappointment turned her voice leaden as she took in the debris and moss and the dried remnants of sludge that had come in when the waters rose. While the air wasn\u2019t damp, the sunshine probing deep, the layers of dirt created a musty, earthy scent that made it clear this room had seen no other living presence for centuries. \u201cThe furniture must\u2019ve been made of wood, rotted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stepped to a shadowy doorway leading inward. \u201cIf I were hiding within, I would choose the core.\u201d Where light would be least likely to escape come night.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s wing brushed his as she took her place beside him once more.</p><p>The rooms that followed were as bleak as the first. Stripped of furniture, carpet, and paintings, they were hollows broken and echoing, though Mahiya was able to guess at the functions of some from the placement of windows devoid of glass and doors long destroyed.</p><p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve been magnificent when alive,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLike a jewel on the water at night, the lights reflected in the lak\u2014\u201d</p><p>Warned by her sudden silence, he followed her gaze and saw color. Crimson. Shiny and sleek, a ribbon that might have come from a woman\u2019s dress.</p><p>\u201cLovers,\u201d Mahiya murmured, picking up the decadent hue that did not belong in this lonely palace devoid of laughter, \u201cmay be using this as a pace for discreet assignations.\u201d It was patent she fought hope.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d It was too old and without comfort to tempt most, but he\u2019d known young angels to do startling things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s soft.\u201d She rubbed her fingers along the ribbon. \u201cIt can\u2019t have been here long or the damp would\u2019ve seeped in, turned the satin rough when it dried.\u201d Her voice was near soundless, her wings held tight to her back to give Jason as much room as possible as they moved through the palace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two rooms later, he held up a fisted hand.</p><p>Mahiya halted.</p><p>Not moving a muscle, Jason listened.

Still, he\u2019d sensed something, and a second later, he knew what it was.</p><p>Sensuality, luxuriant and potent, and a perfume a woman might wear.</p> <p>The cause of the silent warning identified, he dropped his hand but put his finger to his lips. Nodding, Mahiya held her silence as he reached out to part a doorway of vines . . . to reveal a room as disparate from the others as a ruby was from a hunk of rock. Here, the marble had been cleaned with scrupulous care, until in spite of the permanent staining, the walls gleamed.</p><p>Light came in through a skylight devoid of glass and half covered by vines. Rain would easily penetrate the green barrier, but there was little threat of it this time of year. Certainly, whoever had set up this room was unworried about potential water damage to the rich indigo carpet that lined the floor or the cushions of gold-shot silk scattered over the bed in the center.</p><p>A small vanity stood against another wall, hairpins and jewels scattered across the surface. In front of it was a stool on which a woman might sit as she readied herself. \u201cNo vampire could\u2019ve brought this in.\u201d Not with the single road up the mountain buried under a landslide old enough to have scraggly trees hugging its jagged slope.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>Turning at the shaken whisper, he saw Mahiya\u2019s reflection in the mirror above the vanity, her fingers clutching at something.</p> <p>An envelope.</p><p>Written on it was a single word: Daughter</p><p>Mahiya knew Jason had been right to insist they fly to a safer location before she opened the letter, but by the time they landed in a remote field dotted with a scarcity of trees and surrounded by nothing but balls of dusty foliage rolling across the endless vista, she felt as if her skin would split.</p><p>Then they were there and it was time. Back against a spindly tree that nonetheless provided shimmering gray shade, she stared at the red seal of the letter, while the black-winged angel who was no longer her enemy stood a dark sentinel. He said nothing, giving her the time to find her courage, break the seal.</p><p>My dearest Mahiya Geet,</p><p>I had faith you would find this. You and your dangerous black shadow. I thought to kill him for you at first\u2014</p> <p>Mahiya swallowed a cry, thrusting her knuckles against her mouth.</p><p>\u2014but I realized upon further reflection that he is the only thing standing between you and Neha. And it is deliberate. So, then I must tell you I approve. You have made a better choice than I.</p><p>Her heart clenched at the pain inherent in that simple confession.</p><p>I am sorry I cannot be here to greet you, my beloved child. But this part is done. It was a test of my strength and skill. A warning, too, but we both know Neha is far too arrogant to listen, to understand.</p><p>This place is for you\u2014stay here, be safe. Your spymaster will protect you. If he needs must return to Neha, be assured I will make certain he comes back to you unharmed after the real game is played and won. You cannot be in the court at that time. Neha will slit your throat and rip your beating heart from your chest, if only to wound me.</p><p>Your residence in this place will not be for long. Soon I will hold you as a mother should hold her child, while Neha bleeds heart\u2019s blood and her people scrabble in panic and terror. I have had three hundred years to plan my vengeance.</p><p>Nivriti</p><p>34</p> <p>Trembling, Mahiya walked to lean her face against Jason\u2019s back, his wings strong and sleek and paradoxically soft on either side of her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d She passed him the letter without shifting from her position tucked against his back. He didn\u2019t force her to move, didn\u2019t attempt to turn and take her into his arms\u2014as if he understood she just needed to lean on his strength a little until the world stopped spinning.</p><p>\u201cThere is a sense of damp to the letter,\u201d Jason said after scanning the lines. \u201cBut the wax carries a faint impression of her scent still, as did the room.\u201d</p><p>Her mother hadn\u2019t been gone long enough to be erased from the palace. \u201cI think her pride is such that it wouldn\u2019t allow her to do what was done to the snakes.\u201d But she had no doubt Nivriti had known of the needless cruelty. \u201cShe must\u2019ve departed the lake palace after killing Arav, left some of her people behind to cause further disorder.\u201d</p><p>Jason returned his gaze to the letter. \u201cShe cannot plan a martial attack\u2014regardless of how long she\u2019s had to plan, Neha is an archangel with a garrison at her command.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya knew she should be saying something to that, but she felt lost in a world that had shifted on its axis.</p><p>My mother is alive.</p><p>A crackle of paper, strong wings shifting under her touch, and Jason was turning around. Startled, afraid that he was pushing her away when she so desperately needed an anchor, needed him, she froze . . . until he ran his hand over the back of her head and down to press against her lower back, just enough to let her know that he was there, his strength hers to use.</p><p>A sob rocked through her, and then she couldn\u2019t stop, her entire body jerking, her bones suddenly brittle.</p><p>Strong arms, lips against her temple, wings of midnight opening to curve around her, until Jason surrounded her on every side. His heart beat strong and steady, his hands warm on her head and against her lower back, and his heat, it was a smoldering inferno over her skin.</p><p>Black.</p><p>That was the color of Jason\u2019s power, she knew that without any doubt. It felt as if she was surrounded by a raging storm. The sensation should\u2019ve been frightening, but the storm didn\u2019t so much as lift a hair on her head, the calm within filled with such protective warmth as she\u2019d never before felt.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long they stood in the center of that storm, but after a while, she could breathe again. And every breath carried the scent of black fire. She couldn\u2019t describe the intense wildness of the scent in any other way, but to her, it was the essence of Jason. Trying to get even closer to him, she managed to tuck her feet between his boots.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d Jason said, his voice a low rumble against her, \u201cwas my favorite person in all the world. I loved my father, but my mother? She was the one I ran to when I got out of bed in the morning.\u201d He stroked his hand down her hair, rubbed his cheek against her temple. \u201cThen one day, she wasn\u2019t there anymore. If the world suddenly changed and she stood in front of me, I would run into her arms just like that little boy.\u201d</p><p>Raising her tearstained face to his, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d The visceral reaction had terrified her, speaking of a violent need she\u2019d never acknowledged. \u201cBut I never had a mother, never knew her. I shouldn\u2019t be responding like this.\u201d</p><p>Jason moved the hand on her hair to her face, wiping the remnants of her tears away with this thumb, the touch rough, familiar. \u201cYou\u2019ve dreamed about her, thought about her, wondered what she might\u2019ve been like your whole life. It matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said past the knot in her throat, \u201cwhen I was younger, I\u2019d convince myself that she was an awful, hateful person, that she hadn\u2019t fought for me hard enough. When I was really angry, I\u2019d tell myself she never wanted me at all, actually gave me up to Neha.\u201d</p><p>She spread her fingers on his shirt, tried to smooth the wrinkles she\u2019d made when she\u2019d fisted the fabric as she cried. \u201cThen other times, before I grew old enough to understand what she\u2019d done, I\u2019d imagine her as some kind of a goddess, a woman who was lovely and gracious and perfect, and who\u2019d take me away to a place where I didn\u2019t ever have to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t laugh at her. Neither did he attempt to tell her that her dreams had been normal for the lonely child she\u2019d been. All he did was hold her and let her speak, his wings creating a protective cocoon, her body held close to his heat, to his heartbeat, to him.</p><p>I won\u2019t let you go.</p><p>It was a vow. No matter what happened, what Jason believed about his inability to form lasting bonds, he was hers, and she\u2019d fight to hold him. They needed each other, her and her angel with his wings meant for the night. He was a power, had far more knowledge of the world, but she had a heart strong enough to care for a man who might never fully open his own to her . . . because even a fragment of Jason\u2019s heart, it would be raw, honest, a dazzling joy.</p><p>Jason watched Mahiya walk to the lip of the crater within which rippled the lake that housed Nivriti\u2019s water palace. She\u2019d wanted to return here, and given the contents of the letter, he\u2019d seen no reason to stop her. With its use of a name Vanhi alone had known to date, that letter had to be genuine, and so this was meant to be a safe haven for Mahiya. Still, he would take another look at Vanhi, make sure the vampire played no deep game of her own.</p><p>Eyes free of the tears that had earlier smudged their wild brightness, Mahiya stood with her wings to him, the peacock blue and vivid green striking in the mountain sunlight. Had he been on his own, he would\u2019ve chosen a far more concealed position, and even now, he stood in the faint shadow cast by a large tree that had dug in enough roots to nurture itself to a sturdy thickness.</p><p>But Mahiya, though she\u2019d been forced to learn to navigate the shadows of an unfriendly court, was a creature of the light. Yet she didn\u2019t seem disturbed or repelled by the black flame that was the manifestation of his own power\u2014when he\u2019d held her, she\u2019d tried to burrow closer into him, until he\u2019d felt every soft curve and dip of her body. As he thought of the protective need that had compelled him to hold her tight, she turned to look over her shoulder, those tawny eyes pinpointing him with unerring accuracy.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing,\u201d she said, walking to join him. \u201cI agree a military assault is unlikely, but we have no idea of how long she\u2019s been free\u2014the attack on Eris was merely the start of this \u2018test.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThus she may well have gathered far more support than we realize.\u201d Jason nodded. \u201cAnoushka\u2019s death had a deep impact on Neha, could have caused her to lapse in her oversight of Nivriti\u2019s incarceration.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya looked down at the ground, lines marring her forehead, glanced back up. \u201cOr . . . Neha might have left my mother to rot for years without bothering to check up on her\u2014isolation is a punishment she likes to use.\u201d</p><p>Darkness roared within him, a violent wave of black fire. \u201cNo one will ever again imprison you,\u201d he said quietly, aware he was making a promise that might well put him in the firing line of an archangel.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s face shone with a radiance that held him captive. \u201cI know.\u201d Spreading her wings, she touched her fingers to his cheek, the tenderness in it as powerful as a knife blade, until he had the disorienting sense his world had forever shifted.</p><p>\u201cGive me tonight,\u201d he said, wrenching calm from chaos. \u201cI may be able to shed more light on the situation.\u201d He had contacts and people across this territory\u2014he just hadn\u2019t known the right questions to ask until this moment.</p><p>Breaking the touch that connected them, Mahiya gave him a funny laughing look. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His defenses ignited. \u201cMahiya, don\u2019t see more in me than there is.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head a fraction to the side. \u201cPerhaps I am my mother\u2019s daughter after all\u2014I have decided on you, Jason. And if that is a foolish choice, it is also one I will never regret.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his hand over her wrist when she would\u2019ve turned away, holding her to him. Instead of struggling, she stilled, her eyes glimmering with determination and another emotion far more dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you what you want,\u201d he repeated, some unknown thing tearing and ripping inside him at the thought of having to sever his connection to her, when it was the first time in his life he\u2019d trusted even a part of himself to a lover.</p> <p>A soft smile. \u201cDid I make any demands, hmm?\u201d Lifting her free hand, she ran her fingers along his jaw. \u201cI have so much love inside me, Jason. So much. And I have never been allowed to shower it on anyone\u2014no one has wanted it. Let me stretch the wings of my heart with you.\u201d</p><p>He could feel his fingers tightening on her wrist, forced himself to loosen his hold. \u201cWill it be enough to love and not be loved?\u201d he asked, knowing it was a brutal question. \u201cTo give and never receive?\u201d</p><p>Her smile grew impossibly more luminous. \u201cYou have no idea what you give me.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t release her wrist. This could only end in tears\u2014there was no other possibility. But when he would\u2019ve spoken, she pressed her fingers to his lips. \u201cDo not be arrogant, and I shall not have to be sharp in return.\u201d Teasing words but her intent was pure steel. \u201cI am a woman grown,\u201d she said. \u201cI know who I am, and I understand the choices I make\u2014if what you can give me isn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ll walk away. I will not blame you for my choice, so let it be my choice.\u201d</p><p>Jason released her wrist before he did damage to bones so fragile under his strength. Regardless of her eloquent promise, his instincts raged at him to end this, protect her from pain of which he\u2019d be the cause. But the quiet challenge that vibrated in every inch of her body made it crystal clear she wouldn\u2019t easily accept his decree. No, this princess who had lived a life that would\u2019ve broken most, and come out of it believing in hope, in love, was made of far tougher stock.</p> <p>Mahiya would fight to hold on to him.</p><p>A strange violence of emotion crashed inside him . . . and he knew he wouldn\u2019t make the rational decision. Not when it came to Mahiya. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you something,\u201d he said, wishing the pathways inside him had not been stunted by the lack of light, that he was capable of giving her what a man should give his woman. \u201cVenom did find fresh tracks in some of the other tunnels.\u201d</p><p>No exultant victory on Mahiya\u2019s face at his unspoken decision, just a silent joy that scared him on a level nothing had touched for an eon. \u201cAnd old as the tunnels are,\u201d she said, \u201csome exits and entrances must\u2019ve been forgotten, left unguarded.\u201d</p><p>Jason recalled what Venom had said.</p><p>\u201cOnly reason I even know the ins and outs of the entire labyrinth is that when I was first Made, I was . . . closer to the otherness in me. I can\u2019t work out how anyone else would\u2019ve known some of the oldest parts of the tunnels\u2014but that\u2019s where I found the footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwin siblings,\u201d he murmured, \u201cone of whom had an affinity for snakes, would\u2019ve turned those tunnels into their playground.\u201d Where Neha might have forgotten the complexities of the underground system, Nivriti had had nothing but time and the driving desire for vengeance to hone her memory. Still\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t see Nivriti using them for a large-scale attack. It\u2019d take too long to bring in her people one at a time, leave them vulnerable to extermination if they were spotted.\u201d A fire within the tunnels would annihilate.</p> <p>Mahiya wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cI want my mother alive, but should Neha die, the entire territory will be thrown into chaos, millions of lives at stake.\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cOnly another of the Cadre can kill Neha. Had Nivriti joined their number, the whole world would\u2019ve stood witness.\u201d All ascensions to the Cadre initiated worldwide phenomena that could not be ignored, as if the archangels were locked into the very fabric of the planet.</p><p>On the day that Raphael crossed the border, the seas had turned a violent, impossible blue, as had every river and every lake across the world. Even the rain that fell from the sky was a glorious gemstone blue, and when it shattered, it left behind a sparkling residue, faceted diamond dust in the palm.</p><p>\u201cWe must stop your mother,\u201d he said, thinking of the power contained within the bodies of the Cadre. \u201cShe\u2019ll never survive a confrontation with Neha.\u201d The Archangel of India would need but a single strike to end Nivriti\u2019s existence forever. \u201cSpeak to Vanhi, see what else you can discover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell her that my mother might be alive\u2014Vanhi is loyal to both Neha and Nivriti, and might take it upon herself to attempt to negotiate peace.\u201d Her hands fisted, her skin drawn tight over the fine bones of her face. \u201cI just hope I will not have to mourn my mother before I ever meet her.\u201d</p><p>Jason began to connect with his informants even as they returned to the fort, gathering fragmented pieces of data from across his network. Venom was gone, having left for the Refuge right after calling Jason about the tunnels.</p><p>\u201cI stay any longer and Neha will consider me a spy.\u201d</p><p>However, another one of the Seven arrived an hour before sunset, just as Jason returned from a meeting with a vampire who\u2019d only today come from an area about four hours flight time from the fort.</p> <p>\u201cAodhan,\u201d he said to the angel who appeared to be made of fractured pieces of light, from the diamond brightness of his hair to wings whose filaments seemed coated in shards of broken mirrors. Only the golden sheen of his skin and the crystalline blue green of his eyes, the irises shattered outward from the pupil, saved him from being a sculpture in ice. \u201cI did not expect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot stay\u2014Neha won\u2019t permit another of the Seven here. Venom is an exception.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cYou have something for me?\u201d Aodhan was very, very good at filtering the information that flowed continuously through the Refuge. He would have made an excellent spymaster if not for the fact that there was no place in the world where Aodhan would not stand out.</p><p>Instead, the angel had long been Galen\u2019s right hand in the Refuge. Now, he went to New York and the Tower, and would take up many of Dmitri\u2019s duties while the leader of the Seven helped his wife through her transition. Whether the transfer would work, no one knew. As joint head of Tower operations, Aodhan would have to deal with any number of people, when he was a male who could not handle touch and sought isolation as often as not.</p><p>\u201cIt is the first time in centuries that Aodhan has indicated a desire to be a part of the world.\u201d Raphael\u2019s eyes, a blue seen in the wider world only on the day of his becoming Cadre, met Jason\u2019s. \u201cHe must have the chance.\u201d</p><p>Jason agreed, hoped the angel would make it.</p><p>Now, Aodhan said, \u201cI know you can\u2019t speak to me about the details of what you\u2019re doing here, but I\u2019ve detected a pattern linked to this region. It may have no relevance to your task, but my instincts say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>35</p><p>Before the other angel could continue, a butterfly, its wings an unabashed red dotted with saffron yellow, alighted on Aodhan\u2019s shoulder. Another followed a second later, its markings more modest, its wingspan larger. Aodhan looked at them, and for a fleeting instant, he was a young angel again, woefully embarrassed by his most curious of abilities.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if they can smell me,\u201d he muttered, but didn\u2019t brush the delicate creatures away. Instead, he lifted a finger, and a third butterfly appeared out of the sky to alight on it, this one with wings of creamy sunset. \u201cIllium says that perhaps I can use them to flutter someone to death.\u201d</p><p>Jason watched as Aodhan put the butterfly carefully beside the others, creating a living ornament on his otherwise prosaic T-shirt of deep brown. They weren\u2019t the only fragile beings of flight who were drawn to Aodhan\u2014once, long ago, Jason had seen the other angel laughing as he was covered by an array of tiny jewel-hued birds, his attraction greater than the nectar on which they customarily sipped. \u201cAs Galen would say,\u201d he replied, \u201cBluebell has the wings of a butterfly himself.\u201d He knew Illium had done a great deal to pull Aodhan out of the abyss, that the bond of friendship between the two was fast.</p><p>Shaking his head, Aodhan returned to the subject at hand. \u201cA number of older vampires and angels have resigned their posts without fanfare in several courts across different regions over the past six months, then disappeared off the grid. All of them had some tie to Neha\u2019s territory in their past.\u201d</p><p>Six months.</p><p>Time enough to set up a well-guarded base. \u201cHow strong were these angels and vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one as strong as Dmitri or you, but by no means weak. Together, they\u2019d compromise a battalion powerful enough to withstand a significant and prolonged assault.\u201d</p><p>If, Jason thought, that assault force didn\u2019t include an archangel. \u201cDid they take people with them?\u201d Trusted retainers who could keep their mouths shut.</p><p>\u201cRoughly five hundred once you put all the pieces altogether.\u201d</p><p>Those were the people Aodhan had managed to track. There could well be any number of vampires or angels who pledged service to no court, and thus flew under the radar. Because while Nivriti might not have been an archangel, as an angel of acknowledged power, she\u2019d ruled a vast swath of territory under Neha.</p><p>Jason had heard nothing that said her people had not been loyal. Such loyalties died hard, and three hundred years was no eternity in an immortal\u2019s life. \u201cWere you able to glean any information about their eventual destination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this subcontinent.\u201d Aodhan\u2019s eyes fractured the reflection of Jason\u2019s face into innumerable shards. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret that\u2019s been kept well.\u201d</p><p>Unsurprising. Nivriti\u2019s followers had to know that if Neha discovered the conspiracy, she\u2019d hunt down her sister before Nivriti was ready for battle, and complete the execution she\u2019d begun many mortal lifetimes ago. \u201cOne day,\u201d he said to the other angel, \u201cI\u2019ll be able to tell you what you just gave me.\u201d</p><p>Aodhan flared out his wings, the air around him busy with pieces of color as the butterflies perched on him took flight. \u201cI will see you in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Good journey, Aodhan.\u201d As he watched the other angel take flight, a splintered piece of light in the sky, he was already calculating every angle of this problem.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the next morning, the sky still a dark cloud-gray that he found the answer. \u201cIt\u2019s time to tell Neha of Nivriti\u2019s resurrection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Shabnam\u2019s blood . . . it screams for justice.\u201d Deep grooves around Mahiya\u2019s lush mouth. \u201cWhat is it you\u2019ve discovered that you choose this moment?\u201d</p><p>When he laid it out for her, she sucked in a breath. \u201cYou play Russian roulette with an archangel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had never feared death, not for himself. But he would not permit Mahiya to be sacrificed on the altar of the bitter war about to take place. It was one born of old vengeance and old pain, twisted and rancid.

Anyone caught in the middle of their conflict would be obliterated.</p><p>He thought of Mahiya with her wings broken, her face shattered, her eyes weeping blood, and knew he\u2019d force her hand if need be, earn her hatred, but he would not watch her die. Not Mahiya.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cYou went away for a second.\u201d</p><p>He considered obfuscation, decided on truth.</p> <p>Her response was instant. \u201cI could never hate you. I\u2019d sooner love Neha.\u201d Kissing his jaw with sweet, hot lips, she said, \u201cAll right, Jason. You are more experienced in matters of war\u2014I will take your lead in this.\u201d</p><p>Jason had planned to approach Neha on his own, but Mahiya folded her arms, shook her head. \u201cI know her in ways you don\u2019t, that you can\u2019t, especially when it comes to this one thing on which Neha is not rational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you safe.\u201d No one had ever been to him what Mahiya had become. \u201cA single burst of anger from Neha and you will be erased from existence.\u201d And he could not imagine walking the world knowing he\u2019d never again see the strange, dangerous hope that lived in those eyes bright as a jungle cat\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI take your help because you are the stronger,\u201d she said, raw emotion in every word, \u201cbut I won\u2019t hide behind your wings. This is my battle and I will not act the coward! I won\u2019t, Jason.\u201d</p><p>Before he\u2019d reached this inexplicable equilibrium with Mahiya, before she\u2019d staked a claim on him, he\u2019d have incapacitated her and completed the task before she ever knew it was done. Her anger afterward would\u2019ve mattered little. Now he understood who Mahiya was, understood what his action would steal from her, knew that to deny her this would be to take something from her that could never be returned.</p> <p>So it was that she landed beside him in the gardens that overlooked the lake, as sunset lingered on the horizon\u2014Jason having spent the intervening time narrowing down the probable whereabouts of Nivriti\u2019s army, with Mahiya assisting by gathering any information she could through subtle questioning of the older servants.</p><p>Neha stood alone on the edge where the fort dropped steeply into the water, her gaze on the city beyond.</p><p>\u201cI hear Raphael\u2019s people now make free in my territory,\u201d was her opening statement, her tone limned in frost.</p><p>\u201cAodhan had information that was of help to me in my task.\u201d</p><p>The folds of the sage green sari Neha wore today flowed around her ankles as she turned, her wings perfect arches at her back. \u201cMust I beg this information from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never expect such,\u201d he said, aware of Mahiya\u2019s resolute presence and conscious that no matter what he\u2019d instructed, she would not run if this turned deadly. \u201cHowever, the stakes have changed.\u201d</p> <p>Neha rubbed the skin of the thin golden snake coiled around her upper arm like a living armband. \u201cI see.\u201d A dangerous glint in her eye. \u201cYou break the blood vow.\u201d</p><p>He would have done so without compunction if it would\u2019ve saved Mahiya, but as it was, he no longer had to. \u201cWith my action, I protect the best interests of the family.\u201d Neha, Nivriti, and Mahiya were the last direct descendants of an ancient bloodline. With Neha and Nivriti about to go to certain war, Mahiya had become the family\u2019s only hope for a future.</p><p>\u201cYou must seek something valuable indeed that you dare play games with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot valuable . . . but intriguing.\u201d He knew Mahiya listened to what he said, and yet he did not sheathe his words, having every faith in her intelligence. \u201cMy curiosity is not yet sated.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s gaze went from him to Mahiya, her smile as cold as the blood of the creature around her arm. \u201cYou do not need to bargain with me for her, Jason. You\u2019re welcome to remain at this court as long as you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of Raphael\u2019s Seven,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cI must soon return, and I ask that you release Mahiya to me.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s eyes were suddenly chips of ice. \u201cWhy would I give you my favorite toy?\u201d A flick of her wrist and Mahiya was wrenched up into the air, her neck arched in a way that meant she had to be having trouble breathing.</p><p>Rage, black and violent, surged in his veins, but he held it in check. To show even a hint of care toward Mahiya would be to end this negotiation before it began, and unless the Cascade had altered matters, this aspect of Neha\u2019s power was very weak. She could not hold Mahiya for long. \u201cBecause what I have to tell you will provide you with far more satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can tear your mind apart like the rice paper of Lijuan\u2019s lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d He felt it then, her mental touch shoving against his shields, clawing and hard.</p><p>Her eyes widened, anger replaced by fascination. \u201cIncredible. It is as if your mind wears an onyx carapace.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had said something similar to Jason when he\u2019d attempted to reach Jason\u2019s mind in order to\u2014ironically enough\u2014teach him how to protect his thoughts from invasion. No one they\u2019d consulted, not even Jessamy or the healer, Keir, had ever seen or heard of its like in an angel so young.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps\u201d\u2014Keir\u2019s wise eyes in that too-young face\u2014\u201cyou created it before you ever knew it to be an impossibility. An instinctive defense.\u201d</p><p>Jason had always thought Keir had the right of it. Alone and scared when he\u2019d been little more than a babe, he\u2019d had to learn to protect himself from a world too big, too dangerous, too empty. \u201cYou can kill me,\u201d he said, because that was true, \u201cbut in doing so, you lose the information I hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would make an enemy of me out of a frippery?\u201d</p><p>Jason heard Mahiya drop behind him, knew she had to be hurt, but still he didn\u2019t turn. \u201cI do not think you\u2019ll consider me thus after you hear what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya sucked in pained breaths of air, at least three of her ribs cracked. Pushing up from her crumpled state on the ground into a sitting position, she took as deep a breath as she dared. It felt like knives stabbing into her liver, but the haze cleared from her eyes to bring Jason and Neha into sharp focus. The archangel\u2019s face was cold, Jason\u2019s a mask, his tattoo dramatic under the sunshine.</p><p>All at once, Neha laughed, and it was a true laugh, full of delight. \u201cI knew I had chosen well.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s blood went cold, realization a chill rain in her veins.</p><p>\u201cI can offer Jason something Raphael will never be able to match.\u201d</p><p>Jason wouldn\u2019t realize, wouldn\u2019t understand, but she knew that look on Neha\u2019s face, had seen the calculation in it before, after quarrels with Eris. None of that had ever come to anything, but now Eris was dead.</p><p>Swallowing the pain that threatened to splinter her thoughts, she tried to reach Jason\u2019s mind. She\u2019d never before dared this, for it presumed an intimacy he did not wish to share, but he had to know what he faced.</p><p>When her thoughts hit the unyielding glossy black of his shields and ricocheted back, panic beat at her with fluttering wings, but she told herself to be patient, to be calm. If she didn\u2019t succeed, Jason could inadvertently insult Neha and in so doing, forfeit his life.</p><p>I won\u2019t let her kill you, Jason. I won\u2019t.</p><p>Taking another deep breath, she tried to reach him again, realized with a dash of desperation that she was far too weak to have any impact on a shield so solid it was beyond adamantine. It was unlikely he even noticed her attempts, especially when from what Neha was saying, the archangel, too, was attempting to batter his defenses.</p><p>Retreating, she threw every part of her mind into coming up with some other way to either gain his attention or create a diversion.</p><p>Are you hurt? A voice, pristine as a bell . . . and inside her head.</p><p>The wonder of the fact he\u2019d initiated a link might have paralyzed her had she not been so afraid for him. No, I\u2019m fine, she lied, able to taste the gleaming obsidian of his rage. Jason, listen, there is something you must know.</p><p>Silence, but the connection remained open.</p><p>She cares nothing for me except as the toy she called me, but she wants you.</p><p>Neha isn\u2019t the first archangel to want to poach my skills.</p><p>No. She held her breath, released it in a quiet rush as pain stabbed at her chest.</p><p>You are hurt.</p><p>A few broken ribs won\u2019t matter if we both end up dead, so listen. She doesn\u2019t want your skills, she wants you\u2014for her new consort.</p><p>36</p><p>Neha\u2019s voice broke into their silent exchange. \u201cI did not expect such a weak creature to intrigue you so, but it is undoubtedly a fleeting interest.\u201d That quickly, Neha dismissed Mahiya. \u201cWhat I offer you is far more than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s mad.</p><p>Mahiya blinked at Jason\u2019s flat assessment. No, Neha is sane. Coldly so. She knows you\u2019ll be a strong, dangerous, intelligent consort. Jason was a man any woman would be proud to have by her side. And you are beautiful. Neha has always been drawn to beauty in a man. Though Jason was a naked blade to Eris\u2019s pretty ornament.</p><p>Only madness would make her blind to the fact that it would be a very stupid man who\u2019d accept the offer of a woman who imprisoned her last consort for three hundred years.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s mouth threatened to fall open. Well, when you put it that way . . .</p><p>\u201cI need a consort,\u201d Neha said, walking to the edge of the garden once more, her gaze on the lake, its surface a mirror of the blue sky touched with curling edges of red and orange. \u201cI do not want you for a lover, so you may keep Mahiya as a diversion if you wish, but I am offering you power you will never gain in Raphael\u2019s court.\u201d</p><p>Jason was quiet for a long moment. \u201cI did not expect such an offer,\u201d he said at last, as if Neha had caught him unawares and he sought time to get his thoughts in order.</p><p>Yes, Mahiya thought, watching Neha\u2019s face as she turned back to Jason. That was the right tack. To refuse her outright would be an insult the archangel would not forget, never forgive.</p><p>\u201cA consort must walk beside an archangel,\u201d he added. \u201cI prefer the shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy last consort was a creature of the light, shining and handsome, and he betrayed me.\u201d Brittle words.</p><p>Some assistance, Mahiya Geet.</p><p>Startled at the tenderness in his mental tone, something she\u2019d never heard in his spoken voice, it took her a second to reply. She\u2019s still in love with Eris, and you\u2019re too proud a man to be with a woman who mourns another.</p><p>I am?</p><p>Her lips twitched. Jason\u2019s laughter was hidden deep within, where the light did not often reach, but it was there. You are, she said firmly, taking advantage of Neha\u2019s preoccupation with Jason to get to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThis time,\u201d the archangel continued, \u201ca consort who stands in the shadows would suit me well.\u201d</p><p>Jason bowed deeper than Mahiya had ever seen him bow, his wings spread to their full breathtaking width, the colors of sunset playing over the jet in a display that turned it into a canvas of black flame. When he rose back up, his expression was as inscrutable as always, but his voice gentle. \u201cI am truly flattered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut.\u201d The edge in Neha\u2019s voice was a scythe.</p><p>\u201cBut though he may have betrayed you, Eris holds your heart.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s sucked-in breath was loud in the silence. \u201cI am not offering you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jason folded in his wings with neat care. \u201cBut I am one of the Seven\u2014I have seen a true archangel-consort match, one bound by the heart, and so I will always know the lack.\u201d</p> <p>Neha\u2019s anger whipped her hair back from her face, a faint glow coming off her wings. \u201cRaphael\u2019s consort should be dead.\u201d</p><p>Elena, Mahiya remembered too late, had been critical in Anoushka\u2019s execution.</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d Jason said, not missing a beat, \u201cRaphael would take on the Cadre rather than allow her to come to harm. You would not do the same for me.\u201d</p><p>Neha stared at him, a faint confusion in her expression. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect such a romantic heart from you, Jason.\u201d Her gaze snapped to Mahiya. \u201cDo you expect to find such a love with that?\u201d</p><p>Mahiya felt a storm lick against her senses, realized it wasn\u2019t her own emotions she was sensing. Jason.</p> <p>\u201cI expect nothing but amusement,\u201d Jason said in a tone so calm that had she not been swamped by his rage, she would\u2019ve never guessed at its existence, \u201cbut I want it on my terms, on my turf.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s wings swept over the velvet grass nurtured by the gardeners to luxuriant life, as she turned away. \u201cI will give her into your keeping if the knowledge you hold proves as valuable as you believe.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya knew that was the best they would get. Neha would take any further attempt to negotiate as an attack on her honor. We must accept.</p><p>And roll the dice. \u201cThe murderer of Eris and the others is not in your court.\u201d Jason walked to stand beside Neha, his wings a stark contrast to the indigo-dusted white of hers. \u201cNeither is she any longer in the area, but my sources tell me she returns here in the hours after sunset.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s heart ached at the idea of her mother so very close. She knew Jason had been surprised at the discovery of how soon the assault would begin, but it did make a brutal kind of sense\u2014Neha was hurting from Eris\u2019s loss, vulnerable.</p><p>Now, the archangel\u2019s hair flared back in a wind no one else could feel. \u201cOne of his whores?\u201d</p> <p>Mahiya fisted her hands until her nails dug into her palms.</p><p>\u201cI do not make judgments.\u201d Jason\u2019s response was even. \u201cBut I am near certain that until his murder, she had not touched him for more than three hundred years.\u201d</p><p>Neha went so motionless as to be inhuman. It was as if she ceased to exist in the moment, in the now, and went elsewhere. \u201cYou bring the dead back to life.\u201d</p><p>Disturbed by the eerie echo effect in the archangel\u2019s voice, Mahiya rubbed at the tiny hairs on her arms, all standing in alarm.</p><p>\u201cI do not think so,\u201d Jason responded. \u201cI also think this dead woman gathers an army.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s wings snapped out. \u201cCome.\u201d With that, she swept off the garden and across the lake before spiraling up and back toward the fort.</p><p>Jason followed. You\u2019re hurt. Wait here.</p><p>Mahiya was already in the air. I can rest later. Beating her wings put strain on her rib cage, the agony threatening to take her under, but she could not turn back.</p> <p>Mahiya.</p><p>She sensed he was on the edge, that he would bring her down physically if necessary. I need to know, she said, laying her heart open, the heart of a girl who\u2019d never known her mother\u2019s fate.</p><p>A pause. Then use me.</p><p>Not certain if it was what he meant, she nonetheless clung to the midnight strength she could sense in her mind, and landed at the fortified Guardian Fort only seconds behind Neha and Jason. The archangel didn\u2019t even notice her presence, walking with determined steps into a section of the fort that had been closed up as long as Mahiya had been aware of it. She\u2019d tried to explore it once as a child, found her way blocked by fallen debris too heavy to shift.</p><p>Now, Neha touched her fingers to the debris in a complicated pattern . . . and that part of the floor just fell in, revealing a staircase on the other side. Mahiya\u2019s heart thudded so hard, she was certain the archangel would hear it. Each staccato beat pushed against broken ribs, but that pain was eclipsed by brutal comprehension.</p><p>Here, she was here all this time. It was a keen.</p><p>She no longer is. Remember.</p><p>Wrenching her anguish under vicious control, Mahiya wrapped the essence of Jason around herself as she followed him and Neha down the staircase and into a corridor lit with modern electric bulbs set in wall sconces that threw warm light on the stone walls. Many had burned out, while still others were swathed in cobwebs, a silent indication of how long it had been since anyone walked this passage. A hundred feet down the corridor, Neha revealed another staircase that went even deeper into the earth.</p><p>The lights here were naked bulbs, the corridor itself pounded earth . . . and the single room at the end a pit in the earth with crisscrossing bars that hid the shadowed realm beyond. Throwing out a hand, Neha lit up the cell with a blaze of violent power.</p><p>It was empty.</p><p>Mahiya swayed, would\u2019ve fallen if Jason hadn\u2019t grabbed her hand.</p><p>Mahiya.</p><p>I\u2019m fine. Air rushed into her lungs as she took in a breath and thought about what she\u2019d seen: the melted metal where manacles might have hung from the walls, the scorch marks around the hole in the bars of the cell. Whoever had rescued her mother had used a blowtorch to cut her free. Promise.</p><p>He released her before Neha could turn. How badly are you hurt?</p><p>Already healing. I just . . . this place.</p><p>She\u2019d been half afraid they were wrong, that her mother remained trapped in this nightmare place. A creature meant for the skies kept so long in the dark . . . Her wings would\u2019ve been wasted. She couldn\u2019t have flown out of here.</p><p>It also means she was rescued far longer than six months ago. If I was asked to bet, I would say it was done when Raphael executed Uram. The world was in chaos, and Neha often had to be away from the fort on Cadre business.</p><p>A scream of rage splintered the silence, Neha spinning around in a fury that burned ice along one wall, fire along the other. Mahiya barely escaped being singed by the flames . . . and her step out of its path put her in Neha\u2019s direct line of sight. The archangel\u2019s eyes pinned her, cold as hell, and Mahiya knew she was dead.</p><p>Black shimmered in her vision until Jason\u2019s wings were all she could see.</p><p>No, Jason, no! In this mood, Neha would execute him regardless of any other consideration.</p><p>\u201cThe information,\u201d he said as she attempted to budge his shoulders, shove him out of danger. \u201cWas it worth the price?\u201d</p><p>A chill silence, the ice cracking and breaking to fall at their feet, the fire flickering out to leave the walls scorched, the corridor dimly illuminated by the single bulb that had survived. Neha\u2019s laugh this time was inhuman enough to sour Mahiya\u2019s stomach, and yet it held a certain amusement.</p><p>\u201cNow I understand, Jason. You have a weakness for broken birds, and she would make a pretty hostage.\u201d It seemed to please Neha, that justification. \u201cVery well, you have admirably fulfilled the blood vow. Take this broken bird. Keep her, leave her in some protected aerie, it matters nothing. I have no need of a hostage when I can rend my beloved sister limb from limb with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s knees almost crumpled, only her grip on Jason keeping her upright. I\u2019m free . . . and my mother is about to die.</p><p>37</p><p>Dmitri handled several pieces of Tower business, clearing as much of the decks as he could from a distance, including a situation that meant sending a senior angel out of state to deal with another angel who thought to create himself a fiefdom free of Tower oversight.</p><p>That done, he spoke to Ilium. \u201cAnything else urgent we need to clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Aodhan should have time to settle in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dmitri was conscious the angel would be out of his element, but confident he had the capacity to step into Dmitri\u2019s shoes\u2014to a certain extent. Aodhan and Illium were both much younger, had less experience, but together, they were a dangerous force. \u201cYou know how to get hold of me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDmitri.\u201d Golden eyes fringed with black lashes tipped in blue met his. \u201cTake care of Honor. I promise I won\u2019t burn down the Tower in your absence\u2014I don\u2019t know why everyone got so excited about a little smoke.\u201d</p><p>Aware the blue-winged angel was attempting to lighten his mood, he said, \u201cI\u2019m reassured. Let me just call the fire department.\u201d He signed off to Illium\u2019s laughter and glanced over his shoulder to check on Honor as he did a thousand times through the day.</p><p>He\u2019d moved his desk into the bedroom, was never away from her for longer than a few minutes at most. He didn\u2019t ever want her to rouse alone. With the toxin wreaking havoc in her bloodstream, she might panic, be afraid.</p><p>\u201cWill you be here when I wake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Only once he was sure she was safe, her breathing steady, did he force himself to return to his work, the trees beyond the window rustling under the playful caress of the wind. Two more days until he could wake her, until he could hear her voice again. Two more days.</p><p>38</p><p>It took Mahiya only minutes to pack the things she couldn\u2019t bear to be without. The bag was pitifully small, but then she\u2019d always known she would one day leave this place. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken any jewels except for those that were undisputed personal gifts,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t a matter of stupid pride but safety. \u201cI can\u2019t risk that Neha will brand me a thief, demand my return for punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no need to chance such a thing.\u201d Jason nodded in approval at the simple tunic and pants she\u2019d pulled on for the flight out of Neha\u2019s territory. \u201cI will lend you what you need to start your new life.\u201d</p><p>The tension that had knotted up her spine at his first sentence, dissolved with his second. \u201cThank you.\u201d A loan came with an expectation that it would be repaid, did not steal her newfound freedom by making her dependant on him. \u201cYour bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I will miss.\u201d He withdrew his sword, checked it, slid it back into the sheath. \u201cGive me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not heavy.\u201d Designed to be carried on her front, it left her wings unhindered.</p><p>He just reached out and took it, carrying it in one hand. \u201cYour ribs haven\u2019t yet fully healed, so don\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry it by hand as you\u2019re doing\u2014at least until we\u2019re out of the fort. You need your hands free should you have to fight.\u201d Her blade-pins would be useful were they cornered, but a sword wielded by a master would end things before it ever got that far.</p><p>You have a tendency to give orders yourself, princess. In spite of the dark words, he returned the bag. \u201cCome, we have to go.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya stepped out onto the balcony, hesitated. \u201cVanhi, I can\u2019t leave without saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can meet her at the Refuge\u2014she visits there at least once a year. And Neha cares too much for her to punish her for continuing to see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stepped off the balcony with those words to come to a graceful landing in the courtyard, wings spread. Surprised, she followed in silence. What\u2019s wrong?</p><p>I don\u2019t trust Neha not to shoot us down from the skies.</p><p>Mahiya had the same fear\u2014the roof of the fort was spiked with an increasing number of ground-to-air weapons in preparation for Nivriti\u2019s return. It would only take a single \u201caccident\u201d to get rid of an inconvenient angel and the spymaster who protected her. The tunnels, she said. Did Venom give you a map?</p><p>Yes. Stay as close to me as you can without entangling my wings.</p> <p>She discovered the reason for his order a few moments later, when two guards heading in the direction of their palace passed by without so much as a nod, though Mahiya and Jason stood exposed in an alcove just off the path. Guessing they had seen only a smudged pool of darkness, she became Jason\u2019s shadow as they made their way through the fort, their pace cautious but steady.</p><p>Rather than crossing the courtyards, Jason took an internal path, going down otherwise deserted corridors and through heavy doors until they exited into a small garden lit only by a spare number of tea candles. It was, she remembered, an adjunct to a disused palace. As evidenced by the candles, the garden was utilized by the odd pair seeking privacy, but no one sat on the benches tonight.</p><p>Jason halted in the darkness outside the door through which they\u2019d come, and she saw shadows swirl around the candles a moment later, eclipsing even that muted light. Can you see?</p><p>Not well.</p><p>A warm hand gripped hers.</p> <p>Moving with the feline grace of a man at home in the moonless night, Jason led her to the center of the garden and to the pedestal on which stood a statue of an unnamed angel, her wings spread in readiness for flight. A twist of the statue\u2019s right wrist, followed by a hard pull on her opposing wing, and one side of the pedestal slid open. The doorway was narrow, this entrance not meant for a being with wings, but Mahiya bit back her incipient claustrophobia and walked in, Jason\u2019s body heat a subtle reassurance as he entered right behind her.</p><p>A second later, the door slid shut again.</p><p>Stygian, the darkness hissed with ghosts of terror, and she thought she might panic\u2014until a soft, glowing light filled the space, the ball of warmth floating just in front of her. It wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d have expected from a man whose power expressed itself in shades of midnight, but she was beyond grateful. Thank you, she said, able to breathe again now that she could see the tiny box held no serpents.</p><p>His arm came around her. Stairs into the tunnels will open beneath your feet. Soon as they do, head down. He pressed something on the wall and half the floor gave away. Fast as possible, princess.</p><p>Mahiya didn\u2019t need him to explain why. Neha might regret it later if she caused them harm, might consider it a stain on her honor, but they\u2019d be just as dead. Using the light that hovered in front of her as a beacon, wings scraping the edges of the narrow staircase, she pushed forward to enter a tunnel as narrow.</p><p>It was maybe two minutes later that she finally stumbled into a much wider tunnel.</p> <p>Turn left. Jason swept around to walk beside her with that instruction, both of them now able to stand fully upright. A single set of footprints preceded theirs in the dust.</p><p>Venom?</p><p>He says he knows these tunnels like a snake knows its den.</p><p>As if he\u2019d called them up, two snakes slid sinuously into their path. Mahiya halted, examined the color of their leathery skin and breathed out a sigh. They\u2019re not poisonous. Neha didn\u2019t tamper with nature except when she had a specific reason.</p><p>Jason gave her a searching look. You\u2019re not afraid.</p><p>Not in the light, she answered honestly.</p><p>Those weren\u2019t the only slithery creatures they saw, but for the most part, the snakes just wanted to be left alone or were curious. Only one acted aggressive, and it died a quick death under the obsidian blade of Jason\u2019s sword, its body turned to ash between one breath and the next.</p><p>\u201cIs it the sword?\u201d she asked aloud, sensing they were deep enough that sound wouldn\u2019t carry. \u201cThe black fire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. However, it\u2019s a useful conduit.\u201d</p><p>His answer was no surprise, not when she\u2019d felt the midnight flame of him more than once.</p><p>\u201cThe tunnels\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent Rhys a message just before we left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to handicap her mother, but as Jason had known about the tunnels\u2019 possible tactical use before the blood vow was deemed complete, remaining silent would\u2019ve blemished his honor and put his life in danger.</p><p>\u201cFaster, Mahiya.\u201d</p><p>Calf muscles straining as the tunnels began to slope steadily upward, she saved her breath and her strength until they exited at last . . . from a trapdoor in the floor of the broken-down temple where she\u2019d found the teddy bear. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Venom use this before?\u201d The exit was cunningly concealed in a dark alcove.</p><p>\u201cChance the door would be stiff with disuse, give him away. He oiled the hinges for us prior to leaving.\u201d He went into another alcove, came out with a bag she assumed Venom had stashed. \u201cWeapons, should we need them.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing at the fine grit on her face, cobwebs no doubt dusted over her hair, she dropped her bag in the corner and entered the open space in the center of the unbroken part of the temple. \u201cI can\u2019t leave.\u201d The unvarnished words simply spilled out, before she was even aware of making a choice.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>A terrible ache blossomed in her chest at his simple acceptance.</p><p>\u201cIf the world suddenly changed and she stood in front of me, I would run into her arms just like that little boy.\u201d</p><p>It would\u2019ve been smarter to stay silent, to not push at his boundaries, but a life of walls and secrets was not what she wanted with her spymaster. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d she said, asking him to share a piece of his history with her, even if he could not share his heart. \u201cHow she died?\u201d</p><p>Jason leaned against the wall at the back of the ruined temple, his ears cocked to the wind. It brought a single word.</p><p>Nivriti.</p><p>Not long to wait, he thought, guessing the vengeance-driven angel had a spy in the fort who\u2019d informed her the instant her daughter was out of Neha\u2019s reach and no longer at risk of being used as a hostage.</p><p>His eyes lingered on the woman who stood with her back to a column that had survived the vagaries of time, her face a study in strength and vulnerability intertwined. Waiting for his answer, waiting for him to tell her of a nightmare he\u2019d shared with no person on this earth. But this princess had nightmares of her own.</p><p>It could be that that was why he spoke. Or perhaps it was because of the luminous warmth at the back of his mind that was Mahiya\u2019s presence. He should\u2019ve blocked her out, was certain she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d maintained the connection since he first allowed her through his shields. But he was loathe to cut her off\u2014it felt as if she\u2019d tucked herself into him. Not prying, not in any way aggressive, just curled up against him as she liked to be in bed, her hand on his heart.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s life,\u201d he began, taking strength from that gentle radiance, \u201cwas stolen when I was a boy whose wings were yet too big for his body.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, Jason made himself stop looking at the rust that wasn\u2019t rust, and pulled himself out of the hole, closing the trapdoor with careful hands\u2014and averted eyes\u2014so it wouldn\u2019t make a noise. And then he stood staring at the wall. He didn\u2019t want to turn and see what lay on the other side, what he\u2019d pushed off the top of the trapdoor. But the wall was splattered with the rust that wasn\u2019t rust, too. Tiny bits of it had begun to flake off, baked by the hot sun pouring in through the sky-window.</p><p>Stomach all twisted and his heart a lump, he looked away from the wall and to the floor, but it was streaked with pale brown, his feet having made small prints on the polished wood. The dirt inside the hole hadn\u2019t been wet. Not until after.</p><p>After the screams went quiet.</p><p>He closed his eyes, but he could still smell the rust that wasn\u2019t rust.</p><p>And he knew he had to turn around.</p><p>Had to see.</p><p>She was looking at him from the other side of the room, her pretty dark brown eyes filmed over with a whiteness that was wrong. The stump of her neck was crusted with blood where it sat on the table in the corner, as if placed there for just this purpose.</p><p>He didn\u2019t scream.</p><p>He knew never to scream.</p><p>Instead, he looked at the chunk of meat that had been blocking the trapdoor. It wore a silk sheath of brilliant amethyst.</p><p>Amethyst. That\u2019s what his mother always called her favorite color. Amethyst.</p><p>It had taken him a long time to say it right, and she\u2019d always laughed in delight when he used the word, her shining black hair dancing in the sunshine.</p><p>The mat crackled under his feet, and he realized he\u2019d moved, realized he was dragging the meat wearing the amethyst top to the other part that matched, that he was adding her arms and legs, the ripped and bloodied feathers of her silvery-white wings, his chest straining with the effort, the pieces too heavy for his small body. But he had to do it.</p><p>The sun hadn\u2019t dried out the bits in the shade and hidden from direct light, and his hands became slippery with dark red once more. When her head slid out of his hands and thumped on the floor, he bit hard on his lip and picked it up again, stroking back the hair that had gotten in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mama.\u201d He had his mother\u2019s hair, her skin, her eyes, she always said so. But today her eyes weren\u2019t right, weren\u2019t smiling as they always did when they turned his way.</p><p>Finally settling her head where it should be on her body, he knelt down on the mat that always made crisscross patterns on his knees and said, \u201cWake up now.\u201d</p><p>His mother was an immortal, just like him. Only four hundred and sixty-five years old, but that was old enough.</p><p>Angels lived forever.</p><p>That\u2019s what his mother said the mortals said, but she said angels simply lived a very long time.</p><p>He shook her shoulders, her brown skin cold instead of glowing with warmth. \u201cWake up.\u201d He tried not to remember what else his mother had said, but her words whispered into his mind, spoken in the lyrical language of the island where she\u2019d been born and lived until she was taken to school in a place she called the Refuge.</p><p>\u201cAngels can die. It is a difficult thing but not impossible. Especially for younger angels.\u201d</p><p>Now he looked at the chunk of meat wearing the amethyst silk, and he knew what that hole in her chest meant. Her heart was gone, ripped out. Her stomach, too, had a hole. And her head . . . it hadn\u2019t been too heavy for him to lift. Because there was a hole in it, too.</p><p>All his mother\u2019s insides were gone.</p><p>An angel of her age and power could not reawaken without her insides, could not reform. Still he shook her, telling her to \u201cWake up, wake up, wake up!\u201d Until he realized he was screaming, when he was supposed to never, ever scream.</p><p>Shutting himself up by biting down on his lip again until it bled, he patted his mother\u2019s hair back into place and rose, putting one bloody hand on the doorknob to open it. Silence greeted him on the other side. He followed the trail of dried blood, determined to find his mother\u2019s insides. If he put them back, she would wake up, he knew she would. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His wings dragged on the ground, streaking dirt and rust red along the shiny wooden floors, and he knew his mother would scold him. He was always supposed to keep them up, so his flight muscles would grow strong, but he was so tired and hungry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mama,\u201d he whispered again. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll do better tomorrow.\u201d After she was awake.</p><p>Outside, the full might of the sun was blinding, the light reflecting off the white sands on the other side of his mother\u2019s lush garden, the water an endless blue horizon. He blinked until the spots faded, and continued on his task. The trail of sun-hardened black brown went around the side of the house and to what had been the small shed where his father had built things, like the instruments their friends took away to sell at the Refuge place and the toys Jason used to love.</p><p>Before.</p><p>Smoke still rose from the collapsed remnants of his father\u2019s work house, but the fire had devoured a good meal and was settling down to sleep, the fallen beams glowing with a final few embers. He knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to go near fire, but he went anyway, pushing away still-warm pieces with his hands. When the embers burned his skin, singed his feathers, he shook off the hurt and carried on, kicking aside the ash and the lumps of charcoaled wood until he saw his father\u2019s head.</p> <p>It was rolling around on the floor, all bone, the eye holes empty. His father\u2019s body\u2014charred black bones\u2014lay in another part of the small building, and Jason knew then that his father had burned up his mother\u2019s insides as well as his own, that he\u2019d cut off his own head using the chopping thing he\u2019d built . . . would have cut off Jason\u2019s if Jason had made a sound when his father called out for him after the screams stopped and the blood began to seep through the trapdoor.</p><p>39</p><p>But maybe his father had made a mistake, he thought suddenly, hope a bright star inside him, and his mother\u2019s insides had survived?</p><p>He began to dig through the ash again, his skin burning, his face blackened by the dust. He dug, and he searched, and he left a trail of sticky red as his burnt skin peeled and his battered hands began to bleed. It was only when night fell that he realized there was nothing to be found.</p><p>His mother\u2019s insides had been turned to ash.</p> <p>\u201cOnly a very powerful immortal can rise from the ashes of flame.\u201d Brown eyes shining with relief and concern both. \u201cThat\u2019s why you must never play with fire, Jason. Even I cannot survive a fire should it reach my heart and mind, and you are a babe.\u201d</p><p>Wings dragging under the half-moon, he walked out to the closest part of their lagoon, washed himself in the warm, shallow water. His mother didn\u2019t like it when he came into the house dirty, so he washed and washed until all the blood and the dust was gone from his body, his raw and cut flesh stinging from the salt water. Carrying his dirty clothes, he left them on the porch where she always picked them up to wash. His wings were slick with water, so he opened and shook them off before going inside.</p><p>Mama always kissed his cheek and patted his wings dry with a soft cloth, but today, he had to do it himself. It was hard\u2014his wings were bigger than his body, and he couldn\u2019t reach every part.</p><p>\u201cThis way, Bumblebee.\u201d</p><p>Listening to the memory, he spread the cloth on the floor and lay down on it like Mama and his father had once done, both of them laughing after a swim, their wings glistening in the sunlight as he circled delighted above them like \u201ca big bumblebee.\u201d That was a good memory, of the time before his father became a stranger who locked the bedroom door and made his mother make small, hurting sounds that twisted Jason up until he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Dry, he put on clean clothes, and even though he wasn\u2019t supposed to wear shoes inside the house, he thought it would be all right this time, because the floor was so dirty. Ready, he walked to the back door and out to where his mother kept things with which she worked in her garden. She\u2019d like to be near her big yellow hibiscus flowers, he thought, beginning to dig. They were her favorites\u2014when he brought her one, she always put it behind her ear, where it shone \u201cbrilliant as the sunrise against the black silk\u201d of her hair.</p> <p>His father had said that and kissed her.</p><p>Before.</p><p>He was only a child. It took him two days to dig the hole. He didn\u2019t want to put his mother in the ground, but the flies had started to bother her in spite of the sheets he\u2019d dragged out from the other rooms and spread over her. He knew she wouldn\u2019t like that. So after he used a mat to gently pull the pieces of her to the hole he\u2019d dug, he put a hibiscus flower in her hair and covered her up with her favorite amethyst shawl. \u201cI love you, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Then, he began to put the earth back inside the hole, on top of his mama. His tears ran silent and endless down his cheeks, his body having learned too well never, ever to make a sound. When it was all filled up and he knew none of the small animals that lived in the forest would be able to disturb her, he went to the beach to collect shells over and over, until her entire grave glittered and gleamed with the curves and twists and shine of the sea, the heavy blossoms of the hibiscus hanging overhead.</p><p>Then, he put his father\u2019s bones in a sack and dragged it into the damp thickness of the trees, the weight too heavy for him to fly. He didn\u2019t know how long he walked and dragged. A long time. Sometimes he rested. But finally he reached the small coral-reef encircled lagoon that jutted off the main atoll, like a twin that hadn\u2019t quite formed properly.</p><p>Unlike their lagoon, he wasn\u2019t allowed to play in this one. His father had told him there was a volcano under the surface, its crater deep. That volcano, it did something to the water, made it burn Jason\u2019s eyes the one time he\u2019d become curious and come to explore.</p><p>Heartbeat pounding against his ribs with the effort, he rose into the air and flew to the center of the bad lagoon and dropped the sack into its dark heart, watching as the sack sank below the surface and into the maw of the hidden volcano. As the lagoon ate up his father, and though Jason wanted to hate him, hate him, hate him, his heart hurt.</p><p>He remembered how his father had taught him about coral, about sea creatures, about how to work with wood to build instruments that made haunting music, and his eyes blurred until he couldn\u2019t see anymore and he knew he had to get away before he fell into the bad lagoon. Straining his body, he flew up into the air and away, going as far as his tired muscles and heavy wings could take him before he stopped, looked around.</p> <p>Their atoll was a ring of emerald green that circled a shimmering lagoon. He couldn\u2019t fly around it in one day yet, but he planned to when he was bigger. His mother had said she\u2019d go with him, show him all the secret places she\u2019d found, but now she wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>There was no one else.</p><p>He was all alone.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s heart had broken a thousand times over as she listened to Jason\u2019s story, as she thought of that small boy so alone and scared and sad. Yet she also knew that the man in front of her was not that boy, had not been that boy for hundreds of years. She couldn\u2019t wipe away his pain and tell him everything would be all right.</p><p>Jason had learned too well that sometimes nothing could fix what was broken.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a conscious thought to walk toward him. It just seemed right. Just as it seemed right to slide her arms around his torso and lay her cheek on his chest.</p><p>Sometimes, touch could say far more than any words. So she just held him and felt fresh tears prick her eyes as his arms came around her, tucking her close. Her hands were under his wings, his over hers, and it seemed as if this was how they had always gone into an embrace, how they would go into an embrace a thousand years from now.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d Jason murmured, his cheek against her temple, \u201cwas a man of incredible talent fueled by a wildly passionate nature. His Nene meant more to him than anything and anyone else in existence.\u201d</p><p>Black wings came around her, a midnight caress. \u201cPerhaps his passionate attachment to my mother might have been tempered had they been allowed to live in peace in the world, or perhaps the darkness was the price he paid for his talent, but he loved her until it became an obsession, until one by one, he drove off all their friends with his jealousy. Even the women were not welcome\u2014he believed they sought to lure her away with their tales of the Refuge.\u201d</p><p>Leaving, Mahiya thought, woman and child alone with a man whose love had become a noose. \u201cYour mother\u2014\u201d She cut herself off, realizing too late the question would cause him horrible pain.</p><p>But he knew what she had left unspoken. \u201cShe went against her family\u2019s wishes in accepting his suit, but it wasn\u2019t pride that kept her from taking me and returning to the Refuge. It was love.\u201d His arms tightened around her. \u201cEven when his jealousy escalated to the point where he imagined she had a secret lover, one who visited her during the rare times when he flew to a nearby island to harvest fruit. Even when he began to hurt her in ways that left no bruises but the ones in her eyes.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya wanted to rage against his mother, to shake her. How could she have not protected her son from such horror? Yet, even as she screamed silently at the pain that had forged the man in her arms, she knew emotions were nothing so simple.</p><p>Neha\u2019s continuing love for Eris was only one example.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, and the words held all her sorrow, her rage.</p><p>Jason\u2019s response was a stroke of his hand down her back, his heart beating strong and steady under her cheek, his body a furnace, his strength so inexorable she should\u2019ve been terrified. But this was Jason, who would never hurt her. She\u2019d known that deep within even before he told her of a past that made her understand why he helped \u201cbroken birds.\u201d</p><p>A lance of pain, but even stronger was her need to bring Jason back from the horror, to remind him that the world was not just a creation of pain and suffering and loss. Pulling back enough that she could look into his eyes, she thought of everything he\u2019d told her, picked out a hidden wonder.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to swim?\u201d she asked into the silence, the night quiet around them but for the clicking sound that announced the presence of an inquisitive little lizard before it flicked its jewel green body and disappeared into a crevice in the temple wall. \u201cYou said you played in the lagoon.\u201d</p><p>The question startled Jason. He\u2019d expected the woman in his arms to ask him for the details of how he\u2019d finally reached the Refuge, but this subject was a welcome diversion from the memories. \u201cLike a fish. I\u2019ll teach you if you like.\u201d All angels could float, their wings buoyant. However, that buoyancy made athletic swimming, particularly deep dives, difficult. Jason\u2019s parents had taught him tricks to negate the effect, at least for short periods of time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Mahiya\u2019s smile thawed the ice that had formed in his chest as he spoke of the losses that had forever altered the course of his existence.</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d he said, tucking her a fraction closer, \u201cas much freedom in the sea as in the sky if you know how to move in it.\u201d Alone and with no parents to become alarmed that he\u2019d gone too far, he\u2019d learned to streak through the deep, his wings slicked to his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nivriti.</p><p>He released Mahiya at the whisper of wind, folding his wings to his back. \u201cCome.\u201d Walking out and around the shadow-shrouded side of the temple, Mahiya silent as she followed, he looked toward the fort, searching for any sign of trouble.</p><p>He saw nothing . . . not until he swept his gaze to the right.</p><p>The night sky was a sheet of black, the glitter of the stars blotted out by an army of wings. Those wings appeared \u201cwrong\u201d to his vision until he realized they were pure jet. Since no living angel he knew of had wings akin to his own, that meant they had been dyed as camouflage. The vampiric ground guard had to be within minutes of the fort.</p> <p>This is madness. Mahiya\u2019s horrified voice. Even with this army, my mother cannot hope to take Neha on in combat.</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t disagree. Impressive as Nivriti\u2019s forces appeared, they weren\u2019t, not in comparison to the garrison that lived in the fort\u2014which represented only a small percentage of the offensive resources at Neha\u2019s command. You should not watch this.</p><p>No . . . I should be a part of it. I may not know Nivriti, but she is my mother, and Neha has done nothing to win my loyalty.</p><p>Jason turned to pin her with his gaze. You put yourself on that field, and you do nothing but distract your mother. Neha will use you, make Nivriti watch you bleed. You\u2019re too weak to be anything but a liability.</p><p>Mahiya flinched. That was cruel.</p> <p>Cruelty is sometimes necessary.</p><p>You\u2019re strong, she retorted. You could help my mother\u2014but you\u2019re a coward, hiding here.</p><p>He didn\u2019t allow her to see what the mental slap did to him. The instant I step onto that battlefield, I draw Raphael and all his people into a war. Thousands, millions would die in the aftermath.</p><p>Mahiya seemed to wilt, her eyes on the black wings on the horizon. I\u2019m sorry. I knew that . . . I shouldn\u2019t take my anger out on you. Forgive me, Jason.</p><p>He could taste her heartbreak. It is forgotten.</p><p>Shifting to put her back to the wall, she slid down to sit against it, a desolation in her expression he\u2019d never before seen, that stubborn, beautiful hope close to extinguished. I\u2019ve waited so long for her, and now she\u2019ll die.</p> <p>Jason turned his face toward the skies. Stay here. He rose up into the star-studded black before she could question him, blending into the night shadows with an ease that was instinctive. Then he shot straight at the approaching army, their slow, careful pace no match for his speed.</p><p>A cry went up only when he wanted to be seen. Raising a hand to halt crossbows being fired, a woman who was unquestionably kin to Neha cut away from the group to head to him. He felt her mental touch, chose not to acknowledge it.</p><p>Imperious and haughty, she stopped in front of him, fanning her unpainted wings to hold her position. \u201cSpymaster.\u201d</p><p>This woman, he thought, might have given Mahiya the delicate angles of her face, the wild blue and green of her feathers, but she was nothing like the child she\u2019d birthed, her eyes touched with a devouring rage. \u201cYou should speak to your daughter before you undertake this suicide mission.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened before laughter filled the air, husky and soft. \u201cAh, such faith.\u201d A twist to her lips. \u201cLead me to her.\u201d</p><p>Jason was unsurprised both at her lack of worry about a possible ambush, and her complete disregard of his veiled warning to retreat. Love and hate both had a tendency to blind, to destroy reason. \u201cShe is not far.\u201d</p><p>Guardian Fort was alive with activity by the time he returned to the temple, and it took a combination of fine timing and luck to bring Nivriti down without being detected. Mahiya wasn\u2019t where he\u2019d left her\u2014she was standing on the steps to the temple, a crossbow in hand, the bolt notched and in position to fire.</p><p>He almost smiled. He knew the dangerous whip of anger in the tawny brightness was for him, for the way he\u2019d left her, but it changed into shock as her gaze alighted on Nivriti.</p> <p>The dull thud of the crossbow hitting the ground snapped Mahiya out of her stunned motionlessness. Bending reflexively, she picked it up without ever taking her eyes from the woman who walked toward her, dressed in what appeared to be fighting leathers of black, her wings the template from which Mahiya\u2019s had been cast.</p><p>\u201cDaughter.\u201d A whisper-soft word, the woman\u2019s fingers alighting on her cheek as her expression overflowed with a depth of emotion that ripped at Mahiya\u2019s heart, her soul. \u201cForever beloved of my heart.\u201d</p><p>This time, Mahiya didn\u2019t worry about the crossbow when it dropped. Tears streaking down her face, she went into her mother\u2019s arms and let those arms hold her safe. It didn\u2019t matter at that moment that Nivriti was a monster, one who had torn out a man\u2019s internal organs and brutalized a woman for no reason but that it would hurt her twin. Nothing mattered but that for the first time in her life, she was being held with love.</p><p>40</p><p>Nivriti murmured to her, her voice a lilting melody. \u201cShe thought to torment me by telling me of how you suffered, but the affirmation my precious child lived was the greatest gift she could\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>Cupping Mahiya\u2019s face as she drew back, Nivriti pressed her lips to Mahiya\u2019s forehead. \u201cI fought to stay alive and to stay sane, even as my wings rotted and my memories threatened to fragment, because of you. I never forgot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d Mahiya whispered, for no matter what she\u2019d told herself over the centuries about her mother, whether good or bad, the one thing she had not done was forget. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to war with Neha.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s expression changed, all softness erased. \u201cYes, I do. Or she will never allow me peace\u2014my dearest sister needs to see I have grown fangs.\u201d A smile Mahiya couldn\u2019t read. \u201cIt is strange what grows in the dark underground, even as other things rot.\u201d With that enigmatic statement, she snapped her head toward Jason. \u201cI charged you to get her out of here.\u201d</p><p>Jason stood unmoved, a dark sentinel. \u201cI serve neither you nor Neha.\u201d</p><p>Nivriti\u2019s response at that plainly worded statement of loyalty was not anger, but a laugh of pure delight. \u201cI see why you are drawn to him,\u201d she said to Mahiya. \u201cBut remember, he is only a man and not to be trusted.\u201d Her eyes glittered hard as diamonds as she spread her wings. \u201cI shall see you soon, daughter.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya stared up at the sky as her mother rose with flawless grace, her body showing no sign of her long captivity. \u201cMy mother has had years of freedom,\u201d she said at last. \u201cHer wings would\u2019ve taken at least a year to regenerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Jason\u2019s tone held an unexpected note.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you seen that I have not?\u201d Blinded by emotion as she was, she knew she couldn\u2019t trust her own judgment. But Jason\u2019s? Always.</p><p>\u201cNivriti is too confident for an angel about to go into battle against one of the Cadre.\u201d He looked out over the fort, tracking Nivriti\u2019s army. \u201cAnd she flies with too much strength and skill for someone who suffered centuries of imprisonment below the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would the ones who saved her,\u201d Mahiya said slowly, \u201ceven have known where she was?\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to keep her voice low\u2014the noise at Guardian was overwhelming as troops filled the air.</p><p>\u201cNot all loyalties are what they seem.\u201d Loose strands of Jason\u2019s hair blew back softly from his face in the cool night wind. \u201cWere Nivriti smart, she would\u2019ve seeded at least one of her people in Neha\u2019s inner court when that court first formed.\u201d</p><p>And even archangels, Mahiya thought, touching her fingers to his, could make mistakes of trust.</p><p>Jason\u2019s hand closed over hers. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Following his gaze, she saw an angel rise to hover directly above Archangel Fort. From the glow of lethal power that surrounded her form, it could only be Neha. Mahiya twisted her head to the right, hoping that her mother was protected in the mass of fighters, but no, she hovered at the forefront of her troops.</p><p>Neha began to fly toward Nivriti as she flew toward Neha, Neha\u2019s troops amassing above the fort. Those troops were an insult, a bare squadron. As the twins came to a halt above the city, Mahiya knew the populace below must be gazing upward in wonder and fear both. Because when an archangel glowed, people died.</p><p>Neha and Nivriti halted several feet apart, enough that their wings wouldn\u2019t touch and yet that they could talk. Mahiya would\u2019ve given anything to be up there at this moment, to know what it was they said to one another. But whatever it was, it seemed as if her mother threw back her head and laughed before sketching a bow so insincere, Mahiya could sense it from this distance.</p><p>Neha\u2019s glow intensified . . . and Nivriti dropped the arm she\u2019d raised above her head. Her troops swarmed toward the fort as Neha\u2019s own forces flowed to meet them. Both groups avoided the two women in the center of the chaos. Neha and Nivriti continued to hover in front of one another, as steel clashed and crossbow bolts ripped through wings, locked in a battle of wills Mahiya couldn\u2019t comprehend. To kill not only your sister, but your twin . . . I cannot imagine it, Jason.</p><p>They are fools. A harsh summation. They do not comprehend that what they were given was a gift not to be squandered.</p><p>Understanding sang a nocturne, melancholy and haunting, through her bones. Neha and Nivriti had been born as two halves of a whole. Had they remained locked together in friendship and loyalty as the centuries passed, Neha would have been an archangel with the most trusted of allies beside her. And Nivriti would\u2019ve been the second to an archangel, the strongest of positions if one was not Cadre. More, they would\u2019ve both had someone they could trust to tell the truth, no matter the question. Such a trust might well have saved them making the mistakes they had, given them a happier life.</p><p>But they had wasted that gift, allowed pride and conceit to tear them apart, until Neha was a woman without consort or child, and about to kill the sister of her blood. Meanwhile, Nivriti was a woman so consumed with rage that she\u2019d rather chance never again seeing her child, than walk away from her quest for vengeance.</p><p>The glow around Neha turned white-hot.</p><p>\u201cAngelfire,\u201d she whispered, naming the deadly force that could kill even an archangel.</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cNeha cannot create angelfire, but what she can create is just as deadly to the others in the Cadre.\u201d Even as he spoke, a whip of green snapped out from Neha\u2019s hand, a vicious thing as fast as the serpents that came so easily to the archangel\u2019s hand.</p><p>Nivriti shut her wings and dropped at almost the same instant the snap left Neha\u2019s hand, a move of such speed that Mahiya couldn\u2019t follow it with the eye. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if she was asking about Neha or Nivriti.</p><p>\u201cThe Cadre calls it the poison whip,\u201d Jason responded. \u201cA single brush against skin and it releases a deadly toxin into the bloodstream. As with angelfire, an archangel could beat a certain number of glancing blows, but an ordinary angel would die in seconds. A full strike with the whip to the heart or the head equals total death for even the archangels.\u201d Jason\u2019s eyes tracked the two women as Neha hit out with the whip and Nivriti dodged, her speed unnatural. \u201cDid your mother also have power over snakes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, birds.\u201d Her fingers spasmed on his as the poison whip came within what looked like a hairsbreadth of Nivriti\u2019s face.</p><p>Suddenly the sky was full of fire. Their wings crisped, angels screamed and fell, crashing onto city roofs. Jason knew that while their bodies might be broken and burned, the majority would survive. So long as the head remained attached to the body and the flames were extinguished before they reached the internal organs, the charred, blackened remains would continue to breathe, continue to suffer.</p><p>\u201cNeha\u2019s new ability,\u201d Mahiya whispered.</p><p>The fire winked out as quickly as it had exploded across the sky, but Nivriti\u2019s troops had been decimated, though Nivriti herself had been fast enough to avoid the cauldron of flame. Now, she did something with her hands and a web of acidic green identical to Neha\u2019s poison whip snapped out to wrap around the archangel, wings and all.</p> <p>Neha fell.</p><p>Right when it appeared she\u2019d crash onto the burning city below, she snapped the bonds, halted her descent, but Nivriti did not relent, continuing to entangle her in that clinging green web. It seemed to Mahiya that she heard Neha scream in rage as the archangel broke the bonds again and again before releasing the poison whip once more.</p><p>Nivriti dodged, wasn\u2019t fast enough this time, and the poison touched the edge of one wing. However, contrary to the known impact of the poison on ordinary angels, she didn\u2019t sicken and fall. Instead, she shot higher into the sky.</p><p>Neha followed, her wings ablaze with power, her hands wreathed in green. Nivriti turned, dropped a net of green filaments that wrapped around Neha, encasing her entire form. The archangel struggled, a fly caught in a web, and again she fell, but this time, the green turned white and cracked off her in pieces brittle as glass.</p><p>Ice.</p> <p>The second aspect of Neha\u2019s new abilities\u2014but like the fire, it appeared limited, for the archangel did not attempt to freeze her opponent out of the sky.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d Mahiya leaned into him, his wing sliding protectively over her own. \u201cMy mother should be dead, shouldn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Yet Nivriti continued to evade Neha.</p><p>A moment later, she did more than that. She threw the sticky web at Neha once more. Clearly confident she could neutralize it, Neha made no effort to dodge the net. But this time, the green strands blazed incandescent, and the archangel\u2019s scream was of such agony that every fighter in the sky froze in place.</p><p>Mahiya reached out a hand, to whom she didn\u2019t know. It just seemed terribly wrong that they should kill one another. Because Neha, flames licking around her body, had broken the trap at the last second\u2014and Mahiya\u2019s mother was close enough that she couldn\u2019t avoid the strike of the poison whip.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a direct hit, but it did damage.</p><p>Mahiya stifled her cry of loss, but Neha didn\u2019t follow the strike with a deadly second hit, her flight path erratic. \u201cShe\u2019s badly injured.\u201d Impossible\u2014Neha was an archangel. And yet . . .</p><p>Fire licked the sky again, fell onto the city to set more of it alight. The sticky green threads her mother flung out in return, one of her wings dragging, missed Neha to alight on that same city. Screams rose up from the ground, eerie and anguished, the city beginning to glow orange as the flames took hold.</p><p>Mahiya\u2019s blood filled with horror, a ravaging need to do something gripping her throat, images of the toymaker\u2019s innocent son circling in her mind. Right when she would\u2019ve spoken, Jason spread his wings. \u201cI must stop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Between them, Neha and Nivriti would devastate the city and keep going, both too angry and enraged to give up, though it was clear they were injured enough that it might yet be lethal. Ignoring the hows and whys of how her mother could\u2019ve harmed an archangel, she squeezed Jason\u2019s hand. \u201cWe need to stop this. For now, these are my people and I will not let them burn.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d readied herself to fight, but Jason touched her jaw in a fleeting, unexpected caress before giving a curt nod. \u201cNeha\u2019s side is in as bad a position as your mother\u2019s. Seeing her hurt demoralized them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have value as a hostage again.\u201d Mahiya nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll stick close to you.\u201d It bloodied her to think of Jason hurting in order to protect her, but as he understood her need to do this, she understood he was a man who would never allow his woman to go into danger unaccompanied and unshielded.</p><p>Mahiya?</p> <p>That tenderness again, something she never heard in his physical voice.</p><p>Yes?</p><p>Do not get hurt.</p><p>It was an order, followed by a hard kiss that left her breathless. Intending to pull her weight, Mahiya picked up the crossbow she\u2019d dropped, along with a case of ten spare bolts she hung over her arm. She\u2019d purloined an old crossbow from the guard several decades ago, on the rationale that unlike swordplay or hand-to-hand combat, it was something she could teach herself.</p><p>In the intervening years, she\u2019d had to steal replacements, but her plan had worked. She\u2019d managed to sneak in target practice in the mountains at least twice a month until her last crossbow broke five weeks ago. I\u2019m no expert, she said to Jason, but I usually hit my target.</p><p>Good. I\u2019ll need you to watch my back.</p><p>With that unexpected statement, he led her on a low flight path over the blistering heat of the city, until they were positioned between Neha and Nivriti. She\u2019d assumed he\u2019d fly up to where they fought, somehow attempt to stop the battle, but he drew his sword, pointed it downward. A second later, black lightning crackled along his arms and over the hands he had fisted around the hilt of the sword, and she realized he was shoving his midnight power down through the conduit of the blade.</p><p>A trickle of sweat poured down his face, his biceps rigid . . . and shadows began to coalesce throughout the city, thick and heavy, snuffing out flame, stopping agony. People screamed at the river of soft black until they saw it sheath burning victims, smother the flames before moving on. Then they tried to direct it to their own homes and shops, but the shadows were driven by the mind of an angel whose body contained a level of power that stunned, and they went where they were most needed.</p><p>To people. To animals. To buildings in which living beings were trapped.</p><p>When an openly aggressive fighter arrowed toward Jason, she didn\u2019t hesitate or bother to wonder to which army he belonged. Lifting the crossbow, she put a bolt through his wing, sending him into an uncontrolled spiral that ended with him crashing into a burned-out roof. Mahiya winced but notched a second bolt into the bow, and when the next aggressor headed their way, she took aim and fired.</p><p>Maybe she was no fighter, but she would not permit anyone to hurt Jason.</p><p>She\u2019d just dispatched the second angel before he could fire his own crossbow, when Jason shuddered and raised his sword. \u201cThe worst fires are out,\u201d he said, his voice a rasp.</p><p>Wonder at his strength, the way he\u2019d used it to save, not harm, had her throat thick with emotion. \u201cYou\u2019ve given them a fighting chance.\u201d She could see fire trucks pouring water over the buildings that continued to burn, people racing to the lake to create a chain of buckets.</p><p>Jason\u2019s face was drawn as he turned to her. \u201cKeep shooting at anyone who comes at you, and wait for my signal.\u201d With that, he flew straight upward to hover between the two warring women.</p><p>Trusting his skills as a warrior, she didn\u2019t argue. Please be careful. A single strike from either the poison whip or her mother\u2019s acid green web, and he\u2019d crash to his death, but he didn\u2019t so much as flinch when the twins hit out at one another, the strikes passing inches from the edges of his wings. As Nivriti recovered to throw another strike at Neha, only for it to veer toward Jason when her arm faltered, he deflected it with a ribbon of black flame that seemed an extension of his sword.</p><p>Now, princess, he said and her title sounded like an endearment. They\u2019ve exhausted their energy for the time being.</p><p>41</p><p>Mahiya pumped her wings upward, making certain to keep to her mother\u2019s side of the battle line, so as not to provide Neha with an easy target. Jason gave her an almost imperceptible nod when she reached him, and she knew he was relinquishing the reins, an acknowledgment that she knew the players far better than he did.</p><p>\u201cYou are destroying the city,\u201d she said to Neha. \u201cYou are killing your own people.\u201d</p><p>Wings continuing to glow, Neha looked down, frowned, and waved a hand. A thin layer of ice formed over the places where the noxious green of Nivriti\u2019s web had begun to bubble through roofs and walls . . . and people. It froze, then seemed to break off in inert pieces. Neha waved her hand again, but the fires Jason hadn\u2019t smothered continued to burn, the archangel\u2019s ability to create ice apparently exhausted.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only fatigue that marked both women.</p><p>Neha\u2019s wings and body bore raw wounds from the same acid, her cheek gouged on one side to reveal her jawbone, her left wing sporting a palm-sized hole that would\u2019ve crippled most angels. Meanwhile, blood of near black seeped from Nivriti\u2019s nose and ears, even the corners of her eyes, the poison in her bloodstream attacking her from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cYour forces are decimated,\u201d she said to her own mother, wanting Nivriti to turn around, to see how many of her people were dead or viciously injured. \u201cAnd you are fading.\u201d</p><p>Nivriti swept out a hand, the burst blood vessels in her eyes having turned her gaze crimson. \u201cGet out of the way, child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not the child here.\u201d Mahiya held her position, speaking to them both. \u201cYou are at a stalemate, and soon, you\u2019ll be wrestling each other on the ground with the mortals watching as they would a circus act.\u201d</p><p>Frozen silence from both Neha and Nivriti.</p><p>Then her mother started to laugh, and it was awash with near-manic delight. \u201cThat would certainly not do for your vaunted dignity, sister dearest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would suit you very well\u201d was Neha\u2019s cutting response, grooves of pain bracketing her mouth as one of the minor tendons in her left wing appeared to give way. \u201cYou have ever wanted to perform.\u201d</p><p>Nivriti shrugged, wiped her bloody nose on her sleeve. \u201cAt least I did not believe a great act for truth and take a man who did not love me as my consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you only bore his child and stayed faithful while he rutted like a tomcat.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had the strangest feeling of being caught in the middle of a sibling squabble. Except this squabble had already cost hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives. \u201cMy father,\u201d she said with a deliberation designed to offset their emotion-fueled dialogue, \u201cwas a man beautiful enough to enchant a heart of stone, but he was not strong, was not worthy of either one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter speaks the truth.\u201d A great bitterness in Nivriti\u2019s expression, an ugly thing that could eat a person up from the inside out. \u201cI did you a favor, sister. He was lifting the skirts of one of his no doubt many whores inside your fort when I came to rescue him. So I returned with a few gifts.\u201d</p><p>Neha hissed and snapped out the poison whip, but weakened as she was, it didn\u2019t go far. \u201cIt was not your place to render judgment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou dare say that?\u201d Nivriti attempted to spray her with the acid, failed. \u201cAfter you played judge and jury?\u201d</p><p>Jason, you must speak. They won\u2019t listen to me, no matter how much sense I make. The fact was, they dismissed her as a child. Their pride is the weakest point for both.</p><p>Jason stirred. \u201cIf you wish to duel to the death,\u201d he said in a quiet, steely voice that demanded attention, \u201cwe will get out of the way, but in your current condition, you will end up wrestling on the ground, amusement for the mortals. I am certain no archangel or angel has died so ignominious a death.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>Then Nivriti raised an arm and the remainder of her troops formed around her, even as Neha\u2019s own troops stood down. The archangel\u2019s lips twisted into a cold smile. \u201cRun while you can, little sister. I\u2019ll make sure we meet again.\u201d</p><p>Nivriti\u2019s responding smile was as dark as the blood dripping from her eyes. \u201cBe assured I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d With that, she swept around, her troops closing behind her in a black guard. Mahiya.</p><p>Mahiya started at the command from her mother, but that shock was nothing to when she heard Jason\u2019s voice in her mind. Go with her. It is the safest place for you.</p><p>She wanted to argue, wanted to shake him, tell him her place was by his side, but he was already turning toward Neha. Far more, she realized, was in play than the needs and desires of a princess who had never had a kingdom to rule or a man to love, until she gave her heart to an enemy spymaster with wings of midnight.</p><p>Even so, he could\u2019ve taken an instant to reassure her that he would find her.</p> <p>Agony wrenched through her at the sight of him getting further away with each wingbeat. Biting her lips, she stilled the urge to call out after him. She\u2019d already laid her heart at his feet\u2014she would not beg. Because while she didn\u2019t expect Jason, his scars soul deep, to love her as she loved him, she understood he must choose to be with her free of any other consideration.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough, would never be enough, if all he felt was a responsibility to watch over her because she had no one else. Now that the latter was no longer true . . . Swallowing, she reached out one last time with her mind and set him free. Take care of yourself, Jason.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s squadron parted to allow her into the center, closing behind her to form an impenetrable wall.</p><p>Jason forced himself not to turn and watch after Mahiya. He knew that at this moment, he was the known, the familiar. If he asked her to come with him, she would. Once she\u2019d spent time with Nivriti, however. . . .</p><p>No, he would not steal the familial relationship she had the chance to forge, not even if it caused an agonizing hollowness inside him to lose the mental connection with her as she flew out of range, protected by her mother\u2019s people. He would give her time and space enough to decide if she wished to walk beside him now that her life had a whole new dimension.</p><p>Having flown escort to Neha while Rhys made certain of Nivriti\u2019s retreat, he kept an eye on the archangel\u2019s damaged wing as she brought herself in to land in front of the Palace of Jewels. When she dipped to the side as she came in, he deliberately landed too close to her, so that her stumble would be blamed on his clumsiness rather than taken as a sign of weakness by the others landing around them.</p> <p>Pride, as Mahiya had said, was an integral component of Neha\u2019s nature.</p><p>Righting herself by pushing off his body, she ignored him as she entered her private apartments, but he knew that to leave now would be to undo any good he\u2019d done. So he walked out to the courtyard to help deal with the injured\u2014just because angels and vampires were hard to kill didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t hurt. A man who knew how to inject morphine and other pain relief medication was always useful in battle conditions.</p><p>When Neha\u2019s private guard summoned him two hours later, the courtyard was close to cleared, the injured moved into internal rooms. Taking his leave of the healer under whom he\u2019d been working, he entered the palace to find Neha seated on the thronelike chair at the head of the central room. The archangel had bathed and was dressed in fresh clothing, her wounds bandaged.</p><p>Those bandages told him both that the wounds were healing at a far slower rate than they should\u2014and that Nivriti was no longer an ordinary angel.</p><p>\u201cSo, now you are a peacemaker?\u201d Neha\u2019s tone was dangerously neutral.</p><p>\u201cYou are one of the more rational archangels,\u201d he said, and in spite of her acts after Anoushka\u2019s death, the words were true. \u201cTo lose you would create more problems than it would solve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly how rational do you believe me to be?\u201d A subtly calculated look.</p><p>\u201cEnough to take and use what Lijuan could teach you about accelerating the emergence of your new abilities,\u201d he said, \u201cwithout allowing yourself to fall into her web.\u201d It was a wild shot in the dark.</p> <p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Neha said in a sinuous whisper, \u201cwe come to it. That was why you were so eager to assist me, was it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a spymaster.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s smile was cold. \u201cAnd to ask you to act in any other way would be akin to asking an eagle not to eat a rabbit.\u201d Picking up a baby eyelash viper that had slithered across the floor to her, she draped it over her shoulders, absently stroking its yellow orange skin. \u201cYes, Lijuan has been most neighborly of late.\u201d</p><p>Jason could guess. The trauma of Anoushka\u2019s death had left Neha prime pickings for a predator like Lijuan. \u201cI have wondered one thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>Neha raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhether Lijuan can somehow siphon power, or is attempting to learn how to do so, from others in the Cadre.\u201d It was a theory so nascent, he hadn\u2019t even mentioned to Raphael. \u201cHer offer to assist you would then make more sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Neha rose and walked down the shallow steps below her throne to shake her head. \u201cSuch a waste that you will never rule. Yes, the helpful Lijuan thought to play me.\u201d A flash of teeth. \u201cBut she forgets, I have played this game for millennia, too, and I know how to get what I want.\u201d</p><p>Jason was near certain there was, in truth, no true secret to accelerating the development of power, that Lijuan had simply taken advantage of the Cascade effect. At least nine thousand years of age, she\u2019d had millennia to mine the Refuge library for such secrets, even had she not come into her power at a time when several Ancients yet sat on the Cadre. They could well have told her of the Cascade.</p><p>Such a plan would befit the Archangel of China\u2019s intelligent, devious mind, but to bring it up now would be to make Neha look the fool, so he kept his silence and considered his report to Raphael. Though he couldn\u2019t speak of the Lijuan\u2013Neha connection, he could now discuss Neha\u2019s new abilities\u2014her display over the city had made them public.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to keep my favor, Jason,\u201d Neha said, sari whispering along the carpet as she walked to the window that looked out over the courtyard garden, \u201cyou will discover how Nivriti was able to do what she did, and then you will tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do that and I become part of your personal war. Raphael would not be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always do what pleases Raphael?\u201d</p><p>Jason knew the arch question was meant to prick his pride, but the fact was, he served Raphael out of choice, not compulsion. \u201cI will leave your territory tonight,\u201d he said, his tone even.</p><p>Neha\u2019s wings flared, the indigo filaments catching the light, before folding neatly to her back as she turned to hold his gaze. \u201cTell me, when did you gain the ability to use shadows in such a fashion?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, for she could expect no answer. The truth was, what he\u2019d done tonight was only one aspect of his strength\u2014he could use the black lightning in a far more violent way. \u201cDo you wish me to carry a message to Raphael?\u201d</p><p>A sigh, a faint smile. \u201cTell him his spymaster\u2019s faultless service has made me rethink our quarrel. I say Raphael is no longer my enemy.\u201d She allowed the viper to crawl down her arm, twine itself over her skin. \u201cSafe journey, Jason. I will attempt not to hurt Mahiya too badly when I find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will attempt not to hurt Mahiya too badly when I find her.\u201d</p><p>Jason understood Neha\u2019s words had been meant to torment him. It wasn\u2019t the first time someone had attempted such, but it was the first time they had found their mark. No matter his decision to give Mahiya time with her mother, he knew that was not what he was going to do, even if part of him said he used Neha\u2019s taunt as an excuse.</p><p>Flying high and fast, he made certain no one tracked him from the fort. Only when he was dead sure he was alone in the skies, did he come down on the dawn-lit grasses of a jagged mountaintop, the biting winds attempting to rip his hair from its tie. Ignoring the chill whip of air, he took out his cell phone and put through a call to Raphael.</p><p>Raphael was quicker than Neha, perhaps because he\u2019d been directly impacted by the events of that spring. \u201cThe world was in tumult when Caliane rose to wakefulness,\u201d he said the instant he heard of Nivriti\u2019s ability to harm Neha. \u201cThe chaos was put down to the disruption caused by her waking, but what if it was the confluence of two events, the reappearance of an Ancient concealing the emergence of an archangel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the same,\u201d Jason said, recalling the violent storms that had hit the world, the sea rising in a fury, the plates of the earth shifting, ice falling when it should\u2019ve long thawed, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t sense the same depth of power in Nivriti that I do the Cadre.\u201d The prickling consciousness of being in the presence of something other.</p><p>\u201cAnd Neha would\u2019ve known if her sister had become Cadre,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cOne archangel always recognizes another\u2014but from what you say, it appears she is in the dark about the origin of Nivriti\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It could be that as Neha\u2019s twin, Nivriti has a capacity to harm her that no other angel possesses\u2014along with a certain resistance to Neha\u2019s own abilities.\u201d Twins were beyond rare in the angelic population, and Neha was the first archangel he knew of who had been born with another. \u201cWe have no guideline against which to judge the bond that ties them to one another.\u201d</p><p>A short pause. \u201cShould Nivriti believe herself Cadre, she\u2019ll seek to join our number soon enough,\u201d Raphael said thoughtfully. \u201cUnlike Neha, the rest of us are not disadvantaged by a blood connection\u2014it\u2019ll take but a single meeting to answer the question of her strength. For now, continue to have your people keep a watch on her, on them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d Ending the call, Jason turned his ear to the wind, listening for the fading echoes of a retreating army . . . and the shimmering, stubborn hope of a princess whose presence he missed tucked against his mind.</p><p>42</p><p>Mahiya didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected of her mother\u2019s base, but it wasn\u2019t a fortified palace complex hidden in a mountain valley a bare four hours away on the wing. However, it made perfect sense\u2014Nivriti couldn\u2019t have covertly flown a fleet in the dark over a much longer distance. The vampiric ground troops, their journey longer, had traveled to the city in vehicles that wouldn\u2019t stand out on the roads and now retreated in the same fashion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They brought with them the dead and the less critical of Nivriti\u2019s injured, Rhys and Nivriti\u2019s senior general having negotiated a short window in which the fallen could be retrieved. While Nivriti was constrained to depart the city immediately, she\u2019d sent half her angelic battalion to the ground\u2014supervised by Rhys\u2019s men\u2014to rescue and carry home the worst injured, vampires and angels both. That unit was approximately two hours behind them, the ground vehicles almost half a day.</p><p>This complex, Nivriti told Mahiya after they landed in the predawn dark under the watchful eye of the small squadron she\u2019d left to stand guard, had once been hers\u2014and was now again. \u201cNeha allowed it to fall into ruin.\u201d A pleased statement. \u201cThe surrounding village dried up without the palace\u2019s custom, and so the area is a barren, forested wasteland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA perfect place to hide an army.\u201d Entering the palace, Mahiya took in the ancient tapestries, as well as the paintings that had been created using the walls themselves as a canvas\u2014of elephants and horses ridden by sword-wielding vampiric warriors, and angelic maidens shy of smile but with weapons in their hands.</p><p>The once brilliant colors were now pale ghosts, the jewels worn by warriors and maidens both dull rocks. It was clear the tapestries and the carpets that covered the stone floor were as old as the paintings, but the surviving pieces had had the dust beaten out of them to reveal works of faded splendor. The walls and floors of the palace itself had also been scrubbed until the beauty of the building, full of intricate carvings and lacework windows, made further adornment an indulgence not a necessity.</p> <p>\u201cNeha\u2019s greatest weakness has always been arrogance,\u201d Nivriti said after pouring a glass of water from a nearby pitcher, drinking it down. \u201cShe has never believed I could be her equal, and so she left no guards on me or on the places that have always been, and will always be, mine.\u201d Words as hard as the stone of her stronghold. \u201cNow she has learned better.\u201d</p><p>An angel, his left wing dragging as a result of a burn across its upper half, walked in then. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sorry to interrupt, but we must talk about our defensive plans with so many injured.\u201d</p><p>Nodding at the male, Nivriti waved Mahiya away. \u201cGo find a place to rest, child.\u201d Her eyes dropped to the crossbow still in Mahiya\u2019s hand. \u201cYou will not need that here, but I\u2019m glad my daughter is not a useless ornament.\u201d With that, she was gone.</p><p>Mahiya took the chance to explore the palace. What she found was that it was as close to an impregnable fortress as you could get and still be a place that was clearly home for Nivriti and her people. High perimeter walls, but soft rugs on the floor. Weapons everywhere she looked, but a kitchen that permeated the rooms with mouthwatering smells.</p><p>When she made her way to a balcony at the back of the palace, she saw both a working well and healthy fruit and vegetable gardens inside the defensive walls. Though the skies were still gray, a vampire had already begun to work the gardens, and he told her the water in the well was sourced from an underground reservoir. \u201cNo way for anyone to poison it.\u201d</p> <p>Such precautions wouldn\u2019t protect the stronghold against aerial attack, but the mountains around the valley were set up with ground-to-air weaponry Mahiya guessed had been hidden until the assault on Neha, and there was only one road leading in. It was a place meant to hold under a siege, she thought as she walked back inside the palace.</p><p>Though no one appeared to be paying attention to her, guards came out of nowhere to redirect her path when she tried to go down a particular corridor. They also took her crossbow, saying they\u2019d get it cleaned for her.</p><p>Using her best princess smile, she said, \u201cOf course,\u201d and left without argument.</p><p>It took an hour of watching and waiting, but the lingering guards were eventually called away on another task, and it took her but ten seconds to make it to the doors and through. The rooms beyond were locked with old-fashioned bolts and padlocks, bars on the small windows cut into the doors.</p><p>A sudden chill in her bones, she looked into the first window.</p><p>A bloodsoaked and unconscious angel lay within, his wings pinned to the floor by bolts pounded through the feathers, tendons, and muscle. Horror a crushing weight on her chest, she forced herself to walk to the next cell\u2014to find a vampire hanging from his wrists by thick chains, beaten and bloodied, his head slumped forward on his chest. She recognized them both from Archangel Fort. Neither was powerful enough to be immediately missed, but both were old enough to have knowledge of the inner workings of the fort.</p> <p>\u201cMahiya.\u201d</p><p>Having heard the tread of Nivriti\u2019s boots, she didn\u2019t startle. \u201cYou broke these people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeha would do the same to mine.\u201d Ice, rigid and brutal. \u201cShe did far worse to me.\u201d</p><p>It was at that instant that Mahiya admitted the thought she\u2019d nurtured in a secret corner of her heart\u2014that the murders of Eris and Audrey, Shabnam and Arav, had been an aberration, that her mother did not harbor the ugliness of cruelty in her bones. \u201cWill you release them now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nivriti reached through the bars to wrap that sticky green web around the vampire\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cMother, stop.\u201d She gripped Nivriti\u2019s hand, pulled, but it was too late, the substance already on the prisoner.</p><p>As Mahiya watched horrified, his skin and muscle and bone dissolved into bubbling white until the body fell away from the neck. The only mercy was that the male never gained consciousness. \u201cThat\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore merciful than what Neha would\u2019ve done to him had he crawled home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour power was to do with birds.\u201d It was the plea of a child desperate to save something of her dream of her mother. \u201cWith living things.\u201d Not this sadistic death.</p><p>The smile that touched Nivriti\u2019s eyes was tinged acidic green. \u201cThe ability died,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cBut buried in the earth, I found comfort in other creatures.\u201d She shifted to the cell that housed the angel. \u201cThey sacrificed their lives when I needed sustenance, and shared their strength with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Please!\u201d Again, Mahiya attempted to halt Nivriti as her mother\u2014almost desultorily\u2014flicked the deadly green web onto the angel.</p><p>But her mother was over three thousand years old, her power vast even in the aftermath of battle. It was an unequal contest, one Mahiya could not win. Trembling, she forced herself to watch, to remember this death, as the angel dissolved into nothing. He and the vampire both deserved epitaphs, both deserved not to be simply erased out of existence.</p><p>Sighing, Nivriti went to touch Mahiya, shook her head when Mahiya stumbled back. \u201cHow did you stay so soft under my sister\u2019s loving hand, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Because I didn\u2019t want to end up like her . . . like you. Her heart broke again, as she realized that some childhood dreams had no hope of ever coming true.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I am here to take care of you now.\u201d Nivriti looked over her shoulder. \u201cEscort my daughter to her room. She should rest.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya allowed herself to be shown to the clean and, by the standards of the palace, luxurious room. It was clear she was being given honor as Nivriti\u2019s child.</p><p>\u201cI am here to take care of you now.\u201d</p><p>Sitting down on the four-poster bed, grief a knot in her throat, she wrapped her fingers around one of the carved wooden posts that had been polished until they shone, and then she thought. About who she was, what she wanted to do with the immortal existence that stretched endlessly in front of her.</p><p>Regardless of what Nivriti believed, she was no child. She had fought for her freedom from an archangel. Jason had helped her achieve that freedom, and perhaps she wouldn\u2019t ever have gained it on her own, but even faced with seemingly insurmountable odds, even after a lifetime with an archangel who wanted to crush her spirit, she\u2019d refused to surrender. And with her spymaster, too, she was the one who\u2019d driven a bargain when she held but a single fragile card.</p><p>\u201cYou need to give me something in return. I can\u2019t surrender the most valuable piece of information I have without gaining something equally valuable in return.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d spoken those words, demanded he treat her need for freedom with respect.</p><p>But now, once again, she found herself in a prison. There were no locks, no ill will from Nivriti, but her mother had made it patent she saw Mahiya as a babe. Someone who\u2019d be kept safe in this palace, have her wings clipped, and be shut away or ordered into silence when it came time for the adults to talk. Protected from the harsh realities of life.</p><p>\u201cEscort my daughter to her room.\u201d</p><p>Already, Mahiya could feel an oppressive sense of suffocation constricting her rib cage. \u201cIt is too late, Mother,\u201d she whispered, and it was a decision she\u2019d needed to make before she could carry on with her life. \u201cI have not been a babe for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Sadness tore through her veins at all they had lost, the time they could never reclaim. But there was also a sweet, sweet relief, the leaden guilt in her stomach at the thought of abandoning Nivriti leavened by the knowledge that to build a relationship with her mother, she\u2019d have to leave her. It was the only way to force Nivriti to see her as a woman grown. A woman who loved a spymaster with wings of black.</p><p>Had Jason known? That had she flown away from Nivriti on the battlefield, she\u2019d have forever wondered what her life might\u2019ve been like with her mother? That her guilt at deserting a woman who had survived a nightmare, and who looked at Mahiya with love in her eyes, would\u2019ve been a constant pain in her chest?</p><p>Her lips curved, because of course he had\u2014Jason thought four steps ahead. Hope bloomed, but fingers tightening on the post, she forced herself to be rational, to remember he\u2019d parted from her without any indication he intended to find her again. Even if he did, he couldn\u2019t guess that she\u2019d have come to her decision, be ready to leave only hours after arrival. Loyal as he was to Raphael, he\u2019d most probably already left the subcontinent to make his report.</p><p>Which meant Mahiya was on her own.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, she stood and took stock of herself. She was a little tired from the flight to the palace, but not exhausted, as the army had moved at a slower pace to accommodate their injured brethren. Nevertheless, it would be smart to rest, regain her full strength\u2014except that she wanted to leave now.</p><p>Even the most loving restraints were still chains that sought to hobble her.</p><p>Departing now did give her one small advantage\u2014the secondary angelic unit, with their injured cargo, had arrived as she was being escorted to her room. Her offer of help had been declined, and from their condescending smiles, she was fairly certain it was because the guards thought she\u2019d faint when she saw the damage, never realizing the things she\u2019d witnessed in Neha\u2019s court.</p><p>Everyone else who could be spared was tending to the wounded, the palace\u2019s defenses the thinnest they would ever be. It was her best chance to slip away\u2014because the fact was, she didn\u2019t think her mother would simply let her go. Not when Nivriti believed her a child unable to care for herself. Mahiya\u2019s eyes burned, and she wondered if her mother\u2019s blindness was willful, if she tried to find the babe who had been stolen from her so very long ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Swallowing the wave of raw emotion, Mahiya pushed aside the curtains on the balcony doors, saw that the early morning sunlight was crystalline. She\u2019d be spotlighted against the blue sky . . . but no one had forbidden her from taking flight. Decision made, she walked into the bathroom and washed her face, tidied her hair into a tight braid, then opened the balcony doors and stepped out.</p><p>There were any number of angels outside, and one flew toward her at once, his wings a dyed black that told her he\u2019d been part of the assault. \u201cPrincess,\u201d he said with the curt courtesy of someone who had far more important things on his plate. \u201cHow can I serve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d just like to stretch my wings a little before I rest.\u201d Widening her eyes, she gave him a hesitant smile. \u201cI assume it\u2019s safe to fly in the area above and around the palace?\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019d wanted, he focused on the second question and didn\u2019t bother to wonder why she\u2019d want to stretch her wings after four hours of flight. \u201cAs safe as we can make it.\u201d Frowning, he directed a trio of angels with a complex set of hand signals. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m certain Lady Nivriti would prefer you remain safely in your quarters.\u201d</p> <p>He was a general of some kind, she thought. There was too much authority in his tone for an underling. Instead of obeying as he clearly expected, she straightened her spine and said, \u201cAre you ordering me to remain in my rooms?\u201d channeling the dead Anoushka at her spoiled best. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to put me on a leash and lead me around like a pet, too?\u201d</p><p>Weariness washed across the general\u2019s face, and she had to fight to keep from wincing in sympathy\u2014she wouldn\u2019t like to be dealing with this version of herself, either, especially after a battle that had cost him so many of his people. But if she didn\u2019t get out now, she could be stuck in this painful purgatory for weeks, even months, smothered by a maternal love blind to the truth of the life Mahiya had survived.</p><p>\u201cPlease wait,\u201d he said, not giving ground in the face of her outrage\u2014which meant he wasn\u2019t a general, but probably the general. \u201cI will find you an escort.\u201d Turning, he flew off to the left.</p><p>Well, that was stupid.</p><p>Snorting at his assumption that she\u2019d stay where she was put, she stepped off the railingless balcony, swept over the courtyard, and instead of spiraling out in wide circles, went straight up as she\u2019d seen Jason do so many times. If she could get above the fine layer of white cloud before anyone noticed what she was doing, she could confuse and maybe distract any pursuers long enough to get away.</p> <p>That pursuit came far sooner than she\u2019d expected, a brusque voice ordering her to descend. Older and stronger as he was, she knew the general would catch her in seconds, but she grit her teeth and continued to beat her wings upward, shoulder and back muscles straining until her tendons felt as if they might snap. Let him think her a spoiled brat\u2014it would plant the wrong idea in his mind, perhaps give her another chance later on\u2014</p><p>A sweep of black in front of her. Jason! She was so startled, she shot past him.</p><p>\u201cReady to leave?\u201d he asked when he came up to join her\u2014as if she had gone for an afternoon visit somewhere. Are you all right, princess?</p><p>She almost burst into tears at the piercing tenderness of his mental question. \u201cYes and yes,\u201d she said with a shaky smile, wondering if she would ever understand this man she adored. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I have acquired a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d Can you hold the hover?</p><p>Yes. Her body protested the abuse, but she\u2019d handled worse.</p> <p>Situating himself beside her rather than in front, Jason reached back and withdrew his sword, holding it casually at his side as the general reached them. The angel\u2019s eyes snapped from Jason to Mahiya, to the quiet threat of Jason\u2019s black sword, and he seemed to decide silence was the best policy. So they all looked politely at one another until her mother winged up to face her.</p><p>\u201cMahiya\u201d\u2014a whip of anger directed at an errant offspring\u2014\u201cI expect my child by my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Mahiya said with utmost gentleness, not wishing to hurt Nivriti, but knowing she had to force her mother to see the truth if they were to ever build a relationship, \u201cI haven\u2019t been a child for centuries. I was never truly allowed to be one. You know that.\u201d</p><p>In spite of the gentleness, Nivriti flinched. \u201cI will kill her for what she did.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya held up a hand. \u201cNo. Do not think to use me as an excuse in your war with Neha. I want no part of it.\u201d Heart twisting, she held that gaze so familiar and so alien. \u201cThree hundred and seven years,\u201d she said in a whisper that held a lifetime of lost dreams and shattering pain. \u201cThat\u2019s how long I survived\u2014I do not want to survive any longer, Mother. I want to fly.\u201d</p><p>A moment of utter silence before Nivriti\u2019s eyes slammed into Jason\u2019s. \u201cIf you do not care for her, spymaster, I will hunt you to the ends of the earth.\u201d With that violent threat, she and her general dropped back down to the palace.</p><p>Sliding away the sword, Jason turned to her. She truly does love you in her own way.</p><p>Enough to set me free.</p> <p>43</p><p>Four days after he\u2019d put her in it, Dmitri brought Honor partway out of her drugged sleep. \u201cDmitri.\u201d It was a sluggish question as he cradled her in his lap, but he heard the panic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the first blood kiss. Do you remember?\u201d He\u2019d told her every step of the process, so she wouldn\u2019t be afraid when she woke without full control of her faculties, his Honor who had once been held prisoner by monsters.</p><p>Her fingers curled into his chest, fear a slick sheen on her face. \u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor, baby, I can\u2019t bring you fully out.\u201d She was ripping him apart. \u201cPlease remember.\u201d He nuzzled and kissed the woman who made eternity worth living, holding her as tight as he dared, for her skin would be sensitive now, easier to bruise. \u201cI would never do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>A sigh against his neck, the panic subsiding, though her voice remained thick with the drugs. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Relieved until he could barely breathe, he allowed himself three precious minutes with her before he used one of his fangs to puncture his wrist and hold it up to her mouth. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t taste good now\u201d\u2014wouldn\u2019t until the transformation had had longer to take hold in her body\u2014\u201cbut you only have to take a few drops.\u201d</p><p>Honor wrinkled her nose but didn\u2019t fight.</p><p>\u201cVery not sexy,\u201d she muttered afterward and made him laugh, the tension leaching out of his body.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it gets sexier.\u201d Kissing her, he forced himself to lay her back down. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it done.\u201d She cuddled into his body. \u201cWant to be with you.\u201d</p><p>He reached down to reactivate the drug that would take her under once more. \u201cI\u2019ll be here, waiting for you when you wake again.\u201d He\u2019d waited near to a thousand years\u2014nothing would induce him to move from her side. \u201cSleep. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>44</p><p>Mahiya sat on the roof of the Angel Enclave house that was home to the Archangel Raphael and his consort, scarcely believing it had been but a week since she left her mother\u2019s palace. The city of shining metal and sparkling glass she could see across the water fascinated her, almost as much as the angel with hair of near-white who swept toward the roof.</p><p>Elena landed beside Mahiya with an open joy that made her smile. \u201cTen points for certain,\u201d she said, having played this game with the other woman earlier in the week</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being nice. I had to take an extra step to balance the landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine point three, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I\u2019ll take, even though you\u2019re still being nice.\u201d Folding those haunting wings of midnight and dawn, Elena took a seat. \u201cAre you waiting for Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s inside, talking to Raphael.\u201d Having grown up around an archangel, Mahiya wasn\u2019t affected by them as another angel of her age might be, but she never forgot that they were other and thus to be treated with caution. \u201cI came to admire your city so busy and bright, and to listen to the water.\u201d The river rushed past just beyond the cliff, and not far in the distance, she could see two water vessels about to pass.</p><p>Drawing up one knee, Elena hooked her arm around it. \u201cWill you stay?\u201d</p><p>Mahiya had considered that, ruled it out\u2014New York was dazzling, a beautiful city, but with jagged edges that overwhelmed. \u201cI think I would like to visit.\u201d Taste it in small bites. \u201cBut this is not my place.\u201d</p><p>Elena nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s not for everyone, my city, but I adore her.\u201d Undoing a lightweight crossbow from her outer left thigh, she placed it beside her on the roof.</p><p>\u201cWere you on a hunt?\u201d It astonished Mahiya that the consort to an archangel did such a thing, but it also astonished her how Raphael looked at Elena and how Elena looked at the archangel in return. The searing depth of their connection was something she\u2019d never expected, no matter what she had heard of their bonding.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was running a training session at Guild Academy. My turn on the roster.\u201d She lifted her face to the wind, and they sat in companionable silence for almost ten minutes before Elena shifted to look at her. \u201cJason,\u201d she said in a quiet voice, \u201cyou will look after him, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Mahiya said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t a man who needs anyone\u2019s protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Elena said, eyes of silver-gray incisive, \u201cI think he needs you.\u201d</p><p>Yes. The question was, would Jason allow her to give him what he needed, or would he shy, as a wild creature might? It wasn\u2019t the best of analogies, for Jason knew the ways of sophistication and civilization as well as any court male. Yet, he was not of them, part of him still that boy alone in the middle of an ocean. \u201cI feel such things for him,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthat it terrifies me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Elena said with a shoulder nudge. \u201cYou\u2019d never fit in our club otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the startling statement. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for those of us who are insane enough to fall in love with seriously badass men more sensible women would run from screaming. You\u2019ve now superseded Honor as the newest member.\u201d Elena grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you the secret handshake.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya laughed, and it was the laughter one shared with a friend. Elena was consort to an archangel, had access to power beyond imagining. She had no need to cultivate a relationship with Mahiya, and yet Mahiya knew why she did so. Not only because of an inherent kindness that had made her feel welcome from the first, but because Jason was one of \u201ctheirs.\u201d</p><p>Mahiya did not mind being adopted into such a family. There was joy here, loyalty, and best of all, no one wished to use her as a pawn in some political game. Oh, she had no doubts about Raphael\u2019s instincts, but she also knew the archangel would treat her with the courtesy due to the lover of one of his Seven.</p><p>Except she wasn\u2019t certain she was that lover, that her spymaster wasn\u2019t simply waiting for her to find her wings. Don\u2019t go, Jason. Words she\u2019d never say, chains she\u2019d never wrap around him, but oh, it hurt to think of never again feeling the rough heat of his touch, never again seeing that wild black fire in eyes of deepest brown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walking out of his study and onto the lawn, Jason by his side, Raphael headed for the edge of the cliff.</p><p>Hello, Archangel.</p><p>His lips curved. Hello, hbeebti. Glancing back over his shoulder, he saw his consort sitting on the roof with the princess Jason had brought home. The women had their faces turned toward one another, Elena\u2019s hair a white flame, Mahiya\u2019s ebony silk gathered neatly into a knot at the nape of her neck.</p><p>If he had ever considered the woman who would get through Jason\u2019s shields, it would not have been this elegant princess from Neha\u2019s land, with her flawless politeness and a personality that seemed a serene mirror without depth. And yet . . . Jason was his spymaster, skilled at seeing behind shields and beyond defenses. What do you think of Jason\u2019s princess? he said to his consort.</p> <p>That she has a will of iron, that she loves Jason with all her heart\u2014and that there is far more to her than either one of us will ever know, she said as he turned his attention back to Jason. Nothing strange about that. Only you know all the pieces of me.</p><p>As Elena knew him, he thought as he and Jason came to a halt on the cliff above the Hudson. So many discussions he\u2019d had with his spymaster on this very spot\u2014Jason didn\u2019t like being confined when he could be under the sky. \u201cThe princess,\u201d he said, \u201chas sanctuary here as long as she needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sire, but I think she can safely live in the wider world.\u201d Jason settled his wings. \u201cShe\u2019ll have to be careful, but I am of the belief that threats aside, Neha is too proud to break her word. As for Mahiya\u2019s mother, it\u2019s a relationship she alone can learn to navigate.\u201d</p><p>Raphael agreed with Jason about Neha. The archangel wasn\u2019t mercurial like Michaela\u2014honor meant a great deal to her, her own something she guarded. \u201cDoes the princess have somewhere to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael let the breeze brush his face, weave its fingers through his hair, and waited, knowing Jason had something else to say to him.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d Jason continued to look outward, toward Manhattan, his tone calm. \u201cI release you from your promise.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had lived a millennium and a half, had memories strong and weak. He remembered the exact day each of his Seven had sworn fealty\u2014Jason had been so young, and yet there had been a contained strength to him that had spoken to Raphael. He had known the boy would become a man of tempered steel. And he had known that steel had a fatal flaw.</p><p>\u201cI ask only one promise for my service.\u201d Words Jason had said, his skin smooth and bare of the markings that would begin to appear in another decade. \u201cI was not . . . formed correctly. Part of me is damaged and may one day shatter. When it does, I ask that you execute me cleanly rather than allow me to erode from the inside out.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had never asked Jason about his past, but he had put the pieces together, understood that his spymaster had survived a childhood that would\u2019ve left many too broken to function, and that he had scars that might never fade. Scars . . . and fractures. So he\u2019d made that promise, and he had hoped never to keep it.</p><p>Now, a cool wind kissed his skin, his blood, the weight of the promise lifting from his shoulders. \u201cI am glad of it, Jason.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to look out over the water, and just when Raphael thought Jason might speak again, he gave a near imperceptible shake of his head and kept his silence. Raphael didn\u2019t know if Jason had found peace of a kind at last, or whether that peace was only a glimmer on the horizon, but he hoped the black-winged angel would never again have cause to seek such a promise from him.</p><p>For even an archangel could mourn.</p><p>Mahiya was in Elena\u2019s greenhouse, gazing in wonder at the lush yellow flowers of a plant with wide leaves of spring green, when the door opened. She didn\u2019t need to turn to know who stood in the doorway\u2014her very skin seemed to sigh at his presence, her need for him a pulse deep within, for he had not touched her since before the battle. \u201cI think this is my favorite place in all of this land I have yet seen.\u201d Everything bloomed with life here, and there were no hidden aspects, no subtle politics.</p><p>\u201cYou can have a garden now if you wish.\u201d</p><p>Her smile burst out of her. \u201cYes, I can, can\u2019t I?\u201d It was a wonderful thought, and one she\u2019d put into practice as soon as she found a place to call home. Is your offer of a loan still open? Though he\u2019d been physically remote, she hadn\u2019t lost hope, for never once had he shut her out of his mind since the day he\u2019d allowed her in.</p><p>Of course. \u201cI have a house that may suit you until you decide otherwise,\u201d he added on the heels of the mental confirmation.</p><p>Turning, she leaned her back against the bench that held the pot with the yellow flowers, the plant waiting to be transplanted into the larger pot beside it. Jason stood just inside the doorway, his wings caressed by the curling green of a vine that poured from a hanging basket. He should\u2019ve looked too hard, too dark for this place, but somehow, he fit.</p><p>Wild, she thought, he is as wild a thing as these plants. They were only temporarily tamed by the greenhouse\u2014left on their own, they would sprawl and spread until the glass walls were a sea of green. Jason, too, was only tame when he wished to be, a storm held fiercely in check.</p> <p>\u201cIs the house vacant?\u201d she asked this compelling mystery of a man who had once sworn a blood vow to her. No . . . wait. \u201cJason, who releases the blood vow?\u201d His task had been for Neha, but it was Mahiya\u2019s blood through which the vow had been made.</p><p>He went so motionless, she could almost believe he was not there. \u201cThe party to whom it is made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know. Then I release you.\u201d She didn\u2019t want him tied to her by a forced bond of any kind. \u201cIs that all I need to say to do so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His stillness didn\u2019t abate. \u201cCaretakers alone live on the property,\u201d he said, answering her earlier question. \u201cTrusted vampires recommended to me by Dmitri\u2014they would be glad to see the house come alive again. They prefer to make their home in a separate building, but it\u2019s mere seconds away on foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe property, is it nearby?\u201d The gleaming city across from the Enclave wasn\u2019t right for her, but she didn\u2019t want to be so far from it that she couldn\u2019t nurture the fledgling friendships she\u2019d made\u2014with Elena, with a vampire named Miri who worked in the Tower, but who had been at the Angel Enclave house several times this past week. For a woman who had never been free to have friends, these were cherished gifts.</p><p>\u201cThree hours of flight at an average pace, ninety minutes if you push yourself,\u201d Jason said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large estate, enough that no one will be able to come upon you without running afoul of the security system but not so isolated that you need ever be alone should you wish for company.\u201d</p><p>It sounded perfect, but she had expected no less from the best spymaster in the Cadre, the man who knew people better than they knew themselves. But, did Jason know himself? Lips curving, she crossed the distance to him, put her hands against his chest, unsure of herself and of him in this new place, but unwilling to surrender the claim she\u2019d made.</p><p>His arm came around her without hesitation, his fingers splaying on her lower back. \u201cDo you wish to see the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It felt so good to be near him again. \u201cI am falling ever further in debt to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is no debt, Mahiya.\u201d His hand moved in a gentle circle on her back. \u201cNot between us.\u201d</p><p>Her heart kicked, and she wanted to snatch at his words, force him to explain himself, but such demands would never work with this man. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cyou must allow me to repay you in some way until I have the funds to clear the loan.\u201d She pushed off his chest just enough that she could look up into his face. \u201cMy home will be yours, so long as you wish it to be.\u201d</p><p>A flicker in his eyes, but his response was a quiet incline of his head, an acceptance.</p><p>The wickedness in her, born of the same will that had kept her personality her own all these years, stretched awake after a lifetime of restraint. \u201cSince I will not have enough money to repay any loan for years, perhaps I\u2019ll beg your indulgence with sensual favors.\u201d</p><p>Darkness shadowing his face, his hand falling away to leave her bereft. \u201cI would not ask such of you.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she cupped his face. \u201cJason, I\u2019m teasing you.\u201d She had never initiated a kiss, but encouraged by the way he\u2019d returned her touch, she did so now, sipping and tasting at those firm, beautiful lips until he held her again. \u201cAny sensuality I share with you is freely given, and always will be.\u201d</p><p>He pressed her closer to his body with the hand he had on her lower back, his free hand rising to angle her chin exactly as he liked, and then he took control of the kiss, stroking his tongue against her own in a caress that made her toes curl, the black fire of him a dark, beautiful thing. You should not tease me so, Mahiya.</p><p>Someone must. Heart racing at the sinful perfection of him, she tucked her feet between his boots in an effort to get closer and asked a question she felt too shy to do so out loud. Is the estate isolated enough that we can dance?</p><p>A fine, fine tremor slivered through Jason\u2019s powerful frame. No. But I know a place that is.</p><p>Good. Because she wanted to dance with her spymaster, the sensual erotic dance of angelic lovers that was part courtship, part a test of strength and skill, and\u2014if done right\u2014all pleasure. Never before had she trusted anyone enough to share herself in that way. I cannot wait to tangle wings with you, Jason.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, a hint of color on his cheekbones, Jason said, \u201cI\u2019ve created accounts in your name and transferred the funds you\u2019ll need to get on your feet.\u201d His tone was stripped of tenderness . . . but he continued to press her against him, his wings curved in protective display around her until all she saw was lush black. \u201cThe debt isn\u2019t due until you feel able to repay it, at an interest rate of zero percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d Laughing, she fisted her hands against his chest. \u201cThat is the most terrible loan I ever heard of\u2014you will lose on every account.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s expression was solemn. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t. Because so long as you owe me a debt, I will have a home.\u201d</p><p>Everything in her went quiet, even her pulse, time itself standing still. \u201cThen,\u201d she whispered in a voice raw with love, \u201cit is a debt I will never repay.\u201d</p><p>Before he\u2019d spoken, before she\u2019d understood the depth of his need, she would\u2019ve insisted on repaying the loan to the last cent as a sign of her independence. Now she knew this wasn\u2019t about money or about controlling her. Jason had had centuries to accumulate wealth. It meant little to him beyond the practical.</p><p>But a home?</p><p>That, he hadn\u2019t had since he buried his mother. Neither had she, the fort no safe haven for her. So she grasped what it meant to him to have a home, understood, too, that he needed the unambiguous link created by the debt.</p><p>One day, she thought, he wouldn\u2019t need that tie any longer, would come to accept he would always be welcome in the place that was their home. Then they\u2019d laugh over her long overdue debt, and perhaps she would tease her black-winged angel about having allowed a wet-behind-the-ears princess to tie him to such a terrible deal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until then, she would just love him. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>45</p><p>The estate Jason took her to was a vast sprawl of greenery broken up by wild bursts of color, the house of gray stone set within a multitude of gardens that had been allowed to run wild, the caretakers having far too much to do to wrangle the plants.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Delighted, she touched her fingers to a dew-kissed amber rose flowering defiantly without regard to season. \u201cThis is wonderful!\u201d Already, she could begin to imagine their new life here. \u201cOh, Jason, the house is perfect.\u201d No massive palace or mansion, just a dual-storied building meant to be a home, the stones warm in the lazy late-afternoon sunshine.</p> <p>The caretakers\u2019 residence, created of the same lovely stone, sat at a right angle to the house. \u201cI must see everything!\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t smile, not so anyone could\u2019ve seen it, but she felt his joy in the way he followed quiet and unhurried at her back while she explored the gardens. As yet, she didn\u2019t know what she would do with her freedom\u2014though she had a few ideas, excitement bubbling in her veins at the endless possibilities.</p><p>Turning to Jason, she admitted a secret. \u201cI always loved the horses Neha kept.\u201d</p><p>While angels could not comfortably ride horses, they could and did admire the beautiful, strong animals, and kept them not only for the vampires under their command, but as pets and to use in races run against the stables kept by other immortals. Mahiya had studied the subject for many years, because while Neha had taken away the mare she\u2019d called her own, the one thing the archangel had not begrudged her was learning.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, once I\u2019m settled, I could set up some stables.\u201d She\u2019d start small, become a student again. \u201cWhen I know more, I could try breeding them, but until then, I could offer to care for the horses of those vampires and angels who have no place for their pets in nearby cities.\u201d Immortals could be leery about trusting their horseflesh to mortals, as unfair as that might be. \u201cDo you know of anyone else who offers the same?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Being a custodian of animals would not be considered an exalted position by those of her kind, but what need had she of such a thing? No, she wanted only to live a life full of joy. She squeezed Jason\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a glorious start to an eternity I can\u2019t wait to live.\u201d With this man who made her heart beat and the future seem a dazzling promise.</p><p>Taking her hand, Jason tugged her around the corner to the back of the house, across the relatively tame herb garden . . . and to the stables beyond. Stables that had been cleaned and repaired until they were ready and waiting for use. Tears burned in her eyes. I shall have to work very hard to surprise you, spymaster.</p><p>You surprise me every day.</p><p>She somehow knew it was her love that surprised him, that he did not expect it, could not quite understand it. Swallowing her tears, she brought up their clasped hands and rubbed her cheek against the back of his. Will you stay?</p><p>Yes.</p> <p>Though the caretakers, both six-hundred-year-old vampires, were reserved in their joy, their delight at having the house become a home was clear. Jason watched as Mahiya won their loyalty with her quiet warmth and openness of heart, and he knew the dangerous pair\u2014trained in high-level offensive and defensive skills\u2014would watch over her when he had to be away. For a spymaster could not always stay in one place, and he wondered if Mahiya would understand that.</p><p>That, however, was a question for another day. Tonight, he dined with a princess who seemed to see no lack in him and who understood the words he didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, speak. Having already given the caretakers the night off, he and Mahiya played in the kitchen like children . . . until he kissed the nape of this woman who looked at him with love so bright, he could almost believe it wouldn\u2019t end in pain. She shivered, her body melting into his.</p><p>Knowing Mahiya wouldn\u2019t be comfortable outside the closed doors of their bedroom\u2014and it was their bedroom; she\u2019d made that clear by quietly moving his small bag from another suite\u2014he kissed her again before leading her up the stairs and inside. The caretakers had pulled the curtains before they left, but the stars burned through the skylight.</p><p>Shutting the doors behind himself, he stayed in place. Will you?</p><p>Her skin flushed and she ducked her head, before walking to the vanity and slipping off the bangles of jade green glass leavened with gold he\u2019d bought for her from the same shop where she\u2019d purchased several sets of new clothing, having come to New York with nothing but what she wore. He\u2019d forgotten to pick up her bag from the temple where she\u2019d dropped it, he\u2019d been so desperate to get to her, make sure she was safe.</p><p>Bangles clinking onto the vanity, she removed the simple gold hoops in her ears. A slow, deep breath as she shifted away from the mirror, her back to him, and reached up to undo the buttons at the top of her wings that held up a simple tunic of pure black embellished with green and silver embroidery along the mandarin collar. As he watched with a quiet possessiveness that built until it was a primal hunger within, she pushed off the tunic, even as she reached back to undo her hair to create a tumbling curtain of ebony.</p><p>Her legs were sleek and graceful when she pulled off the narrow tapered pants of a rich, deep green. Rising to her full height, she gathered her hair over her left shoulder in a move that sent a tide of color over her skin . . . and he saw she\u2019d taken off her last fragile piece of clothing when she removed her pants, the evocative beauty of her wings her only protection.</p><p>Breathing jagged and body rigid, he closed the distance between them to run one hand down the centerline of her back and around her hip to splay on her navel. When she whispered his name, he lavished a kiss over the rapid beat in her throat. Thank you, princess.</p> <p>Picking her up in his arms to her soft gasp, he carried her to the bed and laid her on her back, her wings spread in magnificent display. Her eyes slid away, hot red dusting her cheekbones, but though she fisted her hands in the sheets, she didn\u2019t attempt to cover herself. And when he began to undo the buttons of his shirt, those eyes returned to watch him with an anticipation that was a caress across his senses.</p><p>By the time he covered her body with his own, the need inside him was a craving that pulsed in every inch of his skin. Nudging her thighs apart, he settled between the silken limbs that slid around to lock at his back, a sweet, hot prison he had no desire to escape. He felt her slickness on his cock as she arched toward him, grit his teeth against the urge to surge into her. No matter how much he wanted to seal the bond between them in this new place with an act intimate and honest, he would not hurt her. Mahiya?</p><p>I\u2019m ready. She opened to his kiss without hesitation. Come inside me, Jason. I miss you.</p><p>Shuddering with hunger so deep it was painful, he took her at her word and began the slow, exquisite slide into her body. Her spine arched, her pleasure a living current that burned sensation over every inch of him, her hands gripping his arms, her legs keeping him captive.</p><p>Oh!</p><p>He buried himself to the hilt inside her as her passionate cry reverberated through his bones, his mouth demanding on her own. She gave him everything he asked for, and she made her own demands in turn\u2014subtle, feminine demands a man had to pay careful attention to hear, to sense, and that gave Jason a violent pleasure to fulfill.</p><p>Stroking his hand down the curves of her body, he cupped the back of one sleek thigh and rocked against her, pulling out a bare inch before pushing back in. She broke the kiss to suck in a breath, her head twisting on the pillow as her body undulated in perfect rhythm with his own, as if they had always been meant to be lovers.</p><p>When he fisted his fingers in her hair and retook her mouth, her hands slid over his nape to close over the sensitive arches of his wings in a caress that made him groan, her tongue dueling with his own. He pulled out a fraction more, rocked in harder, her breasts rubbing against his chest in sweet temptation.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, he rose up on an elbow and cupped one of the sensitive mounds. You are beyond lovely.</p><p>\u201cI happen to think I\u2019m not the pretty one in this bed, wild lover-mine.\u201d Husky, breathless words.</p><p>He held her cat-bright gaze, rubbed her nipple, once more tasted those lips that shaped such sweet words. Words that entangled, marked him, claimed him. Jason allowed the entangling, the marking, the claiming. For the first time in his life since he\u2019d buried his mother and destroyed what remained of his father, he allowed himself to belong to someone.</p><p>Then he loved her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t create light,\u201d Jason said to Mahiya sometime later as he lay on his back with her spread possessively over him, his hand on her lower back. \u201cOnly black fire.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Mahiya pushed up on the muscled silk of his chest to look at him. \u201cOf course you can\u2014you lit up the tunnels.\u201d</p><p>A long, steady look.</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cMe? That was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very strong, Mahiya Geet, and that strength will only grow. You must work on learning every aspect of your power.\u201d</p><p>Astonished and pleased, she sat up cross-legged beside him, her hair covering her breasts. \u201cWill you help me?\u201d It was so easy to ask him\u2014she knew he\u2019d never seek to hurt or humiliate her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, placing his hand on her lower back again, strong and hot. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m not here, I will ask the others in the Seven to come by as often as they can, so your development does not suffer. Raphael, too, is apt to take it upon himself to check on your progress.\u201d</p><p>That, she hadn\u2019t expected, but then, Raphael and Jason had a relationship unlike any she\u2019d seen Neha have with her courtiers and advisors. \u201cI suppose I shall have to become used to having the most powerful of visitors.\u201d Butterflies in her stomach, born of happiness not worry.</p><p>\u201cAfter I\u2019ve had time to settle in,\u201d she said, \u201cand Dmitri has returned with his wife, we should invite our friends for dinner.\u201d She rather thought she would like to do such things, would like to have their home filled with the laughter of friends who were family. \u201cElena will enjoy the gardens.\u201d</p><p>Jason moved his hand to play with strands of her hair, his knuckles brushing the tip of her breast with each pass. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to have two such dinners,\u201d he murmured, continuing with the lazy caresses that made indolent pleasure curl through her veins. \u201cThey can\u2019t all be out of the city at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that,\u201d she said with a laugh, because they both knew she hadn\u2019t considered it. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I have to learn and explore, Jason.\u201d Excitement bubbled like champagne in her blood.</p><p>Coming up over her as she dropped back onto the bed, Jason pushed the sheet gently to her waist, his fingers making a swirling design on her hipbone that rippled a shiver over her frame. \u201cIf you ever decide,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthat you wish to explore other\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pressed her fingers to his lips, held that storm-dark gaze. \u201cI may have been stuck in the fort, but I wasn\u2019t cut off from the world. Thousands of vampires and angels of all ages and levels of power passed through it in the years of my existence. Not one spoke to my heart.\u201d Moving her hand, she cupped his face. \u201cI know the man with whom I want to grow, want to explore the world. You. Only you.\u201d She would have no misunderstanding on that point. \u201cAnd I plan to seduce you so thoroughly, you will become my devoted slave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason\u2019s lips curved in the most subtle of smiles, and it was a kick to her heart, a treasure beyond price. Who is to say I am not already your slave, princess? Tender amusement in her mind. After all, here I lie, my body ravaged by your passion.</p><p>Laughing softly in delight at the fact that her spymaster was teasing her in return, she reached up to trace the swirling black of a tattoo that spoke of lands of white sand and blue seas, palm fronds waving in a balmy breeze while seagulls fought overhead and jewel-bright fish darted in the shallows. \u201cWill you tell me the story of this one day?\u201d she asked in the intimate murmur between lovers as he settled himself between her thighs once more, his weight braced on his forearms.</p><p>\u201cIt was to remind me I was alive,\u201d he said, the words stark. \u201cI felt so little a part of the world at times that I wasn\u2019t certain I wasn\u2019t a shadow in truth, a phantom who made no impact, had no place. The pain, and the indelible mark of that pain, told me I lived, that I was a person.\u201d</p><p>Angry sadness twisted within her, but rather than darkness, she gave him a smile. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, rubbing her foot over his calf, \u201cnext time you want to feel alive, come home and drag me into a bedroom.\u201d She nuzzled at his throat, her skin flushing. I can\u2019t believe I just said that. Truly, I am becoming shameless where you are concerned. It is most disturbing.</p> <p>Bending his head, his hair sliding around his face as his body slid into her own, Jason said, I won\u2019t tell, his quiet laughter more precious to her than a million faceted gemstones.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Mahiya had always known Jason would have to leave\u2014a spymaster could not remain in one place. Though he\u2019d done very well to have information at his fingertips the past two weeks they\u2019d spent entangled with one another as they set up their home.</p><p>\u201cNeha and Nivriti appear to be holding their truce for the time being,\u201d he\u2019d told her a week ago. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to predict what either one will do\u2014theirs is a unique battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mahiya had seen the love behind the hate, seen the need to touch behind the need to annihilate. \u201cI wonder if deep down, they didn\u2019t want to kill one another, if that\u2019s why they both ended up injured but alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Now, seven days after that conversation, her lover stood waiting to take his leave, heading to parts unknown for how many days, she did not know.</p><p>\u201cI may not be able to contact you every day,\u201d he said, the man who had woken her with a kiss this morning buried beneath the obsidian steel of the spymaster. \u201cBut I will as often as I can\u2014and should you not be able to get in touch with me, call Raphael or any of the Seven. Or if you\u2019re more comfortable speaking to the women, Elena and Jessamy will both be able to get their hands on any relevant information.\u201d</p><p>This man, she thought as he spoke, would never tell her he loved her, would never give her flowers and pretty romance. He might never even admit either to her or to himself that she mattered to him in a way that was no simple sensual connection but a heart bond that made her chest ache.</p><p>But, what did she need of words and flattery? She\u2019d grown up around lies and illusions, whispers and insinuations, the thousand intrigues and romances of a living court. Eris had said he loved Neha over and over, and he\u2019d told Nivriti the same thing.</p><p>No, words did not matter to Mahiya, never would.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said to Jason\u2019s instruction. \u201cI have everyone\u2019s numbers.\u201d Putting her hands on his shoulders, she rose on tiptoe to claim a kiss to hold her until his return. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you while you\u2019re gone,\u201d she whispered against his lips afterward. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, I\u2019ll be most displeased.\u201d</p><p>His fingers spread on her lower back, his head bent over her own. \u201cI\u2019ll return home as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Tears clogged her throat at his acceptance that this was his place now, his haven. Stepping back, she twined her fingers through his. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the edge of my hill.\u201d It was a joke, the rolling hillock of land barely deserving of the name, but she\u2019d insisted on calling it that\u2014until she\u2019d woken up two days ago to find a neatly carved wooden sign on it, proclaiming the rise \u201cMahiya\u2019s Hill.\u201d</p><p>It made her smile and fall impossibly deeper in love with him each time she saw it.</p><p>Jason\u2019s wing brushed hers as they walked through the gardens, the wild roses scenting the air in sultry perfume, the sunlight warm on her face. Her mother lived and was a lethal creature she didn\u2019t wholly understand. Neha might yet plunge her region into war. Lijuan was stirring again, and darkness shadowed the horizon.</p><p>And yet this moment, it was perfect.</p><p>All too soon, they were at the edge of the silly little hill, and Jason\u2019s fingers slipped from her own. Neither of them spoke as he spread his wings and took off, his feathers shimmering jet in the sunlight, his strength magnificent. Instead of rising high up above the cloud layer as he usually did, he did a wide sweep above her . . . and then she heard it.</p><p>A voice so pure, it had no match. So clear and exquisite that the birds went silent and the wind sighed, held in thrall. Her heart, it twisted and broke, reformed, the ache so deep, it had no end and no beginning. She didn\u2019t know she\u2019d gone to her knees, was crying, until salt water seeped into her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cThe only songs in my heart were ones that made the Refuge drown in tears. So I stopped.\u201d</p><p>This song was not meant for the Refuge. It was meant for Mahiya. And the tears she shed, they carried no sadness. Because she\u2019d been wrong. Her wild storm had just told her he loved her, the piercing joy of his song branding her as indelibly his.</p><p>I\u2019ll be home soon, princess. </p> </body></html>"]
