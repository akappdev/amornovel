He\u2019d been widowed over five years ago when his kids were twenty-six and fourteen. Now that he was sixty-two, the kids were on their own. Vanessa was married to Paul and they lived on the property on the other side of the stable, and Tom had nearly completed his first year at West Point. Walt\u2019s niece, Shelby, had been staying with him, but during the February freeze she had left to vacation in Maui before pursuing her education in San Francisco.</p><p>But that only scratched the surface. He\u2019d recently begun a relationship with his neighbor, a beautiful, vivacious, mischievous movie star just a few years younger than he was. Muriel St. Claire. Their liaison was just getting interesting, just heating up, when she was lured back to Hollywood to make another film. He was left with her two Labrador retrievers and her two horses. He\u2019d had one phone call since she\u2019d departed for L.A. via private jet, a call in which he had heard the background noise of a party. There was music, chatter, laughter, the clinking of glasses, and Muriel sounded on top of the world.</p><p>The truth of the matter was, he\u2019d gone and fallen in love with her. She had trapped him by being nothing like his perception of a movie star. She\u2019d come to Virgin River almost a year ago, moved into an old farmhouse with her animals and restored it, almost entirely by herself. He\u2019d never seen her in anything but slacks, usually jeans and boots, often painter\u2019s overalls. She was a crackerjack horsewoman, an expert shot and was training her own bird dogs for hunting waterfowl. Earthy. Basic. Yet her wit was sophisticated and her beauty natural and unforgettable. And right now, while he sat by the window in his great room, scratching her dog behind the ear, she was making a movie with Jack Nicholson. The truth? He wondered if she\u2019d come back.</p> <p>His doorbell rang and he hefted himself up to answer it. Two weeks ago he\u2019d felt like a sixteen-year-old boy, looking forward to seeing Muriel every day. Today he felt old and short on time.</p><p>He opened the door to Luke Riordan and frowned. This was just about the last person he\u2019d like to see right now. Luke and Shelby had had a romance that didn\u2019t work out, which Walt suspected was her reason for leaving.</p><p>\u201cMorning, General,\u201d Luke said with a slight nod. \u201cGot a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he said, standing back from the door. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, sir,\u201d Luke said, stepping into the house. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014 Well, I owe you an apology.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat so?\u201d Walt asked. He turned and walked back into the great room. The dogs spied Luke and immediately put the rush on him. Luce, the chocolate Lab, sat in front of him politely, but her tail wagged so violently it sent her whole body into a quiver, while Buff, less than a year old, lost all control and just barreled into him, jumping up and head butting for attention. \u201cBuff! Down!\u201d Walt admonished. It didn\u2019t do much good. The yellow Lab was pretty much out of control where visitors were concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Luke laughed, grabbing the Lab behind the ears and sitting him down. \u201cGot yourself some company here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are Muriel\u2019s dogs. She\u2019s out of town and I\u2019m taking care of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of town?\u201d Luke asked, straightening.</p><p>Walt sat in his chair and clicked the dogs back to his side by snapping his fingers. He didn\u2019t volunteer any more information about Muriel\u2019s whereabouts. With a Lab on each side of him, he indicated the chair facing his. \u201cTake a seat, Riordan. I\u2019m anxious to hear about this apology.\u201d</p><p>Luke took his seat uneasily. \u201cGeneral Booth, sir, I\u2019m the reason Shelby left a little over two weeks ago. I apologize, sir. She had every reason to think her future wasn\u2019t secure with me and she left.\u201d</p> <p>Walt settled back. Shelby was twenty-five to Luke\u2019s thirty-eight and Walt had been concerned that his niece\u2019s involvement with this tough-edged Blackhawk pilot might end with her being hurt. \u201cHow does that not surprise me?\u201d Walt said churlishly.</p><p>\u201cI let her go, sir. I thought she might be better off. I hated to think she\u2019d bet everything on someone like me.\u201d</p><p>Walt smirked. He couldn\u2019t have put it better himself. \u201cI should\u2019ve just shot you,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave it serious thought.\u201d</p><p>Luke couldn\u2019t suppress a huff of silent laughter. \u201cI figured you did. Sir.\u201d Luke hadn\u2019t been out of the army quite long enough to relax about that rank thing. The general was a general till he died and was accorded appropriate respect, even when he acted like a son of a bitch and threatened Luke\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cYou should be apologizing to her, not me,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken care of that, sir. Unbelievably, I\u2019m forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. She came back. She was pissed as hell, but I threw myself on her mercy and she\u2019s given me another chance. I plan to do better this time.\u201d</p> <p>Walt\u2019s eyes had grown wide and his bushy black eyebrows shot up high. \u201cShe\u2019s back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. She said to tell you she\u2019d be right over. She had something to take care of and I wanted a word with you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo apologize,\u201d Walt groused. \u201cI\u2019d like to see my niece, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here pretty soon. But there\u2019s another thing. I\u2019d like your permission to ask Shelby to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Walt ground his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re really pressing your luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know the half.\u201d Luke chuckled before he could stop himself. \u201cAlmost thirty-nine years old and I\u2019m buying into the whole program. It\u2019s not even one of her conditions\u2014it\u2019s one of mine. General Booth, she\u2019s everything to me. I can\u2019t live without her. I thought I could and I tried, but it\u2019s too late for me. I\u2019m in love with Shelby. I\u2019m going to be in love with her for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Walt was sitting straighter. He moved to the edge of his chair. \u201cWhat about her education? What about a family? I think my niece wants a family and I heard you say that wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably heard me say a lot of things I thought I meant and didn\u2019t, sir. Shelby can have anything she wants, do anything she wants\u2014I\u2019ll support her. I\u2019m not going to waste her time, sir. If she\u2019ll marry me, I\u2019ll give her everything I have, go anywhere she needs me to go. She won\u2019t ever again leave my house thinking I don\u2019t care about her. That could have been the biggest mistake of my lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Walt smiled in spite of himself. \u201cLearned your lesson, did you, boy?\u201d</p><p>Luke didn\u2019t mind so much being called a boy by this military icon, but the truth hit him pretty hard. \u201cOh, man,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Walt leaned back. \u201cI like seeing you humbled a little bit, Riordan. What if I withhold my permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll ask her anyway. I\u2019ll tell her you disapprove and ask her to overlook that. But I\u2019d like to do this right, sir. I\u2019ve made enough mistakes\u2014I don\u2019t want to make one more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Walt hummed. \u201cI guess I can still be surprised....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t figure you for intelligence.\u201d</p><p>Luke just shook his head. Well, this was no less than he deserved. He\u2019d taken the general\u2019s niece into his bed, telling her he just wasn\u2019t the kind of man who could settle down. He used every rationalization he could think of to make that all right, but he knew all along that was going to be real tough for the general to swallow. He also knew if Shelby were his niece, he wouldn\u2019t have stood for it. Now Walt was obviously going to torture him for a while. Luke supposed it was his just due.</p><p>The front door opened and Shelby breezed in. Both men shot to their feet, but Luke got to her first, slipping an arm around her waist. \u201cTake care of everything?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said, smiling up at him. \u201cI got off easy.\u201d Shelby had left Virgin River without saying goodbye to Luke\u2019s helper, Art. That in itself wasn\u2019t such a crime, but Art was a thirty-year-old man with Down syndrome and things like disappearing without an explanation or goodbye could seem like abandonment to him. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t angry with me\u2014just worried.\u201d</p><p>Then she went to her uncle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call and let you know I was coming back, Uncle Walt. I had business to take care of with Luke first.\u201d</p><p>Walt looked at her beautiful, shining face. Her hazel eyes glowed, her cheeks were flush with love. But looking at Shelby wasn\u2019t the startling part. One look at Luke told the rest of the story. Luke had always had that bad-boy edge, an aura of danger and a short fuse. No more. All the rough edges had been ground down and his expression was docile as a puppy.</p><p>Walt just laughed as he pulled Shelby into his arms. He hugged her fiercely. \u201cShelby, Shelby,\u201d he said. He held her away from him and, grinning, he said, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve tamed him. He doesn\u2019t have any fight left in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could take much more. He\u2019s been a real handful. But Luke still needs a little work, so I\u2019m going to be staying with him now. I\u2019ll be over to help you with the horses every day, just like always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of horses. Muriel\u2019s out of town and I\u2019ve got the dogs and horses.\u201d</p><p>Shelby reached down and gave each Lab a little scratch. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone back to Hollywood for a while. Going to make a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Shelby asked, grinning hugely, her eyes lighting up. \u201cWow. How awesome.\u201d</p><p>She would find that exciting news, Walt thought. He had told Muriel she had his devoted support in achieving everything her heart desired, but in fact he wasn\u2019t feeling real supportive. He was feeling jealous and lonely and out of sorts. And this news about Shelby and Luke just added to his misery.</p><p>He shook it off. \u201cLuke?\u201d he asked, looking at the man. When he had Luke\u2019s attention, Walt gave his chin a firm nod. And that was all it took to make Luke Riordan\u2019s eyes light up as though beacons shone from within.</p><p>At 1:00 a.m. the phone rang next to Walt\u2019s bed. He thought first of Shelby; she\u2019d thrown her lot in with Luke and Walt hoped nothing had gone wrong. He thought next of Vanessa, Paul and little Matt, his grandson. Young Tom crossed his mind\u2014but a middle-of-the-night phone call from West Point was highly unlikely.</p><p>\u201cWalt?\u201d came Muriel\u2019s voice before he could gather his wits and say hello. \u201cDarling, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I know what time it is.\u201d</p><p>Darling? Did she call him darling? Oh, those Hollywood types probably called everyone darling. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said sleepily. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m okay. This is honestly the first chance I\u2019ve had to call in days. But it\u2019s not going to stay this crazy. I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everything. The production company has been staging small parties in key places all over town, trying to create some preproduction buzz about the movie by having cast members show up. I\u2019ve been researching the character, spending some time with the writer, rehearsing lines they\u2019ll only rewrite the second I have them down, looking at wardrobe and set sketches with the production designer, and generally going out to lunch, drinks, dinner, drinks, and talking till midnight. Then I fall into bed and sleep like a dead woman till 5:00 a.m. when I get up and jump on the treadmill.\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s the treadmill got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI have to be in good shape. And I don\u2019t have the dogs or horses to help me do that. I hired my old trainer back to firm things up a bit. I know it doesn\u2019t sound like it, but I\u2019m working my ass off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, stop going out for all those drinks and you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stick to club soda when I\u2019m meeting with actors, producers, promoters, et cetera. They\u2019re not catching me with my pants down.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and felt instant shame for having baited her like that. And pride; she was a consummate professional\u2014he should have known that. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby came back,\u201d he said.</p><p>Silence answered him. \u201cShe did?\u201d Muriel finally asked in a shocked breath.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. And apparently Luke did enough groveling to satisfy her, because she\u2019s moved in with him. And this morning he paid me a visit, asked my permission to propose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of town! Did you grant it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I told him to go to hell. I should have just shot him. I told him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d like me to believe you\u2019re that kind of bully, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe silly girl seems to love him. And you should see him. Whipped into shape that fast. I bet if we pulled up his shirt, there would be lash marks all over his back. He\u2019s limp as a noodle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s not,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cWell, good for Shelby. That maneuver never worked for me. When I stomped off into the night, they just said, \u2018Okay, bah-bye.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Jack Whatshisname like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to say his last name?\u201d she asked with a deep sigh.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice man. Professional, punctual, talented, and very much enjoys the way people fall at his feet. And they should. He\u2019s got the gift. I like him. I think working with him again will be a good experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwhen are you coming home?\u201d</p><p>Equally soft, she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Walt. And yes, I miss you.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s bar was the place in Virgin River where the locals gathered. Not that everyone was there every night, but you could always count on seeing a friend there. There was a military backbone to this community since Jack Sheridan, a Marine who\u2019d done his twenty, had opened the bar. Following him to the town was one of his best friends, John Middleton, known as Preacher, who was his partner and the cook at the bar. Next to arrive was Mike Valenzuela who\u2019d served with Jack in Iraq twice and was now the town constable. Walt\u2019s son-in-law, Paul, was one of Jack\u2019s boys from way back and had also served with him twice. Even Luke Riordan, being ex-army, was welcomed into this brotherhood. It was the kind of place Walt felt he belonged.</p><p>Since Muriel had left, he\u2019d been going low profile, generally fixing himself a little dinner at home by himself. Since talking with her for a while last night, he was feeling a little more secure about things and decided on Jack\u2019s for dinner. In fact, he got there a bit early, before the dinner crowd. The TV perched high in the corner was on so Jack and anyone who cared could keep up with the news, with the action in Iraq.</p><p>Jack was toting his son David in the backpack while he served. \u201cGeneral,\u201d he greeted. \u201cGood to see you, sir. Been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it has,\u201d Walt said, hopping up on a stool. \u201cWhat do you hear from Iraq?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRick writes at least every couple of weeks. He doesn\u2019t scare me, but CNN and Fox News make me shiver. There were just a couple of big bombings over there. Casualties on our side.\u201d</p><p>Jack had a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who\u2019d entered the Marine Corps at eighteen and after a year of special training, had deployed to Iraq. The boy was like a son to Jack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get a kick out of this, sir. I\u2019m getting computer literate. E-mail is sometimes quick and easy for Rick when he\u2019s near a computer and I don\u2019t want to miss out on anything. Preacher\u2019s been after me for years\u2014he has the books on the computer. And of course Mel needs one at home. So...I\u2019ve finally had a conversion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome aboard,\u201d Walt laughed.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve been spending time with the neighbor lady.\u201d Jack put the general\u2019s preferred brew in front of him without being asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, Muriel has left town for a while and I\u2019m taking care of the dogs and horses.\u201d Walt said this with a touch of pride. The studio contract had provided for help with her dogs on location and someone to stay at the farmhouse and take care of the horses, but Walt didn\u2019t want these valuable extensions of Muriel in the hands of strangers and had asked her to trust him to do the job. \u201cShe\u2019s gone back to Hollywood to make a movie. I imagine she\u2019ll have long weekends here and there, but it\u2019ll probably be close to six months before they\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding?\u201d Jack said. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-ho,\u201d Walt said, sipping his beer. \u201cOne minute she was considering a script she described as having possibilities for her if the right people were involved. The next minute I was driving her to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy exact reaction,\u201d Walt said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with her a couple of times. She\u2019s hard at work. And the animals are fine.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled. \u201cGives you some time on your hands, then.\u201d</p><p>Walt just nodded. It was hard after all these years to regress. He\u2019d forced himself to get used to living a single man\u2019s life after his wife died. In fact, he had never expected to find another woman to fill that space. But once Muriel had, it astonished him how quickly he got used to female companionship. And not just any companion, but a woman who seemed perfect for him. While she was here, riding, shooting, hunting, refurbishing her house, he realized they were made for each other. But the minute the call came from Hollywood he began to think he\u2019d been ridiculous to imagine they had anything in common. It was so easy for her to pack up her cosmetics and dainties, board a fancy Lear and take off for another kind of life.</p><p>\u201cI saw Shelby and Luke the other night. They came by for a beer and a take-out dinner. Looks like things are back on track there,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Walt said. \u201cDo they look content?\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned toward him. \u201cIn every sense of the word,\u201d he said. Then he laughed. \u201cTook Luke lots longer to bite the dust than I gave him credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want Shelby to be in good hands,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cOh, General, there\u2019s no question about that. Luke gave up the fight.\u201d And he grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s all hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter be,\u201d Walt growled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind shooting him.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed at him. Walt put the fear of God in a lot of men, but there was no evidence he\u2019d actually done any physical harm. However, he had enough hot air in him to float a balloon.</p><p>Only a moment later, Mike V came in the back door and sat up next to Walt. Then came Paul, whose approach was always signaled by the banging of his muddy boots on the porch before coming inside. Walt remembered why this place soothed him; a few men enjoying a beer at the end of the day, Jack with his coffee cup\u2014male camaraderie. And then Mel came in, the baby tucked under her coat.</p><p>After she said hello to everyone, she asked Mike, \u201cBrie coming out to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. She\u2019s going to get the baby settled early, if possible. Little Ness likes to burn the midnight oil.\u201d</p><p>Mel looked at Paul. \u201cVanni?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cVanni\u2019s cooking tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Abby?\u201d Mel asked, speaking of their houseguest.</p><p>Paul shook his head. \u201cCameron\u2019s taking her over to Grace Valley for an ultrasound, and he offered to take her to Fortuna for something to eat afterward, just to get her out of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI knew he had an errand and I\u2019m on call till he gets back. That\u2019s nice of him to do for Abby.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded. Then with a semitortured look he tried to conceal, he turned to Walt. \u201cVanni mentioned Muriel\u2019s out of town, sir. Would you like some dinner?\u201d</p><p>Walt looked him up and down shrewdly. Paul had his wife all to himself for a change and was going to begrudgingly invite her father to join them? \u201cI don\u2019t think so, son. Though the deep sincerity of your offer touches me.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed but for an indignant Paul. \u201cAw, come on, I was really nice about that! Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a peach,\u201d Walt said, knowing he was getting a little grumpy. \u201cI\u2019ll just sit here and have dinner with Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Muriel, Walt?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>He was tired of explaining about this, and it hadn\u2019t been all that long. \u201cMaking a movie,\u201d he said unhappily.</p><p>\u201cReally? How exciting! Since she was looking forward to a long break from that, it must be quite an important film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so she says. Jack Whatshisname is the star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack What\u2019s... Jack who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Big star. Cuckoo\u2019s Nest guy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholson? Holy shit,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cMelinda, we were going to stop saying shit in front of the kids,\u201d Jack patiently reminded her, glancing over his shoulder toward David in the backpack.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, I forgot. But, Walt, that\u2019s really something, isn\u2019t it? I mean, he\u2019s huge. This must be a thrill for her.\u201d</p><p>Walt got a fairly dangerous gleam in his eye. \u201cI suppose she\u2019s thrilled to the heart of her bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no wonder you\u2019re so pissy,\u201d Mel said with a laugh. \u201cJack, since everyone\u2019s clearing out, I\u2019m going to get some dinner from Preacher to take home. I\u2019ll get the kids fed and settled. Can you sneak away quickly if I get a call? Since Cameron\u2019s headed for Grace Valley, I need to be on call for medical emergencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Mel,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019m going home, I\u2019ll back you up. If you get a call before Jack locks up, just holler. I\u2019ll walk over and sit with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mike. Jack? Want to help me get loaded up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, babe. Let me get this little guy into his jacket and I\u2019ll give you a hand. Walt, I\u2019ll have your dinner in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a beer to finish.\u201d And wounds to lick, he thought.</p><p>Cameron Michaels found himself in a very unique position\u2014trying to court a woman who was pregnant with his twins. They met a few months ago in Grants Pass when a series of strange circumstances brought them together. It was a night of unforgettable bliss. Neither of them thought they\u2019d ever see the other again.</p><p>He\u2019d been at the Davenport Hotel Steak House because that\u2019s where he and the partners in his former pediatric practice liked to have dinner together every other month or so and she was there for one of her best friends\u2019 wedding. Nikki Jorgensen had married Joe Benson and the reception was at that hotel; Vanni was the matron of honor and Abby an attendant. One thing led to another and Abby fled to the hotel bar to escape all that true love and mush at the reception. Cameron had no idea some of his friends from Virgin River were in the banquet room when he met Abby in the bar. It was a fling\u2014the kind of fling Cameron thought he\u2019d outgrown and Abby had never before in her life considered. And of course it had to lead to pregnancy, something they were both carefully trying to prevent.</p><p>When she came to Virgin River to sit out her pregnancy, Cameron was the last person she expected to run into. But Cameron had ties to Virgin River and loved the place. He had known old Doc Mullins, deceased a few months ago, Mel and Jack Sheridan, Vanni and Paul. He saw a chance for a change of lifestyle and decided to give Virgin River a year. No small part of that decision was the fact that he couldn\u2019t find the woman he\u2019d had a wonderful night of love with. How strange that he ended up in the same town she\u2019d chosen to hide out in. Cameron was certified in family practice and pediatrics and his service to Virgin River was invaluable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right now the complications in his relationship with Abby were extreme. Abby was in hiding because she\u2019d been legally married when she met Cameron, though she hadn\u2019t seen her husband in almost a year. The husband was a semifamous rock star who\u2019d had her sign a prenup promising fidelity or there would be no alimony. When the divorce was final, he\u2019d also left her with a hefty pile of credit-card bills and she needed his money to pay off his debts. If anyone found out she\u2019d conceived the twins before the divorce was final, she\u2019d be in a deep financial mess.</p><p>Cameron was trying to take it nice and slow. Abby had lots of reasons to fear rushing into a serious relationship. The first time she did that, she ended up married to an unfaithful jerk who tied her up with a binding prenuptial agreement. The second time she\u2019d thrown caution to the wind, she\u2019d gotten pregnant. With twins.</p><p>So Cameron had called her and said, \u201cMel would like you to have an ultrasound and meet Dr. Stone, the OB in Grace Valley. I thought maybe I could take you and then, if you\u2019d like, we could have dinner in Fortuna. Something simple and quiet. Just a chance for you to get out. And for us to spend an hour or two together.\u201d</p> <p>And she had said, \u201cThat\u2019s a very nice offer, but why don\u2019t I just take myself to Grace Valley, meet the doctor, have the ultrasound and come back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Abby, I\u2019d like to see the ultrasound.\u201d When that statement was answered with silence, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s typical for Mel to take an OB consult to meet John Stone\u2014he won\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual about me taking you. This can be our secret as long as that\u2019s what you need, but really\u2014we have to spend a little time together at some point. Talk, like we did before all this happened. Get to know each other. Again.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the reluctance in her voice when she finally accepted. What the hell? He\u2019d backed her into a corner. He knew the babies were his and he wasn\u2019t going to give them up. He couldn\u2019t force her into a romantic relationship, he wouldn\u2019t force her to acknowledge the relationship that produced the babies, but he wasn\u2019t going away quietly. They were his children. It meant a lot to him.</p><p>She meant a lot to him. But he couldn\u2019t make her fall in love with him.</p><p>Cameron arranged for the ultrasound to be scheduled for the end of the day, when John was done with his appointments. It would be logical to go have dinner after that. He picked her up at 4:00 p.m. and conversation was a little lumpy and strained on the way over. He\u2019d prepared a script: Tell me about growing up. I\u2019d like to hear about your flight-attendant years. What are your plans for after the babies are born?</p> <p>But none of that worked out because she took the conversation in another direction right off the bat. \u201cI need to tell you something, Cameron. Vanessa has guessed about our secret. She remembered that I slipped away from the reception and of course she knew you lived in Grants Pass. It must have been something in the way you looked at me or spoke to me, but she knew. She was very direct. She told me you were a good man and deserved a chance.\u201d</p><p>He was speechless. \u201cGod bless Vanessa,\u201d he finally said in a breath.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I trust her and I know she has good judgment, but that doesn\u2019t eliminate certain difficult facts. One, even though I slept with you, I don\u2019t really know you. We\u2019re probably highly incompatible. And two, I\u2019m still hung out to dry by a nasty little prenup. An unfair, diabolical prenup that was the closest thing to a swindle I know. And three, Vanessa is sworn to secrecy because I don\u2019t want anyone to know about us. I\u2019m pretty embarrassed about what I did. I can\u2019t afford to risk word leaking back to my rotten ex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cThat certainly spells it out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to protect these children to the best of my ability.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the front seat and gave her hand a pat. \u201cI really appreciate that, Abby. That\u2019s courageous of you.\u201d She looked at him and saw that his eyes had grown very dark, almost navy blue. And dead serious. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p> <p>And from there all the way to Grace Valley they traveled in silence.</p><p>John Stone was as cordial as he could possibly be, happy to see Cam and delighted to meet Abby. They talked for a while about how he\u2019d like to follow the pregnancy closely, along with Mel, because he assumed the babies would come early. It was important to be sure the babies were in position for a vaginal birth, and ultrasounds would be required. John didn\u2019t want her to be too far from a neonatal intensive care unit if they came too early or if a C-section was required. He asked her to step up her appointments for caution\u2019s sake.</p><p>And then he set her up for the ultrasound. \u201cLittle early to determine the sex of the babies. Do you want to know if it\u2019s obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Sure,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He\u2019d barely gotten started when he laughed. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he chortled. \u201cRight out in front, we got ourselves one boy. He\u2019s blocking the other one, but in a couple of months they\u2019ll be bigger, move around a little more and we\u2019ll get a better view.\u201d</p><p>And Cameron, who had seen and done so much medically, especially where children were concerned, began to lose the edge of control he\u2019d always managed to maintain. His eyes clouded; his heart pounded. A son! Oh God, a son! He tried to blink back the emotion, but couldn\u2019t seem to stop it. He grabbed Abby\u2019s hand and squeezed it. \u201cLook, Abby,\u201d he said in a whisper. \u201cThat one in front, the bossy one taking over, it\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>Thank God she was emotional, too. It might take the focus off him. \u201cMy God,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey look perfect,\u201d John said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re on target for July second, but if we make thirty-six weeks, we\u2019re in good shape. They look good, Abby.\u201d He was poking her belly, trying to get them to move around, directing the wand to check their internal organs, their limbs, their skulls. \u201cI\u2019m going to have Mel draw some blood, check for things like Down syndrome, spina bifida, a few other genetic abnormalities. But there\u2019s no reason for you to be less than completely optimistic.\u201d</p> <p>She looked up into Cam\u2019s eyes, he looked down into hers. Both of them had tears on their cheeks. Cameron gently wiped hers away.</p><p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d John said.</p><p>Cameron looked up. \u201cListen, John, whatever it is you think you might know, you don\u2019t know anything. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything in this clinic is confidential,\u201d John said. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Abby and Cam said in unison.</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d John said. \u201cYou have at least one boy on the way. And my lips are sealed. But damn\u2014those are some good-looking babies.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. How about you?\u201d</p><p>The first ten minutes of the car ride from Grace Valley to Fortuna for dinner were silent but for the sound of Abby\u2019s completely irritated, shallow breathing. Finally, through clenched teeth, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that!\u201d</p><p>He knew exactly what he\u2019d done. \u201cI was overwhelmed.\u201d No apology, no further explanation.</p><p>\u201cAnd now Dr. Stone knows!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? I\u2019m the father!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me your word that you wouldn\u2019t divulge! You said it could be my secret as long as I wanted it to be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa knows!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she guessed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd John guessed when I got tears in my eyes at the sight of my son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my son! You\u2019re just a sperm donor who wanted a quick roll in the hay with some chick you met in a bar!\u201d</p><p>Cameron drove a few hundred yards and then slowly pulled off to the side of the road. He turned the car around and headed back in the direction they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d she retorted. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me!\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest and glared out the window into the deepening dusk. And it was a long, long ride back to Virgin River in silence.</p><p>When Cameron got to Walt\u2019s property, he didn\u2019t go immediately down the road toward Vanni and Paul\u2019s. He stopped the car as the road veered around the back of the stable. He turned off the ignition and pivoted in the driver\u2019s seat, facing her. \u201cDo you remember the night we met, Abby? And the conversation we had before going to the room? It was about that list you had\u2014the one about what you were looking for in a man?\u201d</p><p>She glowered at him and nodded, grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cAn important item was manners. You might want to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Cameron\u2014you got me into this mess and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had help,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cLots of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take me home. Please,\u201d she said just as firmly.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. You need to listen to me now. Pay attention, Abby. If being considerate and accommodating isn\u2019t going to work with you, I can change my approach. Regardless what nasty twist you put on things, I never intended to be a sperm donor. Nor was it my idea that we never see each other again after that night we spent together. I looked for you. I wanted more time with you. I never saw it as a quick roll in the hay. That was your doing when you disappeared on me, refused to contact me, even though you promised you would.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important that you understand something,\u201d he went on. \u201cI\u2019ll try to work with you as much as you allow me to, but if you try to separate me from my children, I\u2019ll fight. I\u2019ll come after you. I\u2019ll launch a search that will make Columbus look like a novice. So don\u2019t even think about pulling something sneaky. Whether you like it or not, we\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me home. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019d really like to go home.\u201d</p><p>He turned back toward the road and pulled around the stable to the front of Vanni and Paul\u2019s house, Abby\u2019s current residence. When she went to jump out of the car to flee, he grabbed her wrist and held her back. She turned and looked at him with a little panic in her eyes. \u201cAbby, I can\u2019t make you like me, but I can make you allow me to be a father to my children. I know a hundred ways. Please remember that.\u201d</p><p>Without reply, she pulled her wrist from his grasp and exited the car. Cam watched her walk up the porch and into the house. He sat for a moment, took a deep breath and turned on the dome light to look at his watch. Just after six-thirty. Mel was on call tonight until he checked in, and there were seldom any calls. Doc Mullins had managed a forty-year practice on one whiskey at the end of the day and Cam needed one. Bad.</p><p>He turned around and headed for Jack\u2019s.</p><p>Abby walked into Vanni\u2019s house and leaned her back against the closed front door. Vanni and Paul were in the great room, both of them on the floor with the baby. She looked at the scene of domestic tranquility and burst into tears.</p><p>Paul and Vanni were both instantly on their feet.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Vanni said, rushing to her, Paul on her heels. \u201cWas the ultrasound all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful. Dr. Stone said they\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the world are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a fight with Cam,\u201d she said, tears running down her cheeks, her words caught on a sob.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d Paul asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cI was upset. He got all teary when he saw the ultrasound\u2014one of them is for sure a boy. I hated that he got emotional in front of John Stone and I lost my temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Abby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got emotional?\u201d Paul repeated, more confused. \u201cCameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni\u2014I called him a sperm donor! I was so mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Abby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSperm donor?\u201d Paul said, totally lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe laid it out for me, very seriously. Angrily. He\u2019s not getting out of my way on this. He\u2019s going to be a problem\u2014as if I don\u2019t have enough problems.\u201d She leaned toward Vanni and wept on her shoulder. \u201cHe said he can\u2019t make me like him, but he won\u2019t let me take the babies away from him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike him?\u201d Paul said. \u201cBabies? What the hell\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Vanni looked over her shoulder at Paul. \u201cCameron\u2019s the father\u2014don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Abby stressed tearfully.</p><p>Paul was quiet for a long moment while Vanni just held Abby, comforting her. Finally he found his voice. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be so hostile,\u201d Abby wept. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is, honey,\u201d Vanni comforted.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Paul attempted. \u201cWait a minute here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLong story, Paul,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019ll explain later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought they just met!\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cObviously they didn\u2019t just meet. Don\u2019t be a dimwit. I\u2019ll tell you about it later, after Abby gets calmed down.\u201d</p><p>Paul turned away from them and went to pick little Matt up from the floor where he played. \u201cMust be a long story,\u201d he muttered. \u201cVery, very long. Say, about five months long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, you\u2019re going to have to apologize,\u201d Vanni was saying. \u201cYou can\u2019t be like that to him. I mean, you don\u2019t have to be in love with him or anything, but you have to be civil. He has his rights. And he\u2019s not a bad guy. In fact, he\u2019s a very good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It just got under my skin that I\u2019m in charge of carrying these babies and giving birth to them and I still have no control! None! I just lost it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, when you tell him that, everything will be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, ladies?\u201d Paul said from behind them. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be at this a while, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Paul,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Abby erupted. \u201cYou were going to have sex! You were alone for the first time in forever and were going to have sex, and I came home early and ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, baby,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cWe can have sex anytime.\u201d</p><p>Paul ran a hand around the back of his neck. \u201cWell, actually...\u201d Having sex at all around here was a lucky shot, with a baby, a houseguest and the general popping in, something that would be happening more now, with Muriel out of town. Anytime was pure fiction.</p><p>Paul pushed little Matt at Vanni. \u201cKnow what? I\u2019m going to step out for a while. Go have a cup of coffee with Jack or something. You two get yourselves settled down. Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Vanni said, taking charge of the baby. \u201cProbably a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>As Paul was going out the door, Vanni was asking Abby, \u201cHave you eaten, honey? Let me get you a little something to eat and we can talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Cameron walked into Jack\u2019s and found at least a dozen people at different tables finishing up dinner. He sat up at the bar.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc,\u201d Jack greeted, slapping a napkin down. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Cameron said unenthusiastically. \u201cCan I have a scotch? Neat. Something good. Good and powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Long day?\u201d Jack asked as he turned to select a label that might do the trick.</p><p>\u201cIt got long. Don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll have some dinner and coffee and take your wife off the hook for on-call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have that all worked out, Doc. But I thought you had dinner out with Abby tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t exactly work out.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cThat should thrill Paul. He had the idea he was going to be alone with his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it was beyond my control,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDandy,\u201d he said. He lifted his drink. \u201cSwell.\u201d</p><p>Cameron hadn\u2019t even sipped his drink when Paul walked in. He sat next to Cam and put his elbows on the bar. \u201cWhat you got there?\u201d he asked Cameron.</p><p>\u201cScotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a Crown. Same recipe,\u201d Paul said to Jack.</p><p>Jack got down a glass and poured. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn you had plans for the evening,\u201d he said to Paul.</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d he said. He lifted his glass and took a drink. \u201cBut then Abby came home, having some kind of emotional crisis, and Vanni got all hooked up in that.\u201d Paul glared briefly at Cameron. \u201cLots of crying. Carrying on.\u201d</p><p>Cameron turned toward him. \u201cI did not do anything to bring that on,\u201d he said rather harshly. \u201cI was completely courteous. Thoughtful. I was wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI gather she brought it on herself. She said she lost her temper. Said some rude things. Mean things.\u201d He sipped. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to let it go, man. Cut her some slack. For being pregnant and out of her mind. You know?\u201d</p><p>Jack was leaning on the bar, listening closely to this conversation that was, thankfully, not overheard by other dinner customers. Only Paul and Cameron were at the bar.</p><p>\u201cI handled it the best way I could,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cShe said she feels like she has to do everything\u2014having the babies and everything\u2014and feels like she has no control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has no control?\u201d Cameron asked hotly. Then he laughed bitterly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, she\u2019s feeling real bad about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Cameron said. \u201cWell, guess what? I feel real bad about what she said, too.\u201d Then he looked back into his drink and sulked.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhat the hell could she have said?\u201d</p><p>Cameron looked up from his drink. \u201cShe called me an unkind name.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed at him. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a big boy. What could a little pregnant girl call you that would get you so riled up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about\u2014sperm donor,\u201d Paul supplied.</p><p>Cameron shot Paul an angry look. \u201cWay to go, dipshit. Anybody ever tell you you have a big mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Vanni said not to tell, I didn\u2019t think she meant you. I mean, you know. Right?\u201d</p><p>Cameron glanced at Jack.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Jack,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk. Well, he does, but when he has specific orders not to, he can manage to keep his mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Then Jack, caution drawing every word, said, \u201cNow, why in the world would she say something like that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Cameron said, pouting.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it makes you feel any better about things, Vanessa called me a dimwit for asking just about the same question.\u201d He took a drink. \u201cApparently we have ourselves a situation. Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Jack said, straightening up. He reached for another glass and tipped the bottle over it. Jack usually waited until closing to partake, but it seemed appropriate to commiserate with these two. \u201cWas everything all right with the ultrasound?\u201d he asked warily.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cameron said, sipping. \u201cBabies look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd at least one\u2019s a boy,\u201d Paul said, picking up his drink. After a swallow he found Cameron glaring at him again. \u201cWhat? I wasn\u2019t told not to tell that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a dimwit,\u201d Cameron patiently pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I\u2019m a dimwit who was going to get lucky once the baby was tucked in, until you got Abby all upset and crying and\u2014\u201d He stopped suddenly. He shook his head dismally.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, I propose a toast,\u201d Jack said, lifting his glass. \u201cLet\u2019s drink to silence. If this conversation ever leaves this bar, we\u2019re all going to die. Skinless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d the other men agreed.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jack said, \u201csince there\u2019s a pact of silence, I just want to know when this could have happened. How this could have happened.\u201d</p><p>Cameron put down his glass. \u201cThe weekend of Joe Benson\u2019s wedding in Grants Pass. And, in the usual way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t at that wedding,\u201d Paul pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI had dinner at the hotel restaurant that night. I met her in the bar. Now, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying about it. And if you let on to Abby that I said that much, my situation is only going to get more impossible. You follow me here, Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking over each shoulder to make sure they weren\u2019t being overheard, then leaning close to whisper. Jack, of course, leaned down to not miss a word. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant. You\u2019re the father. Anything come to mind there, bud? Like maybe marriage?\u201d</p><p>Cameron put down his drink impatiently. \u201cPay attention, Paul. I couldn\u2019t even get her to go to Fortuna to eat at a restaurant with me. She hates me. I was a perfect gentleman, back then and tonight, but she hates me. She called me a sperm donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d said Jack.</p><p>All three men lifted their glasses in misery.</p><p>Vanessa put water for tea on the stove for Abby and while it heated she put little Matt down in his bed with his bottle. When she got back to the kitchen, Abby was blowing her nose, wiping her eyes. While Vanni let the tea steep, she put some leftover roast beef, potatoes and carrots on a plate and warmed it in the microwave. She put the tea in front of her friend and left the dinner in the microwave. Vanni pulled herself a beer out of the refrigerator and sat down opposite Abby. \u201cDone crying yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Abby nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. My emotions were so crazy when I was pregnant, I don\u2019t know how anyone could stand to be around me. I was a complete wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be so ashamed,\u201d Abby said with a sniff. \u201cYou had it so much worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good bit of stress right now. Between being unmarried and having all those bills and that horrible prenup, it\u2019s small wonder you\u2019re a bit...reactive.\u201d</p><p>Abby blew her nose. \u201cI complain about having no control, then I lose control. It makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, I\u2019m not known for wisdom, I\u2019m best known for having the worst goddamn temper. Direct quote from my husband who has no temper at all. I want you to know, I\u2019ll stand by you and support you, no matter what your next move is. But, here\u2019s what I think you should do. I think you should go to the clinic first thing in the morning and apologize to Cameron. I think you should have a frank talk with him about how you two are going to manage parenting these children. You two only have to make one commitment\u2014that\u2019s to them. This can\u2019t go on. You\u2019re not going to let them go, and neither is he. You have to find a way to work together, whether you\u2019re friends or not. But so much better if you\u2019re friends. For them. Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just makes me so furious!\u201d Abby got out, another tear rolling down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so furious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he ended up here! That he found me out! That now, in addition to everything else, I have to find a way to deal with him! I just wanted to have my babies, take them to my mother\u2019s and get on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, Abby, you have no right.\u201d</p><p>Abby looked up, eyes wide and glassy, a tissue scrunched in her hand.</p><p>\u201cListen, I told you I knew Cameron before Paul finally stepped up to the plate and told me how he felt about me. Well, I can\u2019t say I knew him all that well back then\u2014we had two very platonic dates. But we did a lot of talking and I learned that he really expected he\u2019d be married with a family by now. He wanted a wife, children. He loves kids so much that he did a second residency in pediatrics. He\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I know all that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, just listen to me. We\u2019ve been good friends for a long time, you and me. We flew together, partied together, cried over the miserable losers we\u2019d hooked our hearts on together. When I think of some of the jackasses we thought we could turn into husbands... God, it makes me shudder.</p><p>\u201cAs your friend, I can be honest with you. And as my friend, you owe it to me to hear me out. Abby, you have no right. You have as much responsibility as he does for this situation you\u2019re in. And he has as much right as you to be a parent here. I think it would have been a tragedy for Cameron if you\u2019d succeeded in disappearing with his children. He deserves to be able to tell his family he\u2019s going to be a father. His mother deserves to know she\u2019s going to be a grandmother. It might be complicated and imperfect, but I bet it\u2019s one of the best things in his life right now. I think that if a problem arises in working this out so you can parent your children together, the problem will be you. Not him.\u201d</p> <p>Abby was speechless for a moment. \u201cWow,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s harsh, I know. But, Abby, that\u2019s the truth as I see it. You don\u2019t have to marry him, you don\u2019t have to love him, but you do have to let him be a father to his children. He hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. He doesn\u2019t deserve your rage. Kid Crawford, your sleazy ex-husband, you go ahead and hate him if you want. But I can\u2019t sit quiet while you punish Cameron. He\u2019s a good soul. And if he hadn\u2019t turned up here, running into you by the sheerest accident, I would consider it your responsibility to find him and tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>Abby leaned across the table toward Vanessa. \u201cListen,\u201d she said pleadingly, \u201care you sure you\u2019d be so sane and logical if you were in this mess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d Vanni said easily. \u201cIt might be hard to get to sane and logical, but I\u2019m not worried\u2014you\u2019ll eventually get there, yourself. Because Cameron won\u2019t ever do anything to hurt you. You\u2019ll at least share parenting, and he\u2019s so great with children, he\u2019ll be a wonderful father. Do you have any idea how many women wish they had parenting partners that wonderful? Get it together, Abby. You\u2019re stuck with this and it\u2019s not a bad deal to be stuck with. What if they were Kid Crawford\u2019s babies?\u201d She stood up and went to the microwave, giving it another forty-five seconds to rewarm the dinner. \u201cLet\u2019s get some decent food in your stomach, a good night\u2019s sleep, and tomorrow you can start mending your fences.\u201d</p><p>When Abby went to bed, she lay awake for a very long time, just thinking. She knew Vanessa was right about almost everything. Of course Abby had to be more cooperative with Cameron, and she had no real concern about Cameron\u2019s ability to be a decent parent. If she hadn\u2019t guessed that much when she met him a few months ago, she certainly knew it now. He took her crap and still honored her needs, protecting her privacy, trying to keep her from panic and fear. His attention was a hundred percent aimed at the welfare of the children.</p> <p>And there was the rub. Despite what she said, Abby still had memories of their night together in Grants Pass that made her skin turn hot. Cameron was a dream lover. His every word and action made her feel adored. In his hands satisfaction had been complete, shatteringly perfect. He was just the kind of man every woman hoped for.</p><p>He was probably exactly that way with every woman he coaxed into bed. The charm, the sensitivity, the power, even the humor. After all, once he realized he was face-to-face with her and she carried his babies, he hadn\u2019t said he thought himself to be in love with her. He\u2019d demanded his paternal rights but hadn\u2019t suggested marriage.</p><p>He had said he\u2019d looked for her. Wanted more time with her...</p><p>She flopped over in bed. She had to let him off the hook for that love-and-marriage thing\u2014she\u2019d have laughed off any declarations of love anyway and she\u2019d never have agreed to marry him, a virtual stranger. That would be crazy.</p><p>But he was right, and Vanni was right. He\u2019d been considerate of her feelings and she had been a shrew. Her children would be better off with a good father they could be proud of, than they would be with no father at all. These ideas cost her quite a lot of sleep that night.</p><p>She was up very early, but she didn\u2019t beat Paul to the kitchen. He was having a cup of coffee as dawn was just barely peeking over the horizon. He looked over the rim of the cup with round eyes. \u201cI apologize,\u201d she said before even saying good-morning. \u201cI was a little crazy last night, but I\u2019m going to the clinic first thing this morning to apologize to Cameron and try to work with him on our...project.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled slightly. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a good idea. Considering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot any better ideas?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbby, I don\u2019t know anything about having babies,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI just know that when little Matt was coming I worried so much about him. Vanni was so upset and sad, I worried that might hurt the baby in some way. I think Mel was worried, too, but she told me that if being worried and scared caused serious problems, there wouldn\u2019t have been a single healthy birth in the history of the world. I just wish you could be happy.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI bet Cameron\u2019s on your side. Bet he wishes that, too.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and just smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I have to work on that. After all, I have some problems, but they\u2019re under control at the moment. And I\u2019m going to move forward with Cameron. If he doesn\u2019t hate me too much...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d She shot him a questioning look. \u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t,\u201d he amended. He smiled lamely.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could have a good strong cup of coffee,\u201d Abby said, looking jealously at Paul\u2019s big mug.</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cSee, that by itself could make you cranky. All the things you give up to be a good mother.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa was barely up with the baby when Abby was shrugging into her coat to leave the house. She thought if she got to the clinic before they opened, she could have a word with Cameron in private. She wasn\u2019t sure what that word was going to be besides, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>She had to bang on the door more than once and finally, she saw a shadow approaching. She glanced at her watch; it was only seven-thirty and they weren\u2019t due to open for business till nine. When he opened the door, her first word was right on. \u201cOh, sorry.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing sweatpants, his chest and feet bare, a towel slung around his neck and his hair wet from the shower. She flushed a little, remembering that wide, hard chest as it had been pressed against her breasts. And those muscular arms that had held him up over her to keep from crushing her with his weight.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get here early, but I think I got here too early,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said, opening the door for her. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Abby?\u201d he asked, looking instantly concerned. \u201cAre you sick? In pain? Anything physically wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a bitch. I came to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, letting out a slow breath. \u201cForget it. You were upset. We were both upset. Having twins isn\u2019t stress free. Let\u2019s let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe we could talk a minute, if you have time.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a small smile. \u201cHow about a cup of herbal tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have a strong cup of coffee with a little Irish Mist and lots of cream, but I suppose that\u2019s out of the question....\u201d</p><p>He laughed lightly. \u201cBad idea. But there\u2019s tea in the kitchen. Mel has it on hand for the pregnant girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d she said. \u201cMel\u2019s not a tea drinker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Mel\u2019s a hard-core caffeine junkie. She\u2019d take it in the vein if she could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI relate. I might be in withdrawal. That could be half the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tea is herbal, so it\u2019s also decaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cOne blow after another.\u201d</p><p>And this time his laugh was a little stronger. \u201cCome to the kitchen. Have you had breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019ll save that for after we\u2019ve talked a bit.\u201d</p><p>He filled the kettle and glanced over his shoulder. \u201cSomething about this little mission of yours upsetting your stomach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about two babies is upsetting my stomach. Double morning sickness. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d She sat down. \u201cI\u2019ve already thrown up this morning, so we\u2019re safe for a while.\u201d</p><p>Cameron stared down at the kettle on the stove. She wouldn\u2019t understand this, but he wished he could have been there for that. He\u2019d like to be around for even the worst parts of the pregnancy; he\u2019d like to be the one she complained to, blamed, criticized and harangued. Even though he was already getting plenty of that, he hated that she suffered her upset without his arms around her, comforting her as she calmed down. Crazy as it was, he wanted to watch her turn pea green, shoot for the bathroom, come out white as a sheet and fall into his arms. He\u2019d like to be the partner, not the silent partner. He\u2019d like to feel her big belly pressed up against him at night, waking him with the romping inside. He turned around and looked at her. \u201cWould you like some soda crackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still having morning sickness at five months?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid so. Mel said it happens. Some of us are lucky. And I\u2019m double lucky. My hormones have obviously gone wild.\u201d</p><p>He got a cup and tea bag ready, poured himself a cup of high-test coffee, strong the way Mel liked it, and sat at the table with her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d she said. \u201cCameron, I was mean and horrible last night and I\u2019m sorry. I think I felt out of control. I\u2019m not really angry with you. I\u2019m not afraid you\u2019d be a terrible father. It\u2019s just this mess of mine. I\u2019d like to keep you out of it. I\u2019d like to keep the babies out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat night... The night this happened...\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI was upset, depressed, didn\u2019t know which way to turn.... I never meant for something like that to happen. I shouldn\u2019t have let it happen. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, there\u2019s no fault,\u201d he said. He reached for her hand, but the teakettle whistled and he pulled back. He stood and fixed up her tea, bringing it to her. He got a spoon, cream and sugar. Then he sat down again while she dunked the tea bag. \u201cListen, it wasn\u2019t about fault. We\u2019re adults. We were adults that night, and it wasn\u2019t a bad night. It was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the way I get to know men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. It isn\u2019t the way I get to know women either,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deserve a second chance.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhich is the point. Vanni sat me down last night. She gave me a stern talking-to. If we\u2019re both going to be parents, we have to at least get along. I can\u2019t treat you like the enemy\u2014you\u2019ve been nothing but nice to me. I guess I just don\u2019t know how to go about that\u2014the getting along part. The part where you get to be the father without anyone knowing you\u2019re the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have just talked about it. Because I have some ideas about that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot open wide. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said.</p><p>She leaned her chin on her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, we don\u2019t have to explain anything to anyone, ever. There\u2019s the starting point. We can be friendly now without any suspicion. We can see each other casually, become friends. Abby, you\u2019re a beautiful, sexy, funny woman. You\u2019re carrying twins and I\u2019m a pediatrician. I love babies and beautiful women. The fact that you\u2019re a single pregnant woman wouldn\u2019t scare me off\u2014why would it? For someone like me to be attracted to someone like you, even if we hadn\u2019t had our history, isn\u2019t so strange. People are likely to think it\u2019s a Lifetime movie. Nothing but happy endings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not embarrassed by what happened. If we wanted to, we could just say we met in Grants Pass while you were visiting your good friend, we got to know each other, we got along. We didn\u2019t date long, but there was an attraction and...well...these things happen. The details aren\u2019t important and none of anyone\u2019s business but ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese things happen,\u201d she repeated, shaking her head.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mysterious. In fact, it\u2019s not a crime. The few people who know aren\u2019t going to tip off Kid Crawford, if that\u2019s what has you panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew people?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to a few. There was Mel, Vanni and Dr. Stone. Now there\u2019s Paul, and thanks to a little time we had at the bar together last night, Jack. Jack\u2019s the only wild card, I think, and he won\u2019t say anything because he doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with Mel on that issue. Paul doesn\u2019t want Vanni to kill him, so he\u2019s airtight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThing is, it might get out eventually. It\u2019s kind of funny in a way\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it\u2014two strangers are sitting alone in a bar, feeling sorry for themselves, and not only do they get together and find a lot of comfort in each other, they start a family. And not just a baby, but twins. Then they end up in the same small town. No one would believe it. I know it wasn\u2019t planned, but I\u2019m not sorry about the outcome.\u201d</p><p>She looked angry. At least indignant. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You hate the complications, but there are twins coming and I\u2019m going to be around to help you with that. One\u2019s a boy. I hope the other one\u2019s a girl. These might be the only kids I get, and I hope I get one of each.\u201d He grinned stupidly and knew it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you had all these legal and financial things hanging on you, you wouldn\u2019t be so cavalier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should see a lawyer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lawyer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you have a good one. You got screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Cameron, I can\u2019t afford another lawyer. The last one almost wiped me out. I pulled all my retirement funds, cashed in my stock, which wasn\u2019t much, sold my condo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>She was struck dumb. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Abby, it\u2019s in my best interest to help you get this monkey off your back. If we have a clean slate, maybe we can work as a team.\u201d He sat back. \u201cThat\u2019s my hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do that,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to owe you that much.\u201d</p><p>He just shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me either way. They\u2019re mine as much as they\u2019re yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a godawful, stinking mess,\u201d she said, pouting and lifting the cup to her lips.</p><p>Cameron was silent. Frowning. When she put the cup down, she looked at him and said, \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to hear about some of the sad things I\u2019ve seen in my practice. Abby, you\u2019re worried about all the wrong things\u2014about who\u2019s going to pay for the lawyer, about being embarrassed that we didn\u2019t have a long relationship before this happened. Give thanks. The babies are healthy and strong and, so far as we can tell, perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her hand went to her tummy. \u201cAre you the calm and reasonable one because you\u2019re not the pregnant one?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart. Because I\u2019m the desperate one. You\u2019re holding the prize.\u201d</p><p>By the time Jack got home at the end of a long day, the children were asleep and Mel was on the computer. He kissed her, then went to the kitchen and looked through the mail. He found a letter from Rick.</p><p>Since the boy was thirteen, Jack had looked out for him, tried to help him into manhood with strength and courage, with goodness. It was with a combination of pride and trepidation that he had sent him off to the Marine Corps at the age of eighteen. It was Rick\u2019s decision, one hundred percent. Jack never fought him on it, though he had wanted to send Rick to college and had put aside money for that.</p><p>Now Rick was in Iraq where Jack had served two tours in his own Marine career. Rick sent a letter home to Jack sometimes as often as every two weeks, at least once a month, and he usually sent it to the bar so that everyone could hear the latest news. He also wrote to his grandmother, who was his only family, and his girl, Liz, who lived in Eureka.</p><p>But this letter hadn\u2019t gone to the bar. Jack ripped it open at once.</p><p>Dear Jack,</p><p>God, I\u2019m sorry to do this to you. I gotta get this out\u2014and I don\u2019t want my grandma or Liz upset. But you know about this stuff. You know how it is, and I have to lay it on someone who won\u2019t freak out. You would\u2019ve gotten some of this on the news, but you wouldn\u2019t have known it had anything to do with me. We moved on Haditha Dam, doing house-to-house searches, trying to root out al Qaeda insurgents, and one of the squads right in front of us was obliterated by a bomb. A truck bomb. There was only one survivor in that squad, and they were a tight squad. Tighter than ours. One survivor, Jack. Holy Jesus, I think I\u2019d rather be dead than watch eleven of my best friends blow up. I knew some of them. Sonny was waiting for a baby, Gravis was engaged, and Dom was this little Italian kid who was just scared shitless all the time. He wanted to go home so bad, he cried. Cried. But his whole squad was holding him up, taking care of him, trying to bolster him and prop him up all the time. They never cut anyone out of their fold\u2014no matter what kind of problem they had. The guy that made it, the one guy, he has a girlfriend back home, and he\u2019ll get back to her, but he\u2019s going to be messed up. But he doesn\u2019t even get to leave yet\u2014they\u2019re moving him to another squad. Holy God, I hope they move him out of the worst of this shit\u2014it\u2019s horrible.</p><p>They were right in front of us, Jack. Another two minutes, it would\u2019ve been us. I can\u2019t hardly sleep since that happened. A couple of my boys puked and one fainted, I think. He got back on his feet real fast and denied it, but I think he really passed out. There was so much screaming I couldn\u2019t tell if it was me or the rest of them. It was all black and cloudy and then it was all blood. I wanted to die on the spot. I hit the ground because there was so much shooting I didn\u2019t know for sure I wouldn\u2019t take one from my own platoon.</p><p>Right after the bomb and all the shooting, an Army Cobra came in and bombed the shit out of one of the buildings. Debris everywhere, really heavy stuff. Big hunks of cement and wood, flying like missiles through the air.</p><p>This place is like hell sometimes. I\u2019m sorry to write you this stuff. Don\u2019t tell anyone\u2014don\u2019t get anyone scared or upset. My grandma and Liz can\u2019t know this shit. We just have to keep them thinking positive.</p><p>And then\u2014if all that crap isn\u2019t bad enough, I think I killed a guy. We couldn\u2019t recover a body, but I saw a sniper and I nailed him. If he managed to crawl away, he didn\u2019t get far because he left behind too much blood to make it out alive. I didn\u2019t believe this could happen, because I was so far away, but I saw the look on his face. And for just one second I thought, why\u2019d I get him before he got me? War can\u2019t be luck. Not with the amount of training we put ourselves through.</p><p>My squad\u2019s all shook up. Hell, the battalion\u2019s all torn up. Since I\u2019ve been over here, I haven\u2019t seen an American die\u2014and then eleven of them went up in one giant explosion. Jack, it was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen. And then I killed a guy.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I had to tell you. Don\u2019t get anyone upset with this. Burn this.</p><p>Jack, I\u2019m not scared. Sometimes I get nervous, my adrenaline gets pumping real hard, it works on my brain a lot, but I\u2019m okay. I don\u2019t want you to worry that I\u2019m scared and will do something stupid\u2014I use the fear to keep me sharp. Some of the boys are terrified, but it\u2019s real easy to see it isn\u2019t going to do them any good to give in to that.</p><p>I\u2019m still okay. But I had to write this to someone who could take it, someone who\u2019d understand, because it\u2019s so freaking awful and if I keep it in my gut, it\u2019s going to eat me alive.</p><p>Rick</p><p>Jack\u2019s hands shook as he read. And reread. He had fallen into a kitchen chair. He felt his wife\u2019s small hand on his shoulder and turned his eyes up to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Rick. It\u2019s not good. It can\u2019t be shared with anyone, he says.\u201d</p><p>She held out her hand. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t include me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMel, it\u2019s very ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know what makes your hands shake, Jack. We get through things together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said wearily. He handed her the letter, let her read. Before she got to the end, tears were running down her cheeks. \u201cDear God in heaven,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOur poor boy. God, all the poor boys.\u201d</p><p>Jack was up until three in the morning, writing to Rick, telling him he could send any kind of letter he wanted, Jack would always be there to read it. He wrote anything he could think of to pump him up, tell him how proud he was, how completely sure he was going to make all the right decisions. He praised him for his ability to empathize with his boys\u2014the ones who survived, the ones who were having a hard time. And he wrote, \u201cYeah, buddy, we\u2019ve all seen some bad, bad stuff. When you\u2019re home, you\u2019ll better appreciate all the good stuff. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>And then Jack went back to his previous practice of writing a letter a day to Rick. Anything to keep him going, keep him positive.</p><p>A few days later, at about four in the afternoon, before the dinner crowd showed up and the bar was quiet, she came in. Liz. Rick\u2019s girl. She stood just inside the door and smiled at Jack. Jack smiled back. What irony that she should turn up just a few days after Jack had received that letter, the one that threatened to rob him of any hope for a good night\u2019s sleep till he had his boy home.</p><p>The first time he\u2019d seen Liz she had been a fourteen-year-old hottie. She wore tight tops, skirts the size of napkins, high-heeled boots and heavy, dramatic makeup. His boy Rick went right over the edge. Despite all Jack\u2019s counseling, Rick ended up in trouble with the girl; he just didn\u2019t get that condom out of his pocket in time.</p><p>The next time Jack saw Liz, she had been so different. She actually looked younger than the first time. A pregnant child; a little girl of fifteen with no makeup, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt pulled over her pregnant tummy, her hair pulled back in a childish ponytail. And that was the real Liz, the girl Ricky loved and stood by. That was the girl who got him in so much trouble at school while he made himself late to every class making sure he got her past the sniggering girls in the hallway and into her classroom. Rick never once complained. He wanted nothing so much as to do right by her.</p><p>Jack had been so proud of the way the boy stuck with her, protected her, was there for her through everything. Then their baby had been stillborn\u2014a tragedy, a horrible way for these kids to grow up. But they\u2019d been so strong, so brave.</p><p>And this was what Liz had become\u2014a beautiful young woman, almost eighteen. She was so lovely it almost took his breath away. Her hair was long, light brown with blond highlights, her eyes sparkling. She still wore daringly tight clothes, but she\u2019d started adding tasteful elements, like today\u2019s tan suede jacket. She wasn\u2019t the showy, seductive nymphet anymore. And her makeup was light, only enhancing her natural beauty, rather than making her look like a too-young hooker, thank God.</p><p>She walked up to the bar, jumped up on a stool and leaned toward him to give him a friendly peck on the cheek. \u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind me. How about you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood. I graduate in June. I have straight As. Rick will be happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy about that?\u201d he asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of it. I didn\u2019t think I could do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...are you doing it for Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was,\u201d she said with a nod. \u201cBut I have to admit, I like the feeling. School was so easy for Ricky\u2014he always got straight As without hardly trying. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m almost as smart as he is, even if I do have to work at it real hard.\u201d She smiled at Jack. \u201cBut, I signed up for community college in the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Nothing wrong with hard work. If it\u2019s any comfort, it never came easy to me, either. Any idea what you\u2019d like to be when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever. Well, I know some things\u2014I know I want to be with Rick. When he\u2019s ready.\u201d She sighed. \u201cJack, sometimes I miss him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, kiddo. What do you hear from him these days?\u201d he asked, praying she wouldn\u2019t ask him the same question.</p> <p>\u201cI got a letter last week. I think he\u2019s having a hard time. He won\u2019t tell me anything bad, but there\u2019s a certain...something. I can\u2019t describe it. It\u2019s like he\u2019s having trouble writing things down, and he keeps repeating the same things over and over. I just hope he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie, men who serve, even when they\u2019re not real close to the action, tend to bring home some issues with them. Know what I mean, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She dropped her gaze briefly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to read about it, but it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are groups, Liz. Military spouses who get together to support each other. You could check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t, Jack. I\u2019m not a wife. They wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBet they would. You\u2019re not the only girlfriend waiting for her guy to come home. If you think it could help you understand some things, you should give it a shot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that would make it easier for Rick?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Nothing is going to make this easier, Jack thought. But he didn\u2019t say it. He smiled. \u201cMaybe. The point is, if it helps you, it might end up helping him. Why not at least ask? If you can find a group in your area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I could check. Does it cost anything?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI doubt it. Why? Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving every penny Aunt Connie pays me for helping in the store. When Rick gets his R &amp; R, I want to meet him. I\u2019ll go anywhere. I got a passport.\u201d</p><p>Jack was momentarily stunned. That had never occurred to him\u2014that Rick would spend his leave anywhere but Virgin River, and that Liz would travel to see him. The shock must have shown on his face, because she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnywhere at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is kind of a big step.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBigger than spending nights with him at his grandma\u2019s house? Bigger than having a baby with him? Than promising I\u2019ll love him forever? Come on, Jack.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBy now you should be used to this. We\u2019re not giving each other up.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled at her, but he was thinking, All I want in this world is for everything to work out for you two now. You\u2019ve earned it. Burying a baby, going to war, being left behind. You\u2019ve gone through things some couples married twenty years haven\u2019t gone through\u2014and held it together. God, no one deserves it more. But he said, \u201cLiz, things usually work out the way they\u2019re supposed to. You need to have faith and think positive.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Since moving part of his family\u2019s construction company to Virgin River, business had been good for Paul Haggerty. He was working on a new construction, a forty-five-hundred-square-foot house for a couple from Arizona. It would be their second home; the people were obviously stinking rich. He\u2019d snagged the job out from under the local contractors by promising to deliver the finished home ahead of schedule. With the reputation of his family\u2019s company in Grants Pass plus a little tour of a couple of his completed properties, it was a quick contract. In addition to getting the job, he\u2019d convinced them to talk to Joe Benson, his best friend and architect from Grants Pass, about a design.</p><p>Now he had to deliver.</p><p>He had a couple of houses and three renovations in production. But business was only as good as his crews. He\u2019d hired some solid, skilled people, and when someone messed up, didn\u2019t show for work or couldn\u2019t follow orders, he didn\u2019t screw around\u2014they were gone. Which meant the hiring and firing was a continual process.</p><p>He kept his office in a construction trailer at the big homesite. That was the project that was taking the most time. The weather was warming up a little, but it was still brisk in the mountains in March. He looked up from the schedule on his clipboard to see a man walking toward him holding a folded newspaper. Another job applicant. Well, good. With any luck he\u2019d be hireable.</p><p>The man was good-sized and appeared strong. He wore an odd-looking cowboy hat, jeans, denim jacket and boots, looking so much like everyone else up here in the mountains. He was clean shaven and his clothes appeared to be fresh; Paul took that as a positive sign.</p><p>When he got up in front of Paul he stopped and said, \u201cHi. I\u2019m looking for the boss at Haggerty Construction.\u201d</p><p>Paul put out his hand. \u201cPaul Haggerty. How you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>The man accepted the shake. \u201cDan Brady. Good. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou advertised for a drywall man and painter. That spot filled yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can always use help with that, if you have what I need. Let me get you an application.\u201d Paul turned away to go into the trailer.</p><p>\u201cMr. Haggerty,\u201d Dan said, stopping him.</p><p>Paul turned. He was used to being in charge, but he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get used to being called mister by a man his age or older.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to waste your time or mine. I served some felony time. If that\u2019s going to stop you cold, let\u2019s not go through the routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cFarming the wrong produce, you might say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else on your sheet?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I turned myself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other arrests? Of any kind? Even misdemeanor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Isn\u2019t that about enough?\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t respond or react. He\u2019d keep secret the fact that he\u2019d feel better hiring a pot grower than someone who\u2019d had a bunch of DUIs. One thing that could really mess up the works and get people hurt was drinking on the job. \u201cDo you have a parole or probation officer you report to?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cParole. I was released early, if that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long. Six weeks. I checked in with the family and relocated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy here?\u201d Paul wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cBecause Virgin River is known for discouraging marijuana growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Dan, my business isn\u2019t limited to Virgin River. There\u2019s lots of work around these mountains and I\u2019m willing to take any good bid if I have the crews to cover it. There could be a job in a place that caters to illegal growing, like Clear River. That going to be a problem for you? Or for me?\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cOld acquaintances of mine aren\u2019t likely to be doing honest work. I think it\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Then he shook his head. \u201cOne of \u2019em might order up a big house, however. I just hope not.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed in spite of himself. He wasn\u2019t going to be doing business in cash. If that ever came up, they\u2019d have to use a bank, and growers didn\u2019t like banks. \u201cThen the next step is your application. I\u2019d like to see what you\u2019ve done in construction, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Haggerty. Thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>Paul got him an application, gave him a pen and clipboard. Dan sat on the steps to the trailer and filled it out. A half hour later he handed it to Paul who scanned it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a lot of construction experience,\u201d he said, surprised. He looked up. \u201cMarine Corps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I started working construction at eighteen, Marine Corps at twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Corps came kind of late for you. A lot of us went in younger...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it for a long time first. And the military benefits seemed worth the time. Not a lot of benefits in the construction trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offer medical benefits for full-time crew,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no longer a priority,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have an address in Sebastapol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my folks\u2019 place\u2014my permanent address. I haven\u2019t found anything around here yet, but I have the camper shell, so I\u2019m good while I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a framer, too. I need framers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could probably do it, but I have an unsteady leg. Since Iraq. I do a lot of other things that don\u2019t go fifteen feet off the ground and that would probably keep your workman\u2019s comp manageable.\u201d</p><p>Paul pondered the application for a good two minutes. The guy looked real good on paper. He\u2019d been a felon, but then again, Paul had fought wildfire as a volunteer beside incarcerated felons recruited for that purpose. \u201cWhat are the chances of getting a letter of recommendation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlim. But the sheriff\u2019s department might be willing to confirm that I was a cooperative suspect. I guess my parole officer might step up. I could ask, but you know that won\u2019t guarantee I\u2019d be a good employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad you want a job?\u201d Paul asked without looking up.</p><p>\u201cBad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad enough to take a urine test every now and then?\u201d</p><p>Dan Brady laughed. \u201cSure. But I can make that easy on you. I can sign a release to give you access to the parole officer\u2019s random urine test, then you don\u2019t have to pay for a lab. I don\u2019t do drugs. Never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Paul asked, mystified.</p><p>\u201cMoney,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt was for the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Dan Brady paused a long moment before he said, \u201cI have a list of regrets about a hundred miles long. That would fall in there somewhere. At the time, I needed the money. Times were hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre times still hard?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cThose times are past. Oh, I still need money, but it\u2019s all different now. Prison changed a lot of things, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays here you do just about everything\u2014drywall, texturing, painting, plumbing, wiring, counters, roofing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoofing\u2014there\u2019s that high-up thing again. Sorry, you have to know the truth, my unsteady leg can take me by surprise. I\u2019ll do anything, but you should have the truth about that for both our sakes. One, I don\u2019t want a broken back, and two, you don\u2019t want an injured jobber on your insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you took a fall from that leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dan said, scratching his chin, \u201ca couple of years ago, I fell in my mother\u2019s upstairs bathroom, and that wasn\u2019t even high beams. I didn\u2019t hurt myself much, but one minute I was standing up, the next I was on my ass. Like I said, I could get up there on the roof, if that\u2019s the price of getting the job, but I\u2019ve made it a policy to stay close to the ground if at all possible. In case.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed. \u201cHow\u2019d you like the Marines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth? I think I was a decent Marine, but I didn\u2019t love it. I got mostly shit assignments. I went to Iraq right off the bat, when things were as bad as they could get. When I was discharged, it was one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did my four and joined the reserves and went back to Iraq a second time. One of us was smarter. I vote for you. But that felony thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I give you a shot? Think I\u2019ll regret it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m good in construction. Before I started doing it for a living, I helped my dad build our house. And I\u2019ll pee in a cup for you. I don\u2019t steal or get in fights. But if I were you, I\u2019d keep me close to the ground. I\u2019ll get a lot more done.\u201d</p><p>Paul smiled and put out his hand. \u201cWell, what the hell, Dan. You paid your debt. But I am going to check in with the parole officer, just to get another read on you.\u201d</p><p>Dan put out a hand. \u201cKnock yourself out there, sir. He thinks I have potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re off to an excellent start. If you have any talent, you\u2019re coming on at a good time. This company is young and growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Thank you, sir. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Brady worked the rest of the week for Haggerty Construction. He was moved around so Paul could see his work. He did some drywall and texturing, hung a couple of big, carved front doors with leaded-glass windows, spackled, fitted countertop, even helped with some wiring. \u201cDo you do everything in construction?\u201d Paul finally asked.</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d Dan answered with a shrug. \u201cI started when I was fifteen, trained by the toughest boss in construction. The man was a tyrant.\u201d Then he grinned proudly.</p><p>\u201cYour dad,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cYou work for him, too?\u201d Dan asked facetiously.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, you stay out of trouble, you might work out.\u201d Then Paul slapped him on the back.</p><p>Dan worked on Saturday as well; they were pressed for time on the big house. But the crew supervisor told everyone to knock off at two in the afternoon and be back Monday morning bright and early.</p> <p>Dan had less than forty-eight hours to get a few things done. He had to do some laundry, buy some nonperishable food he could keep in his camper shell, and he should see what he could find out about renting a room, apartment or small house. But first, he was due a beer. He might be able to accomplish more than one chore by stopping in that little bar in Virgin River. The guy who owned the place might know if there was anything to lease in the area. Just on principle, Dan didn\u2019t want to ask his new boss.</p><p>He walked into the bar and a couple of seconds later Jack came out from the back.</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus Christ,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou again.\u201d</p><p>Dan took off his hat and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cNice to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man\u2014you\u2019re the one. Paul hired you!\u201d Jack stepped up behind the bar, hands on his hips. \u201cHe said he hired a big guy who wore a funny-looking cowboy hat. Guess he doesn\u2019t know a Shady Brady when he sees one.\u201d</p><p>Dan just shook his head and gave a half smile. \u201cYou hold some kind of grudge or something? What\u2019d I ever do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust seems like when you\u2019re around, there\u2019s some kind of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and sometimes when I\u2019m around, someone needs a lift. Didn\u2019t I pick you up off a dirt road in the middle of a wildfire? Jesus, some people have no gratitude. Can I get a beer or are you going to glare at me all day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got clean money this time? I don\u2019t take money that smells like fresh-cut cannabis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you get the word? I\u2019m rehabilitated. I work construction, and that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted one eyebrow. \u201cYou went to jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while, yeah. Paul didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d Jack shook his head. \u201cHow about that,\u201d Dan said. \u201cHe\u2019s a gentleman, too.\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled a cold Heineken out of the cooler, remembering the man\u2019s preferred brew, popped the cap and put a chilled glass on the bar. \u201cListen, he\u2019s a good man. He works hard, he\u2019s honest, he treats people right. He\u2019s a family man and has good friends around here. Real good friends. You better not screw with him.\u201d Jack nodded at the beer. \u201cYou need a Beam to go with that?\u201d It was usually a boilermaker\u2014 Heineken and Jim Beam.</p><p>Dan smiled. \u201cNo thanks, this is fine. Look, buddy, all I want to do for your friend is construction. He gave me a job. I need a job.\u201d He put out his hand. \u201cDan Brady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrady?\u201d Jack asked with a laugh. \u201cHad to be Brady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting, huh?\u201d He put the hat on the bar. \u201cMy signature.\u201d</p><p>Jack hesitated a moment before he put his hand out and shook Dan\u2019s. \u201cJack Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Now, can we move on? No reason we have to go head to head every time we see each other. I\u2019m hoping to live here. At least for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy here?\u201d Jack asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to run into any old business associates in here.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThe bartender won\u2019t take stinky money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying we understand each other?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI never had a problem understanding you, pal. Fact is, if this were my bar, I wouldn\u2019t have taken my money either. But that\u2019s all in the past. And I need some information, if you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m bedding down in a camper shell and it\u2019s fine, but I thought you might know of something to rent around here.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew of a number of possibilities. Luke Riordan had six cabins on the river, recently updated. There was a couple in town who let out a room over their garage from time to time. And Jack had his cabin in the woods. But there was a vast difference between giving the man a job and watching him work and inviting him to spend the night. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about these mountain towns. Rentals and property sales come up so seldom, Paul\u2019s company is doing well. People have to build from scratch or remodel.\u201d</p><p>Dan watched Jack\u2019s eyes as he said this and he knew he wasn\u2019t getting the whole truth. He didn\u2019t blame the guy. It was going to take a while to prove he wasn\u2019t a low-life criminal. He knew there\u2019d be a price when he made the decision to enter the marijuana trade. Right now he could probably get assistance from someone still growing, but Dan didn\u2019t want to go that route. He meant it when he said that was in the past.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan said, \u201cI get that. And like I said, I\u2019m not uncomfortable. I park at a rest stop at night. There\u2019s hot water and facilities. What are your hours of operation? I\u2019m looking for an occasional hot meal and a packed lunch to take on the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can handle that for you. I\u2019m usually here by six-thirty and Preacher lives on the property. He has the coffee on by six. We stay open till about nine at night, later if someone asks us to stay open. If you let Preacher know in advance, he can have a packed lunch ready for you in the early morning. If you need any\u2014\u201d The phone rang in the kitchen. \u201cGive me a second. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>While Jack was gone, Dan wondered, just curiously, if the till was locked. Would Jack Sheridan leave him alone in the bar with a money drawer open? Did he trust him a little bit, or not at all? He wouldn\u2019t blame Jack if it took him some time to warm up to Dan\u2014after all, this was the first hour of the first day they had a legitimate relationship. But Dan and Jack had history. Lots of history. And it wasn\u2019t all so good.</p><p>The first time they\u2019d crossed paths, Dan had to get the local midwife to help him with a birth gone bad at an illegal grow site. That midwife was Jack\u2019s woman, and that whole episode went over like a turd in a punch bowl. The next time they came into contact, Dan had actually rear-ended that same midwife, and she was nine months pregnant. Again, not an auspicious beginning for their friendship.</p><p>But then he\u2019d redeemed himself. Dan was in the area when some local men were searching for Preacher\u2019s wife, who\u2019d been abducted by her homicidal ex-husband. It hadn\u2019t been Dan\u2019s plan to save the day, but the rest of these louts couldn\u2019t hack it and someone had to act. So Dan whopped the ex-husband on the head with his flashlight, knocked him cold and facilitated rescue.</p><p>Then there was the forest fire last summer. By the sheerest coincidence, Jack was sitting by the side of the road, hurt and dehydrated, as Dan was making his escape from a couple of lunatic growers. He picked Jack up and got him to safety.</p><p>Jack had apparently forgotten the good parts. Or decided they weren\u2019t good enough.</p><p>Shortly after that fire, there had been a warrant for Dan\u2019s arrest and that\u2019s when he\u2019d turned himself in. By virtue of being highly cooperative, he\u2019d only served six months of a three-year sentence. But still, he was now and forever an ex-con.</p><p>His beer was long gone. Whoever was on the phone must be important or Jack Sheridan wouldn\u2019t leave someone he didn\u2019t trust alone in his bar. Hell, he wouldn\u2019t even take his money if it smelled like\u2014</p><p>His thought was cut off as Jack wandered back into the bar, his face white and his eyes unfocused. He clutched a piece of paper in his hand and he didn\u2019t look at Dan. He didn\u2019t go behind the bar, but stood just outside the kitchen door and stared blankly at nothing.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Dan said. \u201cHey, Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t respond. He was a million miles away.</p><p>Dan got up and approached him warily. He looked weird, and weird could sometimes mean unstable. Unstable could mean anything.</p><p>\u201cSheridan? What\u2019s up, man?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s unfocused eyes slowly pivoted toward Dan. He licked his dry lips, blinked a couple of times. \u201cMy boy, Rick,\u201d he said in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked a little frantically. He\u2019d had a boy of his own once. He\u2019d probably worn those same eyes at the time. \u201cWhat about your boy Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick,\u201d he said, and lifted the piece of paper on which he\u2019d scrawled notes. Haditha, Al Anbar, hostile, critical, grenade, Landstuhl Medical Center, Germany.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Dan said. \u201cHey! Snap out of it! What happened?\u201d He gave Jack a couple of pats on the cheeks, carefully. He didn\u2019t slap him; Jack might be reactive enough to coldcock him. \u201cWhoa, buddy.\u201d He grabbed a bottle off the glass shelf behind the bar and tipped a shot over a glass. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, lifting the glass to Jack\u2019s lips. \u201cCome on, burn it down, buddy. Get a grip.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s shaking hand came up to grab the glass. He closed his eyes, threw back the shot and kept his eyes closed for a long moment. When he opened them, they were burning with a feral gleam.</p><p>\u201cSomething happen to your son, Jack?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cRick is like a son. He\u2019s in the Corps in Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that,\u201d Dan said, looking down at the paper. \u201cHaditha, in Iraq. Landstuhl Medical. Been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wounded. He might not make it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI gotta think straight,\u201d he said to himself.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Dan said. He shot into the kitchen. \u201cAnybody back here? Hey! Anybody back here?\u201d</p><p>In a second a woman came through a door into the kitchen. He recognized her. She was the woman who\u2019d been abducted\u2014Paige. The last time he\u2019d seen her, she was pregnant. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cGimme a hand out here, huh?\u201d</p><p>She followed him into the bar. Jack was leaning against the cupboard behind the bar and a little sanity had crept back into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSomebody named Rick is hurt in Iraq,\u201d Dan said. \u201cCan you find Jack\u2019s wife? Call her or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Jack said. But Paige bolted to the kitchen. \u201cI just have to think. I was in his file as next of kin, probably because his grandmother is old and sick. Lance Corporal Sudder, they said. Took a grenade in Haditha. They got him out of surgery in Iraq and transported him to Germany, but he\u2019s not in good shape. They had to resuscitate twice and there will be more surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhew, have another one. Slow down the brain a little,\u201d Dan said, pouring a half a shot of something, he wasn\u2019t even sure what.</p><p>He handed it to Jack, and Jack threw it back. He shut his eyes hard. A single tear escaped and ran down his cheek. He opened his eyes again and looked at Dan through slits. \u201cBlack Label,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cYou act like you own the place.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed out loud. \u201cThere you are. You on my planet now? What happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGimme some water. I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>Dan poured a water and Jack took a big drink. By the time he lowered the glass, Paige was standing in the kitchen doorway. Dan glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cMy husband has gone for some supplies,\u201d she said almost apologetically. \u201cThe kids are napping. I called Mel at home and told her to come right now. It\u2019s Saturday, the clinic isn\u2019t open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay now,\u201d Jack said. \u201cRick was wounded in Haditha. He\u2019s hurt real bad. Legs, head, torso, miscellaneous injuries. They airlifted him to Germany. I have to tell Lydie Sudder and Liz.\u201d He looked at Dan. \u201cLiz is his girlfriend. Then I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Dan asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get to Germany. This is my fault. Kid never would\u2019ve gone into the Corps if it hadn\u2019t been for me and all my boys, here all the time, making him think it\u2019s just one big goddamn party. Shit.\u201d He swiveled his eyes to Dan\u2019s. \u201cThey said he\u2019s bad. He might not make it. That I should be prepared for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got phone numbers on this paper, buddy. Once your brain is engaged again, call back and get some more numbers so you can check in at Landstuhl, find out how he\u2019s doing. You had a big shock. You need to get stable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a cup of coffee,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI had to think a second who Lance Corporal Sudder was. God, my worst nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down on a stool,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI\u2019ll fix you a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at Paige. \u201cTry to get Mel before she makes the drive. Tell her I\u2019m just coming home in a little while.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Paige went back into the kitchen to use the phone.</p> <p>Jack sat up at the bar, a place he was never seen. In his usual place behind the bar stood Dan, serving up coffee in a big mug. He didn\u2019t ask any more questions and didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>\u201cRicky turned up when he was thirteen and I\u2019d just started working on the bar. It was a shithole then. I slept in the rubble while I tried to get it straight. He was small back then\u2014his face was covered with freckles and he couldn\u2019t shut his mouth for five minutes.\u201d Jack laughed and shook his head, remembering. \u201cI let him hang around because his mom and dad were dead and he just had his grandma. And the goofy kid sucked me in. He\u2019s twenty now. No more freckles. Six-two. Strong...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta remember he\u2019s strong, Jack,\u201d Dan said. \u201cDon\u2019t give up on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have done it, joined the Marines, but he was first in every training program, he was good....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs,\u201d Dan corrected. \u201cGet it together, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs good,\u201d Jack repeated. He took a deep drink of hot coffee. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can tell Lydie and Liz....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell them he\u2019s hurt bad, in the hospital, and you\u2019re going there. That\u2019s what you tell them. You don\u2019t give anyone permission to give up. If the worst happens, then you\u2019ll tell them the worst. You don\u2019t tell them the worst before it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve seen him, man,\u201d Jack said, drinking more coffee, smiling. \u201cI taught him to hold a hammer, fish, shoot. He was such a little nerd at first, all gangles and pimples and that damn giggling, I thought he might stay that way forever. But he grew up fast\u2014turned out to be a little faster in the saddle than was good. Whew. I felt like a father to that kid\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeel,\u201d Dan corrected. \u201cFeel like a father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, that\u2019s a fact.\u201d</p><p>Paige popped her head back into the bar. \u201cShe\u2019s already on her way, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, we shouldn\u2019t have bothered her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to be here,\u201d Dan said. Paige withdrew again, leaving them alone. \u201cShe\u2019ll go with you to see the grandmother, the girlfriend. Then you\u2019ll go see Rick. You think you\u2019re together enough to do that? To go to Germany? Because if you\u2019re nuts or in some flashback, you can\u2019t chance it. It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Jack took a drink from his coffee cup, then slowly raised his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t let him down. I think I was in shock for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>Dan stood behind the bar while Jack sat as a customer. Dan refilled his coffee mug, then pulled another Heineken out of the cooler, but this time he drank it from the bottle. For a few minutes they talked quietly about Rick and what he meant to Jack. About the letter not so long ago that described how dangerous it had been in Haditha lately.</p><p>The sound of boots on the bar\u2019s porch brought Jack off the stool and toward the door. He pulled it open and there stood Mel, her eyes wide and her mouth open slightly. \u201cRicky?\u201d she asked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cWounded in Iraq. He\u2019s had surgery to stabilize him, but I\u2019m not even sure on what. He had leg, torso and head injuries and has been airlifted to Germany, to a military hospital there. Mel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming around. It knocked the wind out of me. Where are the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike came over from next door\u2014they\u2019re sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to tell Lydie and Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst Lydie,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go home and while you pack, I\u2019ll get on the computer and find you plane tickets. Then we\u2019ll go to Eureka to see Liz. We\u2019ll go in two cars, I\u2019ll take the kids with me. When you head for the airport, I\u2019ll bring the kids home. Unless you need me with you in Germany. Thing is, I don\u2019t have the kids on my passport. Shit, how dumb was that, with Rick in Iraq! Why didn\u2019t I take care of that? Well, maybe I should come. I can fly to L.A., get the passport handled in a day, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, stop. You\u2019re not dragging the kids to Germany,\u201d Jack said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get going.\u201d He held the door for her.</p><p>As she was leaving, she looked over her shoulder at the man behind the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2014ah\u2014leave a few bucks on the bar,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd help the lady in the kitchen till her husband gets back, if she needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the few bucks, unless you want to pitch in for that Black Label you threw down my throat,\u201d Jack said with a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014\u201d Dan shrugged \u201c\u2014glad I was here.\u201d</p><p>Jack started to leave, but then he stopped again and looked at Dan. \u201cThe thing that did it, the thing that knocked me out for a while... When I told the sergeant who called that I\u2019d get right over to Germany, he asked me if I didn\u2019t want to wait until Rick was out of surgery, until they knew his condition, in case he didn\u2019t make it. And I said no, I wasn\u2019t waiting. I was either going to see him or bring him home. Just thinking that? It put me in shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop thinking it now,\u201d Dan said. \u201cGet going. Remember, he\u2019s strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. Remember, you\u2019re strong, too.\u201d</p><p>Lydie reacted exactly as Mel expected. She gasped, got teary and twisted her hands, asking questions for which Jack had no answers. But then she straightened her neck and stiffened her spine and began to pray. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she said bravely. \u201cWhen you get there, tell Ricky his grandma is fine and praying for him. He worries about me too much. I don\u2019t want him to worry when he should be working on getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come by and check on you later today,\u201d Mel said. \u201cDon\u2019t get upset and forget to test your blood, take your insulin and eat. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. Now go. Don\u2019t waste your time here. He needs you.\u201d</p><p>Liz was another story. After booking a flight and packing a duffel, Mel and Jack drove to Eureka in separate vehicles. Liz met them at the door before they were halfway down the walk. \u201cIs he alive?\u201d she asked before they even told her why they were there. Her eyes were as big as hubcaps and frightened. \u201cIs he alive?\u201d</p><p>They couldn\u2019t even get in the door. \u201cHe was wounded, Liz,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019s seriously hurt, but he\u2019s in the hospital. They airlifted him out of Iraq and he should be in Germany soon. I\u2019m going to see him, and when I get there, I\u2019ll call you immediately and tell you his condition. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she said, whirling around and fleeing back into the house. Over her shoulder she said, \u201cI knew all day. I knew. I couldn\u2019t get him off my mind and I was worried all day. I worry a lot, but not like lately. I have a passport and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz! No!\u201d Mel said. \u201cNow stop, honey. Let Jack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, if Jack won\u2019t let me go with him, I\u2019ll go by myself. I\u2019ve never been on a plane, but I\u2019ll figure it out. I have to go, I have to be there for him, I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she should,\u201d Jack said quietly.</p><p>Mel tugged on his sleeve to bring his ear to her lips. \u201cJack, what if you get there and it\u2019s the worst case? You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be worst case,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd if it helps Rick... Maybe it\u2019ll help Rick.\u201d He looked at Liz. \u201cYou have a computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pack. Mel will get you a ticket. You have to hurry. We have to drive to Redding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew all day long,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have almost a thousand dollars saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here. In my bedroom. Will it cost more than a thousand dollars? Because I could borrow some from my aunt Connie.\u201d</p><p>Jack took the baby out of Mel\u2019s arms, hanging on to both children, freeing her. \u201cPut it on the card, Mel. Get her a ticket on my flight if you can.\u201d Mel just looked up at him with a large question in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s his girl. He loves her. And she knew all day. There\u2019s a bond. He\u2019d probably rather have her there than me. Besides, we have to get it straight, how you act around someone who\u2019s been critically wounded. Liz is up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz, will your mom be okay with this? You\u2019ll miss a bunch of school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her. She\u2019s got her cell phone. It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I\u2019ll make up school. This is Rick. I have to be there with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d Mel said. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s terrible? What if he\u2019s not okay?\u201d</p><p>She threw a soft suitcase on the bed and looked at Mel with clear, determined eyes. \u201cThen I have to be there even more.\u201d</p><p>Mel sighed and sat down at the computer.</p><p>By the time Mel left Jack and Liz to begin their long journey to Frankfurt, her kids were just about psychotic from waking too early from naps, being hungry, having been transported all over the place. It would make sense to just go home and try to settle them, but she couldn\u2019t. She had to speak to Connie, Liz\u2019s aunt. She should tell Preacher and Paul, Marines who felt close to Rick. She should tell Cameron to look out for Lydie, since he was living at the clinic and Lydie was just down the street.</p><p>And after that she would go home to a lonely house and two fussy kids. It wasn\u2019t typical for Mel to feel totally frazzled, but she did. She loved Rick as much as Jack did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She went first to Connie, but didn\u2019t stay long. Then to the bar where Preacher already had the news from his wife. He wondered if he should close the bar. \u201cThe word is going to travel,\u201d Mel said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not going to hear anything for twenty-four hours or so. Stay busy. Everyone loves Ricky. If it\u2019s not your fanciest dinner tonight, no one will complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dinners tend to get fancier when there\u2019s trouble....\u201d</p><p>Next, Mel checked on Lydie, who was doing remarkably well under the circumstances, but by the time she got to the clinic to talk to Cameron, her kids were screaming and tears were running down her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d he said, coming down the stairs in his jeans and T-shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked. He immediately took David off her hands so they could each comfort one child.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said, trying to sniff back emotion. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard us talk about Rick, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Is he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not all right. He was critically wounded in Iraq. Jack and Rick\u2019s girlfriend, Liz, have rushed off to Germany, where he\u2019s been airlifted for surgery. My kids have been slung around all afternoon so we could get the two of them on their way, and I just realized I haven\u2019t let myself feel it yet. He\u2019s like Jack\u2019s boy. He\u2019s like my boy. And these two are absolutely insane. I need to rock and feed and tell more people who are close to Ricky and I\u2014\u201d She started to cry. \u201cI\u2019m so worried and scared I could just die.\u201d</p><p>Cameron put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cCome on, Mel. Let\u2019s rock and feed and cry if you need to. I\u2019ll make you tea or hot milk or\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTea or hot milk?\u201d she asked through her tears. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a beer in the refrigerator,\u201d he offered, wiping her cheeks with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cI came for a reason, not just to cry. I didn\u2019t plan that part. Lydie Sudder, down the street, that\u2019s Rick\u2019s grandma. His only living family. And she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about Lydie. Diabetic, failing vision, high blood pressure, and her heart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be alert to her. It\u2019s not as though pounding on her door at two in the morning to see if she\u2019s all right is going to help. But I checked on her and told her to call one of us if she had any problems related to this scary news. I told her to call a pager. I can\u2019t go home yet. I still have to call on Vanni and Paul.\u201d</p><p>He led her into the clinic\u2019s kitchen and deftly pulled a couple of the prepared bottles she kept there out of the refrigerator. Emma was almost a year old, David two, and both of them were happy with the cold milk. Then he handed Mel a beer with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cHow about dinner for these two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now they\u2019re just tired to the bone and need some calm. But I can\u2019t sit around here too long.\u201d</p><p>Cam had David in his arms while Mel held Emma. Both children settled down quickly with their bottles and some warm, calm arms holding them. Mel sniffled a couple of times, but having her children under control and a quiet place to sit calmed even her.</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen Liz,\u201d she said softly. \u201cShe\u2019s never been on a plane before, much less to Europe. She packed in ten minutes. She kept asking me questions while I was trying to get her a ticket on the computer. She\u2019d ask, \u2018Hair dryer?\u2019 and I\u2019d answer yes. \u2018Cold or warm there?\u2019 and I said cold. Ten minutes and she was ready to go. She\u2019s loved him since she was fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about his injuries?\u201d Cam quietly asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot, no.\u201d She repeated what Jack had told her. \u201cI wanted to go with him, but I have a passport problem and two small children. I still wanted to go. In the end, Liz went. Seventeen-year-old Liz. And I was jealous.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cIt was probably good that she went, if it\u2019ll help the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Jack said. But suddenly I feel abandoned. I know it\u2019s stupid, but I still felt it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid, Mel. It\u2019s the real deal. Thing is, there\u2019s just no help for it. Why don\u2019t you leave the kids with me while you make your calls to deliver the news.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and laughed hollowly. \u201cThat makes perfect sense, but because of this I just can\u2019t be separated from my kids. I have to have them near.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cTell you what\u2014I\u2019ll follow you out to Haggerty\u2019s, then to your place. I\u2019ll help you with the kids, get them fed and settled. We\u2019ll make a sandwich. And when all is calm and quiet, I\u2019ll take off.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI didn\u2019t have plans for tonight anyway. And I\u2019m wearing the pager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have baby food,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what grown-up food I have.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cYou\u2019re hopeless. Fine. I\u2019ll make us a couple of sandwiches here, pack them, and we\u2019ll go get the job done. Do you have chips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cIs Jack completely in charge of the food at your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d she admitted, taking a drink of her beer. She snuggled Emma, calmed down, sniffed back her tears, and thanks to Cameron\u2019s offer of help, felt a lot better about the rest of her mission.</p><p>\u201cI have chips,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled at him. She\u2019d spent so much time being grateful to Cameron, the doctor, for practicing medicine in her town, she hadn\u2019t realized how great Cameron, the person, really was. \u201cYou\u2019ve turned into my good friend,\u201d she said. \u201cLike Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice,\u201d he replied. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>It was a very long night and day before the phone rang at the Sheridan house and Mel lunged for it. She said hello and heard Jack\u2019s gravelly voice. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! What do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be all right. He cracked his head, lost a spleen, is scraped up all to hell, but the injuries are apparently not life threatening at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he burned?\u201d Mel asked, thinking about a grenade and the heat.</p><p>\u201cNo. Pitched through the air, though. But not burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, he lost his leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the damage too severe? Was it inoperable?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe lost it in the explosion. There wasn\u2019t a chance. Losing the leg was what almost killed him. He lost a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, poor Rick. Where\u2019d they amputate? Above or below the knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbove. But they saved a lot of thigh and femur. He\u2019s still in recovery. We haven\u2019t seen him yet, but he\u2019s going to be all right, Mel. Mel,\u201d he said, then paused. \u201cThis is rough. We\u2019re not family. Liz isn\u2019t a spouse and I\u2019m not his father. We\u2019re not getting a lot of help, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to let us bring him home. He might be transferred to some military medical facility for rehab. If I was his father, I could probably bring him home and take him to the nearest hospital for rehab. If I\u2019d just worked with Lydie to adopt him legally before all this\u2014\u201d</p><p>She heard the regret in his voice. Jack felt as if he\u2019d let Rick down. \u201cJack, just see Rick, let him know you\u2019re there, find out how he\u2019s doing medically, with pain and trauma. Decisions about where he\u2019s going next will come when they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jack? You might want to sleep. I hear the exhaustion in your voice. You have to be strong for Rick. Very strong. You can\u2019t cave in to things like pity, worry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Liz holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than me. She was so relieved to hear he\u2019s going to be all right, she started to cry and laugh at the same time. She doesn\u2019t quite get it, that she\u2019s not getting him back right away. And when she does, he won\u2019t be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou both just need to see him. He\u2019s not going to be himself for a while.\u201d She paused. \u201cI wish I was there with you, Jack. I could help. And I miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the kids okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine, Jack. We\u2019re all fine. Just missing you, that\u2019s all. But you\u2019re where you have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, if I could just get him home, with our family, I\u2019d feel so much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will come.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cHe needs to finish this journey. He needs the rehab, a prosthetic leg. Some counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to tell people? Or would you like to make calls yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do it, Mel? Lydie, Connie and the boys? If you can call Preach, Mike and Paul, they can call the squad. Are you up to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling. I\u2019ll make the calls right now. Everyone is waiting. Will you do something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you see Rick, please tell him I love him. And I\u2019m proud of him. Tell him I\u2019ll do anything in my power to help him. And tell him... No, it\u2019s too soon for that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cWhen I lived in Los Angeles, I worked with a doctor in emergency for almost a year before I learned he wore a prosthetic leg. He was quick, confident, strong and very talented. It\u2019s not only possible, it\u2019s probable. It\u2019s just that... I\u2019m sure getting there\u2019s a real bitch.\u201d</p><p>Blessedly, Mel had a very slow Monday morning in the clinic. Cameron had a couple of walk-ins, but Mel busied herself with paperwork and the children. It was lunchtime when a familiar guy walked in. He pulled off his Shady Brady inside the door. \u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>She rose from the desk behind the reception counter. \u201cHi. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Good. Um, I was just wondering if you\u2019d heard anything from your husband. About the kid. Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, walking toward him. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be all right. He has multiple injuries, all treatable. He\u2019s got head injuries that aren\u2019t a threat, he lost a spleen, is scraped up real bad but not burned, and he lost a leg in the explosion.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes grew wide and shocked at that last. Then, when he collected himself, he asked, \u201cAbove or below?\u201d</p><p>She knew exactly what he meant and wondered about his association with amputees. \u201cAbove the knee. Sounds like you know something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I was sent to Landstuhl after an injury and got cozy with a lot of guys who lost limbs. Below the knee was easy compared to\u2014 Well, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of rehab ahead, but the outlook is potentially positive. He\u2019s safe for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, dropping his gaze, shaking his head. \u201cGood. He made it through. Poor kid. What did your husband say\u2014that he\u2019s twenty years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust barely. And the sweetest kid you\u2019ll ever meet. Nice of you to inquire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that whole scene. Shook old Jack up pretty good. I haven\u2019t seen him very often over the past few years, but I\u2019ve never seen him shook up like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick\u2019s pretty special. Listen, speaking of the past few years\u2014I think about that woman and baby a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to lie to you, but that baby had nothing to do with me. I knew about the woman\u2014I knew her man left her out there, ready to pop. I checked on her a couple of times and knew she had a sketchy past, like a lot of us, and she refused to go to a clinic. She said it would be all right, but I found her in a mess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me the truth? Why\u2019d you let me think it was yours?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d help otherwise. And I did get her on a bus. If she didn\u2019t run out on that sister, they were willing to take her in, help her. Sorry, that was about all I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have done nothing,\u201d Mel said. She smiled. \u201cIf you\u2019d done nothing, it would\u2019ve been a disaster. She and the baby\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, I gave it a shot. Glad it worked out. Hope things work out for Rick, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come you\u2019re around here twice in the same week?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>It brought a grin out of him and she remembered, way back to that scary night, when he\u2019d said, Tough little broad, arentcha? He had grinned just like that. \u201cI got a job with the construction company. Haggerty\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real job?\u201d she asked, eyes wide. \u201cWhere they take taxes out of your check and everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everything,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cYou live around here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cExactly. I\u2019m staying in a camper until something comes up for rent. If you hear of anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I hear of something, I\u2019ll let Paul know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You take care.\u201d He turned to go.</p><p>\u201cI never did get a name.\u201d</p><p>He turned back. \u201cDan,\u201d he said. \u201cDan Brady.\u201d</p> <p>Four</p><p>Rick was just about twenty-four hours post surgical when he was allowed a visitor. Jack and Liz had to negotiate. \u201cLet me go,\u201d Jack said firmly. \u201cLet me see what we\u2019re dealing with. He\u2019s hurting, he\u2019s drugged, the prognosis is good from our perspective, but he lost a limb and that\u2019s gonna be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to see him, touch him, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about anything but that he\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI know how you\u2019re feeling right now, but I\u2019ve been down this road before and wounded Marines are unpredictable. Sometimes they\u2019re just grateful to be alive, sometimes they can be real loose canons. If he\u2019s unstable and angry, let him unload that on me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell him I love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. I\u2019ve only got ten minutes with him. Let me get the lay of the land. If he\u2019s mentally stable, you\u2019ll go in next.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded reluctantly; he could just imagine how crappy that made her feel, but Jack couldn\u2019t be sure how Rick was going to take to either one of them being here. Logically, he should want his closest people near him. But getting blown up and waking up in a hospital ward could skew someone\u2019s sense of logic something fierce.</p><p>It was a small ward, only six beds. But six where there should only be four. Hospitals catering to the war-wounded were crowded, even with the number of wounded decreased. He spotted Rick right off\u2014a white bandage wrapped around his head, his face cut and scraped, a bandaged stump where there had been a right leg. He wore green scrub pants, the right leg cut off, no shirt and his sheet was kicked away. There was a surgical bandage on his side; the spleenectomy, Jack assumed. An IV dangled above him; Jack hoped there was plenty of morphine in it.</p> <p>He looked around; green walls, white linoleum floors, that hospital smell of disinfectant and medicine. There was a guy in a circular bed with pins in his skull, a guy with a thigh-high cast on one leg, another sitting up in bed who looked for all the world to be uninjured, though there was a wheelchair beside his bed, a young man with his arm in an elevated cast level with his shoulder and a man flat on his back, in traction. And Rick. It was clearly an orthopedics ward. Jack nodded at the other patients as he entered and they returned the nod, grim-faced. Right away he knew, they weren\u2019t angry\u2014it was that Rick was the newest patient and they were waiting to see what happened next.</p><p>He stared down at the boy and saw the tears on his cheeks and his mouth parted in a dark slit as he took breaths slowly and deeply.</p><p>\u201cRick?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Rick\u2019s eyes opened. \u201cJack,\u201d he said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of pain, son?\u201d</p><p>He winced and nodded, squeezing out another tear.</p><p>\u201cDid they tell you about your condition?\u201d Jack asked him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d he asked in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout a day ago. They got you right up here. You\u2019re out of Iraq, you\u2019re in Germany. You know where you are, son?\u201d</p><p>Rick gritted his teeth and nodded.</p><p>\u201cRemember anything?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI... Ah... I remember someone screaming at me. He kept saying don\u2019t you give up, don\u2019t you quit. Fucker. I ever see him again, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt himself almost laugh; at least he had fight in him.</p><p>\u201cI brought Liz.\u201d</p><p>Rick\u2019s eyes came open instantly. \u201cNo,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t brought her, she was going to try to make it on her own. She needs to see you\u2019re okay, Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her here! Just get her out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Jack said, leaning over the bed. \u201cI could no more leave her behind than\u2014\u201d</p><p>As Jack put a hand down on the mattress beside Rick, Rick let go a howl of pain that nearly shook the walls. Jack jumped back in shock and fear, but Rick just kept screaming and flailing around. The nurse was beside the bed instantly. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch anything,\u201d Jack said apologetically.</p><p>The nurse ignored him and just talked to Rick. \u201cDeep breaths, I\u2019m upping the drip a little. Deep breaths, hang on, it\u2019ll kick in right away. Come on now, just breathe.\u201d Still, it took a moment for Rick to calm down. The howling ended with some soft whimpering that finally gave way to a couple of moans.</p><p>The nurse turned toward Jack. \u201cDid you sit on the bed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI leaned a hand on the bed, but I wasn\u2019t anywhere near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhantom pain,\u201d she said. \u201cYou probably leaned your hand where the leg used to be. It\u2019s spooky, but it\u2019s the real deal. He felt it and it hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter if you just don\u2019t touch anything. The first forty-eight hours are real rocky, but it\u2019s going to get better. Is this your first experience with an amputee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said weakly.</p><p>\u201cI have some pamphlets. Why don\u2019t you take a couple of hours to look through the literature. I think he\u2019s going to rest for a while now. I just gave him a nice boost.\u201d</p><p>Jack followed her to the nurses\u2019 station, glad to see someone was willing to be helpful to him there. When Liz saw them leave the ward together, she was immediately tailing them. Jack turned and asked her to give him just a minute with the nurse and continued on, leaving her behind. The nurse handed him some pamphlets and he asked, \u201cYou take care of a lot of these guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull-time,\u201d she said with a little nod of her head.</p><p>\u201cHelp me out with something here,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI just told him I brought his girl and he freaked out. Told me to get her out of here. Right up to the injury, there was no problem between him and the girl.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cReactions like that usually come later, after the reality settles in. This soon after the injury, patients are just being stabilized, they\u2019re struggling with the pain and trying to get a fix on what their condition is. His response might be connected to pain and drugs. But later... Not too unusual, I\u2019m sorry to say. Some men and women adjust so well, it\u2019s astonishing. Sometimes the new amputee is very needy, desperate for confirmation that he\u2019s still worth loving. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t even want to chance it, pushing loved ones away. There are a lot of psychological and emotional adjustments to go along with the physical. Everything from the pain and fear to self-esteem issues. You\u2019re going to have to learn about all this, and be patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does that go on?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cThe adjustment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurely individual. But you should see what you can learn about this for now. And maybe you can help get the young lady through it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw crap, what am I going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always recommend you start with the truth. This isn\u2019t an easy time for anyone. Try to watch those expectations. But you could tell her most of what the corporal is feeling is beyond his control. He\u2019ll need help getting through it. And yet, he might resist help. It\u2019s a contradictory process for some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to get him up, out of bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had him up, briefly. He didn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s still in a lot of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I need my wife here.\u201d In fact, he couldn\u2019t remember a time he needed her quite this bad. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll look through this stuff right away.\u201d</p><p>He turned to go back to Liz. The second he noticed she didn\u2019t seem to be where he\u2019d left her, he heard the screaming. \u201cGet out! Just get out of here! I don\u2019t want you here! Go away! Get out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d he muttered, running for the ward. He stopped in the doorway and what he saw emptied him out inside. Liz stood beside Rick\u2019s bed, her hands over her face, her beautiful long hair hanging down like a curtain, her shoulders quaking with her sobs while Rick nearly came off the bed, screaming at her. Jack moved quickly, put his arms around her and pulled her away. When they were back in the hall he held her against him protectively while she cried. He\u2019d never felt so helpless in his life. It almost felt as though if he crouched down, he could scoop up the pieces of her broken heart off the floor.</p><p>The same nurse was beside them again. \u201cI\u2019m going to give him something to calm him down a little bit. And I\u2019m going to tell him you\u2019ve left the hospital for now. Let\u2019s give him some space. Like I said, the first forty-eight hours are real rocky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cCome on, honey,\u201d he said, pulling Liz down the hall and away.</p><p>Jack took Liz as far as the main floor of the hospital where he found a quiet corner in the waiting room. He just held her hand while she cried. She whispered why why why breathlessly, sobbing almost uncontrollably. It was a long time before she could stop long enough to ask, \u201cWhy did he tell me to go away? Why?\u201d</p><p>Jack squeezed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about what just happened until you calm down and we\u2019re out of here. We need quiet. Privacy. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cLots of things are going to be hard to understand,\u201d he said, giving her hair a stroke. \u201cAnd if you think I have any inside track on this, you\u2019re going to be disappointed.\u201d He showed her the pamphlets the nurse had given him. \u201cWe have some reading to do, and some talking to do. Then we need food and sleep. Can\u2019t stay on top of this emotional roller coaster without those two things.\u201d</p><p>An hour later they were seated in a restaurant eating bratwurst, potatoes and kraut. Jack was having a very tall beer, and Liz, a glass of water with her meal. She picked at her food, her stomach upset. She seemed to be barely holding it together and every so often a tear would escape and roll pathetically down her cheek. Her fingers continually wandered to that diamond pendant necklace Rick had given her, the promise diamond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure the best way to handle this,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHere\u2019s my idea. See if you agree with it. I\u2019ll go back tomorrow and spend some time with him. I won\u2019t mention what happened until he turns the corner on the pain a little more. We can\u2019t take too much personally while he\u2019s on such heavy drugs. Might be he comes out of that drug haze and feels a little more in control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t? What if he won\u2019t see me?\u201d she asked, and as she spoke, her eyes filled up with tears again.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, we\u2019ll get through the influence of anesthesia and pain drugs before we revisit the issue. We can\u2019t really judge his feelings while he\u2019s on that morphine planet. But he\u2019ll get used to the morphine pretty quick and it won\u2019t make him insane anymore. Then he\u2019ll see you. He will. The nurse said this sort of thing happens a lot, but usually later on. Some patients get real clingy, need a lot of reassurance that they\u2019re still lovable, some actually have such an inferiority complex about their body image, they push loved ones away. Like they don\u2019t deserve love even when it\u2019s offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he be a clingy one?\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>Jack actually laughed. \u201cRick? We both know why. Because he\u2019s too damn proud for his own good, that\u2019s why. Liz, honey, there\u2019s no reason Rick can\u2019t have a completely full, productive life. There\u2019s almost nothing a guy with a prosthetic limb can\u2019t do. I\u2019ve seen news stories on guys with fake legs running marathons. And Rick will learn, he will. He\u2019ll do whatever he wants...eventually. But if I know my boy, he\u2019s going to be a giant pain in the ass getting there.\u201d</p><p>She laughed through some tears.</p><p>\u201cMel told me this story. She said it was too soon to tell Rick, and she didn\u2019t know the half of that. She said she worked with a doctor in the emergency room back in L.A. for a year before she realized he had a prosthetic leg. She never did say how she found out. I don\u2019t know what you know about big-city trauma centers, but those docs have to be fast and strong and steady. And I don\u2019t know how well you know Mel, but she\u2019s demanding as all hell. If she worked with a doc who didn\u2019t pull his weight in any way, she\u2019d be all over him.\u201d He took a drink of his beer. \u201cYeah, she didn\u2019t know about the guy\u2019s leg for a year. What does that tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. But, Liz, it isn\u2019t going to be easy on Rick. He\u2019s dealing with way more than just the leg\u2014he\u2019s been to war. And if it\u2019s not easy on Rick, it\u2019s not going to be easy on us. What do you think of my idea? We give him a little time to settle down? Get through the drug haze before we push on him? We don\u2019t need another crazy outburst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. I\u2019m so disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, honey, I know. Believe me, I never saw that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t help by being here. I thought he\u2019d be glad to know how much I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet when we\u2019re through the worst of this, he will be.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy idea?\u201d Jack pushed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have some time on your hands. I don\u2019t think you should try to see him until the timing is better. Not just for him, honey. For you, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I want to go with you. I won\u2019t go in his room until he says it\u2019s okay, but I want to be there. In case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure the temptation won\u2019t be too strong?\u201d he asked her. \u201cBecause I think until we get a little stability here, you shouldn\u2019t even peek in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay in the waiting room downstairs. I brought my backpack with school stuff. And they have a TV\u2014 I saw an English news program on it. I\u2019ll try to be patient. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. You done eating? We can share this reading material. And I want you to get some rest so you can deal with these ups and downs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said with a small smile.</p><p>Two hours later, Jack stepped outside the hotel and used his cell phone to call Mel. It was nine hours earlier in California and she was at the clinic. When she answered, he just said, \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! Did you see him?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cMel, he\u2019s going to recover. But it was the worst experience of my life. I shouldn\u2019t have brought Liz. He took her apart. Ripped her heart out.\u201d</p> <p>Over his thirty-five-year military career, Walt Booth had seen hundreds of injured soldiers. He\u2019d made dozens and dozens of goodwill visits to hospitals; he\u2019d attended many wheelchair-basketball games and races. He had nothing but respect and admiration for the men and women who turned their physical disabilities into productive lives.</p><p>But something about Rick Sudder\u2019s injuries got to him. He didn\u2019t even know Rick that well. It was probably all about the timing. Walt\u2019s son was army now. Rick and Tom were only a year apart in age and had become friends. Sometimes when Walt thought about Rick coming home with one leg, he got confused in his mind and pictured Tom. He hated that. It cost him sleep. There was no logical reason for it. Tom was tucked away at West Point, working his butt off, studying day and night, not in a war zone.</p><p>He knew he was affected, that it showed on him. Vanni had asked him if he was all right and he admitted the truth\u2014thinking about that strong and vital young man dealing with an injury like this was working on him, grieving him. Muriel had asked him what was wrong in one of their phone calls and he laid it out for her\u2014Jack and Liz had gone to Germany to be there for Rick when he was waking up after surgery and he worried about all of them. \u201cThis war is a hellish business,\u201d he had said. \u201cAnd, Muriel, there\u2019s always a war somewhere. That was my life\u2019s work, staying on top of the wars. And Rick, he\u2019s such a nice young man. So proud and dedicated. I hate to think of his suffering.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been so lovely in her response, consoling him, praising his sensitivity. But what he really wanted was to wrap his arms around her and hold her close. He had no idea how long it would be until he could do that again.</p><p>They didn\u2019t even talk every day. When he called her, he almost always got her voice mail; when she called him, it was usually very early or very late. Sometimes she called him while she was on the treadmill, killing two birds with one stone, and the huffing and puffing was too annoying for him to listen to.</p><p>He soldiered on. It was what he was trained to do. The bar in Virgin River was a little sparse and quiet these days, but he dropped by to see if there was any news from Jack. Sometimes he had dinner with Vanni, Paul and Abby at their house. And he tended Muriel\u2019s horses twice a day, letting them into the corral after feeding them, mucking their stalls, brushing them down, checking their hooves.</p><p>On this particular night, he ate a sandwich and headed for Muriel\u2019s with the dogs in tow. They seemed to love going home. He drove up at dusk and noticed there was an old car parked in front of the porch and all the lights were on inside the big house. The dogs immediately started barking at the front door. He thought about calling Mike V to tell him Muriel\u2019s had been broken into, but instead he fetched a pitchfork from the barn and used his key to let himself in. He knew the dogs would let him know where the intruder was.</p><p>They ran right up the stairs. He followed at a distance and then heard a squeal he definitely recognized.</p><p>He appeared in the bedroom doorway, pitchfork in hand, clad in jeans and a plaid flannel shirt, and looked at the woman in the bed. She was struggling to keep the sheet over her naked breasts, laughing, petting her dogs. \u201cWell!\u201d she said. \u201cAbout time! Maybe I should get a better caretaker. I thought you\u2019d never get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world are you doing here?\u201d he asked, leaning the pitchfork up against the wall.</p><p>She grinned at him and pushed her dogs off the bed. \u201cBringing comfort and joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours. Completely naked and getting cold. Did you close the front door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, a state of shock overwhelming him.</p><p>\u201cThen, Walt, what say you close it. So these dogs don\u2019t have free run of the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel,\u201d he said. \u201cHoly damn, are you a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNow, get that door closed for me. Hmm?\u201d</p><p>He grinned largely. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. I\u2019m in no condition to take care of that. But I am in a condition.\u201d</p><p>He was downstairs and back upstairs in short order. He closed the Labs out of the bedroom and stood at the side of the bed. He looked down at her and his eyes glowed. \u201cYou look a little different,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my hair colored several times. They don\u2019t think I have it right yet.\u201d She held out her hands. \u201cNails. I have nails again. And I\u2019m wearing makeup for a change. But I have the same body. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll come as good news or bad.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. Then he pulled off his boots and clothes, dropped everything on the floor and crawled in beside her, taking her into his arms. \u201cGood news,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, Muriel. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you more, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t even have a goddamn conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsane, isn\u2019t it? I hate the schedule. But I tried to tell you\u2014it\u2019s not about being a star, it\u2019s about working your tail off. There\u2019s never a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a small fit. I\u2019m entitled once in a while. I know all about when and how to do that, you know. A couple of our wannabe stars were missing all sorts of fittings and readings and I finally said, Hey, I have property, animals and a boyfriend up north and I\u2019m not feeling happy about wasting time here, waiting around for people to get it together. I need a day off! So one of the producers rounded up an airplane and gave me a little time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a Lear at that little airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose car do you have parked outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething left in long-term parking by an airport-tower guy who\u2019s out of town. I have permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how much time do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA night and long morning. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not that good at tantrums. But I wanted to see you.\u201d She ran her fingers through his silver hair. \u201cHow are you, Walt? I\u2019ve been a little worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d He lifted the sheets. \u201cI\u2019m getting better by the second.\u201d He ran a big hand down over her shoulder, her breast, all the way to her hip. \u201cYou\u2019re the same here. Your skin may be softer.\u201d And then he covered her mouth with his. He kissed her deeply and thoroughly. \u201cI haven\u2019t fed the horses yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fed them. I didn\u2019t want us to be interrupted,\u201d she said. \u201cOhhhh. I\u2019m really glad I showed up. Do you have any idea how wonderful your hands feel on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said, kissing her cheeks, neck, shoulder, breast.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Well, almost as good as your lips....\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cMuriel, did you just come back for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d she whispered, her eyes closed, her body straining toward his. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cAfter.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her again. \u201cIf I\u2019d said that to you, you would have been highly insulted. But a man is almost never offended to learn he\u2019s needed for sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind? I\u2019m flattered.\u201d He positioned himself over her. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not in a big hurry. I\u2019m planning to take my sweet old time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel,\u201d he laughed. \u201cThank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got first. Then we\u2019ll see if thanks are in order.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh, though he thought she was funny. Instead, he worked her body. He stroked her, kissed her, licked her, entered her and rode her, remembering those wonderful sounds she made when she was getting close. When she came apart on him, boiling over in a fantastic climax, he gave her a moment to thoroughly enjoy herself, and when she was no longer preoccupied with her own pleasure, he took his. He wanted her to feel it deep inside her. And she moaned deliciously, holding on to him, kissing and sucking his shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With his hands on her soft bottom, her lips on his neck and shoulder, he struggled to catch his breath. She probably wouldn\u2019t understand how much he had needed a connection like this with her. He\u2019d been lonely in general, but specifically for Muriel, the woman he\u2019d begun to think of as his other half. Talking to her, touching her, got him past the edge of despair, but it was like this, deep inside her, loving her man to woman, that fed the part of him that was so hungry.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Walt,\u201d she whispered. And he laughed.</p><p>\u201cI think I can squeak in a couple more of those before the landing gear goes up on that Lear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my heavens....\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his side and took her with him, holding her against his body. \u201cIs this normal?\u201d he asked her. \u201cAre we supposed to be having wild, insanely satisfying sex at our age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone should have told me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have taken better care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very well cared for. I have no brain left. You drove it out of me. I can just see the tabloid headlines. The famous Muriel St. Claire found with her brains screwed out in her old farmhouse. Only one suspect comes to mind....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought people, especially men, petered out as they got older....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have regular checkups in the army? Didn\u2019t your doctor ever ask you how things were working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart, my ears, my eyes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that god-awful prostate exam I\u2019ve heard tales about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYup. That was part of the drill. No pun intended. But the closest he ever got to my sex life was asking me if I could still pee over a jeep.\u201d He heard her giggle. He ran his hand along the hair at her temple, brushing it back. \u201cI needed to be with you like this, Muriel. For a while after you left I was afraid I\u2019d imagined the whole thing\u2014our relationship. Thank you for coming back to me. I was starved for your body, your laugh.\u201d</p><p>She locked her fingers together behind his neck. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be there for you. But I have to be honest, darling. I needed you. Just as damn much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like? What you\u2019re doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely begun. We haven\u2019t started filming, but for me it\u2019s well under way. It\u2019s like giving birth\u2014it\u2019s a creation for me. I become another woman. I feel her, channel her, give her the space to grow. And when we\u2019re finished and if the editing is good, I\u2019ll see something I made as surely as if I gave it life. She won\u2019t be me, though the character is about as close to my own as I could get. She\u2019ll be a completely new being that I shaped. It does something for me that\u2019s really close to my heart. My soul. To you it will be just a seven-dollar ticket and two hours of your life you\u2019ll never get back, but to me it\u2019s conception, gestation and delivery.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cThen you can\u2019t ever stop doing it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I was a full-time actress for forty years and I worked whenever I could get work, which, fortunately for me, was very often. Now if I work, it will be for something I consider very important, very much worth my personal investment. I put a lot of myself into these roles, it\u2019s not just showing up on the set. I\u2019m lucky\u2014I like this life I have here and I no longer have to work full-time to make ends meet. For someone in my business, it\u2019s a huge luxury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope the way I say this doesn\u2019t come out wrong,\u201d Walt said. \u201cI hope you have lots of chances to do something that fills you up like that. And I hope you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work this out, Walt. There are lots of options for us. You can always travel, too. Come to me.\u201d</p> <p>He stiffened in shock. \u201cMuriel, can you honestly see me on a movie set? With two dogs following me and a pitchfork in my hand?\u201d</p><p>It made her giggle. \u201cI can see you almost anywhere.\u201d</p><p>In only a couple of days, Rick\u2019s pain management was greatly improved. As long as he didn\u2019t get behind on the drugs, he\u2019d be relatively comfortable. And while he wouldn\u2019t get his final prosthetic leg for two to three months, he\u2019d begin rehab immediately and have a temporary limb he could work with in a few weeks. They were going to ship him out to the Naval Medical Center in San Diego to at least start his rehab until they could find a facility closer to home. But he didn\u2019t necessarily want to be closer to home.</p><p>\u201cIf it can be worked out,\u201d Jack said, \u201cI\u2019d like to bring you home to Virgin River to stay with me and Mel. We can get you to rehab several times a week\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rick looked down into his lap. Every time he did that, the stump shocked him. \u201cListen,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI appreciate it, I do, but I already told the caseworker I didn\u2019t care where they sent me for rehab. Because I don\u2019t want to go home with a walker or crutches. Without a leg.\u201d</p><p>Jack was mute for a second, staring at him. This was the first he\u2019d heard of this. He grabbed a chair from across the room and pulled it right up to Rick\u2019s bed and spoke quietly so as not to be overheard by the other patients. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, Rick. It\u2019s not as if you can keep this a secret. I called Mel, told her your condition so she could tell all those people waiting to hear. It had to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m not trying to keep it a secret. I\u2019m alive, that\u2019s enough. But if there\u2019s going to be a struggle, I don\u2019t need everyone watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to take that route?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t see a lot of watching, but maybe a lot of supporting. We\u2019re on your team. You can\u2019t be as happy to be alive as we all are to have you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, can I just do this my way? This isn\u2019t going to be simple. Do you know how much is involved in getting a leg? Learning to use it? I just heard a little about it this morning and it sounds like\u2014 It takes a long time, it hurts, it\u2019s hard to manage, do you realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely do,\u201d Jack said. \u201cMe and Liz, we\u2019ve been reading up. Talking to people. Learning the ropes. So we can do whatever you need us to do.\u201d</p><p>Rick looked away. \u201cI need you to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Jack was speechless for a second. Then he gathered himself up and spoke. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done screwing with this. You have to see Liz now. Today. A couple of days ago you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, not making eye contact. \u201cIt was the pain. I know I overreacted. I\u2019ll see her. I\u2019ll tell her I\u2019m sorry about how I acted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Jack said sternly. When Rick met his eyes, Jack said, \u201cI know you\u2019re not in a good place right now, but this will pass. I\u2019m going to send Liz in. At the least, tell her you didn\u2019t realize you were being mean and that you appreciate her coming all this way and sitting in a hospital lobby all alone, scared to death to show her face around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Jack,\u201d he said, meeting his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? I\u2019m bad luck. I\u2019m not good for people.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s head jerked to attention. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad things happen to me, around me. Things don\u2019t go right when I\u2019m around. It started when I was two.\u201d</p><p>Jack was astonished. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head. \u201cMy parents died. My grandma got real sick. One strike and I got my girl pregnant. Her baby died. I went into the Marines and the squad clearing the street for us died. I got blown up. Come on. I\u2019m a walking disaster.\u201d He laughed unkindly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m a disaster who can\u2019t even walk.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned toward him. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a new leg that will work almost as good as the one you lost and you can get on with your life. It\u2019s the stuff of life, we have some shit to deal with and we move ahead. You\u2019ll move ahead, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your parents die when you were barely two? Did your first baby die? Did you get blown up in the war?\u201d</p><p>Jack had a tempting moment. He never focused on the things that had gone terribly wrong\u2014it was hard enough to put them away when you didn\u2019t think about them all the time. It was a horrible trap, letting yourself list the stuff in the negative column. He\u2019d always stayed away from that. But Rick\u2019s questions were like a challenge and he wanted to stand up, bear down on him with a glare and shout, Yeah, I held more than one Marine while he was fucking dying and there was no way to save him\u2014it gets me screwed up sometimes. I couldn\u2019t find a woman to bond with till I was forty! My mother died too young! My baby sister was raped and beaten! My wife, my heart, almost died of a hemorrhage! My boy Rick got blown up in the war. It wasn\u2019t the same stuff, but it was nasty stuff that made me weep. Instead, Jack calmly looked at Rick and said, \u201cA lot of what happened to you\u2014it happened to me, too. Because I was there with you. Someday you\u2019re going to find out that when someone you care about suffers, you suffer right along with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d Rick said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to be left alone. So you don\u2019t have to. Suffer.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood up. \u201cNot that simple. Sending me away isn\u2019t going to make me feel a lot better, but I\u2019m not getting into that with you till you have some time to adjust. I\u2019m going to tell Liz to come in now. Be nice to her. I\u2019m going to take her back to California and I don\u2019t want her crying all the way home.\u201d</p><p>Rick made a face that was most definitely a grimace. As he looked up and saw the determined set to Jack\u2019s jaw and his narrowing eyes, he knew there was no way out of this. It terrified him. If he couldn\u2019t hang on to the anger, he was going to break down and cry like a girl. He would not cry in front of Liz; he would not cry in front of these wounded soldiers. \u201cFine,\u201d he said to Jack. \u201cTell her to come in.\u201d</p><p>Rick took a lot of deep, fortifying breaths while he waited. Then he looked over his shoulder and saw her standing uncertainly in the doorway to the ward. God, she looked more beautiful than he\u2019d remembered, than the vision of her in his dreams, of which he had far too many. He scowled. He wasn\u2019t sure he could do this. He stared at her and crooked a finger, bidding her to come closer. She walked slowly across the room until she stood in front of him.</p><p>For a second he almost hated her; at least he hated the look of pain in her eyes. He wanted to shout, You think it hurts to get yelled at? Try this!</p><p>He attempted a small smile and said, \u201cBe careful, Lizzie. Don\u2019t get too close. If you rub up against the wrong place, I\u2019ll go through the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you? If I don\u2019t touch any other part of you?\u201d</p><p>Bad idea, he thought. But he was stuck\u2014everyone in the room was watching. Without even looking he knew Jack was standing in the doorway, making sure Liz was safe from him. \u201cLean over toward me. Real careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about the phantom pain,\u201d she said. \u201cI read all about it. I\u2019m staying far away from where the leg was.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and studied her for a minute. This was going to be harder than ever because she wasn\u2019t put off by the sight of the bandaged stump. There was no question about it\u2014nothing in her feelings had been changed by this. And that was such a big mistake on her part.</p><p>He put out his hand, on his left side away from the amputation, and pulled her closer to that side. She leaned toward him and he met her lips for a short, unsatisfying peck of a kiss. Behind eyes he briefly closed he remembered making love to her, before and after the baby they\u2019d lost. Wonderful, beautiful, fantastic love that could sustain him for a lifetime. It all came back to him in a colorful, sensual flash; he could smell her skin, taste her sweet body. And then in an equally quick flash, he tried to picture making love to her without his leg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He opened his eyes and pulled back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was mean to you, Liz. I was kind of out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m sorry that my being here didn\u2019t help you as much as I thought it would. But when I heard you were hurt, I just had to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone tell you what\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d he asked her unemotionally.</p> <p>\u201cSort of. You\u2019ll have rehab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be transferred to Balboa, the Naval Medical Center. Some people go to other places once they\u2019re healed up a little, but some stay there, live in barracks. Two to three months. Then I\u2019ll be medically discharged or medically retired. After I learn to walk on a fake leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProsthesis,\u201d she corrected, pushing her long hair over her ear.</p><p>\u201cYes. Fine. While I\u2019m doing that, you get ready to graduate. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready now, except for a couple of papers and finals,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting all As.\u201d</p> <p>He almost smiled but caught himself. \u201cListen, I know you want to help me, but the best thing you can do for me right now is understand\u2014rehab is going to be a big job. Full-time. I\u2019m not coming home until I\u2019m through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d she said, nodding, smiling tremulously. \u201cWe can finally have phone calls again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick?\u201d she asked, tilting her head, tears gathering in her eyes. \u201cWill we have phone calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, squeezing her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t start crying, Liz. I can\u2019t take care of you right now, you have to get that. You have to be strong because I can\u2019t take care of you. Taking care of this is enough work.\u201d He waved at the stump with his free hand. \u201cI can\u2019t be worrying that something I did or said made you cry. Cut it out.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed back the threat of tears and held her mouth in a rigid line so her pinkened lips wouldn\u2019t tremble. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. It won\u2019t take that long. And at least it\u2019s not Iraq.\u201d She sniffed again. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to say goodbye to you again, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t a good idea for you to come all this way. If I hadn\u2019t given up a spleen, I\u2019d have been out of here in forty-eight hours. On a medical transport to the States. Kind of hard to catch up with.\u201d He saw the stricken look in her eyes and quickly said, \u201cBut hey, it was real nice of you to come and I appreciate it. I\u2019m sorry I was so mean\u2014I had no idea what I was doing, saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay. I love you, Ricky.\u201d</p><p>Say it back, he told himself. You can\u2019t not say it back, that would be cruel. But he didn\u2019t want her to know he still loved her, it wasn\u2019t good for her to be bound by that. And then he reminded himself, he wasn\u2019t going to break it off with her here, like this. That would come later. So he took too long but he finally said, \u201cI love you, too, baby.\u201d Maybe adding baby would lessen the blow of his hesitation. \u201cSorry, my brain is like mud. All these drugs, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack said in another few days you\u2019ll get used to the pain drugs and be more lucid.\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. His Lizzie didn\u2019t use words like lucid and understand the meaning. \u201cRight,\u201d he said. He pulled on her hand. \u201cNow, come on, give me a nice little kiss goodbye, be strong for me, and we\u2019ll catch up later, when I\u2019m settled in rehab. Huh?\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him and gave him another kiss, another kiss like she might\u2019ve given her brother if she had one.</p><p>\u201cAt least I know you\u2019re safe now,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll still miss you, while you\u2019re in rehab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you already,\u201d he whispered back, not wanting to, not meaning to. \u201cNow go on. Don\u2019t drag this out. It\u2019s too hard.\u201d</p> <p>He turned and watched her go, seeing Jack standing in the doorway, glowering. Oh, he\u2019d pissed off the big man. Too fucking bad, he thought. Maybe everyone would have been better off if he hadn\u2019t made it. He brought bad karma.</p><p>He turned back to the wall and struggled with self-pity. Just thinking about those phone calls he used to have with Liz, back when they were younger and talked every night, was enough to make him cry like a baby. He couldn\u2019t believe the level of self-loathing he felt, that he brought so much pain on people. And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, he couldn\u2019t see the end of his own pain. The empty space where there was supposed to be a leg and foot hurt like hell. He couldn\u2019t imagine how that was possible, but the doctor explained something about neurons still delivering the message to his brain that his missing limb hurt. The stupid neurons didn\u2019t know his leg ended above the knee.</p><p>He heard the sound of one of his roommates, a thirty-five-year-old guy he knew only as Stu, using the trapeze over his bed to heft himself out and transfer to his wheelchair. Then he heard the squeaking of the wheels and hoped Stu was going for a ride down the hall.</p><p>But no. Stu wheeled himself in front of Rick. Stu wasn\u2019t sent out of Landstuhl because he\u2019d been stationed here when he had an accident that caused a spinal cord injury. Stu had his legs, but he wasn\u2019t going to be using them.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Stu said, looking up at him. \u201cBeautiful girl, adores you, and you shut her down. You have a brain tumor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Rick said, looking away. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I haven\u2019t had yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the leg hurts, but your lips don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you mind your own business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a little town here, this ward. It\u2019s impossible to mind your own business. And you\u2019re FUBAR, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we knew that,\u201d Rick said, smiling meanly. \u201cNo reason for me to fuck her up, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I heard, just minding my own business in this little town of ours, you already fucked her up, and now you\u2019re cutting her loose. We need to get you a new MRI on your head\u2014you definitely have a brain tumor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t get this yet, but people care about you. They come running all the way from the States when you\u2019re hurt. And you\u2019re going to walk back into that homeplace of yours, looking just like you looked before you left until you take your pants off. Everything\u2019s going to work just fine. But you\u2019re too lame to see that right now. You working on pissing everyone off till they hate you? You could just be happy you have this much going for you. How about that?\u201d</p><p>Rick glared at him. \u201cNo, Stu. I can\u2019t just be happy.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Jack thought about sending Liz home and staying around Frankfurt until he could see that Rick was on his way to San Diego, but in the end he decided to go with Liz and let Rick have the space he was asking for. He didn\u2019t think Rick was being logical or smart, but stubborn went a long way. Rick verged on irrational, and yet, as Jack was beginning to understand, this behavior was not out of the ordinary for a young man in his situation. After all, he was hurting all over, physically.</p><p>So he said to Rick, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving in the morning and I\u2019m going back tonight. I\u2019ll get in touch by phone and once you\u2019ve had a decent start on your PT, I\u2019ll come down and visit. Just a real quick visit\u2014you don\u2019t have to put out the china or anything. I just want to check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI can just let you know how I\u2019m getting along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might be more for me than you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd if you need anything, even just someone to talk to, call. If you need me, I can come. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Jack put a hand around the kid\u2019s neck and pulled him briefly against his chest, holding him close for a second. Even like that, Rick was so far away. He didn\u2019t hug back. He put one hand on Jack\u2019s arm and that was it. For a brief and terrible moment, Jack wished Rick would fall apart, take his comfort.</p><p>When Rick and Liz\u2019s baby was born dead a couple of years ago, Rick had needed Jack\u2019s and Preacher\u2019s strength to keep him on his feet, to keep him from crumbling. He\u2019d needed the men he\u2019d grown to think of as fathers to bolster him so he could keep Liz from losing it. They\u2019d spent hours talking, supporting, soothing, lending the strength of their experiences.</p><p>Right now Rick didn\u2019t want anything from anyone, and for Jack this was horrible. It was like being rejected as a father figure.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack,\u201d Rick said. \u201cIt was nice of you to come all this way. Sorry I\u2019m not good company.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled at him, a completely indulgent smile. \u201cRick, there wasn\u2019t anything else I could do. Like it or not, that\u2019s the way it is with best friends. If it was me in the bed, you\u2019d be right here.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of emotion crossed Rick\u2019s features, but it didn\u2019t last long. \u201cThanks. Have a good trip home.\u201d</p><p>Normally Rick would have told him to give Mel his love, but on this visit he hadn\u2019t even asked about her or the kids. In fact, he asked if his grandmother was holding up and that was all. He didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone, see anyone, think about anyone. The way he was isolating himself from feeling not only worried Jack, it was completely familiar to him. Jack had been in a few bad situations in the Marines and he\u2019d been too goddamn stoic for his own good. But, he reminded himself, he had somehow grown out of most of that. He had survived the traumas of combat.</p><p>The one who surprised him more was Liz. Jack was afraid he\u2019d be dragging a weeping, sniveling seventeen-year-old basket case back across the Atlantic, but Liz, although troubled and sad, seemed to be in control of her emotions. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, you know,\u201d she said to Jack while they sat together on the airplane. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he doesn\u2019t love me anymore. But I understand I can\u2019t know that for sure until he gets better. And he will get better. I was terrified that we\u2019d get to Germany to find out he was\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Jack squeezed her hand. \u201cI know, kiddo,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, he\u2019s hurting and he\u2019s screwed up right now, but he has no idea what he\u2019s getting himself into. I offered to bring him home to my house and drive him to PT as many times a week as he needed to go and he rejected that. He said he didn\u2019t want anyone watching his struggle. Well, I talked to the social worker right before we packed up and left. When he gets to the hospital in San Diego, everyone will be watching him. They have a new care unit they call C-5\u2014Comprehensive Combat and Complex Casualty Care. There\u2019s a large amputee unit that combines everything from orthopedics and psych to drug treatment. He might be kicking and screaming the whole time, but as long as he\u2019s there, there will be treatment for whatever is going on with him. And that missing leg isn\u2019t all that\u2019s going on with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on with him?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not sure I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny guess.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cCould be what they used to call battle fatigue, but it\u2019s really just the shock of seeing terrible things, doing things you wish you hadn\u2019t had to do, denial, rage, fear. Add on top of that, he got hurt real bad and is minus a leg. He can get a good prosthesis, but he can\u2019t ever get that leg back. He\u2019s wounded, worried about the future and, for that matter, worried about the past. His war past. He\u2019s going to the best possible place to get help with that. You and me? We can\u2019t help him as much as they can. Bad as it hurts that he doesn\u2019t want our help, it\u2019s probably the best thing that could happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he gets himself back,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause no matter what, I\u2019m probably going to love him forever.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head against Jack\u2019s shoulder in the narrow, confining airplane seats. Without looking at Jack, she said, \u201cRemember back when I was pregnant?\u201d Then she laughed hollowly. \u201cFifteen and pregnant. God. Talk about hurt, scared and pissed off....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRick was only seventeen,\u201d Jack inserted.</p><p>\u201cAnd he did everything he could for me. You can\u2019t believe the things he did. He protected me from the popular girls who made fun of me, pointed at me, tortured me. He got in a fight because some guy said something mean about me and Rick defended me. He didn\u2019t want to get married, but I wanted to so bad because I was scared of being alone, of my mom and aunt taking the baby away from me....\u201d She looked up at Jack and smiled. \u201cSo he ran away with me. Trying to give me anything I needed to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled back, stroking her hair. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get too far,\u201d he said, remembering. He\u2019d gone after them, brought them back.</p> <p>Her fingers were on that small diamond again, running it back and forth along the chain around her neck. \u201cYou know what I want to do? I want to hitchhike to San Diego and stand outside his hospital room and yell and cry and beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI want to, but I won\u2019t. I can see he doesn\u2019t want me right now and that would only make things worse. I just can\u2019t think what I should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever check out those support groups?\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cJack, if you\u2019re not married to the Marine, no one has any time for you. And that\u2019s that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought the people in the group would...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould bend the rules?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo. Jack, I think I\u2019m on my own this time.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and brushed her hair across her pretty brow. He couldn\u2019t relate to this. There was no special girl from years back that, if he saw her again, he\u2019d regret letting get away. And he wasn\u2019t even sure Rick and Liz were meant to be, despite all they\u2019d been through together. But they were, individually, such incredible kids. So strong. They shouldn\u2019t have to be that strong at their tender ages.</p><p>Could fate throw any more at them?</p><p>\u201cNah, you\u2019re not on your own. Not while I\u2019m around. Not while Mel\u2019s around. I\u2019ll mention to Mel that you\u2019re not getting any support. If anyone has ideas, it\u2019s Mel.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel it was his job to get them together. But if there was anything he could do to get them through this dark patch so each of them could carry on without terrible damage, he\u2019d damn sure try.</p><p>Jack and Liz flew from Frankfurt to Kennedy International to Denver to Redding. Before heading out of Redding to Eureka, they visited a cell-phone store where Jack bought a phone. There was no reception in the mountains; they relied on pagers and landlines. But there was plenty of reception in San Diego. He FedExed the phone to Rick, to Lance Corporal Richard Sudder. He scrawled a note:</p> <p>Just so I can reach you. So you can reach me.</p><p>And anyone else you want to talk to. Jack.</p><p>Then he took Liz home to Eureka. He carried her suitcase up to the porch for her and it was there that she wrapped her arms around him, laid her head on his chest and cried. \u201cThank you for everything you did for me. For Rick. I\u2019ll pay you back somehow.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin. \u201cLiz, I did it because I thought it was an important thing to do. It wasn\u2019t a loan. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I think you wasted your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. We needed to see him alive. Think about it\u2014alive and pissed off is so much better than what it could\u2019ve been. Let\u2019s stick with that. And move ahead the best we can.\u201d He paused. \u201cHe needs time.\u201d</p><p>Then he drove the rest of the way to Virgin River.</p><p>Normally, when he had dealt with something confusing or emotional, the one person he wanted to talk to, be with, would be Mel. She had this uncanny knack for zeroing in on a problem, cutting through the flab and attacking the situation with reality, honesty, wisdom.</p> <p>This time he went to his bar and looked for Preacher. They\u2019d been to Iraq together twice and had been through some ugly stuff. Preacher had been wounded pretty bad the first time and Jack had carried him about a mile to get him to medical transport, but Preacher had come away with all his parts.</p><p>The bar was quiet; a couple of guys were sharing a pitcher and playing cribbage, so Jack went back to the kitchen where Preach was slicing and dicing. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJack! Whoa, man. When did you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeconds ago. I need to go over to the clinic, see Mel and the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s a goddamn mess. Hurt, pissed, so angry, isolating, doesn\u2019t want a friend, doesn\u2019t want help, barely acknowledged that Liz and I flew across the fucking Atlantic to carry his body home.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievably, Preacher smiled. \u201cGood. He\u2019s getting stage one covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStage one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe one and two. Anger and denial. He\u2019s gonna have to grieve the leg, the war wounds, the time he lost from his young life. There\u2019s probably going to be five stages.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned on the worktable, his brow wrinkled. \u201cHow do you know this shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked it up on the computer. You know, after you figure out e-mail, there are other things you can do on that computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next for him?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get my cheat sheet, but it could be bargaining\u2014I\u2019ll never commit another sin if you just let me live. That kind of thing. We\u2019ve all done that. All that\u2019s really important is\u2014it ends in acceptance.\u201d</p><p>Jack straightened. \u201cHow long does it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s the thing,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cIt depends on the person. Rick? He\u2019s pretty tough. It could stretch out. He doesn\u2019t let go easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Jack said, running a hand along the back of his neck. \u201cWhy do I always think I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno, Jack,\u201d he answered with a shrug. \u201cBut Rick\u2014we\u2019re just at angry? And his body, his health\u2014that\u2019s under control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still in a lot of pain, on drugs for it, shipping to San Diego as we speak. Balboa. NMCSD. He\u2019ll heal up the stump and start physical therapy. They could keep him until he gets his leg or farm him out to some smaller facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to heal and shrink. They can\u2019t fit him until it\u2019s ready\u2014no swelling, no redness, no tenderness. They\u2019ll get that stump in a shrinker, looks like a skull cap kind of. It\u2019s real important, before they fit the prosthesis, that it\u2019s not swollen or anything. They\u2019ll work with him in PT to avoid muscle contractures and desensitize that stump to get beyond the phantom pain. A lot of physical therapists will put a healthy, healed stump in a bowl of crunchy dry cornflakes and grind it around to kind of teach the nerves that the leg ends there.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cHow do you know this shit?\u201d Preacher just tilted his head and smirked. \u201cYou looked it up, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted to understand the news you brought home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is the news?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Preacher shrugged. \u201cPretty much on target.\u201d</p><p>Rick began his stay in San Diego in the Naval Medical Center orthopedics ward, which he shared with other young men recovering from recent injuries. While there, he was evaluated for his pain management and physical therapy program. Before the end of the week, he was having PT every day and had been issued both a walker and wheelchair, but he had little interest in leaving the ward.</p><p>He assessed the condition of the other patients and came to the conclusion there was no predicting how people got through trauma like this. Some were downright cheerful in spite of terrible pain, some were horribly depressed. He judged himself to be right about in the middle\u2014neither cheerful nor catatonic with gloom. Once they started slacking off on the narcotics, it was harder to sleep. It was like trying to catch a nap in an amphitheater\u2014there was always noise, light, movement. There were cries in the night, sometimes from a breakout of pain, sometimes from nightmares. One guy cried for his mother in his sleep. Moans, groans and, unbelievably, even laughter punctuated the darkness. Rick was afraid to succumb to sleep lest he scream and expose the depth of his vulnerability.</p><p>Once the cell phone had arrived, there was already a message waiting\u2014Jack. \u201cRick, give me a call when you get the phone so I know we\u2019re operational. Call anyone you like\u2014there\u2019s no limit on the minutes.\u201d Rick didn\u2019t call him. He kept thinking he would pretty soon, but after a few days the phone twittered and the caller ID signaled Jack. This time the message was more commanding. \u201cRick, if you don\u2019t call me back, I\u2019m going to drive down there to be sure you\u2019re getting by all right.\u201d</p><p>Trapped, he returned the call. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just haven\u2019t felt like talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk long. How are they treating you? Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Rick sighed. This wasn\u2019t what he had in mind. But, it was better to have Jack on a phone than in his face, so he\u2019d have to play along. \u201cI\u2019m still in the hospital, moving to barracks with other PT patients tomorrow. I get around in a chair or walker. Mostly the chair because it\u2019s easier. Another week or two and I\u2019ll get a preparatory prosthesis and start walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreparatory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first step before the real fake leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. How are the other guys there doing? Meeting anyone you can, you know, talk to?\u201d</p><p>Rick was silent for a long moment. Then he said, \u201cNot a lot of laughs around here, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019ll get better when you\u2019re in barracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe. Listen, I\u2019m pretty tired....\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Haven\u2019t had enough rest yet?\u201d When Rick didn\u2019t respond, Jack said, \u201cOkay, buddy, I\u2019ll let you get some rest. I\u2019ll call tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>One thing about the barracks, the men were in various stages of recovery. They weren\u2019t all newly injured like Rick. One guy was practicing tying his shoes with two prosthetic arms while another was strapping on his preparatory prosthesis in the morning and using only a cane to assist him with balance. But the routine was different here\u2014no more food on a tray or bath out of a basin at the bedside. Here it was a mess hall and showers. Rick had to admit, a real shower felt damn good, even if he did have to have his stump wrapped because the wound wasn\u2019t completely healed. And he sat on a stool in the shower to be safe. But getting himself to the cafeteria for a gang meal wasn\u2019t his idea of a good time.</p><p>There were guys here who played poker, passed around pictures of their wives/girls/kids as well as magazines\u2014mostly porn. \u201cGotta keep the pipes clear,\u201d one guy laughed as he tossed a nudie magazine on Rick\u2019s bed. There were men in barracks with no hope of ever clearing the pipes, paraplegics who\u2019d lost movement and feeling from the waist down. Rick knew that if his brain and emotions were engaged right, he\u2019d see they had it worse and experience some gratitude. But his head was tangled around powerful feelings of doom and an overwhelming sense of loss that he couldn\u2019t talk about. Hell, he couldn\u2019t even understand it. He just felt it so deep, as if everything had slipped away from him and couldn\u2019t be rescued\u2014the life he\u2019d had before war, the body he\u2019d had, the dreams and goals.</p><p>He\u2019d like to talk about it but just couldn\u2019t bring himself to. Liz called a couple of times and even though he didn\u2019t pick up, he listened to her messages over and over. She loved him, she was praying every day that he was doing okay in rehab, that he was feeling more positive.</p><p>He\u2019d always been able to talk to Liz. Even though they\u2019d started out as lovers, right out of the chute, they had always been best friends. They\u2019d been thrown into the deep end of the pool, with pregnancy, fetal death, war. They\u2019d never have stayed together so long if they hadn\u2019t been able to talk and write about their issues. They held on to each other through so much confusion and fear, got each other through not just by talking, but by listening. Jack had taught him that: Don\u2019t worry about saying the right thing, Rick. Let Liz tell you what scares her and tell her you won\u2019t abandon her\u2014that\u2019s all she really wants from you. Had Jack talked to Liz? Advised her? Because it seemed as if she\u2019d always done that for him, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure how she got on the naval base, but he opened his eyes one night and she was there, sitting on the edge of his bed. He could hear the sounds around him, so he knew he was awake\u2014there was snuffling in beds, moaning, humming, snoring.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked her, panicked, immediately afraid she was going to be in deep trouble. Maybe arrested.</p><p>She reached out a hand and ran her pretty fingers over his temple, down his cheek, softly over his lips. \u201cI thought maybe you needed me, Ricky. And I knew I needed you.\u201d Then she leaned over him and touched his lips with hers. He inhaled sharply, smelling her scent, tasting her special taste. His girl. Not a girl, a woman, and she never let him forget she belonged to him and he belonged to her. He\u2019d had some dates, some making out with girls before Lizzie, but she was the whole deal for him. They might have started out a couple of clumsy, stupid kids, but by now they knew each other\u2019s bodies and needs and their sex was rich and powerful and satisfying.</p> <p>She fed him sweet kisses and he swallowed her little moans. \u201cShh,\u201d he said to her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get in so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI pulled the curtain.\u201d</p><p>He glanced and saw that they were as alone as they could be in a barracks, the privacy panels separating his bed from his neighbors. And the sounds of sleep and dreams were all around him. He went after her mouth again. Her perfect, soft, round mouth, her full lips. He ran a hand down her side to her hip and over. She was wearing that tiny denim skirt. Ohhh, that little skirt. He slid his hand under and she was bare. He let his fingers explore while she kissed him; his baby, she was wet and ready. This wasn\u2019t a good idea, he thought. Not here. But he was ready, too.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d he said, lying her down next to him. And she answered with that soft little moan he knew so well. \u201cCome here, I need you. I need you so bad right now.\u201d It was crowded in his little bed, but he rose onto his side, looking down at her. His Liz, his beautiful, sweet, loyal Liz. He slipped one hand under her shirt to capture a breast, the other went under her skirt to probe her a little. He had to cover her mouth with his to silence her moans. But then he pushed up her shirt and pulled her pretty nipple into his mouth and he didn\u2019t care if she moaned. He was in heaven.</p><p>Sometimes this was all it took; Liz had always been so hot. He\u2019d run his tongue around her nipple, suck a little, stroke her between her legs and she\u2019d plunge right into an orgasm. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me,\u201d he whispered into her mouth. He licked, sucked, stroked and she came apart, hot and wet, gasping. He heard himself laugh softly. Then he positioned himself over her, mounted her, rising above her, finding and entering her. God, she felt so good he thought he was going to die.</p> <p>He pumped and drove into her and heard her hum. \u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d she whispered. And his hand snaked down between their tight bodies to find that clitoris again, rubbing it. He knew his woman; this was what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t get caught, I\u2019m going to put my face in you and stay there an hour,\u201d he promised her. \u201cI just can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said softly. \u201cPlease please please please...\u201d</p><p>And he erupted. Went off like a rocket, pulsing and coming until there was nothing left inside him. His eyes were pinched tight, he was bathed in sweat, and for a second he wondered how she\u2019d gotten him on his back. And then he opened his eyes and realized he was alone.</p><p>She\u2019d only been there in his mind, in his dream. But God, what a dream. It was so real, so perfect, exactly as he remembered.</p><p>He panted for a while, catching his breath. He looked and there had been no privacy screen. But it seemed everyone was asleep; no one was sitting up looking at him. He had a momentary hope he hadn\u2019t been talking in his sleep, but a glance around told him it had all happened in his head, under his sheet.</p> <p>And then he realized that in his dream, he\u2019d held himself over her with two complete, undamaged legs, kneeling between her legs. He gasped at the memory, so vivid. Soundless, hot tears rolled from his eyes across his temples. Oh, Liz... Oh, baby....</p><p>Mel and Jack struggled to get their family back to normal. Jack had been home for two weeks. He had talked with Rick, but he wasn\u2019t getting very far with him. Rick would take his calls if he was near the cell phone, but he neither initiated nor returned them. \u201cThis might require more patience than you have,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t headed for a quick fix. It\u2019s going to take months. Maybe years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths,\u201d Jack mimicked, disappointment drawing out the word. And then, \u201cYears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, even if he weren\u2019t wounded, catastrophically wounded at that, his return from a war zone would be a serious adjustment. Every family of every soldier goes through this. And you know that.\u201d</p><p>But while Jack knew it, he didn\u2019t really know it from experience. He\u2019d always been active duty and had only visited his family. He moved on to the next challenge and if anyone thought he\u2019d gotten depressed or crazy, they didn\u2019t mention it. Certainly Jack knew he was adjusting after a combat assignment, he just didn\u2019t think anyone else knew. And of course he\u2019d never sustained an injury that would retire or discharge him.</p><p>Although Rick was on Mel\u2019s mind every bit as much, she had other people to care for. She had called Liz regularly and talked with her in person when Liz came to town to help her aunt Connie in the corner store. She convinced her to visit that counselor who helped her after her baby had been stillborn, a definite step forward. A couple of women from town were prenatals and she did all she could to assist Cameron in the clinic with other patients.</p><p>At the end of March spring teased the mountains\u2014one day pleasantly warm and a few days later, an icy rain, a threat of snow. Mel was seeing a prenatal patient one afternoon when she heard a commotion in the front of the clinic. Fortunately she wasn\u2019t doing internal exams; she stepped out of the room to see a breathless, skinny man who looked to be in his sixties in a panic as he yelled at Cameron, waving his arms excitedly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dyin\u2019, I know it! You gotta come! She\u2019s dyin\u2019!\u201d</p> <p>Cameron looked over his shoulder. \u201cMel?\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward. \u201cWhere are we going, sir?\u201d she asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cA couple blocks. Hurry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me excuse my patient, Cam. Fire up the Hummer, get the gentleman in it and I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>So while Cameron and the man got into the Hummer, she told her patient she had an emergency and would call her to complete the exam another time. They didn\u2019t bother locking up for something like this; the drug cabinet and patient records were already locked. Because Mel had appointments, the children were with their aunt Brie for the afternoon, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be able to hurry along with Cameron until Jack or someone could come for them.</p><p>Cameron followed the man\u2019s directions two blocks to a house that Mel recognized at once. She\u2019d been here before, months and months ago, when she fetched thirty-two-year-old Cheryl Creighton from her alcoholic stupor and carted her off to a county-funded treatment facility. She had never seen Cheryl\u2019s father, who this must be. But she would never forget Cheryl\u2019s mother\u2014she was a morbidly obese chain-smoker who wheezed with every laboring step she took. One look at her and Mel had worried about the woman\u2019s heart. If it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that since she first laid eyes on Mrs. Creighton they\u2019d had a major forest fire and lost their town doctor, Mel would have had a pang of guilt for not checking on her, even though she was not a patient.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your wife\u2019s name, Mr. Creighton?\u201d Mel asked as they pulled up to the house.</p><p>\u201cDahlia,\u201d he answered. \u201cDahlia Marie. She can\u2019t breathe and she\u2019s grippin\u2019 at her chest.\u201d</p><p>Cameron threw the Hummer into park and, grabbing his bag, ran up the steps, across the broken-down porch and through the front door, Mel close on his heels with her own bag. \u201cShe\u2019ll be in the kitchen,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>The familiar squalor greeted them; the little house hadn\u2019t been cleaned in forever and smelled like an ashtray. As Mr. Creighton hurried behind them, she was aware of his wheezing.</p><p>As Mel had predicted, Dahlia was slumped back in her favorite kitchen chair, the mess of paperbacks, magazines, newspapers, Coke cans, ashtrays and miscellaneous food items like cookies and chips all within reaching distance. Her eyes were round and fearful, her lips turning blue while her pallid skin glistened with sweat. She had trouble breathing. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can help, Dahlia,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cameron had the stethoscope in his ears and pressed against her chest. He listened for only a second before reaching in his bag and giving her an aspirin. \u201cCan you swallow this for me, Dahlia?\u201d he asked. While she did so, he reached for the new blood-pressure cuff that fit around her wrist, tightened it and took an electronic reading. He lifted that hand against her breast, nearer her heart, for accuracy.</p><p>Mel was locating the emergency drugs she kept ready in her bag\u2014atropine, epinephrine.</p><p>\u201cMel, can you manage the oxygen canister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, darting out of the house. By the time she got back, Cameron was slipping a nitro tablet under Dahlia\u2019s tongue. She pulled out the tubing and fit the cannulas into the woman\u2019s nose. \u201cThis will help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe need a transport,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d Mel said. \u201cGive me one second.\u201d She saw the old-fashioned wall phone beside the refrigerator and picked it up, dialing with the rotary dial. \u201cPreacher, hey. Cameron and I are at the Creighton house and have to take Mrs. Creighton to the hospital right now. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I need\u2014both of you. Thanks.\u201d She hung up and told Cameron, \u201cJack and Preacher will be right here to help.\u201d</p><p>Cameron looked at her, smiled slightly and lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get the gurney and bring it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You handle this and start an IV. I won\u2019t be a minute.\u201d</p><p>By the time Mel had the gurney out of the back of the Hummer, Jack and Preacher were jogging up the block toward the house. She didn\u2019t wait for them, but began to push the gurney toward the house, over the cracked and broken walk. When she reached the porch, the men were beside her, lifting the gurney up onto the slanted porch, avoiding the missing boards. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jack asked softly.</p><p>\u201cPossible coronary,\u201d she said just as quietly. \u201cShe needs to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to drive so you can ride in the back with Cameron?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him suddenly. \u201cYou boys come in so handy. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Preacher got the gurney as far as the kitchen doorway and lowered it like professional paramedics. Then they went into the kitchen and stood one on each side of her. \u201cAfternoon, Dahlia,\u201d Jack said. \u201cLet\u2019s take a ride. How about that?\u201d</p><p>Cameron lifted the portable oxygen canister and IV bag, hanging on to them.</p><p>Dahlia Creighton got a very frightened look on her face and Jack said, \u201cDahlia, this will be easier if you just let me and Preacher do the work, okay? We\u2019re going to lift you onto the gurney and wheel you out, easy as pie. But if you struggle or wiggle around, we could drop you, so be still and trust us. We\u2019ll be rolling you into the Hummer in seconds. How about that, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but she hadn\u2019t said a word yet.</p><p>Jack and Preacher slipped arms under her thighs and behind her back, counted to three and hefted close to four hundred pounds of woman into their arms and carried her the short distance to the gurney, lowering her onto it. They pulled it up, which took enormous effort given her weight, and got her to the back of the Hummer to slide that gurney inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have gas in that truck, Mr. Creighton?\u201d Mel asked. When he nodded, she asked, \u201cYou all right to drive? It would be better for you to follow us to the hospital so you have transportation.\u201d He nodded again and started fishing in his pocket for his keys.</p><p>And something happened during this whole operation that Mel would never comment to anyone about but that filled her with a warm pride. Dahlia had had a little accident, possibly from stark fear that she was dying, or maybe fear that the men would drop her. She\u2019d wet herself and, in the process of moving her, Jack\u2019s sleeve had been soaked.</p><p>Cam and Mel jumped in the back of the Hummer. Mel asked Preacher to call the hospital and tell them they were en route. The door slammed behind them and, without a word, Jack and Preacher unbuttoned their shirts and exchanged them. Jack was swimming in Preacher\u2019s dry shirt; Preacher was walking back to the bar in a sleeveless T-shirt in the cold late-March afternoon, carrying Jack\u2019s soiled shirt. And within ten seconds, Jack was behind the wheel of the Hummer, driving out of town.</p><p>Oh God, she thought. Where do you find men like these? Men who will do absolutely whatever it takes to help people, no matter what? She\u2019d chosen this profession; she\u2019d chosen to be up to her shoulders in whatever medical problem or mess came her way. She\u2019d been bled on, crapped on, peed on, puked on, and it never discouraged her from providing whatever was needed medically. But Jack was just Jack. Preacher, a cook! They weren\u2019t nurses, doctors or medics, and yet she couldn\u2019t count the times they jumped in and helped, even if it left them covered with blood or amniotic fluid or\u2014this time\u2014the wet accident of a woman he barely knew who was in a traumatic, life-threatening situation.</p> <p>They were made of gold.</p><p>Dahlia Creighton made it all the way to Valley Hospital before she arrested. She was resuscitated in the emergency room and the staff cardiologist was conferring over the phone with a doctor at a larger hospital about transporting her for an angiogram and possible bypass surgery.</p><p>Cameron, Jack and Mel didn\u2019t hang around\u2014there was nothing more they could do for her now. The drive back to Virgin River was long and quiet in the Hummer. When they got to town, there wasn\u2019t enough day left to open the clinic. Jack pulled up in front of the clinic and Mel said, \u201cI\u2019ll get a bucket of soapy water to clean out the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Cam said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it done quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed another hand?\u201d Jack asked.</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYour dinner crowd will be showing up pretty soon. I\u2019ll stop by the bar before I head out to Brie\u2019s to pick up the kids.\u201d</p><p>Donned in latex gloves with twin buckets, Cam and Mel scrubbed things down. Mel took the gurney out and was working on it while Cam crawled inside the back of the Hummer, washing it down, standard procedure between uses. When everything was shining, supplies in the Humvee and medical bags refreshed, buckets of water tossed in the flower beds around the porch, Cam said, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you. I\u2019m going to have to make a few adjustments in my schedule. I\u2019m going to have to find another job in a few months.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and dried off her hands. \u201cI figured something would have to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited Abby to come here for dinner tonight. I want to talk to her about things. I\u2019m going to try to convince her we should be roommates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoommates? How romantic,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, she doesn\u2019t have romantic feelings, but I want to take better care of my family. Whether she likes it or not, she\u2019s my family. At least, she\u2019s giving birth to my family. In another month, she\u2019s going to realize how much she needs me nearby. After they\u2019re born...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAfter they\u2019re born, she\u2019s going to need me even more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo. You have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let the town down. But if I can find a hospital or practice nearby that could use a doctor, at least part-time, I\u2019ll live in Virgin River and keep appointments here as often as possible. I\u2019d like to be on hand either in the mornings or afternoons, and evenings and weekends for house calls. The problem is the emergency care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, we have an emergency that needs medical intervention and transport about three or four times a year. There\u2019s a fair chance you\u2019d be taking a day off or out of town visiting your family when those emergencies occur. On the other hand, there\u2019s an equal chance you could keep a job in Fortuna or Eureka and be right here when we have an emergency. What I really need is a physician who keeps appointments and makes a few house calls, not an E.R. doctor. We call the sheriff\u2019s department or paramedics\u2014it might take them a little longer, but that\u2019s how it is when you live in a rural area. Our people understand that. If you hadn\u2019t been here today for Dahlia, I could have called Mercy Air, medical transport.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI might hang on to you a little longer if you have a way to take care of your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIn the end, where I live isn\u2019t going to be up to me. I\u2019m not letting them get away. If Abby insists on living in some godforsaken place like London, I\u2019ll follow.\u201d</p><p>Mel couldn\u2019t help it, she burst out laughing. \u201cGodforsaken London? I\u2019d give my eyeteeth to spend a year in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI understand\u2014you got your head wrapped around being a small-town doctor, living in the mountains, a low-stress lifestyle, and then, whoops\u2014you\u2019re going to be a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you would say, boy howdie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo\u2014tell me your plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beginning of one. I\u2019m solvent for a while yet. I won\u2019t be desperate for more income before the end of summer, but I should start looking. I want to hang close for now because those babies could come in a couple of months, hopefully not earlier, and then after they\u2019re born, I want to help Abby get a couple months under her belt before I start working two or three jobs. There\u2019s room for her in the clinic while I look around for something to rent that will hold all of us, something real close. I can give her my room and sleep in the patient room. If there\u2019s a God, I\u2019ll find a nice, comfortable three-bedroom not far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you out there. The cabin\u2019s empty. Two bedrooms and a loft, ten minutes from town, no farther away than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need it for family and friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that Luke Riordan has those cabins on the river all fixed up, we\u2019re in great shape. The Sheridans show up from time to time, but we have a guest room and guesthouse. We bought the cabin to have a handy alternative for emergencies. This qualifies.\u201d</p><p>He hung his head and shook it. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m a complete idiot.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter brought his head up. \u201cMe?\u201d she asked. \u201cCameron, I never planned a pregnancy in my life, and I\u2019m the expert! Just work it out if you can. I want the best for all of you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll work out some rent agreement with you and Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. You practically work for free. The longer I can keep you around, the better. Besides, that cabin has good fortune. I gave birth to David there.\u201d She laughed at the shudder she saw pass through him. He was no doubt imagining his twins coming out in that cabin. She put a hand on his arm. \u201cWork things out any way you can, Cameron. You can have the cabin for as long as you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you check with Jack about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cJack will do anything I ask.\u201d Then she grinned. \u201cBesides, Jack would approve of this idea. If it works for you.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Abby was primping in front of the mirror, Vanessa standing in the bathroom doorway, arms crossed over her chest, watching. \u201cMy face is fat,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Vanessa argued. \u201cYou look beautiful. Amazing. And huge.\u201d</p><p>Cameron was cooking Abby dinner at the clinic tonight. He thought they should talk about a few things, which was totally reasonable. Abby plucked at the mother-to-be top Vanni had loaned her. \u201cAre you sure you wore this the very last week of your pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only having one, remember. Abby, you look wonderful. You do want to look wonderful, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be content if I don\u2019t spoil his appetite with the way I look,\u201d she said, but she leaned closer to the mirror to carefully line her lips. Then she ran the comb through her shiny hair one more time. Then she licked a finger and smoothed it over one finely arched eyebrow, shaping it.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Vanni said doubtfully. \u201cSo, what\u2019s on the agenda tonight? What does he want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure,\u201d Abby said. Then she ran her hands over her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have plenty on the roster. Vanni, I\u2019m only six months pregnant and I look like I\u2019m going to drop them tomorrow. I don\u2019t know if I can stretch anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you can.\u201d Vanni laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t wait up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home early,\u201d Abby promised.</p><p>\u201cPlease, not on my account. Why don\u2019t you just throw caution to the wind and try to enjoy yourself.\u201d She glanced at Abby\u2019s big belly. \u201cYou enjoyed yourself once. I bet you can again. Cam\u2019s a great guy.\u201d</p><p>Abby knew this, and not just because Vanni wouldn\u2019t let her forget it. If she had to get knocked up by a virtual stranger, at least she picked a decent guy. And it was just too bad that their relationship was so rife with complications, with unknowns. The only things that were for sure\u2014Abby was a nice person, Cameron was a great guy, and two babies were going to come barreling out of her in about two months, give or take. She could already tell she\u2019d never make it to term.</p><p>Abby got to town promptly at six and found the clinic door unlocked. \u201cHello?\u201d she called after stepping inside.</p><p>Cam looked down the hall from the kitchen, a plain white apron wrapped around his hips and a spoon in his hand. He smiled at her. \u201cHi. Go ahead and lock that door, Abby. They have to knock after clinic hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, throwing the dead bolt. When she got to the kitchen, he had discarded the spoon and helped her out of her coat. He hung it on the peg by the back door and said, \u201cYou look pretty, Abby. Beautiful, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I look full-term and I\u2019m not even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect. Healthy and strong and very pregnant.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cYou feel okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cFine.\u201d In fact, her back was aching, her ankles were swelling and she was getting these mysterious pains in her lower abdomen that Mel and John Stone described as ligament-stretching pains that felt at least like a pulled muscle, sometimes every bit as powerful as a knife thrust. Sleeping was getting difficult and heartburn had settled in with a vengeance. \u201cI get some heartburn\u201d was all she admitted to. \u201cIt\u2019s a good excuse to eat ice cream at night. What did you cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpaghetti with meatballs and sausage,\u201d he answered with a grimace. \u201cI don\u2019t have ice cream, but I do have Tums. I never even thought of heartburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might go light on the sausage, but I so love it,\u201d she said, sitting down. He\u2019d set the table in mismatched stoneware. She ran a finger around the plate in front of her.</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s old stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019d known the kitchen wasn\u2019t very well stocked, I could have brought my own stuff. I don\u2019t mind cooking and I\u2019m kind of good. All my kitchenware is in storage at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is mine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re both like a couple of Gypsies right now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d She leaned back in her chair and rubbed the small of her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow about sparkling cider?\u201d Cameron asked, glancing down at her feet. Her slacks rose up just enough for him to see her ankles.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great, thanks. And water?\u201d</p><p>He got both for her and then sat in the chair beside hers. \u201cJust a little heartburn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBackache, edema, heartburn... What else?\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of her cider. \u201cSomething they call ligament pains that feel remarkably like a wide-awake cesarean section.\u201d</p><p>He winced.</p><p>\u201cI pee on the half hour.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s funny? A few more years, when your prostate is a bit larger, you won\u2019t think it\u2019s all that funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s more than just a few more years, Ab,\u201d he said. But he smiled. He touched her hand, gave it a little squeeze. Then he stood and went to the stove. He gave the pasta a swirl, the sauce a stir, then grabbed a leafy salad from the refrigerator and put it on the table along with a small bowl of dressing. \u201cHow\u2019d you like to toss that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, digging a pair of large spoons into the salad. \u201cSo. What did you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, how about names? For the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be involved in names?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p> <p>\u201cSure. If I were having the babies, wouldn\u2019t you want input in that? Or\u2014if I were having them, would you drop out of sight? Pretend you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Shock settled over her features. Jesus, did that ever cut deep. Would she? Would she shake it off, run for her life, refuse to be involved, just let him deal with it? Oh God, of course not! She swallowed. But isn\u2019t that just what she\u2019d hoped he would do? Go away and leave her alone. \u201cUm, have you thought of any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmothers are Alice and Eleanor. They\u2019re awesome and those are cool names....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice and Eleanor?\u201d she said, making a face.</p><p>\u201cAlly and Elly, that\u2019s what they go by. Wait till you meet them\u2014you\u2019ll love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re getting a girl! We only know about\u2014\u201d She stopped talking.</p><p>He glanced at her over his shoulder as he lifted the steaming pot off the stove and tossed the cooked pasta into the colander in the sink. He glanced over his shoulder again and grinned at her. She realized what she\u2019d done\u2014she\u2019d coupled them in parenthood.</p><p>\u201cI hope we get a boy and a girl, but I\u2019m good with two boys. I love all those little-guy things\u2014T-ball, soccer, catching bugs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI played T-ball,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAnd soccer. And I used to go to the lake with my family and catch a jarful of fireflies to put on the nightstand for when I went to bed.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cIf I\u2019d known I was killing them, I would never have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, you\u2019ll be good with either boys or girls. We\u2019re all set\u2014but they don\u2019t have names.\u201d He picked up her plate and put some pasta and sauce on it for her. He included a couple of meatballs and a sausage and put it in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t eat anything you think will give you heartburn.\u201d Then he served himself and sat down with her. \u201cTry it, Ab. See how I cook. It\u2019s an old family recipe.\u201d</p><p>She took a tentative taste, rolled the food around in her mouth and tilted her head with lifted eyebrows. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t smart enough to leave out the sausage\u2014but I didn\u2019t make it as garlicky and spicy as usual. I toned it down for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally I like spicy. But it\u2019s out to get me lately. So,\u201d she said, lifting some salad into his bowl, then hers. \u201cWhat else is on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIn a hurry to get this over with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, surprised and maybe a little embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014 I mean, we talk all the time and this sounded kind of serious.\u201d</p><p>He stabbed some lettuce and brought it to his mouth, chewed, swallowed. \u201cWe have a few minutes on the phone, see each other at Jack\u2019s for a couple of minutes here and there, and there\u2019s no yelling or shooting\u2014which is a big improvement\u2014but we don\u2019t get down to business. Abby, we\u2019re having two babies in a couple of months, three months at the outside. Nah,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll never make it three months. Do you have any of the details worked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cSure. Some.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her and smiled pleasantly. \u201cCare to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing to suggest we have a high-risk pregnancy, but it\u2019s pretty common for the mothers of twins to go on bed rest for a while to delay labor while they grow and get stronger. And when babies come, it\u2019s often early and fast. And taking care of them as newborns is pretty demanding. Also, you have a financial situation that\u2019s giving you some stress. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said. \u201cSheesh. I\u2019m not too worried about bed rest, I\u2019m in good health and I have Vanni and Mel. John Stone is watching real close for early and fast. My mom will come as soon as they arrive and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will mine,\u201d he said, and she actually grabbed her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. We can hold her off for a week, maybe, but these are her grandchildren and she\u2019s never missed a grandchild\u2019s debut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told her?\u201d she asked, aghast.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, twirling a little spaghetti around his fork. \u201cBut I have to do that. It\u2019s going to be hard enough to explain not telling her sooner and making sure she had a chance to meet you. They\u2019re not just our children, Ab. They have grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins...et cetera...on my side of this family as well as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she said, dropping her fork. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed lightly. \u201cRelax. Nothing to worry about. They\u2019re fantastic people and you\u2019ll be real happy to have them in your life, I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t they think... I mean, we\u2019re not married and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, got up and fetched himself a beer from the old refrigerator, using the underside of his heavy class ring to pop the top. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve heard of things like this before. A man and woman, not married, having children. But telling my family is just one item on this list. Abby, the list is long. We have so many things to work through before you go into labor. And not all that much time to do it.\u201d</p><p>She rested her forehead in her hand, her elbow on the table. \u201cHit me with another one. What else do we have to work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have cribs? Clothes? Gear\u2014car seats, diaper bags, et cetera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should make a run to the mall,\u201d she said absently. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I have to get moving on this. But, I talked to my mom about all this stuff and we decided, since I didn\u2019t want anyone to know I\u2019m pregnant, we\u2019re not saying anything to friends and family. Then when they come, after they\u2019ve gotten a couple of months old, we\u2019ll send announcements. I\u2019m even thinking of fudging the birthday. I hate to do that, but... So, no showers or early gifts or any of that. I\u2019ll take care of the newborn items. It\u2019s the only way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you on that debt from your ex you\u2019re working through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d she said, sitting straighter and smiling, very proud of herself. \u201cVery close. I\u2019ve put almost all the money he sent me toward the credit-card bills, just using a tiny smidgen of that money for incidentals. I have just six thousand left to pay.\u201d She beamed. She tasted a little more spaghetti, a little more salad. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have used any of his money, or any of the money my folks insisted on sending, but I\u2019m tapped out and had to. I had to have maternity clothes\u2014Lord, did I need maternity clothes! Do you see this? I\u2019m growing out of Vanni\u2019s largest hand-me-downs!\u201d</p><p>Cameron\u2019s expression darkened. He shook his head, took a swig of his beer and muttered, \u201cHe has millions! What a nasty thing to do to an innocent woman! I hope that son of a bitch burns in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron! What a thing to say!\u201d Then she smiled. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t have said it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s start with that, then we\u2019ll get to our mothers. I\u2019d like you to stop endorsing his checks and I\u2019ll clear that debt. Then\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got it all worked out. It won\u2019t be much longer\u2014just another month or two and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, I talked to Brie Valenzuela. She said to tell you to drop in and see her anytime. I\u2019d be happy to go with you. Here\u2019s the way she sees it. He probably just stuck you with those bills on his lawyer\u2019s advice. In any case, the debt was a part of the dissolution of the marriage, which means it\u2019s court-ordered and you\u2019re stuck with it. But if he wants to chase down that prenup and try to prove you had sex with someone before the divorce was final, he\u2019ll have to take you to a civil court to sue you. It\u2019s not a felony, it couldn\u2019t make criminal court\u2014no one would prosecute you for it. It would cost him more to sue you than he\u2019d get if he won. And if he does take you back to court, he\u2019s going to look like the devil himself\u2014he walks out on you after six weeks of marriage, never pays a penny of support for nine months of separation while he openly lives with another woman, and he wants over forty thousand dollars in credit-card debt on cards you never had and never used? When he\u2019s a millionaire? Never going to happen. He could make his situation worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what my lawyer said,\u201d she inserted.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I talked to another one. Brie\u2019s a very experienced former state prosecutor and has been through a divorce of her own.\u201d</p><p>Abby groaned. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s another person in town who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy. It\u2019s all lawyer-client privilege. Confidential. While she didn\u2019t deal with divorce in her practice, she knows everyone in the state and made some phone calls. As long as you clear the debt and don\u2019t take his money like some gold digger, that\u2019s going to be the end of it. You\u2019ll walk away from it. Unless he hates you for some purely personal...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off at the unexpected sound of her laughter. \u201cPersonal hatred? I don\u2019t think he remembers my name. Cameron, he\u2019s on woman number ninety-two at least. He\u2019s been married three times and he\u2019s probably not smart enough to stop. Plus, I\u2019m relatively sure he\u2019s using drugs, drinking himself stupid...\u201d She wound some spaghetti around her fork and put it in her mouth. \u201cThis is very good,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes Brie really think if I obey my court instructions, I could get beyond this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does. And she\u2019s willing to help if there\u2019s a problem. Remember, he\u2019s a rock star on tour. How much energy do you think he has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his lawyers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s an issue. They could recommend more motions\u2014if they want to make more money for themselves. Brie recommended a polite, legal letter bringing this whole business to a close. Let him get screwed by his lawyers and not by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That actually sounds very sensible. What else is on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d he said, leaning back a little, \u201cafter the debt is gone and you\u2019re finished with that business, or so we hope, I\u2019ll support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t want that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll carry the babies and you support me,\u201d he suggested, winding his own spaghetti around his fork and grinning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said, rubbing her lower back.</p><p>He continued to eat his spaghetti and salad and while he did so, he talked to her, friend to friend. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal\u2014we have stuff to handle. We have mothers\u2014enough said. We have your prenup, which can be handled, but it\u2019s making you tense and you don\u2019t exactly need tension. That needs to go away. You can\u2019t live on air\u2014you\u2019ll have to eat and cover your head, so you\u2019ll need some kind of income. There\u2019s furniture and supplies to buy. We have twins coming and I know you didn\u2019t hand-pick me for the job, but I\u2019m the dad. Bad break for you, maybe, but I could turn out to be a good dad for them\u2014I know a lot about kids. And this pregnancy is not the usual thing. I\u2019d like to be close to the situation, to keep an eye on you and the babies. I am a doctor\u2014that can come in handy, y\u2019know?\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cWe should be in close contact, daily, on these issues and others\u2014like names. They should get names before they come. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s a good idea. You have my number.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we consider moving in together? While we head for this event?\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s clear the debt, get Kid Crawford out of the picture, I\u2019ll take on your upkeep rather than Vanni and Paul shouldering your food and board, and we\u2019ll evolve into...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to explain anything. People will just say, \u2018Dr. Michaels likes that nice pregnant girl.\u2019 We\u2019ll share a house. I\u2019ll be your roommate. You\u2019ll have your own room. But there will be late nights you\u2019re worried about some belly pain or later, night crying from the babies. You don\u2019t want to do that to Vanni and Paul and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just going to go home to Seattle. To my mom and dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have room for me?\u201d he asked, lifting his fork and arching that brow.</p> <p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d she said, slamming down her fork. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean to say you plan to just follow me and demand to live with the babies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be obsessive. But Jesus, Ab, I don\u2019t want to miss out on anything. Do you know how much babies change from two to six weeks? It just kills me to think you\u2019d take them that far away from me. I mean, they are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, frustrated. \u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sweetheart. And they\u2019re also yours. And I swear to God, I will never try to take them away from you. That would be cruel.\u201d</p><p>He had just aimed an arrow at her sense of justice. The shock of realization must have shown on her face, but he took another bite, had another drink of his beer, smiled.</p><p>\u201cLive together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll go if you stay with Vanni and Paul. Toward the end, when you\u2019re sleepless, you\u2019ll be up at night. You\u2019ll be tired during the day, but there will be a toddler around, making noise and crying. And you\u2019ll have all those late pregnancy complaints, worries. Then you\u2019ll have a small guest room stuffed to the ceiling with paraphernalia. Then babies\u2014and grandmothers as additional guests? Newborns, sometimes, cry for hours. They could have Vanni and Paul up all night, walking the floor with you. Nah, that wouldn\u2019t be good. And besides, it\u2019s not Paul\u2019s job to help, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you suggest we live? Here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere isn\u2019t bad,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cBut Mel and Jack offered us their cabin. It\u2019s a nice cabin\u2014two bedrooms and a loft, ten minutes from town. Ideally, we should hurry and look around for a place that can accommodate a man, a woman, two newborns, two grandmothers and... We don\u2019t have to make room for the lawyers, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d she said, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cAbby, we have things to work out every single day. We have to buy cribs, car seats, swings, layette items, lots of stuff\u2014it\u2019s going to take more than one trip to the mall. We have to let the families know there will be babies coming\u2014it\u2019s only fair. We should have dinner together every day, just so we can communicate, catch up. If there\u2019s anything you need or anything you\u2019re worried about, I want to be close so I can help. If you think I\u2019m going to molest you while you\u2019re huge with my babies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m getting sick of that word, huge.\u201d She blinked at him. \u201cAre you independently wealthy or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cJust barely got all the bills paid from med school and residency. I have a little set aside. Not too much. In fact, after the babies are a couple of months old, I\u2019m going to try to find a second job in one of the bigger towns to supplement my income. Then I can live in or close to Virgin River so I don\u2019t let these people down. I promised Virgin River a year. I\u2019d hate to renege on that. They need a doctor here. But if you need me more...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to stay here while you give them that year?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cAbby, I just hope I can take care of you and the kids well enough, help and make you happy enough, so you\u2019ll give me some time before you spring some major change on me. Because I care a lot about all of you. I do. I\u2019m trying everything I can think of. And, Abby\u2014I wouldn\u2019t run out on you.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cBut,\u201d he said with a shrug, \u201cif you can\u2019t stay here, for whatever reason, I\u2019ll look for work wherever you and the babies go.\u201d</p><p>Oh goddamn, she thought. She was getting teary. Why would she get teary? He was trying so hard. But, he asked her to be his roommate.</p><p>He\u2019d also offered to help her with everything in her life, from her finances to her medical condition. And didn\u2019t he suggest he\u2019d walk the floor at night with screaming babies?</p><p>\u201cThe idea,\u201d she said, \u201cis totally nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a first for us,\u201d he agreed, grinning handsomely. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly running with the pack, you and me. Think about this. It could work. We could take care of each other and our kids real easy. Eat more of that spaghetti. I have a little cheesecake in the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you want an answer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Cameron hoped it didn\u2019t show on his face that he was elated to have gotten this far. Realistically, he had expected to be wearing the spaghetti dinner just for the suggestion. But she was actually considering it? Amazing. \u201cTake your time, Ab. There\u2019s no emergency.\u201d He glanced at her belly. \u201cFor a good week or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve lost my appetite,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything scary. I didn\u2019t threaten or beg. I offered help. We\u2019ve had a few rough spots, but we have good rapport. Abby, I really want to be part of this. You\u2019re awful special to me. Keep eating and tell me about those fireflies you caught as a kid. Tell me about going to the lake with your family.\u201d</p><p>She did. It took a couple of minutes before she loosened up, started talking about her childhood with laughter. She never expected it, but this was so much like their first night together, their one night together. They began as strangers and before an hour had passed they were telling their stories, their secrets, laughing, touching hands, like old friends. Like lovers.</p><p>She asked him about his childhood, about his family. He told her anything she wanted to know and she realized how much she had missed him since that fateful night. The only reason they\u2019d spent the night together in the first place was because they clicked so well, had so many common feelings and experiences.</p><p>Then they picked up the dishes and began scraping and rinsing them. She pulled out the trash can from under the sink and before dumping her leftover sausage and meatball into the bin, she started to laugh so much she bent over her tummy. She stuck her fork into the opening of a discarded jar and lifted it out of the trash. She presented an empty jar of Rag\u00fa spaghetti sauce.</p><p>He grimaced.</p><p>\u201cOld family recipe?\u201d she asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re an old family,\u201d he said. \u201cOr so I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d she laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a liar!\u201d</p><p>First thing in the morning, Abby drove into town and went to the clinic. She had primped and tried to look her best, then she\u2019d had a stern talk with herself about this situation.</p><p>Cameron not only made sense, he was being both reasonable and honorable. Whether they\u2019d hand-picked each other or not, they were having a set of twins. Children who needed parents. Parents who would have to rely on each other and should not only get along, but be familiar with each other. There was no better way to accomplish that than by being roommates. She looked down at her stomach. There was certainly no chance of them being lovers.</p><p>But there was more to it. As gracious as Vanni and Paul had been about her extended stay, they deserved a life of their own. After all, she hadn\u2019t intended to impose for the duration\u2014she had planned to rent something and go it alone. It took about five minutes to realize, going it alone was really not an option. She had to have a support system. She could live somewhere else and see Vanni every day if she wanted to. Not only did Vanni and Paul need their space, so did Abby. She wasn\u2019t used to living with people. She\u2019d had a roommate years back, but they had been very independent of each other. And there was that brief time with her husband\u2014very brief. Other than that, she was used to solitude.</p><p>At Vanni\u2019s house there was always someone around: a baby crying or squealing happily; Walt popping in regularly; Shelby and Luke dropping by, often bringing Luke\u2019s helper, Art, along, sometimes for dinner. Most evenings the house was full and noisy or they were all going to Jack\u2019s and got a little funky and worried if she tried to beg off and stay home. In the end, she always went along. She had almost no time to herself.</p><p>At least with Cam, he\u2019d be at the clinic every day and wouldn\u2019t pester her to death in the evenings. And she would have her own room to flee to if Cameron made her feel the least bit crowded.</p><p>Really, it made sense. It would just be so awkward.</p><p>And boy, was there going to be a lot of talk!</p><p>When she walked into the clinic, she found Mel in the reception area going over some paperwork at the counter. She turned and smiled at Abby. \u201cWell, hey there. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks. I\u2019m here to meet Cameron. He wants to show me your cabin....\u201d</p><p>Mel got an unmistakably wistful look on her face. \u201cI hope you like it,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re absolutely sure it\u2019s okay,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m thrilled for you to use it. That little cabin changed my life. I lived there until I married Jack, then we lived there together until our house was finished. When the weather gets a little warmer, you\u2019ll wake up to deer in the yard. New fawns with freckles on their backs. David was born there. Jack delivered him.\u201d</p><p>Abby got a wild look in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to get that far back to nature,\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t either. I didn\u2019t plan it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Jack certainly didn\u2019t. But I wouldn\u2019t worry\u2014with Cameron hovering over you to make sure everything is all right, that won\u2019t happen. I think you\u2019re in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d she said tentatively. \u201cI\u2019m a little worried about...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cGossip. Everyone talking about us.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes twinkled and she smiled. \u201cAbby, you\u2019re an unmarried woman pregnant with twins and you\u2019ve been spending time with our pediatrician. He never misses a chance to sit by you at Jack\u2019s. Surrender. The gossip is way ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>Abby gasped. She leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially. \u201cDo they think there\u2019s something to us? Like a relationship?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of Mel\u2019s light brows lifted in amusement. \u201cThey hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been there,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThe whole town had me married to Jack before I had my first really good kiss with him.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cAh, hell, go with it. At least they\u2019re not malicious. Just very nosey. I got through it. You can, too.\u201d</p> <p>Heavy footsteps started down the stairs. \u201cHey,\u201d Cam said cheerily. \u201cYou made it bright and early\u2014thanks. I have some patients this morning. Ready to take a look at that cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said uneasily. And she thought, What the hell am I doing?</p><p>Ten minutes later they pulled into a clearing in the forest and she looked at a charming little cabin surrounded by huge trees. It had a peaked roof and a wide porch with Adirondack chairs. She could imagine the deer, colorful flowers bordering the porch. There was a beam of light that glanced through the trees and shone on the porch. And she said aloud, \u201cWhat the hell am I doing?\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed at her. \u201cNesting,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on.\u201d He got out of the car and went around to her side, giving his hand to pull her out.</p><p>He opened the door for her to walk into the house and what she saw was\u2014a little cabin. One big room included living room, kitchen, breakfast nook and breakfast bar. There was only room for a sofa and overstuffed chair, ottoman and rocker surrounding a big stone hearth. A polished old chest served as a small coffee table in front of the sofa and there was one small side table and lamp. Back through the kitchen was a washer and dryer, water heater, pantry and stairs to the loft. It was shiny clean and quaint. Cute. Small.</p> <p>The bedrooms weren\u2019t large, but big enough, with a bathroom separating them. And the loft wasn\u2019t enclosed by any more than a rail. There was a queen-size bed in one bedroom, a double bed in the loft. \u201cThis will be your bedroom and I\u2019ll take the loft,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI\u2019ll take a day off so we can go into Eureka and get some baby furniture for this room.\u201d He pulled her into what had been Mel and Jack\u2019s nursery, bare and ready for a couple of infants.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s an idea, if it works for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first thing we do is get rid of that credit-card debt, get Brie to draft a letter saying you\u2019ve paid your bill and don\u2019t want any more alimony, or any more contact with the ex. I\u2019ll set you up a bank account and get you a credit card.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cTry to remember I\u2019m not a filthy-rich rock star, I\u2019m a relatively poor pediatrician and family-practice doctor who gets paid in beans a lot. Then we finish furnishing this place with cribs, et cetera. Now\u2014it\u2019s out here a little ways, so if we find ourselves in a situation where you need bed rest or something, we\u2019ll just stay in town. You can have the bedroom I use at the clinic and I\u2019ll stay in the other room, so you\u2019re not alone. Other than picking out names, we\u2019re covering all the bases. If you think you can stand this little cabin, that is.\u201d He looked around. \u201cI actually like it. It\u2019s cozy. Sweet.\u201d</p><p>But when he looked back at her, tears were running down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, Abby,\u201d he said, pulling her toward him. \u201cDo you hate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sniffed, shaking her head. \u201cI kind of like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be temporary while we look for something better. I just want to keep us in close quarters, so I can help.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head and found words with difficulty. \u201cWhat have you gotten yourself into?\u201d</p><p>He wiped away a tear. \u201cI know this is so hard for you. If you\u2019d rather be at Vanni\u2019s, I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t mind. But, Abby, I\u2014 Honey, I want to help, be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d end up doing something like this. It\u2019s so...so...calculated. Such a practical arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, give me a chance here. I want to take care of you. I know you don\u2019t like hearing that\u2014you\u2019re used to taking care of yourself.\u201d He slipped a hand over her belly. \u201cRight now that\u2019s not practical. We have to think about your health. This isn\u2019t an ordinary pregnancy.\u201d He smiled sweetly. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary pregnancy.\u201d She sniffed again and he pulled her close. \u201cIf there\u2019s a better way, better for you, just tell me. I\u2019ll do anything I can.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head against his shoulder. She inhaled his scent, remembered the lusty night that had gotten them here. She closed her eyes. Such a sweet memory....</p><p>And he felt one of them kick him in her belly. He pulled her closer, tighter, wanting more of that. \u201cThere are a few problems with this cabin,\u201d he said. \u201cNo TV, for one thing. Mel and Jack never installed a satellite dish. I hardly ever bother with TV. I catch the news at Jack\u2019s, listen to music and read a lot.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back from him just a bit and looked up into his blue eyes. \u201cI have a portable DVD player. Vanni has lots of DVDs to loan. Maybe I\u2019ll watch a movie sometimes, but I like to read. I go through a couple of books a week\u2014lately most of them are about pregnancy and childbirth. I guess you already know all about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty much up to speed. But I wouldn\u2019t mind looking at what you\u2019re reading.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe, if you\u2019re very nice, I\u2019ll let you watch a movie with me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI bet they\u2019re all girl movies that make you cry.\u201d He used his thumb to wipe a tear away from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cCameron, everything makes me cry. Haven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty normal. Pregnant women cry a lot, whether they need to or not. When would you like to move? I don\u2019t want you alone out here, so I\u2019ll come at the same time. After I help you get your things transferred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a day or two? All I have is clothes. Are we going to have some kind of routine or something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll go to work, but my schedule isn\u2019t demanding. I have a lot of free time when there aren\u2019t patients, but I won\u2019t hang around here and drive you crazy. You can do what you want\u2014either stay here and relax, listen to music and read, or go hang out with Vanni. We\u2019ll have dinner together when you feel like it. We\u2019ll talk sometimes, like friends do. Pick names for the babies. When you give me permission, I\u2019ll call my mother, who is going to freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d</p><p>He hugged her close. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine. She might be a little put out that we\u2019re not married, but the twins will mollify her. When you think I\u2019ve earned the right, we\u2019ll share a DVD.\u201d He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd after they\u2019re born? When it\u2019s time for me to get on with my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about what you\u2019d like to do, where you\u2019d like to be, and what you want will be a priority. I\u2019ll see how I can fit in that plan as a dad. But, Abby, can we get to that later? One thing at a time? As long as I promise I don\u2019t have any plan to screw up your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing at a time. Aren\u2019t you worried what people will think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve only been here a few months, but there are a million interesting little stories that verge on scandals in this town. People love \u2019em. If I had the slightest worry anyone would treat you meanly, I\u2019d never have suggested this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of little scandals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have lots of time for me to catch you up on the local stuff, like Mel and Jack, Preacher and Paige, and I guess you probably already know about Vanni and Paul.\u201d</p><p>Very suddenly, Abby felt relief flood through her. She knew that whole story\u2014that Paul had been in love with Vanni for years, but she\u2019d married his best friend. And then, after Vanni\u2019s husband Matt was killed in Iraq and the way to her was clear, Paul had such guilt and shame about his obsession, he couldn\u2019t act. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, he thought he had gotten a woman back in Oregon pregnant. \u201cDoes everyone know about that?\u201d she asked in a stunned whisper.</p><p>\u201cI doubt we could find anyone around here who doesn\u2019t know at least a version of the story.\u201d Then he shrugged. \u201cAbby, you have to remember\u2014the important thing is that you\u2019re healthy, we\u2019re working together to bring healthy twins into the world and we\u2019re going to do the best we can to be good parents. Who\u2019s gonna throw rocks at that idea? Only a petty fool. And I say, screw the petty fools.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. There was a reason she\u2019d gone to that hotel room.</p><p>Seven</p><p>It was ten days after Mel and Cameron\u2019s emergency run to Valley Hospital with Dahlia Creighton when Cheryl came to Virgin River. Mel had heard that Dahlia hadn\u2019t survived long enough for bypass surgery. She\u2019d had far too many medical problems to get through what might have otherwise been an uncomplicated surgery.</p><p>This was only the second time Mel had seen Cheryl since she\u2019d entered an alcohol-treatment program over six months ago and the change in her still startled Mel and brought a bright smile to her lips. When Cheryl walked into the clinic, despite the fact that she had just lost her mother, Mel nearly beamed at her. She had to quickly reel in the reaction. This was not a time to grin stupidly. But Cheryl looked so good\u2014fresh, healthy, pretty. It was hard to imagine her the way she\u2019d been when Mel first met her, slouched and dirty, wearing men\u2019s clothes, looking bruised both physically and emotionally.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Sheridan,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you hear the news about my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, Cheryl. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. We did all we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did, as did the other doctors. My mother was very sick. Really, she didn\u2019t stand a chance. And she wouldn\u2019t even consider medical treatment before. Truthfully, I don\u2019t think she thought she needed any. And between my father and I, we weren\u2019t alert or smart enough to know, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis must be a very difficult time for you,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cIt is. And challenging, but I have it worked out, sort of. My dad has gone to live with his brother in Yuba City, on the other side of the mountains. I have to deal with the house. It\u2019s mine now. I can\u2019t support my dad, so he\u2019s better off with his brother and Medicare. That\u2019s the best we can do. He has a ton of health problems, too. He has serious emphysema, among other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you move home?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m never living in that house again. I\u2019m done with that part of my life. I have a decent job in Eureka and someday I might even have my own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still living in your group home?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have roommates. We\u2019re all in the same program, so it\u2019s like a group home, but not official. I\u2019d sell the house, but it\u2019s just not salable. It\u2019s falling down. I\u2019m going to clean it out of trash. I brought some friends to help,\u201d she said, jerking her chin over her shoulder toward the street in front of the clinic. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop by Jack\u2019s and ask him if he has a problem with us filling up that Dumpster. Most of the junk left behind by my dad will be tossed and we\u2019ll take the bigger stuff to the dump in the back of the pickup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jack will be happy to let you use the Dumpster if it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we can close the lid when we\u2019re done. Have to close the lid around here or wildlife will get in there and make a mess, disturb the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI might just let it go, the house. If I can\u2019t keep up the taxes, I\u2019ll lose it eventually, anyway. In the meantime, if anyone you know needs shelter, I can let them use it. As long as they\u2019re not alcoholics or drug addicts. I can\u2019t go along with that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mel smiled. \u201cStill heavy into your program, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing and hard to believe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. You were ready.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, and her face was so pretty. Her hair so shiny. \u201cMore than ready. I just wanted to stop by, say hello and thank-you.\u201d</p><p>Mel tilted her head, and her smile was a little sad. \u201cI\u2019ll be sorry not to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably be back a couple more times before I\u2019m all done here. Let me give you a phone number, just in case someone desperately needs a roof. That\u2019s about all it is. And if you do run into someone like that, please tell them I didn\u2019t clean the place, just emptied it of trash. It wasn\u2019t really my house. I\u2019m embarrassed by the condition it\u2019s in, but not embarrassed enough to spend days scrubbing it. Being there...it just takes me back to a bad place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Mel said, lifting a small notepad off the counter.</p><p>Cheryl scratched out her number in Eureka. \u201cJesus, I wish I could do something for you. I owe you my life. I really do.\u201d</p> <p>Mel put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cListen to me now. I made some phone calls. That\u2019s all. You did all the heavy lifting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the thing,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one ever made phone calls for me before. I was the town drunk and no one ever thought I had a chance of being anything else. Till you came here. And that\u2019s the God\u2019s truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mel said, sniffing back emotion. \u201cWeren\u2019t they short-sighted? You\u2019re clearly headed for wonderful things.\u201d</p><p>Later the same day, Mel hauled both her kids to the bar at five o\u2019clock. Since he\u2019d moved into the cabin with Abby, Cameron was anxious to get home at the end of the day, even though his dinner at Jack\u2019s was on the house. This was not at all mysterious to Mel.</p><p>Jack came around the bar and took David off her hands. \u201cHey, my man,\u201d he said to his son. \u201cWanna ride on Da\u2019s back for a while?\u201d</p><p>Mel jumped up on a stool and said, \u201cJust hang on to him for a second, Jack. Let me have a diet cola and I\u2019ll get these maniacs home. Bring us something of Preacher\u2019s later?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, babe.\u201d He deftly drew her a cola, one-handed, his son on his hip. But David wasn\u2019t in the mood to be confined. He was two now and well into the terribles. He was bowing his back, kicking his feet, whining. \u201cSettle down, bud,\u201d Jack said, hanging on to him. It wasn\u2019t a good idea to give him his freedom in the bar and grill. Nothing but trouble and breakage awaited.</p><p>\u201cGot any chips or popcorn?\u201d said a voice just a couple of stools down from Mel.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can rustle some up,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGimme a minute, huh? I have my hands full of madness.\u201d</p><p>Mel turned and saw it was Dan Brady, having himself a beer.</p><p>\u201cI thought if you could hand me the progeny, bring us something to snack on, you and your wife could have a minute.\u201d He held out his hands toward David. \u201cI\u2019m checked out. I know how to hang on to a kid wild with the devil.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyebrow lifted. \u201cDo you now? Aren\u2019t you just full of surprises. I honestly didn\u2019t know you could do anything but grow weed.\u201d He shifted and handed David across the bar.</p><p>At first David squealed in annoyance, but Dan grabbed him and brought him onto his lap. \u201cHey now,\u201d he said, holding him with a firm arm around his waist, bouncing him on his thigh. \u201cTake it easy. Only in a town of six hundred would it be considered normal to have a kid your age right up at the bar. Count your blessings.\u201d</p><p>Jack shook out some Goldfish crackers into a bowl. \u201cHis favorite,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Dan said. He turned his attention on David. \u201cSo, little man, you want one?\u201d He maneuvered the small cracker into David\u2019s mouth. \u201cNow. Give one to me? Please?\u201d</p><p>David thought about it a second, then slowly pushed one toward Dan\u2019s open mouth. \u201cMmm,\u201d Dan said. \u201cYour turn.\u201d And he plucked one out of the bowl and directed it toward David\u2019s mouth, but pulled it back, making the kid laugh. \u201cOh, you want that? Can you say please?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head obstinately, stiffening his back, grinding his fists into his eyes, pushing out his lower lip. Dan took the Goldfish for himself and laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s try that again,\u201d he said, picking up another. \u201cPlease?\u201d he coached.</p><p>\u201cPease,\u201d David said in a pout.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Dan approved, popping a Goldfish into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gifted,\u201d Jack observed. \u201cHe\u2019s been a real asshole lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! We were going to try to stop swearing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I think I\u2019m doing better at that than you are, by the way. But hasn\u2019t he been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t help it\u2014he\u2019s at the asshole age. He\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Jack said, grinning at her. \u201cYou have a rotten mouth and you can\u2019t help yourself.\u201d</p><p>She grinned back at him. \u201cI never uttered a single curse until I met you.\u201d</p><p>Dan focused on David. \u201cYour parents are flirting with each other. You better have another fish. You could be on my lap a long time.\u201d</p><p>Jack studied him for a moment. \u201cYou got some experience there, pal,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d Dan answered. Then he looked at David and said, \u201cMy turn. Please.\u201d And he opened his mouth for a fish.</p><p>\u201cLike with kids,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNephews and nieces or something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said. And then, to David. \u201cYour turn. Say please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPease,\u201d he said, smiling and opening his dripping, goopy mouth.</p><p>Dan looked at Jack. \u201cHow\u2019s the boy? Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I don\u2019t know. Mel and Preacher both say he\u2019s working through the whole thing, but he\u2019s different. He doesn\u2019t reach out, you know? He doesn\u2019t call me, doesn\u2019t call the girlfriend. He was so into that girl, I can\u2019t even explain how much. Nowadays, he avoids her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a hard time, I guess,\u201d Dan said, right before he looked at David and said, \u201cYour turn. Say please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the girl handling that?\u201d Dan asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t have a real conversation with you for three years and now you\u2019re like a neighbor. No, you sound like a goddamn shrink.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled at him and opened his mouth for a fish. But David shouted, \u201cPease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to understand,\u201d Mel said, answering for Jack. \u201cI think it\u2019s hurting her a lot, but she\u2019s amazingly patient and understanding for a young girl. There\u2019s a counselor she talked to once before who\u2019s trying to help her out. At least there\u2019s that.\u201d She shook her head and kissed Emma\u2019s fat cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s only a senior in high school. Just turned eighteen. They fell in love too young.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked back at David and said, \u201cPlease.\u201d Then it was David\u2019s turn again, but Dan turned to Mel. \u201cEighteen and... What did you say he was? Twenty? They have a lot of time to get beyond this. It could take a while, but they have a while. They\u2019re just kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hurt,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI just hate to see them hurt like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody gets through the years without a ton of pain, you know?\u201d And then David yelled at him. \u201cOh. Please,\u201d he said, opening his mouth for a fish. He chewed and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get so sick of the good manners here. It gets old.\u201d</p><p>The door to the bar opened and Cheryl Creighton stuck her head in. \u201cJack, we\u2019re all done over at the house and I\u2019m afraid we filled up your Dumpster. The house isn\u2019t how it should be, but it\u2019s cleaned up some. Let me leave you a key. If anyone needs to use it, just let me know, huh? Mel\u2019s got my number. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with it yet. But really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHouse?\u201d Dan said. \u201cTrailer? Condo? Room? Shed? Lean-to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheryl\u2019s house is empty,\u201d Mel said. \u201cShe says it\u2019s not in good shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you let me see it?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cListen, it\u2019s falling apart. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have hot water? A toilet that flushes? Lights that turn on and off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s about all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you let me see it? Is it for rent?\u201d</p><p>Cheryl frowned slightly. \u201cListen, first of all, you\u2019re not going to need much of a look to see you\u2019d be better off sleeping in your truck. And second, I\u2019ll only let someone stay there on a recommendation from the Sheridans. I don\u2019t really care if the thing burns down, but I don\u2019t want anything bad to happen in that neighborhood because I let some riffraff in.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled slightly. \u201cFirst of all, I am sleeping in my truck. And second, I could maybe get a reference from my boss. He seems to like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll vouch for him, Cheryl. If he thinks he wants to rent it,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>This caused a look of surprise to take over Dan\u2019s face, but it disappeared as David was shoving a Goldfish into his mouth.</p><p>Cheryl thought about it for a second. Then she shrugged. \u201cWell, at least it\u2019ll go cheap if you\u2019re interested. But you won\u2019t be interested. Come on, let\u2019s get this over with. I want to get home.\u201d And she turned and left.</p><p>Dan stood and hefted David toward Jack. \u201cWell, gee. Maybe my luck is turning around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I vouch for you,\u201d Jack said, \u201cI\u2019ll be watching you.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed. \u201cOh golly, Jack. I just wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>Dan got in his truck and followed Cheryl the short couple of blocks to the neighborhood. She had three other people besides herself in an extended cab truck\u2014one guy, two women. The truck bed was loaded with what appeared to be broken-down furniture, covered with a tarp and tied down. He supposed if they were cleaning out the house, she had needed some help.</p><p>He looked first at the neighborhood in general\u2014it wasn\u2019t upper middle class, that was for sure. The houses were small, most in poor repair. But there were a few that stood out and looked as if they were maintained with care, kept immaculate with tidy flower beds and healthy yards. When Cheryl pulled up in front of an old house, some of the flaws were instantly apparent\u2014the porch was missing boards and was about to fall down altogether, one window was covered with plastic kept in place by duct tape and the roof was about half-rotten shingles. Well, he wouldn\u2019t be getting up there. But he worked for a builder who had roofers\u2014maybe he could get a discount to keep the rain off his head.</p><p>Inside was actually better than he expected. It didn\u2019t smell great, but all that would take was soap and water. He stepped right into a living room/dining room\u2014the walls needed plaster and paint, the floors needed resurfacing, that window needed glass, the lighting fixtures were ancient and therefore so was much of the wiring. But there was a large stone fireplace on one wall, large windows on the other. A door off the dining area probably led to the bedroom.</p><p>The kitchen was small, barely room for a little table and four chairs, about 1950s vinyl decor. The linoleum on the floor was scarred, cracked, peeling and permanently stained. A couple of cupboard doors were missing and the stove and refrigerator were at least as old as he was. There seemed to be a room behind the kitchen, but the add-on was sloppy\u2014it wasn\u2019t level with the rest of the house. Dan stepped carefully across that uneven chasm and pushed the door open.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a larger bedroom off the dining room,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cBathroom\u2019s right there.\u201d She pointed to the right of the kitchen.</p><p>He peeked first into the bathroom\u2014nice size with a newly installed, as of about fifteen years ago, perfectly hideous shower. It was more like a large pan on the floor with a drain in it, a disgusting-looking shower curtain on a circular rod attached to the wall. He tilted his head and frowned as he studied the contraption. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if she could read his mind, she said, \u201cMy mother was a very large woman and couldn\u2019t handle the tub, so my dad, who is obviously not very handy with things like this, put in a shower for her. It\u2019s a terrible-looking thing, I know. And it needs a new curtain, but honestly, I never expected anyone to want to look at it. And when you get down to it, I don\u2019t have the money to make things nicer around here. It\u2019s as is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a washer and dryer, by any chance?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. They still work, too. Out back on the porch. It\u2019s not heated out there, but it\u2019s enclosed. And the water heater is only a few years old, so that should make it a while.\u201d</p> <p>He took a quick look at what one would call the master bedroom. It was really an awful-looking little house that had the potential to look nice\u2014barely big enough for a couple and one child. He could spend some time checking the structure later, but for now it appeared all its ugliness was merely cosmetic. Some elbow grease would make it civilized, but some remodeling talent could make it quaint.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe I could do a few things around here to make the place presentable if you give me a break on the rent. I\u2019m a builder by trade. You thinking you might sell it someday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019m not interested in living in it\u2014I work in Eureka. But I just found out the house was my responsibility, so...I guess I\u2019ll either rent it, sell it, or let the state take it for nonpayment of taxes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShew,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really do have some thinking to do. Listen, here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019ll pay you some rent and take care of the utilities. If you give me a break on the rent, I\u2019ll see if I can fix it up a little bit. If you decide to sell it and I make you an offer, you\u2019ll deduct my materials and labor from the price. Think about that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes just grew wider. \u201cYou can have it for two-fifty a month. Do whatever you want. You can\u2019t make it any worse, even if you\u2019re the worst builder in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should pay your taxes. Give you time to think. But you have to let me have it for a year, to make it worth my while to do some things to it. And I\u2019m not the worst builder in America.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>She put out her hand. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have some kind of contract?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. Try to be a nice guy about this and if you decide to abandon the place, lock up and let Jack know. Mrs. Sheridan has my number in Eureka.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, Jesus,\u201d he said, taking off his hat and running his hand over his short hair. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan Brady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cheryl Creighton. Be a good neighbor, will you? I think the last people who lived here were a lot of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. Us. My parents and I.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWould you like to seal this deal over a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I don\u2019t care for a drink. Do you drink a lot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe? I\u2019ve been known to have a beer or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet drunk a lot?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He frowned, having no idea what her issue was. Maybe she came from a hard-drinking family and it put her off in a big way. \u201cI get drunk not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not convenient. But I like a beer sometimes. That going to be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee,\u201d she said. \u201cThat must be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the utilities taken care of right away. Get them in your name. I\u2019ll come back out in a couple of weeks or a month and if you still want to live here, I\u2019ll pick up your rent check and give you an address to mail it to me.\u201d She wiggled a key off her key chain, handed it to him. \u201cIf you change your mind, give the key to Jack.\u201d</p><p>No first and last months\u2019 rent? No security deposit? he wondered. Then he realized a security deposit on this dump was ridiculous, but you\u2019d think she\u2019d want to get a month\u2019s rent out of him. He pulled out his wallet and peeled off five twenties. \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll take care of the rest of the month. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do anything bad to your house. And I work for a guy from town, so I\u2019m not going to steal from you or anything.\u201d</p><p>She actually gave a huff of laughter. What could he possibly steal? The forty-year-old stove and refrigerator? \u201cYeah, good,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, at least you\u2019ll get the ugliest hot shower of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that will be a good thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gave a curt nod, turned and left. He just stood there a minute, totally perplexed. She was a little messed up from cleaning out this dump of a house, but there was no concealing her basic good looks, trim figure. But there was also no concealing the unhappy person inside.</p><p>And then he heard her truck depart from the front of the house. Her business was done here.</p><p>Since her one-night visit to Virgin River, Muriel had tried to talk to Walt every day, but occasionally she\u2019d miss one. By mid-April she\u2019d been working on her movie two months. They had started some sound-stage filming in a fake farmhouse built on a studio lot, and there was a lot more of that to do. But now came the real deal. The cast and crew were moving to Montana to film on location. This was her perfect opportunity for another escape. While most of the company moved on to set up, she could take some time and arrive when they were ready for her. Given her experience, trusted professionalism and\u2014oh, yes\u2014she was the other big star, she could take a break. No production company Lear this time, so she got a ticket on a private commuter and flew into the little Garberville airport. One of the ground crew gave her a lift out to her house.</p><p>Lately, whenever she\u2019d talked to Walt, Muriel had been hearing something distant in his voice. Maybe it was just his loneliness with her being away. Or maybe he was unwilling to compete with her career. Maybe, regardless of what he said, he\u2019d expected her to say no to a fantastic acting opportunity to stay home with him, proving her love. Given the number of men she\u2019d been through in her life and her independence, she could just say Phhhhttt\u2014get over it. Everyone gets a life, bub, not just the boys.</p><p>And that\u2019s what she would say, if she became convinced he was just another difficult man who had to be sure he was always on top, that he was first ahead of her work, her sense of self, her need to be productive. She just hadn\u2019t seen that in him. There was something different about Walt, and she\u2019d known it since the first moment she\u2019d met him. He had all the ingredients of the superior male beast\u2014big, tough, heroic, masterful, dominant. But then she\u2019d see him with his daughter or grandchild and realize that he was more than that. He had a tenderness so deep, a loyalty so strong, and a reliability so constant she wanted to embrace it and never let go.</p><p>So she was taking her brief ten-day hiatus in Virgin River to find out if Walt was just another man, or maybe a little lonely, in need of reassurance. She\u2019d earned the break. And Walt, she thought, had earned the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>The pilot of her plane had asked around and found her a ride. Once home, she called Walt\u2019s house, but there was no answer. Jeez. Hollywood might be all superficial fluff, but at least they could exist on cell phones!</p><p>She rustled up her extra set of keys and took her truck into town. Ah, there he was\u2014his Tahoe was parked in front of Jack\u2019s with quite a few other vehicles. A glance at her watch told her it was probably dinnertime. She walked into the quiet hum of conversation; Jack\u2019s was rarely real noisy. She pulled off her hat, ruffled her hair with her fingers and scanned the room. Then she saw his broad back. He sat up at the bar talking with his niece, Shelby, while Luke stood behind Shelby with a hand on her shoulder. On Walt\u2019s other side was Paul, lifting a beer.</p><p>\u201cHey, now,\u201d she heard Jack say, causing them all to turn.</p><p>Muriel had taught herself to read people a long time ago. It was necessary in her line of work to get a message from the body language and the eyes. Walt smiled a little bit, but his posture opened to her and his eyes grew instantly warm. Yet it was Shelby who jumped off her stool. \u201cMuriel! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She gave Shelby a hug. \u201cTaking a little break from filming while I can. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect! But what about you? Is it incredibly exciting?\u201d</p><p>Muriel chuckled. \u201cNo, sweetheart. It\u2019s mundane. It just happens to fill up about sixteen hours a day and is usually exhausting.\u201d She walked toward the men, arm in arm with Shelby. \u201cWalt, I tried to call. You weren\u2019t home so I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood bet,\u201d he said, leaning toward her. He slipped an arm around her waist and gave her a peck on the cheek.</p><p>Ah, there it was. She could feel the vibration under his skin. He was glad to see her. Maybe relieved. She didn\u2019t want to make a scene by throwing herself into his arms, so she turned to Luke. \u201cHow are you? I see he didn\u2019t shoot you.\u201d</p><p>Luke laughed and shook his head. \u201cNot yet. But I\u2019m still listening for that rifle cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m still listening for that,\u201d Paul said, sipping his beer.</p><p>Jack chuckled and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure, Muriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a beer? Whatever you think I\u2019ll like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said, slapping a napkin on the bar.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the family, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExceptional. Mel\u2019s exceptionally gorgeous and demanding, Emma\u2019s exceptionally beautiful and David is an exceptionally bad terrible two. We may not survive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, weaker men than you have made it through that stage,\u201d she said. She picked up her beer and raised it. \u201cI hope you have some good gossip. I\u2019ve missed the hell out of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can keep you entertained for a little while,\u201d Shelby said. And for the next half hour or so, she laughed and hummed at the local tales, both funny and serious. Shelby had decided to make Luke\u2019s life and marry him, date to be announced, the local pediatrician was living with Vanni\u2019s pregnant girlfriend, Jack was having trouble getting Rick to open up on the phone about how he was doing in rehab, but within a couple of weeks he could go down to Naval Medical Center in San Diego to pick him up, bring him home. And little David had a big, round, purple lump on his forehead from throwing himself on the floor in a temper and banging his head.</p><p>Walt didn\u2019t let it go on very long. Jack handed him a sack of some of Preacher\u2019s takeout and he stood from the bar. \u201cYou must be starving,\u201d he said to Muriel. He lifted one dark brow and tilted his head toward the door.</p><p>Now, Muriel was too aware that if anyone else in this bar had pulled that trick, the laughter and jeering would have been relentless. No one got by with anything around here, and certainly nothing that obvious. But this was the general and even Shelby, who had him wrapped around her little finger, was cautious. Respectful.</p><p>\u201cStarving,\u201d she said with a smile. Then she turned to Jack. \u201cI\u2019ll be around for ten days. I\u2019ll see plenty of everyone. Tell Mel I said hello and I\u2019ll catch up with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Outside, on the bar\u2019s porch, Walt slipped an arm around her waist. He put his rough cheek against hers and said, \u201cYour horses are fed. Come to my place. The usual suspects now know better than to step foot near it.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later she was laughing hysterically as her Labs assaulted her while Walt tried to pin her against the wall just inside the door. And, oh God, had she needed to come home!</p><p>\u201cTen days?\u201d he asked, his voice coarse.</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do while you\u2019re here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to ride, run the dogs and sit on my porch with you and a glass of wine, watching the sun go down. Then I\u2019d like to sit on my porch with you in the morning with coffee and watch it come up. And this,\u201d she said, running her hands over his shoulders and down his arms. \u201cI want to stay real close to the feeling of your arms around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds doable,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about we start with a nice, slow, relaxing orgasm? Then we can make plans while we have dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she said, kissing him.</p> <p>Rick Sudder had been at the San Diego Naval Medical Center for a little over a month. He\u2019d transferred from the ward into the barracks weeks ago and had his new preparatory prosthesis. It was a hard plastic socket for his stump attached to a mechanical knee and then a titanium pylon attached to a plastic foot. It would probably be a couple more months before he\u2019d get the real deal, a fake leg that at least looked like a fake leg instead of a rod stuck into a running shoe. And that was another thing\u2014the running shoe. He didn\u2019t wear running shoes unless he was playing basketball. He wore boots. But this was safer, sturdier, and the height of the sole was significant in measuring the length of the pylon so he\u2019d be level. From what he heard from other amputees around the barracks, he should feel lucky to be level.</p><p>He was still learning the ropes. A below-the-knee amputation was a piece of cake compared to his\u2014he had to learn to balance and operate a mechanical knee. Frankly, he preferred the wheelchair or crutches. The wheelchair had to be weighted on the front side bars so he wouldn\u2019t tip over backward because he no longer had the counterweight that his leg would have provided, but he still would rather that than a walker. And crutches were a little unstable, not that it mattered to him. But they insisted on the walker, which made him feel like an old man. Plus, he was still hurting. His foot where there was no foot itched till he wanted to lose his mind.</p><p>The pain was so much more manageable, but leaning his weight on the prosthesis was tough and the phantom pain still drove him crazy, especially at night. That, he was told, wasn\u2019t exactly easily remedied. It was a process of retraining the nerves, a tedious, frustrating exercise. He was walking now, inside the parallel bars and with the walker.</p><p>In rehab he\u2019d been focusing on straightening the leg to prevent contractures\u2014the shortening of the muscles in the thigh of his amputated leg. He\u2019d been forced to lie on his belly, something they called proning, and lift that stump to extend his hip. Then he\u2019d stand at the bars while a therapist pulled back on it. And he was instructed to repeat these exercises while on his own, but he didn\u2019t. Getting better didn\u2019t interest him enough, and he knew that. He also knew he\u2019d probably be sorry, but motivation was hard to embrace.</p><p>Then there was group. Group was almost unbearable. Let\u2019s all get together and talk about what it feels like to lose your limbs or not be able to move your body from the waist down, what fun! Let\u2019s have a little chat about how scrambled your brain is after you\u2019ve been shot/blown up/crushed. Or, how about we have a good cry followed by a group hug? And then, the frosting on the cake, accept praise from the group moderator\u2014who, by the way, has arms and legs and doesn\u2019t have to get around in a chair\u2014because you let it all out and cried in front of the boys.</p> <p>Rick wasn\u2019t sure he could stand much more of this. The only thought worse was going home like this, with a brain like so much spaghetti and one leg even worse than Captain Ahab\u2019s.</p><p>He had to admit to himself, being in the barracks as opposed to the ward was better, especially the freedom of movement. All the men had some form of disability, and they traveled back and forth to the hospital physical therapy department, but also to the exchange to buy anything from snacks to paperbacks, to the base movie theater, or on outings with friends or family members. His roommates were more relaxed, more honest. He was actually forming some relationships. They were like members of a squad, almost. The gimp squad. But at least they could bitch about the physical terrorists, the counselors, their families or girlfriends or buddies back home who just didn\u2019t seem to get it, and they didn\u2019t have to bare their souls or cry to be doing it right.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t complain about the food or the weather. He couldn\u2019t remember the Marine Corps or navy ever feeding him decent food before this. And San Diego in April was like a piece of heaven. The sun was bright and warm, the breeze was clean and smelt vaguely of the sea, at night the sky was usually clear or the storms gathered off the coast and put on a light show over the ocean. He spent as much time outside as he could, finding a bench or chair in either the courtyard or in front of the barracks and just parked there, soaking up the sun. The southern California sun was so much sweeter than that mean, harsh desert sun in Iraq.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t ever been this much sun in Virgin River; if the height of the trees didn\u2019t block it, then the clouds did. In Virgin River you wore your sealskin eleven months of the year; mountain life was chilly to cold almost year-round.</p><p>His cell phone chimed in his pocket and he pulled it out to see who was calling. Unknown. That was a trick only Liz tried, hoping he\u2019d pick up. Jack never bothered with that because Jack wasn\u2019t a crafty teenage girl. He let it go to voice mail. Liz had been sending him things at least twice a week. Stupid things. Cookies she made that weren\u2019t all that good, magazines that looked used, cheap cologne, as if he\u2019d be going out on some date or something, Soap-On-A-Rope and razors, like the Naval Medical Center wouldn\u2019t keep him clean. A Saint Christopher medal. For what? To keep him safe from now on? Stupid, stupid things. Things that made his eyes water at her sweet caring, her simple but beautiful attempts to bring him any level of pleasure. He treated her like such shit she should just cut him loose and spend all those efforts on someone else, someone who deserved it.</p><p>A car pulled up in front of the barracks, a woman jumped out of the driver\u2019s side and ran around to the passenger door. Her skirt was short and flouncy, her knit top snug, legs long and shapely. And man, what an ass\u2014round and tight and pretty. Aaron\u2019s woman. Aaron was one of his roommates, about a week ahead of him in this rehab program.</p> <p>She held out her hand to Aaron and helped him stay steady while he stepped out on his prosthetic leg, the preparatory kind. And once he had himself balanced in the open car door, he pulled his woman against him and she molded there, planting her lips on his, her firm breasts pressed up against him, his arms around her waist with one hand slipping down to that fabulous butt to pull her even closer.</p><p>Aaron was about thirty and this was his fianc\u00e9e. He was one happy-go-lucky son of a bitch, like nothing much was wrong. He had also been wounded in Iraq, but he hadn\u2019t been blown up. He took a bullet and it shattered his knee so catastrophically they had to amputate, yet to listen to him, talk to him, you\u2019d think this was some minor fucking inconvenience. Rick vacillated between admiring him and hating him.</p><p>While Aaron kissed his girl, Rick\u2019s voice-mail message alert bleeped. But Rick watched Aaron. He wondered what it would feel like to believe he had the right to do that to a woman, with a woman.</p><p>Aaron had said he was going to run some wedding-planning errands with his girl and if he was real lucky, he\u2019d be able to talk her into some afternoon delight at a hotel that was handicap friendly, haw haw haw. He looked pretty delighted, pretty relaxed. Apparently that had worked out for him.</p><p>\u201cWant me to walk you in, baby?\u201d the fianc\u00e9e asked.</p><p>He grabbed for his cane out of the front seat. \u201cNah, sweetheart, I got it. I\u2019ll talk to you tonight.\u201d Then he grinned. \u201cGlad we got everything taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d she said, giving him another quick kiss. \u201cPractice up now so you can come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I will,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>Aw, Jesus, Rick thought. Can we get any sweeter? You\u2019re a goddamn cripple! Have you noticed, crip, you haven\u2019t got a real leg there? And the one they gave you\u2014it\u2019s not working that good.</p><p>She held his hand, backing away from him so slowly like they couldn\u2019t bear to be apart. Rick felt it squeeze his chest. Vaguely, in the back of his mind, it reminded him of the way he\u2019d pulled away from Liz when he said goodbye to her before leaving for Iraq.</p><p>He squashed the memory.</p><p>Aaron walked slowly toward Rick, who sat on the bench outside the front door of the barracks, his walker beside him.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing, Rick?\u201d Aaron asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Rick said, because he knew how the game was played. You stay up! You stay positive! You act like getting this fake piece-of-shit leg was your fucking dream come true! \u201cHow was your afternoon? Or do I even need to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Aaron said, not taking the bait. \u201cWe got some things done. Sandy has this whole wedding business nailed. All I do is say, looks good to me.\u201d He smiled a bit wistfully. \u201cShe\u2019s so great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you had a little afternoon delight, too,\u201d Rick suggested.</p><p>\u201cAny time I get to spend with Sandy is perfect,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity, isn\u2019t it kind of difficult?\u201d</p><p>Aaron stood right in front of him, forcing him to look up. \u201cWhat, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex?\u201d</p><p>Rick was speechless for a second. He\u2019d rather speak in code, but Aaron was pretty upfront. Especially with these issues. \u201cUh, yeah. That.\u201d</p><p>Aaron laughed. \u201cIt was a lot harder to learn how to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the leg go?\u201d Rick heard himself ask.</p><p>\u201cRight up against the wall, pal. It\u2019s not real soft and cuddly. But I get some very fine traction without it.\u201d Then he chuckled. \u201cYou worried about that, my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me make this easy for you. I take it off. That seems to be the popular solution for most men. And I\u2019m going to get this thing broken in as quick as I can. I want to walk Sandy down the aisle and dance with her at the reception. It might not be Fred Astaire style, but if I don\u2019t fall on my ass, I\u2019ll be damn happy.\u201d</p><p>Rick grinned, but he thought, you simple fool. You screw with a stump and limp around the dance floor like an idiot and you\u2019re damn happy? Fool. \u201cGood for you,\u201d Rick said, because that\u2019s what he was expected to say.</p><p>\u201cYou have a girl, don\u2019t you, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNo girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard there was a girl back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I dated some, that\u2019s all. No girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Aaron said, grinning. \u201cYou have something to look forward to. I didn\u2019t find my Sandy till I was twenty-six.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t you have a couple of legs then? Rick wanted to ask. But he said, \u201cSure. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>When Aaron had gone inside, Rick checked his message.</p><p>\u201cHi, Rick, it\u2019s me. You never pick up and I guess I stopped expecting you to call back, but I just wanted to call you anyway, tell you I think about you every second. I\u2019m graduating in less than two months, can you believe that? This girl you had to beg to stay in school? And guess what? I have all As. But I think I told you that already. Maybe a hundred times. That is, if you listen to the messages. I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe you just delete them. But anyway, I know you\u2019re going to be out of there before too much longer, and it would just be so...awesome...if you came to graduation. I\u2019d be so proud to have you come. I guess I won\u2019t know anything about that until you call me back. Hey!\u201d she said, changing her tone. \u201cI sent you a little something. I hope you like it.\u201d</p><p>Rick clicked off the phone. Then he turned it back on and replayed the message. Then replayed it again. Then listened to an older one, her voice making his eyes sting and then cloud. He missed her so much. But he couldn\u2019t...couldn\u2019t...couldn\u2019t... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, sure. Like I\u2019m going to watch you graduate, your boyfriend, with a peg leg in a pair of dorky running shoes. Get real, he thought. Then he turned off the phone and put it in his pocket.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Abby called Cameron at about three in the afternoon to say, \u201cDon\u2019t eat at Jack\u2019s tonight\u2014I\u2019m cooking us a special dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it. Can I bring anything home from the corner store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I already shopped at the grocery in Fortuna. I\u2019ve been shopping all day, buying little things for the babies. Just the essential newborn things in neutral colors until we find out the sex of the second baby. I can\u2019t wait to show you everything.\u201d</p><p>She was so happy, so excited, it left Cameron grinning like a schoolboy, hardly able to abide two more hours with nothing to do at the clinic. But he didn\u2019t want to rush home and spoil Abby\u2019s special dinner.</p><p>Still, Cameron left the clinic early and drove all the way to Grace Valley to buy her a bouquet of flowers. He made a mental note to tell Connie she might want to stock a few bouquets from time to time\u2014he couldn\u2019t be the only husband who wanted to surprise his wife with some flowers. Oh, that\u2019s right! he thought with a laugh. I\u2019m not a husband, she\u2019s not a wife. They were just playing house. But they were playing it very well. The first thing they\u2019d done after she moved her clothes into the closet at the cabin was drive over to Eureka and buy two cribs, a changing table and small chest of drawers. They spent some time looking at baby products online at Babies \u2019R\u2019 Us so Abby could pick out what she liked and they could start a steady stream of purchasing right up to the births.</p><p>What had Abby said, that they\u2019d probably be completely incompatible? Far from it. They moved through that tiny cabin so smoothly and with such ease, it was as if they\u2019d lived together for years. In barely two weeks, they were becoming good friends, almost a couple. This was what he\u2019d expected since the moment he met her, that they\u2019d bond this way. And there was affection as well. They found plenty to talk about that had nothing to do with her pregnancy or the twins and had become comfortable enough in each other\u2019s company for the casual touching of hands, arms, shoulders; there was even an occasional kiss on the brow or cheek. At first it was Cameron, giving her that avuncular peck, but soon it was Abby, also, standing on her toes to kiss his cheek.</p> <p>The only thing that could make him happier would be if they could become a real family\u2014husband, wife and kids. This was still in its infancy and Abby needed time. But she liked him, he knew she did. She couldn\u2019t keep it secret. She liked him, depended on him, respected him. It was going in the right direction.</p><p>He walked into the cabin to see pots on the stove, the makings of a salad in progress scattered around the counter, and Abby\u2019s feet hoisted up on the arm of the sofa. He leaned over the back of the sofa and looked down at her. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my ankles got bigger and bigger all day, and while I was making dinner my back started to kill me. Then I had a contraction! I felt it! It was big and long. So I stopped what I was doing and just laid down. And I\u2019ve had a few more since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call, getting off your feet,\u201d he said. He tossed the flowers on the counter and went around to the front of the couch and sat on the trunk. \u201cYou probably overdid it today, got a little dehydrated\u2014that can bring on the Braxton Hicks. You\u2019re carrying a big load for a full day of shopping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel like an elephant. And I could hardly stand up anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your back now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, lying down. But, Cameron, I have to make it at least six more weeks and I\u2019m not sure I can expand any more without exploding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he said, opening his bag on the floor beside the sofa. \u201cI\u2019m going to take your blood pressure, just to see where you are, but I bet you were just on your feet too long today. You\u2019re probably going to have to watch that. And roll onto your left side for me\u2014try not to lie flat on your back like that. It distresses the babies sometimes.\u201d He fit the digital cuff around her wrist and held her wrist across her heart for a more accurate reading. When it beeped, he looked at the little screen. \u201cIt\u2019s just up a little. But your heart is racing. Calm down, everything is all right.\u201d</p><p>She got tears in her eyes. \u201cWhat if I go into labor too early? What if something goes wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey, listen. If you\u2019re earlier than thirty-five weeks, we\u2019ll airlift you to Redding to have a neonatal ICU available in case we need it, but there\u2019s no indication that\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re in perfect health, but you\u2019re very pregnant and your body is going to let you know when you need more rest and relaxation. And you have to keep up the fluids. You should start lying down on your left side for twenty minutes or so every couple of hours to keep the swelling under control and give your body a chance to rejuvenate. That\u2019s not going to be too hard to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds dreadful,\u201d she said. \u201cHighly inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one dark brow. \u201cHow does complete bed rest sound? Because it\u2019s not unusual for women carrying twins to be put to bed at the end to hang on and grow them a little more. You can avoid that for a long time by taking it easy while you can.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes clouded over. \u201cI think I want my mother.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the hair back from her temple and over her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re past traveling, Ab. But we can call your mother if you\u2019d like, ask her if she can come. I could give her my bed and sleep at the clinic. Maybe a visit from your mother would help. Think about it\u2014but remember, she\u2019ll want to be here when the babies come. That\u2019s not far away, Abby. Even if you go as far as Dr. Stone and Mel would like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...she always calms me down when I get all upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to apply for that job\u2014see if I have any talent in that department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Cameron! There\u2019s another one,\u201d she said, her hand on her belly and her eyes wide as doughnuts.</p><p>He carefully lifted her top and put his hand, firm and warm, on her belly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt at all, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraxton Hicks. Bet it doesn\u2019t last thirty seconds. Having a lot of those can soften the cervix, which is probably why there are some OBs who think the more of those practice contractions you have, the smoother and quicker the labor will be, but I can\u2019t recall if there\u2019s any research to that effect. Ah.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOver in less than thirty seconds. It\u2019s all right, honey. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could check you, see if you\u2019re dilated or effaced at all, but really, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s so...intimate.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cAbby, we didn\u2019t get this way sharing a glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014 That was such a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty weeks,\u201d he said. Then he smiled warmly. \u201cStay calm. I had some training in this.\u201d He leaned over and gave her belly a kiss. \u201cSweet,\u201d he murmured, pulling her top down.</p><p>She smiled a small smile. \u201cHave you told your mother yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I better do that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. What will you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the part I\u2019m having some trouble with....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you were blatantly honest?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThe unvarnished truth would be\u2014I met this knockout woman, had a wonderful but too short relationship with her, and found out later we\u2019re expecting twins. So of course we\u2019re having them. Together.\u201d Then he added, \u201cCongratulations, Gram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she says, \u2018Cameron Michaels, you get married at once, or else!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-six, Abby. My mother can\u2019t tell me what to do anymore. What we do is our business, not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell her soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some good news for you,\u201d he said, deftly changing the subject. \u201cYour credit cards are paid off. You don\u2019t owe anything more to your ex-husband. Brie is drafting a letter to him to explain you won\u2019t be accepting any more alimony and want to consider the matter closed. You might want to talk to her about that so you understand exactly what she can do, what she can\u2019t do. But it looks like it\u2019s just about over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is good news. I can\u2019t wait until all that\u2019s behind me. Do you think there\u2019s any chance I can still get into trouble for\u2014you know\u2014breaking my prenup with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s so unlikely. He has bigger fish to fry. But just so you don\u2019t let that possibility get you all worked up, if there\u2019s a problem, we\u2019ll have Brie negotiate it down and pay it off, fifty dollars a month if we have to. Abby, even the worst case isn\u2019t going to be a big deal. Let\u2019s move on from that. It\u2019s given us enough trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that idea,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I finish the dinner you started,\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have going out there?\u201d he asked, pointing his chin toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cChicken cacciatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You couldn\u2019t have been whipping up an omelet or hamburgers, huh?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost done. Simmer what\u2019s in the skillet, make the pasta, finish the salad.\u201d</p><p>He stood up. \u201cYou must have been hungry when you started this meal. What about your heartburn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s chicken cacciatore without onions and peppers and only a small amount of garlic. It could be awful.\u201d</p><p>He touched her nose. \u201cGo get into something comfortable. Your flannel nightgown or some sweats. Grab your DVD player and some movies. We\u2019ll eat on the sofa and put on a DVD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry about the dinner.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSorry about the backache and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCankles,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cCankles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when there\u2019s no definition between your calves and ankles.\u201d She held up a foot. \u201cCankles.\u201d And she pushed herself up from the couch, falling back. He put out a hand to pull her up and she said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>When the dinner was ready, Cam fixed a nice-looking tray and brought it to her. She took it and held it out in front of her for a moment. Her lap was gone; there was no place to put it. With a chuckle, he took it from her, placed it on the trunk and handed her the salad bowl. On instinct, she was soon balancing it on her big belly, making him laugh. \u201cWe should get some pictures one of these days,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could bear it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut later, when you\u2019re in your old body, you\u2019re going to wish you had some. Mel\u2019s great with the digital camera. We\u2019ll get her to shoot a few.\u201d He lifted her tray and with it balanced on his knees, he cut up her chicken. \u201cJust something to remember this by. We\u2019re long past that craziness of wishing it wasn\u2019t so, aren\u2019t we? I mean,\u201d he said, cutting and slicing, \u201cI hope you are. I don\u2019t think I felt that way for one second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbby, you can\u2019t do this, sitting on the couch. I thought I\u2019d make it easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel like an invalid,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJust concentrate on feeling like someone who deserves to be spoiled.\u201d Finished, he put the plate back on her tray and went to fetch his own. \u201cHow\u2019s the food taste? Did I do anything to screw it up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d she said. \u201cBland, but good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Abby. And there\u2019s ice cream if it\u2019s not bland enough. What movie did you decide on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Women Want. Mel Gibson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI better pay attention to that one,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI seem to be deficient in that department.\u201d When they\u2019d finished, he picked up their trays. \u201cYou can start it or wait for me to do dishes, your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d she said. And once the water was running in the little kitchen, she murmured, \u201cAnd you\u2019re not deficient in anything.\u201d</p><p>It was dark in the little cabin but for the light from the portable DVD player. She had set it to play repeatedly, so had no idea when they might have fallen asleep, but the romping of babies woke her. Cam had slipped under her legs, resting them on his thighs to keep them elevated, so she was too cozy to stay awake. She looked over at him and had to stifle a laugh. His feet were up on the trunk, his head tilted back, his mouth open, and his hand snaked under her sweatshirt to feel her belly. But the movement of the babies hadn\u2019t roused him. Yet.</p><p>She pressed her hand over his and watched him. He slowly came awake, closing his mouth, sitting up, meeting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. I must have done that in my sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she laughed. \u201cDo you have any idea what time it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said through a yawn. \u201cWas it a good movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe both bit the dust. Me, from tension probably. And you, from working yourself to death to stay ahead of my tension.\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cMy children are up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good sign. It would be better if they slept when we slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go to bed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be three in the morning. I\u2019m afraid to look.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and put out his hand. \u201cCome on, sleepyhead.\u201d</p> <p>When she stood from the couch and faced him, she looked into his beautiful blue eyes and said, \u201cWould you like to sleep next to your children?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were startled, his mouth agape.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be like the last time,\u201d she hastened to promise.</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cIt will be even better,\u201d he said, slipping his hand over her belly. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t pass up an invitation like that. I\u2019d like to feel all of you up against me, cozy and safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come on.\u201d</p><p>Abby had her turn in the bathroom first and when Cam came out, she had changed into a huge T-shirt that came almost to her knees and, he assumed, panties. So he stripped down to his boxers and crawled in, curling around her back. \u201cNice,\u201d he whispered against the back of her neck.</p> <p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed, snuggling in.</p><p>His hands found her belly and rested there and sleep found him, content and confident for the first time in so long. He was going to make this work. Yes, he was.</p><p>In the early morning he woke and he was facing her, her head on his arm, her breath on his cheek, her belly against his belly. And one hand under her shirt, cupping her bare breast. And a huge, throbbing, early-morning erection in his boxers. He pulled his hips away from her first, then slowly removed his hand. Whoa, shit, he thought. That would probably ensure this was his last visit to her bed. But what was he supposed to do? He couldn\u2019t control what he didn\u2019t know he was doing. But still, there must be a way to assure her that he\u2019d never... That he knew she was as big and ripe as a full-term mother.... That it wasn\u2019t necessarily that he wanted... But of course he wanted her, but he didn\u2019t have to... Oh God, he couldn\u2019t figure out how to get out of this embarrassing situation without offending her, insulting her. Or scaring her to death.</p><p>He gently pulled his arm out from under her and headed for the shower.</p><p>Cameron beat Mel to the clinic in the morning. While she was bright and cheerful, he was awful quiet. He busied himself at the computer. When she asked him what he was doing, he said, \u201cCar seats. We need two car seats and Abby just about wore herself out shopping in Eureka yesterday, so I told her I\u2019d look online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mel said. \u201cGood idea. I guess a pediatrician knows what to look for.\u201d</p><p>Two hours and two patients later, he was still acting as if something was wrong. So she went head-on, as she was known to do. \u201cWhat\u2019s eating at you? You\u2019re all funky and weird, like you and Abby have a problem or something.\u201d He ducked his head. \u201cOh, you and Abby have a problem. What\u2019s the matter? Can I help? Is the pregnancy all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can help,\u201d he said, turning away from her and heading for the kitchen.</p><p>She followed him. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know, though, do you? Until you run it by me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing,\u201d he said, not facing her.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I look at cracks and talk about sex for a living. You can\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>He turned around. \u201cI was thinking it would be embarrassing for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, get over it. I\u2019m your midwife.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cAbby and I are getting along very well. It\u2019s incredible. Better than I thought it could be. We\u2019re so compatible. And last night I slept beside her, holding her and the babies....\u201d He dropped his chin.</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet. I\u2019m so happy, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd woke up with my hand up her shirt and with the biggest hard-on.\u201d</p><p>Mel looked momentarily perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I need to know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much just being near her is getting to me. I can\u2019t let her think that\u2014 I mean, I let her think it would be completely safe for me to just lie beside her and... Aw, Christ. I have no control at all. What a damn mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, take it easy. Most of that\u2019s just nature. Huh? It happens all night long. I\u2019m sure Abby knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just happening when I\u2019m asleep. I really have a problem here. I\u2019ve wanted that woman since the first second I saw her, but she\u2019s in no condition for me to want her like that. What kind of man wants to... I mean, I won\u2019t touch her, I swear I won\u2019t. But if she thinks she\u2019s not safe from my instincts, then I\u2019ll be sent back up to the loft. And I don\u2019t want to go back up to the loft!\u201d He took a breath, shook his head dismally. \u201cI should probably go back up to the loft.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s face cracked into a huge grin. \u201cMy goodness. The Madonna syndrome? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mother of your children can\u2019t also be a sexual human being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she\u2019s ripe as a tomato! She\u2019s thirty weeks! With twins! It would be irresponsible to\u2014 You know we don\u2019t want a lot of action down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, surely you have a better imagination than you\u2019re letting on. I mean, there are a few alternative methods of sharing affection that don\u2019t involve intercourse. But of course I agree\u2014intercourse now is probably not the best idea, even though we\u2019re not necessarily concerned about early labor. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of relationship. At least, not now. We agreed to share this space so I could be there for her. So we could have them together and rely on each other. Not so we could explore alternative methods of affection, by which I\u2019m sure you mean manual or oral.\u201d He ran a hand over his chest as if wiping it dry. \u201cShe probably shouldn\u2019t play around with orgasms anyway. That\u2019s all we need is a little early labor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, this is something for you to talk to her about,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYou afraid you\u2019ll shock her? Didn\u2019t you get her pregnant? Isn\u2019t she aware you have a healthy libido?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she has no idea how healthy. Really, I wasn\u2019t prepared to find her sexier than ever. She can\u2019t even get up off the couch without a hand and I\u2019m ready to spring into action and\u2014\u201d He stopped himself. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>Mel just chuckled. \u201cListen, while she\u2019s feeling big as a cow, I doubt she\u2019d be insulted to learn she actually turns you on. Know what I mean? It might lead to some meaningful communication, which it sounds like the two of you could use.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t help herself. She chuckled again and put a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to laugh at me,\u201d he groused.</p><p>\u201cAw, I think you\u2019re cute. Talk to her. You said you\u2019re getting close. Tell her how you\u2019ve been feeling, et cetera. And you can also explain why it\u2019s not an excellent idea to have a wild romp in the hay just now. But you don\u2019t have to be embarrassed by your feelings and frankly, I don\u2019t think a little orgasm or two would hurt. You\u2019re not tempting fate for at least a couple more weeks. Desiring her when she\u2019s in this phase of motherhood\u2014that\u2019s sweet.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cJack sure didn\u2019t have this problem. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed by his feelings. Frustrated by them, yes. Embarrassed? Pah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Jack is the guy I should be talking to....\u201d</p><p>Mel lost every trace of humor. \u201cOkay, I have to draw the line there. You can\u2019t do that. Jack might say too much\u2014he\u2019s been known to do that once or twice. And I can\u2019t have you conjuring up pictures of me in\u2014\u201d She straightened her spine. \u201cI\u2019m your boss, I think. I am, yes I am. You\u2019re the doctor, but it\u2019s my clinic. I can\u2019t have you picturing me in compromising positions, even if they might help your pathetic sex life, because I\u2019m your boss.\u201d</p><p>He just grinned largely, happily. As of her last words, he didn\u2019t need Jack\u2019s input to drum up an image or two. Her turn to squirm. She\u2019d certainly enjoyed his discomfort, but all he said with regards to hers was, \u201cWhy, Melinda. Hmm.\u201d</p><p>As the April afternoons became warmer and perfect for riding, Muriel rode along the river with Vanessa and Shelby while Walt watched the baby. It was Muriel\u2019s last day in Virgin River and spending time with the girls had become almost as important as spending it with Walt. And spring in the mountains was exhilarating; bright green with a smattering of colorful wildflowers along the riverbank. They rode along at a leisurely pace, enjoying the fresh air and conversation.</p><p>\u201cIs there a date set for the wedding yet?\u201d Muriel asked Shelby.</p><p>\u201cNo, not exactly. We can\u2019t figure out when to do it, where to do it. Luke still has two brothers in the Middle East. I think we should wait for them to get home and he thinks we\u2019d better hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d Muriel asked.</p><p>\u201cWe want to have a baby,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>Muriel just frowned. \u201cShelby, you\u2019re so young\u2014you have lots of time. It\u2019s not like your clock is ticking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she laughed. \u201cLuke\u2019s clock is ticking. He\u2019ll be thirty-nine next month. He\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to be going to high-school football games with a walker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to have a little time with him first? Alone time? Before you add a baby to the mix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that, but I get his point. I\u2019m just so pleased he\u2019s going along with the family idea, I\u2019m being cooperative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd school?\u201d Muriel asked.</p><p>\u201cThe nursing program officially starts in September, but I\u2019m going to take classes this summer to get a head start. There will be an orientation day in June and I can take Luke with me, but I had a tour already. The students in that program are men and women, all ages, and I mean all ages\u2014from eighteen to fifty. The only thing I had to work out with Luke is that he\u2019s going to be a totally involved father and not leave it to me to manage all the child-care issues alone so I can go to school.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Muriel asked.</p><p>Shelby laughed. \u201cFor someone who insisted marriage and family would never be in his future, he can\u2019t wait. If it was up to Luke, we\u2019d take off for the justice of the peace. But his mother would absolutely kill him if he did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better plan enough in advance so I can make it,\u201d Muriel warned.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Shelby asked. \u201cYou\u2019d come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d come. It\u2019ll take some planning, and maybe some conniving, if I\u2019m still on this movie when you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel, are you anxious to get back to the movie?\u201d Vanessa asked her.</p><p>\u201cIn a way,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cSometimes the chemistry is so good on a set, with all the people involved, that it\u2019s like forming a family. That\u2019s not typical. It\u2019s like all the planets lined up\u2014the script, the cast, the crew, the direction. And I think the fact that we\u2019re going to Montana rather than New Delhi or Greenland gives everyone a real positive attitude. Montana in the summer\u2014a great idea. A lot of people are bringing families.\u201d She was quiet for a moment. \u201cThey could have filmed here,\u201d she said as she moved her mare down the river path, right between Vanni and Shelby on their mounts. \u201cThe setting is just as good, the weather just as wonderful in summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to miss the general,\u201d Vanessa said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI wish he\u2019d come to Montana. At least for a visit. They rented me a small house up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you asked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Something about that idea bothers him. He keeps saying we\u2019ll see. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be putting in long hours\u2014I had to tell the truth about that. But really, I suspect Walt doesn\u2019t think he can fit into my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two serious?\u201d Vanni asked. Muriel shot her a look and Vanni actually blushed. \u201cI mean, are you... I mean, you don\u2019t have to say anything.... I mean, I was just wondering if\u2014 Oh, hell, mind your own business, Vanessa!\u201d she self-admonished.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s serious?\u201d Muriel asked. \u201cDo I think he\u2019s just about the greatest man I\u2019ve ever met? I do. If I started to list all the things that make him wonderful, we wouldn\u2019t have time. Are we going to get married or anything like that? No. But could this fantastic relationship we have go on for a long time? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to put my foot in my mouth all over again, but why are you so sure you won\u2019t get married?\u201d Vanni asked.</p> <p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019ve had five husbands and a number of steady guys. Why would I attempt that again? I\u2019d like to think it was their fault, but what if I\u2019m the one who\u2019s not so good at it? And why would Walt take a chance on a woman who\u2019s had five husbands and a number of steady guys? Especially when this friendship we have feels... Well, it feels perfect. I wouldn\u2019t want to screw it up. Besides, there\u2019s no panic\u2014my clock isn\u2019t ticking. Hell, I threw it against the wall years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you afraid of\u2014\u201d Vanni shut her mouth before she did it again.</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what, darling?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cAfraid of growing old alone?\u201d</p><p>Muriel laughed lightly. \u201cOh, you\u2019re so young. No, I\u2019m not afraid of growing old alone. I\u2019m afraid of growing old trapped.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a few long seconds. Then Shelby said, \u201cWow. I never even thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you? Either of you? You\u2019re young, in love, have long, steady lives ahead. And I certainly don\u2019t feel that ending up with a man like Walt would trap me in any way, it\u2019s not that.\u201d She looked steadily at Vanni, then Shelby, then ahead at the gloriously rising mountains covered with towering trees. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could live with myself if I trapped him. What if there was another role that intrigued me, that I wanted to try? I thought I was ready for retirement, to leave the movie business behind, but then a great role for a fifty-six-year-old woman came to me and I found it irresistible. And here I am, not wanting to pass it up, yet not wanting to leave Walt and this wonderful life behind.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve faced a dilemma like this. Really, I had sworn off men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just guessing here,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cBut somehow I don\u2019t think Daddy would feel trapped by you or your career.\u201d</p> <p>Muriel was quiet for a long time. Then she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. He keeps asking me when the filming will be done, but he won\u2019t even commit to a long weekend visit in Montana.\u201d Then after another few minutes of silence, Muriel said, \u201cI probably should have given up acting to breed horses years ago.\u201d</p><p>There was a time, before Jack had two children, Preacher had his two, Mike and Paul one each, before the living quarters at the bar were enlarged for Preacher\u2019s family and before everyone had their own homes on the outskirts of town, that it was standard for the same gang to meet for dinner several times a week. Now they had to make an effort to all be there on the same night.</p><p>It\u2019s not as though this bothered Jack much\u2014he saw everyone every day. Sometimes a day or two went by without his seeing one or two of the women, but the guys would always stop by for lunch or a beer or something. He was missing the old squad, though. Time for a Semper Fire union. He wanted the brotherhood around to bolster him. All this came to mind because he was leaving in the morning for San Diego; he was going to pick up Rick and bring him home.</p><p>Rick didn\u2019t want the escort. He told Jack to stay home and if it wasn\u2019t too much trouble, catch him at the bus when he got in. Like Jack was some neighbor guy he didn\u2019t want to impose on or something. The kid was coming home after being blown up in Iraq, and Jack, who loved him as much or more than anyone, shouldn\u2019t go to any trouble? That wasn\u2019t how it worked. Not in his experience.</p><p>Mike walked in the back door and right behind the bar. He liked to get his own beer. He also liked to stand back there with Jack. Then, not a minute later, the sound of Paul kicking the mud off his boots on the porch could be heard, and he walked in. He sat up at the bar and tapped it twice, his signal that he was ready for a beer.</p><p>Another minute passed. Then Paul said, \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Jack should have known they were there to give him a little moral support. The whole ordeal with Rick had been a load for everyone, but clearly hardest on Jack. \u201cYup,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave at about 5:00 a.m. if I sleep in, then drive down, spend the night, scoop him up and bring him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe good to have him home,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not like he was,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a peg leg and a giant bug up his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us were like we were. For a while,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe\u2019s a kid. He\u2019ll get through it. Or we\u2019ll get him through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel\u2019s working on finding someone for him to talk to. A professional,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI have PT all worked out, but he needs other stuff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz know he\u2019s on the way home?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Because I told her. Rick couldn\u2019t be bothered to pick up the phone when she called him, or call her back. Almost two months and he didn\u2019t take even one of her calls.\u201d He grimaced and shook his head. \u201cReally, I want to choke him, but I know what\u2019s going on. And I know he can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s screwed up,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t know how tough it\u2019s going to be when he\u2019s ready to start unscrewing himself, if he keeps burning all his bridges,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAsk me how much I look forward to ten hours in the truck with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo easy on him, Jack. You said it yourself\u2014it\u2019s not like he wants to be messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. It\u2019s just tough. I\u2019ve always been amazed at how strong he is. Right now\u2014his glass is not half-full. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone\u2019s entitled to be imperfect sometimes,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s just that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I can take about anything but self-pity. Anything. But feeling sorry for yourself is the most candy-assed thing you can cave into.\u201d</p><p>Mike chuckled. \u201cBecause you never indulged? Oh my brother, I did some self-pity that would\u2019ve put your head on fire. Man, I was in a hole so deep...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you got out,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou climbed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when you were ready, Jack. When I was,\u201d Mike said. \u201cGo easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go,\u201d Mike suggested. \u201cJack, you never really got shot up. Or blown up. Maybe I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll go easy.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Jack pocketed the cell phone he only took when he would be out of the mountains and had reception. He threw his duffel in the back of the truck and Mel said, \u201cJack, try to be patient. Your expectations of him have always been high. You miss him, you want him to bounce back, be his old self because you care about him, because you miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd because I don\u2019t want him to feel any pain. Everyone is so ready to help him with any pain or fear or worry he has, and he\u2019s got this wall. It\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him talk. Try not to tell him how he should feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that you want him to talk because you miss him. If he doesn\u2019t want to talk yet, let him be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know why he couldn\u2019t at least call Liz and tell her what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, that\u2019s between them. When he gets home he\u2019s going to have to work it out because she\u2019ll be around and he can\u2019t send her to voice mail when she\u2019s standing right in front of him. Jesus, this is your weakness. You, who didn\u2019t fall in love till you were forty, think you can fix up everyone\u2019s relationships.\u201d She shook her head. She got up on her toes and kissed him. \u201cWell, your heart\u2019s in the right place, that\u2019s for sure. Make sure your mouth is in the right place, too. Closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, drive carefully. I need you back.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>When Cameron got to the clinic in the morning, he had a patient waiting. Mel had arrived early, opened up the office, and checked in a young mother and her eighteen-month-old son who suffered with an obvious ear infection. He had a fever, was batting his ears and crying. Mel could have handled it, but knowing Cameron was due, she waited for the pediatrician.</p><p>In no time, he had sent them on their way with Tylenol, antibiotic and decongestant. Then he found Mel in the kitchen. \u201cI usually beat you here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAw, Jack left this morning for San Diego. He\u2019s gone to pick up Rick. And he\u2019s not handling the situation all that well. He didn\u2019t sleep much, was up by four, anxious to get on the road, troubled about the whole ordeal. There was such a ruckus around the house, the kids woke up too early and they\u2019re all cranky, so I left them having morning naps at their aunt Brie\u2019s. We\u2019re all out of sorts.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cJack\u2019s so worried about Rick. And sometimes when Jack gets worried, he acts out.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe has so much love in his heart. He just wants his people\u2014the people he loves\u2014to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cYou have no idea how nice that sounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what it would mean to me if the right woman said that about me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted her coffee mug to her lips, taking a sip. \u201cWell, maybe she has, Cam. If she hasn\u2019t, she just doesn\u2019t know you well enough. You and Abby doing okay?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI haven\u2019t been banished to the loft yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Cameron,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI probably should be. I also haven\u2019t talked to her about it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid when I tell her the truth about how I feel about her, she\u2019s going to run for her life, that\u2019s why not.\u201d The wall phone in the kitchen rang. \u201cI got it,\u201d Cameron said. He lifted the old-fashioned receiver. \u201cClinic,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d Abby said in a whisper. \u201cThere are deer in the yard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy are you whispering? Can they hear you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare them off. Oh, I wish you were here. There\u2019s a baby. And a couple of deer look ready to pop. Not as ready as I look, but wild animals probably don\u2019t get this big.\u201d</p><p>He laughed into the phone. \u201cI told you, you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d been home another half hour, you\u2019d have seen them. Cameron, there are six of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny bucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the mamas. And one baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fawn,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s barely born. He\u2019s wobbling on his legs. Oh, I wish you could see him.\u201d</p><p>He turned the phone away from his mouth. \u201cMel? Can you spare me for a little while? Abby has deer in the yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, there aren\u2019t any appointments. I can call you if someone wanders in and needs you,\u201d she said, smiling, cradling her coffee cup in two hands. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he told Abby. \u201cI\u2019ll park down the road and walk up. I might scare them off anyway if they smell a human. But I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d</p><p>He drove a little faster than necessary out to the cabin because he couldn\u2019t wait to see the look on her face, all lit up and excited about the deer. He parked before he got to the clearing and crept up the long driveway as quietly as he could. By the time he got to the clearing, the deer had moved to the tree line. He gave them a wide berth by going around the far side of the cabin to the door. He had to tiptoe across the porch. One doe lifted her head; they could no doubt smell his human scent, but they didn\u2019t bolt. That surprised him. There were too many hunters up this way for them to feel safe.</p><p>Abby held the door open for him. Her face was bright; she was all stirred up. So happy. \u201cYou saw them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re half hidden in the trees, but I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel said this was an enchanted cabin. I guess she\u2019s right.\u201d She went to the kitchen window, leaning across the sink the best she could to look out. She could feel him move up behind her and put his arms around her. His hands instinctively rested on her belly. The kids were still now. Of course. Their parents were awake.</p> <p>He leaned forward and inhaled the scent of her hair, breathing deeply. She let her eyes drift closed.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d he said. She started to turn around and he said, \u201cNo, just stay like this.\u201d He gently massaged her belly. \u201cThere\u2019s something I should have told you from the beginning, Abby. I didn\u2019t mean to mislead you, but I was afraid if I was completely honest, you\u2019d never agree to move into the same house with me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes tight. He\u2019d been lying beside her in bed at night; she\u2019d felt him draw her closer, fondle her in his sleep. She knew he didn\u2019t realize what he was doing, but she was more than aware. That had never been part of their plan. He was going to tell her now that\u2019s not how it was supposed to be between them. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cAt night, when I\u2019m beside you, holding you...\u201d</p><p>Oh, here it comes, she thought. Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019ll be worse if you cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a little carried away in my sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t intend to do that, but you have to know the truth. It\u2019s not just when I\u2019m asleep that I have that urge. That reaction.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThe truth is, I have that impulse all the time. I respond to you.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cBoy, do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope this doesn\u2019t make you angry or really offend you. But you should know\u2014I get turned on by you all the time. All I have to do is see your eyes, smell your skin, touch you, even innocently. And I just about go out of my mind. My feelings haven\u2019t changed one bit since that first night I met you. The second I touched you, it was like an explosion under my skin. I told you I wanted us to be friends, but the truth is, I\u2019ve always wanted so much more than that. Abby, the truth is, I had ulterior motives. I thought if I got you under the same roof with me, I could get you to fall in love with me.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. Finally she said, \u201cYou\u2019re just overwhelmed by the thought of parenthood. You said, even before we kissed, you wanted a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I have for years. But I\u2019ve met a lot of women who could have been mothers to my children, who would have volunteered for the job. And I\u2019ve just never felt like this. When morning came in that Grants Pass hotel, I didn\u2019t want to let you go. Ever. You just plain turn me on. Every bit of you\u2014your laugh, your scent, your eyes, your hands, your soft hair...your mouth. When I look at your mouth, I almost lose my mind with lust.\u201d</p><p>A small huff of laughter escaped her. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit, yeah. I guess I thought that big belly with my babies inside would cool me down, but it didn\u2019t. But you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019ll live with my feelings and not expect you to reciprocate them. And I will help you and keep you safe, just as I promised. I give you my word, Abby, I\u2019ll never lose control.\u201d He took his hands off her belly and grasped her upper arms, squeezing them. \u201cI should probably go back to sleeping in the loft. I don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable. Or worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m damn grateful that you\u2019re willing to try to cohabit so we can get to know each other better, so we can be on the best of terms to be the best of parents. That means a lot. You probably didn\u2019t realize it, but my hand has wandered while we slept and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realized it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself. \u201cCan I turn around now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to slug me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDo you think I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Probably. I molested you in your sleep. Well, in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>She slowly turned around and took in his vulnerable expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep in the loft.\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment to absorb that. He swallowed, cleared his throat, gave his head a little shake. Then he focused on her eyes. \u201cListen, I know your emotions are all over the place\u2014bad divorce, ugly legal problems, major pregnancy... Abby, I love you. I\u2019m not just a guy under the same blanket with a girl. If it wasn\u2019t you, this wouldn\u2019t be happening. God, I hope that doesn\u2019t scare you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d she asked him. \u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask myself if it was possible. I couldn\u2019t seem to help it. When you didn\u2019t get in touch after we met in Grants Pass, when I couldn\u2019t find you, I was miserable. I told you back then, I liked our chances. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone in my life I felt so much for, so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say it was that way for me, Cameron,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I guess I hoped that over time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I liked you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were very sweet to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t take any effort at all,\u201d he said, giving her hair a soft stroke. \u201cYou were like heaven. I couldn\u2019t believe I was that lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about you afterward. All the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d he asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cBut I was scared to death to find myself hooked up to another guy I thought was everything I wanted, only to find out I was just delusional. To let myself believe in you, count on you and have you run out on me?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t up to that. I thought it would be a lot safer if I never saw you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Abby. It doesn\u2019t matter what place I have in your life\u2014I\u2019ll never run out on you. I\u2019ll support you and the kids, I\u2019ll be a good father, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were even kind and supportive after I called you a sperm donor....\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou were in high temper that night. Remind me not to get into fights with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, when you asked me to move in with you, I thought it was all about the babies. That it had nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh, it had everything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe past couple of weeks...\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve been happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? If I could just elevate myself above sperm donor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? They don\u2019t get any better. Talk about packing a punch,\u201d she laughed. \u201cThat night, I remember thinking, if I had a little more time, if my life weren\u2019t so screwed up, I could fall in love with this guy.\u201d</p><p>His breathing got a little heavier. \u201cI have nothing but time,\u201d he said, and his voice had grown raspy.</p><p>\u201cThen we don\u2019t really have a problem here, do we?\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cWe could\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was cut off by his hands on her face, his lips on her lips, kissing her with a passion she hadn\u2019t even dared hope for in so long. He groaned and moved over her lips with heat, urging her mouth open and kissing deeper, hotter. Long and wet and hungry. It was quite a while before he could even break from her lips a tiny bit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I remember,\u201d she whispered, breathless.</p><p>And that fast he was on her lips again, devouring her, feeding her deep kisses and tasting the inside of her mouth. Her arms went around his neck, his went around to the small of her back and they were locked in a passionate kiss that didn\u2019t end until he felt a strong kick against his belly. She laughed against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that\u2019s going to be an issue from now on,\u201d he said. \u201cMore so after they\u2019re born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo question in my mind. I have to start on the parenting books right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d he said, running his fingers through her dark blond hair. \u201cI\u2019m a pediatrician. I can help with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, I love you, too. I want this to work for us. I can\u2019t imagine being away from you ever again. You\u2019ve made me so happy.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cGod, why couldn\u2019t you have told me that when you were less than thirty weeks....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s too risky now,\u201d she said in disappointment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cameron. Although really, it baffles me that you can even think of sex when you look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about touching every single curve of your body. I think about kissing and tasting every part of you. I think about things I\u2019m not allowed to do until after you deliver and mend. I can\u2019t stop thinking about all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re allowed to hold me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allowed to never let you go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Their one night together had been filled with fire, explosive in its power. This lazy morning was not\u2014it was sweet and gentle, as though Abby were fragile and precious. They started out embracing in the kitchen, then moved to the bedroom to lie down on the bed, clinging to each other, kissing. Then, inevitably, clothing was pushed out of the way then removed. Cameron was determined to keep his pants on, a safe barrier, but that idea crashed when her hands on his zipper slowly glided it down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cameron undressed her slowly, shed his own clothes quickly, then stretched out beside her, bringing her gently into his arms. Holding her, kissing her, caressing her, he made a study of her body with slow hands and soft lips. Just skin on skin, lips on lips, nothing but a breath separating them, brought such relief and contentment to both of them. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go back to sleeping in the loft,\u201d he whispered against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI would hate that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what it feels like, to finally have your hands on me again. It\u2019s so wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do it. And we can\u2019t even do this too much longer. We\u2019ll just get carried away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm. Carry me away, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t fool around with orgasms. They could get you contracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I fool around with one?\u201d she asked in a breathy whisper.</p><p>He chuckled low in his throat. \u201cOne long, slow, gentle one?\u201d he asked. He slipped his fingers into her wet folds, stroking her, bringing a delicious moan from her. \u201cJust lie back and relax, baby. Nothing wild. We\u2019re going to have to save the wild part for later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, Cameron...\u201d And then her hand was on him, tight and hot, stroking him aggressively, pulling on him.</p> <p>\u201cUh, Abby, maybe you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I should,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I can\u2019t take that. It\u2019s been too long, I\u2019ve wanted you too much.... I\u2019m going to explode all over you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed, lips parted slightly, she whispered, \u201cDoes it seem as though I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen? To both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he groaned. He pampered her clitoris, slipping one finger just barely inside her, just enough so he could feel the spasms when she reached climax. It was only seconds before he felt exactly that. \u201cOh, honey,\u201d he said, capturing her mouth in a deep, long kiss that hung on while she enjoyed every last bit of it. Imagining himself inside her, he came and came and came until a loud groan escaped him and his eyes rolled back in his head.</p><p>And then they lay there, their hands still intimately touching each other. He tried to imagine whether that could have felt better if he\u2019d been buried deep inside her, but this intimacy with her brought such emotional and physical satisfaction, he couldn\u2019t imagine anything better. He gently kissed her cheek, her neck. \u201cPregnant sex,\u201d he laughed. \u201cIf this wasn\u2019t a multiple pregnancy, we\u2019d be doing it like bunnies right now. I\u2019m not sure exactly how, but we\u2019d find a way.\u201d</p> <p>She giggled then sighed and snuggled close.</p><p>After a while, he stirred. \u201cStay put,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to stay down, resting. I\u2019ll get a washcloth and towel.\u201d He was back a moment later wearing his boxers. With a warm, wet cloth and soft towel, he cleaned her up. Then he crawled in beside her, taking her again in his arms, pulling just the sheet over them. She drowsed in his embrace and he listened to her soft, steady breathing. Abby might have drifted off, but he didn\u2019t. He watched her, felt her belly against his, alert for any start up of Braxton Hicks contractions. In an hour, nothing was amiss. They hadn\u2019t disturbed the uterus.</p><p>It was tempting to spend the day in bed with her, pleasing her as often as she\u2019d like, but he knew that wasn\u2019t a good idea. For another week or so, they might enjoy a little discretionary satisfaction if she felt inclined, but then to be safe, they should wait. This didn\u2019t matter to him\u2014his happiness was complete. She loved him, wanted him. And he would do anything for her.</p><p>By the age of thirty-six, Cameron had had plenty of sex, and by far much more interesting than what had just occurred with Abby. Definitely more energetic and creative sex than that. But he couldn\u2019t remember ever feeling more whole, more fulfilled.</p><p>He hated to disturb her, but he had to get back to town eventually. He\u2019d been gone all morning. \u201cAbby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSweetheart.\u201d She moaned softly and stretched. Her eyes opened and she smiled. \u201cFeel better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMuch. You?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI want you to know something\u2014I want to marry you. Whenever you\u2019re ready. But that\u2019s not the most important thing. I\u2019m committed, totally. No matter what you decide you want to do, I\u2019m in this with you all the way. I\u2019ll never leave you. I love you, and I don\u2019t just toss out the L word. You can count on me, Abby.\u201d</p><p>She ran a hand along his cheek. \u201cThank you, Cam,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love you. You can count on me, too.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cThank God those deer came into the yard. This could be the best day of my life.\u201d</p><p>When he got to the clinic at around lunchtime, Mel was in the kitchen. He knew he had a special smile on his face and that there was far less tension in his posture. He couldn\u2019t hide the feeling that his entire life had suddenly fallen into place. He tried to appear nonchalant, but he suspected he had the faraway look of a man in love. He didn\u2019t say anything, but she looked him over and grinned. \u201cMust have been quite a herd,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBig herd,\u201d he said. \u201cAbby was very excited to see them.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. Then she stood and gave his shoulder a pat. \u201cCam, there are times Jack rounds up a poker game with some of the guys....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and as she passed him she said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever play.\u201d</p><p>When Jack was finally able to pick Rick up at his barracks, more than twenty-four hours after he\u2019d started his trip, he was a little disappointed by what he found. Rick was waiting outside, alone, with his packed duffel and a walker beside him. Jack didn\u2019t think he\u2019d still be relying on the walker. And he had hoped there\u2019d be some guys around, seeing him off. \u201cYou\u2019re still using this, huh?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter than falling on my ass,\u201d Rick said. \u201cYou have no idea how hard it is to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab that duffel, would you, Jack?\u201d</p><p>Jack hesitated before picking it up. \u201cGood thing I didn\u2019t leave you to catch the bus, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time to be the smartest one, okay?\u201d Rick said, making his way to the truck. And of course, Jack\u2019s truck was jacked up. Rick opened the door and just looked up at the climb.</p><p>Jack threw the duffel in the back and stood beside him. \u201cWell, let\u2019s figure this out right off. You can put weight on the prosthesis, right? Left hand up here, right hand on the door, left foot on the runner, and pull. I\u2019ll get the walker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a hand, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll spot you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou have any trouble, I\u2019ll catch you. Give it a go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you try?\u201d Jack replied, very proud of himself for not saying fucking try. Mel would be proud, too.</p><p>Rick made a face and a noise of displeasure, placed his hands and foot, gave a tug and hoisted himself up into the cab. He did it, first time. But while it made Jack so happy, it obviously gave Rick no pleasure at all. \u201cWell, there you go.\u201d Jack grabbed the walker and put it in the truck bed. Really, he wanted to throw it as far as it would go. He wanted his boy back; he wanted the dependence on the excuse of this disability to stop, probably long before it was reasonable.</p><p>Jack was too impatient. He knew that. He wished he could be another way. But he felt so desperate to have his Rick back, no matter how many pieces he was in. Even if it took a while, that was okay, as long as Rick wanted to get back as much as he should. It was this attitude of defeat that was killing Jack.</p><p>He should have gone down to San Diego a few times while Rick was in rehab, if only to run through fast food and feed him. He\u2019d gotten thin. All that upper body strength he\u2019d had before Iraq had wilted. Rick was going to need the muscle to compensate for the missing leg. A little time on Preacher\u2019s food would help, but he had to work those muscles, and that took motivation.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some breakfast,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI had breakfast,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cHow about more breakfast? Looks like you could use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some for yourself if you want. I\u2019m not hungry. I\u2019ll wait in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Jack just kept driving. It was going to be a long trip home.</p><p>Every couple of hours Jack stopped, someplace there was food if he could help it, and forced Rick out of the truck to move around. \u201cCome on, the PT guy in Eureka said you need to move around to avoid something\u2014I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was....\u201d</p><p>\u201cContractures,\u201d Rick supplied. \u201cI\u2019m fine. But this leg has got to come off for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after this stop. Let\u2019s do it, Rick. Look around\u2014you have your choice. Big Mac, Subway, fish \u2019n\u2019 chips, whatever you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Jack muttered. He hauled the walker out of the back and put it down beside Rick. \u201cWalk around the truck at least twice. Then we\u2019ll get the leg off.\u201d Then he took off across the street and walked into a sandwich shop, coming back out with two big submarine sandwiches. He almost smiled to note the walker was back in the truck bed and Rick back in the cab. Not so disabled when he wanted to be done with his exercise. And Jack wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d accomplished it, but the prosthesis was in the backseat of the extended cab.</p><p>Jack tossed one of the sandwiches in Rick\u2019s lap, put two giant colas in the cup holders and started up the truck.</p><p>Rick just stared at the food in his lap.</p><p>\u201cEat what you can. It\u2019s been hours since you\u2019ve eaten and I\u2019ve eaten three times. When we get back, I\u2019m going to get some of Preacher\u2019s weights out of the storage shed for you. You should probably bulk up those arms, shoulders, chest. Give you back your advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>Jack was stupefied. He shook his head. \u201cFor getting through life?\u201d he said by way of a question.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d Rick said again.</p><p>And Jack thought, you can\u2019t slug him. You have to keep your mouth shut and be patient, that\u2019s what Mike said, what Mel said. So Jack talked to himself. Okay, I\u2019m not the best person to deal with this. I never had it this bad, and sure not when I was this young. Mike, he\u2019s been through a terrifying, life-threatening injury. Mike might be able to step in. Mel had done as she promised and lined up a counselor through the VA. He couldn\u2019t make Rick help himself, but he could throw him in the truck, drive him there and sit outside till the hour was up.</p><p>Eventually Jack said, in his sensitive and mellow voice, \u201cEat the goddamn fucking sandwich. And I mean it.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, Rick peeled off the wrapping paper and took a bite, then another bite.</p><p>But Jack had lost his appetite. He was glad Rick was eating something, but this didn\u2019t feel victorious at all. The drive had to come from inside Rick, not from the bully in the seat next to him.</p><p>Jack forced down about half his sandwich, wrapped up what was left and managed to keep heading north. After Rick had eaten what was presumably his fill, he leaned back in the seat and dozed, his own wrapped half sandwich on his lap. Jack lifted it carefully; he put it in the sack for later. Rick\u2019s nap gave him a little time to think.</p><p>He remembered what Mel had said, that Jack needed his boy back so bad, he was pushing on him. He remembered when Mike Valenzuela picked Virgin River as a place to recover when he\u2019d been critically wounded on the job at LAPD\u2014because his family and friends needed him well again so badly they were suffocating him. And he remembered that he\u2019d never loved a kid as powerfully as he loved this one, except maybe David and Emma, and his love was strong. Sometimes it caused him to act in desperate ways. He could end up doing more harm than good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a good couple of hours before Rick woke with a painful cramp in his thigh, his stump. He groaned in pain and started rubbing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come up on a rest stop real soon here. Hang in there,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Rick just kept rubbing, gritting his teeth. He pushed back in the seat, lifted his butt and fished a pill bottle out of his pocket. He swallowed a pill with a gulp of old, watered-down cola.</p> <p>\u201cWhatcha got there, pal?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNot the good stuff,\u201d he answered. \u201cJust some anti-inflammatory laced with a little codeine. It gets me by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for a pit stop?\u201d Jack asked, driving into a good-looking rest stop.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rick said, a little breathless from discomfort.</p><p>\u201cWant the leg?\u201d Jack asked, pulling up to a handicapped spot right in front of the men\u2019s room.</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d Rick said, drawing up the leg of his jeans and tucking it in the waistband. \u201cJust the walker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit tight.\u201d Jack got out, grabbed the walker, and instead of insisting Rick do some wild gymnastics getting himself out of the truck without the help of a prosthetic limb, he just slipped a strong arm around his waist and pulled him out, lowering him gently to the ground. Then he followed Rick as he made his way slowly into the bathroom.</p><p>Rick turned around once. Over his shoulder he said, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Head down, hands braced on the walker, he moved slowly into the john, took his place up against a urinal, braced himself, balancing precariously on one leg, hand against the wall, and got the job done. He was wobbly, especially getting his zipper back up. He moved slowly to the sink and washed his hands. Seeing the potential for disaster if Rick put his wet hands on the metal walker, Jack handed him some paper towels while he was still braced up against the sink. When Rick moved away from the sink, his jeans were wet in front from the dripping sink. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLearning curve is kinda high,\u201d Jack remarked. \u201cYet another reason to work on the leg, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Rick moved slowly out of the bathroom. Without looking at Jack he muttered, \u201cOne of the guys said it was easier to figure out how to have sex than how to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it\u2019ll come up.\u201d</p><p>When they got to the truck, Jack braced him under the arms and said, \u201cSwing on up there, buddy.\u201d When they were again under way, Jack just gave it some time. They were another half hour on the road after a long day, and now well into Mendocino County, when he asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the pain now, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Pill kicked in, mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be home in less than a couple of hours,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about back there, about the sandwich. The way I acted. We aren\u2019t going to get too far if I try the bully approach. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou understand, I just want to find the best way to help you get on your feet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFoot,\u201d Rick said, not looking at him. \u201cYou want me to get on my foot.\u201d</p><p>Jack ground his teeth and told himself, Let it go. Rick won\u2019t be angry forever. Will he? \u201cListen, there are a couple of things we should talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRehab, for one. You\u2019re set up at a clinic in Eureka. It\u2019s supposed to be a good little shop and I\u2019ll take you. Vets from around this county use it a lot. And there\u2019s some counseling...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a break, huh? You hear yourself? You wanna feel like this the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, we did that whole group-hug thing at Balboa. It was a waste of time. I felt worse, not better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be one-on-one and you don\u2019t have to hug anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one have two legs?\u201d Rick asked sarcastically. \u201cBecause I just love it when some joker with all his parts tries to help me cope with what\u2019s left of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have two fucking heads for all I know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cSorry. That was frustration. I\u2019m just frustrated.\u201d</p><p>Rick laughed humorlessly. \u201cIs that a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving on. I\u2019d like you to stay with me and Mel. Once you get up the porch, the house is flat. The shower is a flat walk-in. You don\u2019t have to negotiate a tub. I can get you around till you\u2019re driving again, which will be as soon as you\u2019re ready. You can spend as much time with your grandma as you like and I\u2019ll even drive her out to our place, but her house is a challenge and she shouldn\u2019t be taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cShe won\u2019t have to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, try to be reasonable. Mel and I can help, but Lydie has enough challenge taking care of herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be taking care of me. We\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you totally opposed to making this as simple as possible? Are you going to let me help at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let you drive me home, didn\u2019t I? And aren\u2019t you glad for the good company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was a slice of heaven....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext item? Or is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cNothing to talk about there.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Jack\u2019s turn to laugh without humor. \u201cBuddy, on this we\u2019re gonna talk. I know you didn\u2019t take her calls, didn\u2019t return them. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with that, but we\u2019re going to be back in town and she works for her aunt Connie every week. You can\u2019t avoid her. She\u2019s scared to death of how you\u2019re going to act toward her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to be scared,\u201d Rick said quietly.</p><p>Jack sighed. At least that last lacked the edge of hostility. \u201cI\u2019m sure she can\u2019t help it. You\u2019ve been ignoring her. I gotta say, I don\u2019t get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll talk to her. I\u2019ll be nice as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, what the hell\u2019s going on with that?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cJack, it\u2019s going to be all right. Lizzie\u2019s young. Young and beautiful. She\u2019s sweet. And strong. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about what you just said sounds real bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019ll be okay. Might take a little getting used to, that\u2019s all. She doesn\u2019t need a guy like me weighing her down.\u201d</p><p>Jack had to concentrate to keep from driving off the road. \u201cWhat the hell? Is this about the leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the leg, but face it, that\u2019s not a great asset. It\u2019s about everything. Ever since Liz ran into me, her life has been messed up. I\u2019m not good for her. She can do a lot better and deserves to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to agree with that. She\u2019s going to fight that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not too hard, because that\u2019s how it is. Jesus, don\u2019t you think the girl\u2019s been through enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Jack said, but what he really meant was he didn\u2019t know what to say that wouldn\u2019t include a lot of frustrated swearing. He just wanted to shake Rick until all the marbles in his head fell back into place.</p><p>\u201cWhat a break,\u201d Rick said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be nice while you\u2019re dumping her? After all she\u2019s gone through for you? Don\u2019t you think if she felt she\u2019d been through enough, she\u2019d cut you loose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext item?\u201d Rick said. \u201cOr have we covered everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m going to try to be reasonable here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were moving on?\u201d Rick answered.</p><p>Oh, he\u2019s going to make me choke him! Jack thought. He shook his head a little violently, trying to let Mel\u2019s voice rise to the surface, because his instinct was to stop the car and say something like, Listen, asshole, that little girl stuck by you while you were sticking by her and if you don\u2019t love her anymore, okay, stuff happens. But you don\u2019t just decide you\u2019re not good enough and shit can her like that. And you have enough fucking parts!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d Jack chose to say. \u201cPhysically, emotionally, psychologically. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t make any fast moves. If you get through some of this stuff, get your problems sorted out and get good on the leg, get the high-tech leg, and then if you still feel this way... All I\u2019m saying is, do you have to be so sure about major changes like that before you\u2019re fully recovered? You and Liz have been together a long time. You\u2019re just planning to push her away right off because you\u2019re still all messed up in your head. Which, by the way, is in the goddamn pamphlet.\u201d</p><p>He could see Rick\u2019s jaw tighten. \u201cNext item?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAw, Christ,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m trying hard as I can! I want to do what\u2019s right! In my messed-up head, it isn\u2019t right to hold on to Liz or let Liz hold on to me when she can do so much better! That\u2019s it! I\u2019ve had months to think about it! Now\u2014next fucking item!\u201d</p><p>Jack took a defeated breath. \u201cOkay. Preacher made barbecue.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. His worst nightmare. A town gathering, welcoming him home. He\u2019d crumble. Cry like a girl. He wasn\u2019t up to it. \u201cTell him thanks. Tell him I\u2019m in pain. We\u2019ll catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in pain,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI am now. It\u2019s not happening, Jack. I can\u2019t. Do. It.\u201d</p><p>An hour from home, Jack thought. Maybe he\u2019d change his mind. But if he\u2019d learned anything in the last ten hours, Rick had enough determination to get him through almost anything. Except complete recovery. \u201cOkay, pal. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>When Rick got to his grandmother\u2019s house, Lydie was overwhelmed by his homecoming. Rick could feel Jack standing behind him, just inside the front door, holding his duffel and the prosthesis, watching as Rick embraced his weeping grandmother with one arm while he balanced the walker between them. She was so small in his big arm and he had no instinct to shut her out. She was old, frail, and had suffered too many losses in her life. For a few moments, while he held her against his chest, Rick was grateful that he could come home to her in any condition. \u201cHey hey,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, Gram. You\u2019re gonna drown me with those tears. No crying, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicky, I can\u2019t remember when I prayed so hard. Thank God you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home, Gram. Everything is all right,\u201d he said, thinking about how wrong it all was. But he wouldn\u2019t put his gram through that. He comforted her until she wiped her old eyes and just stood there in front of him, studying his face with her trembling fingers. And behind him, he could hear Jack breathe.</p><p>\u201cI bet there\u2019s doings at Jack\u2019s tonight,\u201d Lydie said.</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI\u2019m just not up to it, though. It was a long ride and my leg aches. I\u2019m going to skip it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked him, frowning.</p><p>Be welcomed home like a one-legged hero to this little town? Ha, not on your life, he thought. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you want to go see the neighbors, I\u2019m sure Jack will take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay home. Thing is, I didn\u2019t cook anything, Ricky. Thinking we\u2019d be at Jack\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll pull something together.\u201d He gave her crepey, soft cheek a stroke, wiping away a tear. \u201cWe have to get up our strength, huh? And you need your insulin and food.\u201d</p><p>Jack brushed past them, taking Rick\u2019s duffel to his old room, the one he grew up in, the one he had briefly shared with Liz when their baby was almost due. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you something from the bar. Can\u2019t have you trying to cook your first night home,\u201d he said as he passed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Jack\u2014\u201d Rick began.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, Rick,\u201d Jack said. He was back quickly; the house was small\u2014just five rooms and a bath. He met Rick\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019ll pass on your regrets and get a batch of barbecue, bring it down. You rest.\u201d</p><p>In a brief attack of humility for being such a giant asshole all day while Jack tried his best, Rick said, \u201cThanks, Jack. I appreciate that. A lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jack said, clearly still miffed at him, disappointed in him.</p><p>Rick got over the guilt right away. Jack, maybe most of all, would be better off if Rick just wasn\u2019t around to bring disaster after disaster into his life.</p><p>He got the prosthesis back on. He had a quiet meal with his grandma, she took her insulin and he popped a pain pill, and it was barely eight o\u2019clock when she was nodding off in the chair and he sent her to bed. Then he dimmed all the lights so if anyone passed the house they would think he was asleep.</p><p>Rick was aware that there were lots of people at Jack\u2019s bar, just down the street. In fact, he could hear engines and voices even though the front door was closed. It brought back memories of all the good times there, the times he\u2019d come home on leave, the visits from Jack\u2019s boys who all treated him like a little brother. He went back further in his mind to when he worked there, all through high school. It was like a second home\u2014hanging out with Preacher and Jack, bussing tables, loading stock, going to Eureka for supply runs.</p><p>That job was his life for a while. Jack always made sure Rick\u2019s school sports and homework came first, fit his work at the bar around those things, like a dad would do. And when Lizzie got pregnant, Jack and Preach did everything they could to give him work while freeing him up to take good care of his girl, the mother of his baby. Here he\u2019d gotten himself in this giant mess and they were totally there for him, holding him up, keeping him sane.</p> <p>It brought tears to his eyes, thinking about those days. Some of them, like when the baby was stillborn, were the worst days of his life. But remembering that day\u2014Jack and Preach, Mel delivering the baby when she herself was pregnant and due any minute, Lizzie somehow getting through it and still loving him.... How was it possible he could remember such a terrible day with such fondness?</p><p>His grandmother almost always left the front porch light on at night, but Rick turned it off. He just sat on the couch in the darkened living room and thought back to all those times, sorry but simultaneously relieved he wasn\u2019t down at the bar being welcomed home by the town.</p><p>In spite of himself, he felt bad about it. He knew Preacher would have put out his favorites and women from town would have brought their own special dishes to add to the party. He knew they meant well. He just didn\u2019t think he could stand the scrutiny.</p><p>At ten o\u2019clock, Rick knew the party was long since over; farmers and ranchers didn\u2019t stay out late. Livestock and crops got them up real early. When he heard a light tapping at the front door, he thought it would be Jack, mother-henning again, checking on him. Maybe the guy wanted to tuck him in.</p><p>He opened the door and found himself face-to-face with Liz.</p><p>Ten</p> <p>Rick\u2019s very first thought was, how can she be even more beautiful? Her eyes bluer and hair thicker, silkier, making his hands ache to run through the strands. She didn\u2019t look like a girl anymore; Liz could pass for twenty-one, easy. She was a knockout with a body that cost him sleep. His very next thought came right out of his mouth. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I got the message, Rick. You\u2019re not going to take my calls, not going to call me back, not going to get in touch even when you\u2019re right across the street from my aunt Connie\u2019s store, where I work every single weekend.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSo, I\u2019m here to see you. To talk to you. To find out exactly what your problem is.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little cruelly. \u201cWell... Let\u2019s see,\u201d he said, scratching his chin. \u201cWhat could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Rick. Eventually you\u2019re going to be honest with me. The leg doesn\u2019t have anything to do with us. I don\u2019t care about a goddamn leg and you know it.\u201d</p><p>He just stared into her eyes. This was a whole new Liz from the one he\u2019d left. Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true\u2014she\u2019d been on her way to becoming this Liz for a couple of years at least. He\u2019d put her through an awful lot and instead of crumbling into a mushy pile of little-girl tears, she\u2019d gotten tough. Confident. Her back was straight and her eyes glittered. \u201cLet\u2019s put this off a while, all right?\u201d he said. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ve put it off long enough.\u201d She touched her diamond pendant. \u201cI\u2019m the girl you promised to marry. You\u2019ve been mean and horrible and I understand you\u2019re going through terrible stuff, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to turn your back on me. I\u2019m not going to let you do that to me. I\u2019ve been through stuff, too. The way it was with us, we helped each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna be able to help me with this,\u201d he said, and he started to close the door on her.</p><p>But her hand was against the door, keeping it from closing. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a short ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandma\u2019s in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Leave a note. Write, \u2018Went for a ride with Liz.\u2019 She isn\u2019t going to ground you.\u201d</p><p>He actually chuckled. He remembered his Liz as a soft, sweet, vulnerable girl. The one he made cry at the hospital in Germany; the girl he had to be strong for. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have this conversation tonight,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can do it right here, right now, maybe wake up your gram, or we can sit in my car and do it in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Liz, I\u2019m real tired and I\u2019m in some pain here. And I don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d she said, walking into the house. She sat down on his grandmother\u2019s sofa. \u201cHere, then.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath and shook his head. He limped over to the kitchen counter, pulled a piece of paper off the notepad and scribbled a note to his grandmother. Then he limped toward the door, grabbing his coat off the rack.</p><p>\u201cYou want crutches or something?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo. This isn\u2019t going to take too long.\u201d And he limped out the front door. Once he looked down at the three porch steps, he stopped. He grabbed the railing and hoped he wouldn\u2019t end up facedown on the walk\u2014working that knee was still a crapshoot. Liz stayed behind him, giving him time. If she\u2019d grabbed his arm to help him, he would have brushed her away, but she was smart and just waited till he made it.</p><p>And then, to his surprise, she left him to open his own car door. When she was settled behind the wheel, he was surprised when she started the car and put it in gear. \u201cI thought we were just going to sit in your car,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d she said as she pulled away from the curb, \u201cbut we\u2019re going somewhere you can\u2019t chase me off or walk away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just pull down the block. I\u2019m not real fast, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed is that what\u2019s wrong has nothing to do with your leg,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have definite problems, all right.\u201d She glanced over at him. \u201cOkay, lay it on me, Ricky. Go ahead. Get it off your chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you better stop the car first. Really, let\u2019s not go too far from home, okay? I meant it\u2014I\u2019m tired and my leg hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going far,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile I\u2019m driving, do me a favor, Ricky. Try to remember me. I\u2019m the girl who\u2019s always on your side no matter what. Huh? I\u2019m the girl who would do anything for you. I\u2019m the one who stuck by you a hundred percent when you said the Marine Corps was what you needed to get your head straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said, waving a hand. \u201cI did. I still am, even though you act like I\u2019m dead or something.\u201d</p><p>He just stared straight ahead, not commenting, wondering how he was going to do this. One thing he had accepted\u2014no matter how he handled it, he was going to hurt her bad. But in the end, she\u2019d get over it and be better off. Problem was, she smelled so good and even though she was acting real tough, he knew that underneath all that strength was a softness so lush and deep, he could lose himself for a while, and it was getting to him. Maybe if she hadn\u2019t had the starring role in so many of his dreams, he could have forgotten.</p><p>He leaned his head back on the seat and closed his eyes. If he did this right, it would be over tonight. Then they could move on from what had been one disaster after another since the day they met.</p><p>Liz turned off the road and drove right down to the river. She parked, killed the lights and the car engine, and turned in her seat to face him. And waited.</p><p>\u201cLiz, I don\u2019t think we should be together anymore.\u201d He gazed into his lap rather than at her. He waited for her reaction and when there was none, he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause, Liz, us together is one bad break after another and I\u2019m pretty sure every one of them was my fault. It\u2019s not fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cso you\u2019re doing this for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want that. I know you don\u2019t. Don\u2019t you think that makes it even worse? That no matter how much I screw up your life, you\u2019ll hang in there with me? I want you to stay away from me, Liz. Get on with your life, find a guy who won\u2019t mess you up every time you turn around. All right? Let me off the hook here, Liz! Let me go so I don\u2019t have one more thing to feel guilty about! You hear me?\u201d</p><p>She just looked at him. There wasn\u2019t even a big moon and yet he could see her blue eyes sparkling like stars. She gave her head a gentle shake. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get past this,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurt and mad, but it\u2019s going to pass, Rick. And when it does, you won\u2019t want me to be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her small hand against his cheek and just gently shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He glazed over. His hand covered hers while he looked into her eyes, took in that small, soft, pink mouth, inhaled her scent, imagined... And then before he knew what was happening, he grabbed fistfuls of her thick, long hair and pulled her mouth onto his, eating her mouth, devouring her, moaning in the back of his throat while he invaded her with his tongue and allowed hers into his mouth. That taste\u2014it was the taste he remembered, dreamt of. And he couldn\u2019t stop. He snapped. His hands went from her hair to her back, to her breasts, down to her butt, around to the front, grabbing her in that vee that joined her legs. \u201cJesus, this can\u2019t happen,\u201d he whispered against her mouth even as he was pulling apart her jacket and lifting her sweater. \u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he said, unhooking her bra and filling his hand and then his mouth with her breast.</p><p>Liz shifted her weight, making it easier for him to touch her, kiss her. While he roughly suckled, she kissed his temple, his ear, ran her fingers through his hair, buried her lips in his neck, inhaling him, tasting him, murmuring to him that she needed him, loved him, wanted him. This wasn\u2019t the way it usually was between them\u2014he was desperate and fast now, not sweet and slow. She didn\u2019t care\u2014he was touching her again and what that meant to her was that he didn\u2019t really want them apart. Maybe he thought it would be smart or wise for them to break up, but it wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>His hands grabbed the snap on her jeans, ripped it open, ran down the zipper and then slid down down down. A deep growl rumbled in his throat and he was back on her mouth. \u201cOh God, that\u2019s good,\u201d he muttered. \u201cGood, so good....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Rick,\u201d she said in a breath.</p><p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d he said against her lips. \u201cTake them off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicky, in the car? Like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot the first time, Liz. Off,\u201d he commanded. \u201cYou have to. Come on!\u201d</p><p>And he was tugging at her jeans, his thumbs hooked into the waistband. She put her hands over his and stopped him. She looked into his wild eyes for a moment and then slowly helped him draw down her jeans. She kicked off her shoes, lifted her legs and slid them off. She still had her panties on, but as panties go, they weren\u2019t much\u2014just a tiny thong that barely covered her and wouldn\u2019t keep him out. And they didn\u2019t\u2014his hand was instantly inside her panties, then inside her. She sucked in a breath, trying not to dissolve against his touch, but it caused him to moan.</p><p>And then his hands were fumbling with his own pants, undoing the belt, unsnapping, struggling with the zipper while he was in a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said gently. \u201cLet me.\u201d She drew the zipper down easily and set him free.</p><p>He grabbed her hips and pulled her over him and then he stopped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh God, Liz...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered back, kissing him softly. \u201cOkay, I know...\u201d</p><p>And then he pulled aside that small, silk thong and lowered her down on him.</p><p>\u201cYour leg\u2014\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s okay. Like this, it\u2019s okay. Ahhh,\u201d he said. And then he started to pump his hips with rising ferocity. He grabbed the back of her head, pulled her mouth down to his, kissed her deep and hard and exploded inside her with a muted growl. He thought he\u2019d never stop, he was caught in such a long, desperate orgasm. And she just held him, let him ride it out, kissing him. And finally he began to relax beneath her, though he was panting as if he\u2019d run a mile.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNo condom. Great.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her hand along the hair at his temple. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the pill for a couple of years, Rick. Since the baby.... We\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I just lost my mind.\u201d He looked up into her eyes, saw her soft smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t even make you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seemed in kind of a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I rough on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, which was the same as yes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know which end is up right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He squeezed her bare behind in his hands. \u201cSee, this just can\u2019t happen....\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s happened plenty of times. Not exactly like that. If that had been our first time, I might not have loved it. But it wasn\u2019t our first time.\u201d</p> <p>His hand caressed her hair. \u201cLiz, I\u2019m no good for you, baby. You have to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. He\u2019d certainly screwed that up. Came with her to tell her she had to give up this idea of them and then ripped her clothes off. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you dressed. And home. I should get home myself, before I do any more crazy, stupid, painful things to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Liz,\u201d he said, fastening his pants, helping her into her jeans. Then he held her face in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you anymore. You have to hear this\u2014what I need right now is a time-out from us.... Can\u2019t you see, Liz? I can\u2019t be part of a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive yourself time to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want this anymore! It\u2019s not going to work!\u201d</p><p>For the first time since she showed up at his grandmother\u2019s door, he saw tears collect in her crystal-blue eyes, but they didn\u2019t spill over. \u201cWorked pretty good for you a few minutes ago, Ricky.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet a long moment. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, okay? I think I hurt my leg.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, she pulled up in front of his grandmother\u2019s house. She stared straight ahead and said, \u201cYou could let me be your friend. After all we\u2019ve been to each other.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her profile. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. I\u2019d just use you and hurt you. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone nuts. This isn\u2019t you at all\u2014and it\u2019s not just the leg. You\u2019d better get some help with it, Rick, before you throw away everything good in your life.\u201d When he didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, she said, \u201cGet out then. You know how to get in touch with me.\u201d</p><p>Rick wasn\u2019t all the way up the porch stairs before Liz drove off, and not slowly. Angrily. She sped out of town. It was Friday night. Hadn\u2019t she said she worked for her aunt every weekend in the store? Maybe he got that wrong.... Anyway, she was gone, and that was good. Two months of ignoring her didn\u2019t send her packing, but this last deal would.</p><p>He got himself in the house and saw that the note he\u2019d written his gram was still on the kitchen table. He dropped his jeans and unfastened the leg. He unlaced the running shoe and worked the prosthesis out of his jeans and leaned it against the sofa. He pulled up his jeans and sat down on the sofa. He grabbed the leg by the titanium pylon and threw it across the room. It clattered to the floor over by his gram\u2019s old piano. Then he put his head in his hands and felt the sting of tears in his eyes.</p><p>What the hell had he done? He had planned to tell her, calmly and sanely, they couldn\u2019t be a couple anymore. She should get on with her life, forget about him, find herself a guy who could take her the places in life she deserved to go. He even had a little speech about how she should go on with school, get herself real smart and snag an intelligent man who was going to earn a decent living and not bring mayhem into her life at every turn. And what had he done? Practically raped the girl! The fact that she hadn\u2019t tried to stop him didn\u2019t undo the fact that he\u2019d been out-of-his-mind desperate, driven and rough. If she had told him to stop, could he have?</p><p>\u201cRicky?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head from his hands to see his gram standing under the living-room arch, clutching her old chenille robe together.</p><p>\u201cI heard a loud noise....\u201d</p><p>Thank God she couldn\u2019t see well enough to catch the tears in his eyes, on his cheeks, the leg across the room. \u201cSorry, Gram. I took off the leg and dropped it. It\u2019s really heavy. Sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re getting a cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, yeah,\u201d he said, sniffing. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need your walker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it. It\u2019s right at the end of the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Gram. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not fine, he thought. I\u2019m a fucked-up mess. What the hell have I done to myself? To everyone else? Was I born under some kind of curse?</p><p>All in one day, he\u2019d beat up two of the most important people in his life\u2014Jack and Liz. All day long he\u2019d been an asshole to Jack and now look what he\u2019d done to Liz\u2014had sudden forceful, rough sex with her, and then told her she had to go away and leave him alone. He felt lower than a worm. And yet he couldn\u2019t for his life think of a better way to handle the situation. It was better for them if they didn\u2019t care about him so much.</p><p>There were going to be more people to deal with. People he didn\u2019t want pulling for him, being kind to him, befriending him when it could only come back on them in a bad way. Everything Ricky touched, as far as he was concerned, blew up. Just like that goddamn grenade in Iraq. There was also Preach. Mel. The boys from Jack\u2019s squad. Connie and Ron. The whole frickin\u2019 town.</p><p>Then he realized with a shock\u2014he was ashamed of having been blown up. Now, that made absolutely no sense, but there it was. He should have come back from Iraq with some head troubles, but not this kind. He\u2019d listened to guys in that stupid support group talk about shame at having been wounded, shame at having to put their families through dealing with a disabled vet, and he thought it was beyond ridiculous.</p><p>But here he sat, on his grandmother\u2019s floral couch, knowing that everything in his head would be different if he had returned to Virgin River with two legs. And he didn\u2019t know what to do with that knowledge. There was no changing things.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sleep well, but when he got up, real early, the first thing he did was use his walker to get to his gram\u2019s front porch and look across the street at Connie\u2019s house, right next to the corner store. And there was Liz\u2019s car. It had a dewy coat over it\u2014it had been there a long time. Where had she gone after dropping him off? Obviously she hadn\u2019t gone home to her mother\u2019s in Eureka. His head began to pound. Had she gone out to the woods or river to cry?</p><p>Rick felt like a monster.</p><p>He hid out the whole day. He could have walked down to Jack\u2019s and been friendly, but after ditching the welcome-home party, he thought he\u2019d just play the wounded Marine for a while longer, let everyone think he wasn\u2019t up to public appearances. So Jack came to him.</p><p>\u201cJust checking to see how you\u2019re doing today,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd brought you and your grandma something of Preacher\u2019s for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, taking the bag. \u201cIs Preacher pissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher hardly ever gets pissed,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut just for future reference, you don\u2019t want to be around when he is. So\u2014today\u2019s better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m getting by. Trying to get a little rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I want you down at the bar at 9:00 a.m. Monday morning. We have PT in Eureka,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you. PT Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The counselor Tuesday and Thursday. Also morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that....\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou going to call a cab? Or maybe you have another ride in mind so you don\u2019t have to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Rick just looked down, frustrated with himself for wanting to hurt people so much. \u201cOkay, thanks,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not real hot on that counselor idea. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I heard that. Just so you know, Mel is hot on it\u2014and she found the counselor. Go ahead, tough guy\u2014call her and talk her out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t call her and just refuse to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you\u2014I happen to think it might help. I guess you could be a stubborn fool and refuse to talk.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIf you decide to go that way, just listen. Maybe you\u2019ll pick up something. By the way, what happened with you and Liz?\u201d</p><p>His eyes popped open. \u201cWhat makes you think something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she saw you last night, and she doesn\u2019t seem to be doing real well. I asked her. She said she can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Even if he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t tell Jack he\u2019d treated her the way he had. He just couldn\u2019t handle the look he\u2019d see in Jack\u2019s eyes. If he\u2019d learned anything, Jack\u2019s opinion of how men should treat women was firm\u2014they were to be handled with the greatest of respect and care. He could tell Jack he\u2019d practically raped her, then told her to go away and leave him alone, and although Jack wouldn\u2019t give up on him, he\u2019d be completely ashamed of him. Rick decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. He couldn\u2019t bear the added guilt. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it either,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack was silent for a moment. \u201cGood thing we have that appointment with the counselor. You can tell him.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t count on it, Rick thought.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, Jack dropped Rick at a modest home in Grace Valley and said he\u2019d wait out Rick\u2019s counseling session at the caf\u00e9 in town. Rick stood at the curb and stared at the house for a minute or so\u2014but Jack just drove off. Finally, he went to the door of a remodeled garage that had a sign by it. Jerry Powell, followed by a bunch of letters, including PhD When he knocked, a man shouted, \u201cCome on in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He found himself in a small waiting room that was, thankfully, empty. There was a door to another room and presently a tall, spindly man with a sharp nose and thin hair that flopped onto his forehead appeared there. He smiled. \u201cYou must be Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be the counselor.\u201d</p><p>Jerry laughed. \u201cCome on back.\u201d</p> <p>Rick slowly followed while Jerry waited at the door. He indicated a couple of chairs facing each other and then he closed the door. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting clients right now, but I close the door in case anyone wanders into the waiting room. This room is soundproofed for our privacy.\u201d</p><p>Rick sat. Between the chairs, a small table bore a box of tissues. That was for when he broke down and cried like a girl.</p><p>Before sitting, Jerry offered his hand. \u201cJerry Powell, Rick. It\u2019s nice to meet you. And even though you might be tired of hearing it, thank you for the service you perform on behalf of our country. Not only do I appreciate it, I\u2019m deeply touched and personally indebted to you.\u201d</p><p>Rick was surprised. He tilted his head. Actually, he hadn\u2019t heard that. Maybe if he\u2019d gone to his own welcome-home party at the bar, he might have. But instead of saying thank-you, he said, \u201cJust so you know, I don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>Jerry actually smiled. \u201cWhich puts you in the majority. I do some work for the county and from time to time a junior-high or high-school student, in trouble at school, comes my way as part of penance. A way of not getting expelled. If you think they want to be here...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to me wasn\u2019t high-school stuff.\u201d</p><p>Jerry sobered. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d He let that go a beat. \u201cWell, I should explain\u2014I\u2019ve never counseled a disabled veteran before. I\u2019ve had vets, I\u2019ve had amputees, I\u2019ve counseled lots of people with disabilities, but I\u2019ve never counseled a person trying to adjust to civilian life after a war injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe we\u2019ll learn from each other,\u201d he said easily, not in the least intimidated by Rick\u2019s hostile nature. \u201cI\u2019ll try to keep up. Anywhere in particular you\u2019d like to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t hear me\u2014I\u2019d rather not do this at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll start. I\u2019ve been in Grace Valley about ten years now. There\u2019s a rumor going around that I claim to have gone on a ride in a spaceship with aliens.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the absolute truth\u2014I really did. I swear. I don\u2019t even care that hardly anyone buys it\u2014it happened to me. Screwed me up pretty good for a while. I\u2019ll make a deal\u2014you tell me some of the stuff that\u2019s giving you trouble. I\u2019ll tell you about the spaceship.\u201d</p> <p>Rick\u2019s mouth hung open. He stared at him in total astonishment. When he did finally shut his mouth, he opened it again to say, \u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me!\u201d</p><p>Jerry smiled. \u201cGod\u2019s truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a nutcase? And you think you\u2019re going to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a survivor of a traumatic experience. It took a lot of counseling and I was already a counselor. As for us, you and me, there\u2019s client privilege, which means I never talk about your issues. In fact, I don\u2019t tell anyone who my clients are. What you say about our sessions is up to you\u2014but I won\u2019t mention I\u2019ve met you under these circumstances. I don\u2019t even take notes, in case they\u2019re ever subpoenaed, but you don\u2019t have to think about that\u2014your session with me isn\u2019t court ordered. So. Maybe you\u2019d like to jump in, take a chance. Hear about the spaceship for dessert?\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head. Unbelievable. It was surreal. The guy who was going to help put his head back together thought he\u2019d been abducted by aliens? \u201cHoly Jesus,\u201d he muttered. Jerry just lifted his pale brown eyebrows, waiting.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal,\u201d Rick said. \u201cBad stuff happens to me and the people who care about me. Started when I was two and my parents died in a car wreck. I bet if we could check back further, my mother probably almost died in childbirth....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a fact? Like you\u2019re bad luck or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like I am. You get mixed up with me, care about me, you\u2019re in for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but believe it. There\u2019s a long history of it.\u201d And Rick explained the details, his voice cold and flat.</p><p>A half hour later, Jerry asked, \u201cTell me about your girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my girl anymore. I broke up with her, for her own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still know about her. Tell me some things so I know who you broke up with and how you\u2019re feeling about it.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. Now, this was where the tissues might actually come in handy, if he broke down. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe had some of that accidental teenage sex when I was sixteen and she was fourteen. Happened so fast, we didn\u2019t even see it coming. One time. I got her knocked up. She was scared to death, and she was just a kid. But she wanted to have the baby, and she wanted me. Her mother and aunt Connie wanted her to give the baby away, but in the end it was me who couldn\u2019t live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you feel about the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I wanted to disappear. Run for my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to her. I stuck with her. I knew even way back then I loved that girl. It was totally nuts to love someone at that age, but I did. And we were going to find a way to keep that baby. My grandma and Jack, they were on board to help if they could. I was willing to do anything. Anything. Work ten jobs, whatever I had to do. I should have known I was no good for her when she got knocked up after one time. But then, just to drive the point home, her baby was born dead.\u201d</p><p>Jerry cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t think I missed anything there, Rick. It was also your baby. Correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it to her, though. I put it there, she loved him and took good care of him, and he was born dead.\u201d His voice cracked on the last word.</p><p>\u201cVery tough for the two of you,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cVery, very painful. You must have had a great deal of grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice filled with both anguish and self-loathing. \u201cAnd my way of dealing with it was to abandon her. I told her I had to get my head together. I enlisted in the Corps.\u201d He lifted his head, shook off the threat of tears. \u201cShe was scared to death of me doing that, plus I was going to be gone a long time, and she needed me. There was a war going on\u2014I knew I\u2019d end up going. And this girl, still just a girl in high school, she said if that\u2019s what I needed to do, she\u2019d stick it out. She\u2019d wait. She\u2019d be faithful, write me every day, and wait. How many fifteen-year-old girls do you know who could get through that? Get knocked up, bury their baby, send their boyfriend off to the Marines, then to war, and wait? I told her I wouldn\u2019t hold her to that, but it was her decision.\u201d</p><p>Jerry was silent. And so was Rick, for a little while.</p><p>\u201cShe missed every high-school thing that came along. While I\u2019m off turning myself into a big man, she\u2019s sitting home alone. She\u2019s so beautiful, you just can\u2019t imagine. And sweet. But she\u2019s not a little girl anymore\u2014she\u2019s gotten so strong.\u201d He let go a laugh. \u201cBecause of me. Because I put her through so much, probably. She\u2019d stay home from things like prom and homecoming because she didn\u2019t want any guys who would ask her out to think she was available. She\u2019d stay home and write me letters instead. When I got blown up, she came to Germany, where I was in the hospital. She\u2019d never been on a plane before in her life, and she flew halfway around the frickin\u2019 world to see me, make sure I was alive. And I treated her like crap. Told her she shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>Quiet reigned a moment. \u201cSounds like a wonderful girl,\u201d Jerry finally said. \u201cDevoted. You must have been in a bad place, emotionally, while you were in the hospital. Would that be correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just didn\u2019t deserve all that. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made her own choices, Rick. As did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, laughing without humor. \u201cThe choices I made were all selfish. The ones she made were all unselfish. All for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet if you asked her, she\u2019d say her choices served her needs. She must have wanted to be a part of your life.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo matter how bad it is for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou so sure it\u2019s bad for her? Sometimes being someone\u2019s partner is fulfilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, Jerry. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her in Germany, she should get on with her life\u2014that I was going to be busy trying to get through rehab. She called, sent me stuff, but I shut her out, hoping she\u2019d just wander off and get a life. Find a guy who could give her stuff, like maybe a future that didn\u2019t hurt all the time. But damn, that girl\u2019s stubborn. She never quit. I wouldn\u2019t take her calls, wouldn\u2019t return her messages, but she just kept at it. When I got back to Virgin River the other night, she came over to my gram\u2019s and asked me to go for a ride with her, to talk. I went, and I tried to talk to her, but once we were parked at the river, I just grabbed her. Like a maniac. I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I tore off her clothes and just did her\u2014just like that. No lovey-dovey stuff. After her jeans were off, I pulled her onto my lap and just plugged her. I practically raped the girl who\u2019s stuck by me through everything. And then I told her I couldn\u2019t be part of a couple anymore, that she had to let me go.\u201d</p><p>Now Jerry\u2019s silence lengthened, but Rick didn\u2019t fill it for quite a while.</p><p>\u201cHow impressed are you with me now?\u201d Rick finally asked.</p><p>Jerry cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019d like to ask a couple of questions, if it\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out. I\u2019m all out of secrets now.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat again. \u201cDid you hit her?\u201d</p><p>Rick was startled. \u201cOf course not! I wouldn\u2019t hit Liz!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hold her down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I pulled her on top of me. I can\u2019t do anything with this leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she struggle? Try to pull away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she ask you not to?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019d do anything for me. But that\u2019s no excuse for what I did to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything like, no? Or, please don\u2019t? Or, stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, she let me! That makes it worse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfterward, did she say you hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cShe said I\u2019d seemed to be in a hurry. And it was okay that it wasn\u2019t good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she cry or complain that she\u2019d tried to get through to you or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. She went along with it. I was rough and only thinking about myself. I was getting off! I was out of my mind. Liz is not made for that! She\u2019s a good, sweet, giving person! I don\u2019t want her giving in to someone like that. Like me.\u201d</p><p>Jerry smiled patiently and watched as Rick wiped angrily at his eyes, refusing to let himself cry.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Jerry said, \u201cthat sex will be better for both of you if you\u2019re conscious of each other\u2019s needs and desires. People in the throes of passion sometimes get a little selfish. Take advantage. And in the end, if they\u2019re two people who care about each other, it\u2019s not entirely satisfying. It sounds like maybe it wasn\u2019t all that satisfying to you.\u201d</p><p>Rick narrowed his eyes meanly. \u201cI got off. She didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it also happens, with couples, that people give rather than take sometimes. If one partner is particularly needy and the other doesn\u2019t feel at risk\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are the biggest dork,\u201d Rick snapped.</p><p>Jerry laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do better than that. I\u2019ve been called way worse than dork. And I concede to dork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just told you about the other night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t rape her, Rick. You didn\u2019t even almost rape her. I\u2019ve only known you for fifty minutes and yet I believe, if she\u2019d tried to pull away or told you to stop, you would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure because you weren\u2019t tested\u2014it didn\u2019t come to that. What\u2019s interesting about this is that my bigger challenge is usually explaining what rape is to a young man who thinks he didn\u2019t when, in fact, he did. Not listening to no. Holding a girl down. If what you\u2019re telling me is accurate, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m telling you is horrible,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cI think if you caused her pain, it probably came afterward, when you told her you didn\u2019t want her anymore. I\u2019d like you to think more about that decision so you can outline your motivation on that for me, and we\u2019ll talk about it on Thursday. I\u2019d also like you to try to make a list of the good things that have happened in your life. Don\u2019t strain yourself\u2014give me five. Maybe you should think of them as \u2018lucky\u2019 things. But our time is up for today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a goddamn minute!\u201d Rick snapped. \u201cYou have to tell me about the fucking spaceship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill your ride be waiting?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll wait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay then. I was camping with a couple of friends. We were in Arizona, way out in the middle of nowhere. We\u2019d been in Sedona, but we moved out into the desert. When my friends woke up in the morning, I was gone. I woke up\u2014I don\u2019t know when\u2014inside this spaceship. I had no memory of being snatched. It was like silver glass on the inside and the people\u2014the aliens\u2014had on suits that covered them from head to toe, breathing like Darth Vader, and I was stripped bare and lying out on a silver table. They were studying me and poking at me and talking in what sounded like high-pitched squeaks. Like dolphins.</p><p>\u201cMy friends got a search party going back in Arizona, but after two weeks of not being able to find me, they all gave up the search. They assumed I\u2019d wandered off and died in the desert. But at some point, again in a total blackout, I found myself back in the desert of Arizona\u2014alone. A park ranger found me and picked me up. The story goes that I wandered off from our camp and hallucinated due to dehydration, but that isn\u2019t what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it did,\u201d Rick said.</p> <p>Jerry shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t dehydrated. And after weeks of being missing in the desert, my clothes weren\u2019t damaged. Not torn or dirty or anything.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve researched\u2014mine is not the lone account of such a thing. I\u2019ll be glad to give you what other details I can remember at the end of our next session, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>Rick sat back in his chair and just stared at the guy. \u201cHow often does this spaceship trick work for you?\u201d</p><p>Jerry grinned. \u201cEvery time.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t ask about the counseling session. He didn\u2019t even bother with something as benign as, \u201cWas it as bad as you thought it would be?\u201d He just left it alone, so there was no talking. When they got back to the bar, Jack said, \u201cTomorrow morning is PT. See you at 9:00 a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get real tired of this,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cGet? I\u2019m already tired of it. \u2019Course I wouldn\u2019t be if you weren\u2019t so angry with me for God knows what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry with you, Jack. It\u2019s the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cTomorrow\u20149:00 a.m.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I need to come in now. Talk to Preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Jack said. And he thought\u2014why the hell can\u2019t you talk to me?</p><p>The big man was working in the kitchen. Paige was sitting at the workstation, holding Dana, now nine months old. \u201cWell, hey,\u201d she said, grinning broadly when she saw Rick enter. With baby in her arms, she went to him, embracing him. \u201cI wondered when I was going to see you. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Rick\u2019s hand automatically wandered to little Dana\u2019s head, smoothing over her thin cap of brown hair. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Paige. I wanted to apologize for the other night. To you and Preach.\u201d</p><p>Preacher lifted his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cNo problem, man. Jack said you were worn out and the leg was hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to double apologize,\u201d Rick said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t it. I just couldn\u2019t take on the town, Preach. I\u2019m sorry. Maybe I can run into them one at a time. But a big gang like that\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like I could do it. I wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cAh, how can I explain? Nah, I can\u2019t explain. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not always in charge of how I behave. Sometimes I say mean things, ungrateful things. Do things it isn\u2019t like me to do. And sometimes I break down and it\u2019s embarrassing. That\u2019s the best I can do for an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cStill real rocky, getting on with things. Yeah, I been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a bushy brow. \u201cJack ever tell you about how I got hurt in Iraq and cried like a baby, calling for my mother?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWasn\u2019t like me either, and my injury was minor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was major enough that I had to carry you over my shoulder for a long damn stretch,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even in the hospital after,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cSo, I know the best way to fix your situation. Marines back from war are always comped around here. \u2019Course, you\u2019d be comped even if you hadn\u2019t gone to war, but since you did, you eat and drink on the house here, just like cops, doctors, firefighters. You know\u2014like we\u2019ve always done. You serve the town, Jack serves you. You must be getting some serious cabin fever sitting around your grandma\u2019s. Walk down here sometimes, just to say hello. That\u2019ll get you back in touch. One at a time, like you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cI gotta warn you\u2014I\u2019m not great company. Ask Jack.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at Jack. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it gets better. After some adjustment. Maybe we should go out to the river....\u201d He grinned yet his eyebrows frowned in a menacing way, as though he was thinking of drowning Rick rather than catching fish.</p><p>Rick almost smiled. Jack was a real good guy, but he wasn\u2019t good at taking shit, and Rick had given him a real load of it. \u201cSee?\u201d he said, looking back at Preacher and Paige.</p><p>\u201cWell, try this,\u201d Paige said, pushing the baby on him. \u201cShe puts everyone in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a fact?\u201d Rick asked, taking Dana into his arms. \u201cWhere\u2019s the little guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris is in school. He\u2019s in first grade now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, jeez, was he in that bus accident?\u201d Rick asked. \u201cJack told me about it.\u201d</p><p>Paige shook her head. \u201cHe was home that day. I kept him home because of the nasty weather. If it weren\u2019t just first grade, I probably would have sent him. Now, till I get my confidence back, I drive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rode that bus for years. Must have scared you to death,\u201d Rick said, and sniffed the baby\u2019s neck while she patted him on the cheek.</p><p>Preacher smiled and exchanged glances with his wife. \u201cScared everyone in town, Rick,\u201d Preacher said, not wanting to draw attention to the fact that Rick was caving in to the baby\u2019s softness, sweetness. \u201cHow about a sandwich? I\u2019m just making up some for lunch. And I want you to see the new house Paul built on the bar for me and Paige\u2014it\u2019s amazing. Turned that little apartment into a real house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d Rick said, and then he actually laughed as Dana pressed her forehead against his and blubbered her lips in a spitty noise.</p><p>Jack just wandered into the bar. But he smiled to himself. It was true, he wasn\u2019t patient. But all he had to see was one ounce of recovery and it gave him some hope to hang on to.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Friday afternoon came and Jerry Powell sat at his desk. He didn\u2019t take notes during sessions, but afterward he wrote out a summary for the client files. He heard the outside door open and quickly closed and put away the file. Then he smiled as Liz walked into the office. \u201cHey there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she answered, taking one of the chairs in the room.</p><p>This sort of thing didn\u2019t happen in Jerry\u2019s practice as often as one might think it would, given the size of the towns. He\u2019d been counseling Liz since right after her baby was stillborn. He had a nice contract with the county school district. There were school counselors in both Eureka and Fortuna who liked his work and made referrals to him. And after Rick had been wounded in Iraq, Liz came back to him. After all, he\u2019d been able to help before and they had history, so he was a logical choice.</p><p>If Rick and Liz talked about it, they would find out that he was counselor to both of them, but they wouldn\u2019t learn it from him. And information he got from them about each other didn\u2019t factor in his therapeutic work, though it was pretty impossible not to be aware. Therefore enlightened, he hoped.</p><p>Even though he felt a lot closer to Liz, and knew her much better, it hadn\u2019t taken him long to feel a certain attachment to Rick. Here were a couple of kids who had been to hell and back. And while they loved each other, they were in a bad enough place that they might not get through it together. In fact, Jerry knew they were already apart. The one thing he couldn\u2019t do was fill in the blanks for them\u2014it would be a breach of ethics. If he were in a place where more PhDs were available to counsel, it would probably be wise to push one of them off on another counselor. If they were a married couple seeking individual as opposed to marriage counseling, he would be forced to. Otherwise, it would be a conflict of interest.</p><p>They needed him. And he was confident he could counsel them without prejudice.</p><p>Jerry came around his desk and went to the chair facing Liz. She came by his office every Friday after school on her way to Virgin River to help her aunt in the store. She had been for a couple of months now. \u201cHow was your week?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNot great,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried I might be sliding backward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and tell me about it, Liz,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I had myself toughened up a little. Like I\u2019ve told you before, I started concentrating on school more, so Rick would be proud. But then I liked it. Liked that I could get the grades when I tried. Liked that I already got an acceptance into community college. It was for me. And I hung in there pretty good, even though Rick wouldn\u2019t take my phone calls or anything. But then I finally saw him and talked to him. Last Friday night. I had to go to him, of course, even though he knows exactly how to find me. He made it real clear\u2014he wants us to break up. He\u2019s through with me. All week I haven\u2019t been able to study at all. And I have finals coming up.\u201d She swallowed a couple of times, as if trying to keep her tears in check. \u201cAll of a sudden, I don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you care about?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNot much of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean, it\u2019s not just schoolwork that\u2019s been affected?\u201d</p><p>She scooted forward on her chair. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Jerry. I knew this all along. I\u2019ve known it since I read the pamphlets with Jack in Germany. He\u2019s breaking up with me for my own good. He said as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you remember what he said?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat with him there was one bad thing after another, and they were always his fault. Which is the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. But I read in all the stuff they gave us and the stuff I found online, some wounded military guys go through this kind of thing. They feel as if it\u2019s their fault or something. As if they don\u2019t deserve to be loved. What the hell is that? Why doesn\u2019t he blame me for all the stuff that\u2019s gone wrong since we\u2019ve been together? Why don\u2019t I blame me?\u201d</p><p>Jerry smiled a little, tilting his head. \u201cIf you\u2019ll remember, we worked through some of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did, huh?\u201d she said, suddenly reminded. She straightened. \u201cYeah, we did. I did blame myself before. I thought I\u2019d done something wrong to make the baby die. Like I ate the wrong things or didn\u2019t eat the right things. Or slept on my back or something. Yeah.\u201d She actually smiled, though it was a weak and sad smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right. But I never broke up with Rick because I thought I wasn\u2019t good enough for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe went over some of this, too,\u201d Jerry reminded her. \u201cEveryone has an individual response to crisis, grief, et cetera. I don\u2019t say this to you to influence the direction you take in your situation, Liz, but you do have to keep that in mind. He has many adjustments to make that might not make sense to you. Just like if you\u2019d told him you were guilty, as if you\u2019d hurt the baby, it might not have made sense to him. The important thing is that you understand yourself.\u201d</p><p>She made a face, lowered her gaze. \u201cHaving a little trouble there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feelings are so hurt. And I drove out of town, parked and cried. But before I even got done crying, I was so mad. I\u2019m still so mad. Instead of studying like I should be, I just go into these mental arguments with him, yelling at him in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you play some of those tapes for me?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you yelling in your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, things like, Who do you think you are? You think you\u2019re the only one who ever felt terrible and scared and alone? Who felt loss? Who felt you weren\u2019t good enough? Don\u2019t you think I\u2019d have given up both legs if it could have saved the baby\u2019s life? Things like that. I mean, I went through a real bad time with the baby, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know. Did he help you with that at the time?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>She was quiet a moment. Finally she said, \u201cTotally. He did everything he could think of. Even though it hurt him just as much. I know it did. After the baby was born, when he was holding me and the baby together, he was touching his little-bitty hand and tears were falling on my hair and the baby\u2019s head. But he held me. He came to Eureka almost every day. He called to see how I was twice a day.... And now...he won\u2019t let me be there for him,\u201d she added quietly. \u201cHe wants to do this alone. And he can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we went out to talk, we made love.... Well, not like we used to. He was a little nuts, grabbing me. I tried to slow him down a little, shushing him, kissing him softly, but he was just gone. That\u2019s what makes me confused\u2014he doesn\u2019t want us to be together anymore, but he can\u2019t control himself when he\u2019s with me. Explain that to me.\u201d</p><p>Jerry deferred. Instead, he said, \u201cDid he hurt you, Liz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysically? Of course not,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHe even said he was sorry while he was trying to get my jeans off. Like he was sorry he was so desperate or something. Because he didn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t stop him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t care. He\u2019s been away a long time, he\u2019s been through so much, and I was missing him, too. I wanted him\u2014that wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem came after when he said, \u2018See? We can\u2019t be together.\u2019 And I thought\u2014what was that? That was together. I understand it\u2014I read all the stuff. He\u2019s pushing me away. But at the same time, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>\u201cNow? Now nothing. From me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you explain that, please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI took him back to his grandmother\u2019s house and told him to get out of my car. I reminded him that he knew how to find me. I\u2019ve spent months reaching out to him. I don\u2019t think it would be good for either one of us if I pushed on it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019re going to be able to follow through on that?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>Her lips pursed, her eyes watered, a trembling hand rose up to her chest and just as a giant tear rolled down her cheek, in a voice so soft Jerry had to strain to hear her, she whispered, \u201cMy heart hurts. Hurts so bad. I...I just don\u2019t want him to see me cry anymore....\u201d She hiccuped and blinked until her cheeks were wet. Jerry didn\u2019t hand her a tissue; she knew where they were. She\u2019d used up his supply several times. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t love him so much, I\u2019d hate him.\u201d She swallowed and reached for a tissue. \u201cMy heart hurts so bad....\u201d</p><p>By the time May was full on the land, the afternoons were almost always sunny and warm. The forest animals were out of hiding, often with new babies, along the meadows and river at dawn and again at dusk. Spring wildflowers were in full glory along roadsides, up the mountainsides and through the meadows. Virgin River was at its most beautiful in spring.</p><p>And Dan Brady was glad he\u2019d made the decision to come here. He\u2019d given it a lot of thought. Indeed, there\u2019d been lots of time to think about where he\u2019d settle while he cooled his heels in Folsom Prison. He was a low-profile prisoner\u2014just a pot grower. He didn\u2019t even take a hit for dealing\u2014he\u2019d only been caught growing, but the assumption was, he grew it to sell it. It was the pedophiles and rapists who were in constant danger from other inmates. And there was fighting among the gangs. Dan just did his time quietly. And thought.</p><p>It was a logical decision for him. Virgin River was a quiet, decent town. There were people there he thought highly of\u2014Mel and Jack being two. Preacher was an oddball, but good-hearted and helpful. Paul Haggerty was a stand-up boss. Of course, he\u2019d had no expectation that they\u2019d come to respect him, but to his amazement, they were perfectly friendly toward him. And the job with Haggerty\u2014pure luck. If he\u2019d been Haggerty, he\u2019d never have hired himself. But it was working out great. There was plenty of overtime when he wanted it. Haggerty paid a fair wage and the benefits were good. The men he worked with were quality crews. Haggerty had high standards.</p><p>It didn\u2019t leave him much spare time, but what was he going to do with spare time? He\u2019d always been a loner, something that intensified when he was growing pot. It was a habit he was slowly trying to break\u2014it made sense for him to come out of the darkness and have people in his life, like he used to. They might not trust him, but he trusted them. They were transparent, to the last one\u2014not real complicated, living authentic lives, invested in their families and friends, protective of their own, their town. So he had begun to slowly enter their world. He picked up a packed lunch from the bar every morning at about 6:00 a.m.\u2014Preacher made it the night before. Then a couple of nights a week he\u2019d take dinner and a beer there and catch up on local gossip and national news on the bar\u2019s TV. The rest of the time he either worked or tinkered around the rental house.</p><p>His father taught him something real useful when it came to fixer-uppers\u2014always do what shows the most first. So the first thing Dan did was replace the window glass in that one broken window and reinforce and repair the front porch. Took him a day and a half. Then he hired some of Haggerty\u2019s boys to scrape and paint the house while he painted the porch\u2014he wasn\u2019t going up on those ladders. Dan wasn\u2019t about to invest in a new roof if he didn\u2019t own the place, but he did have the existing roof repaired so he wouldn\u2019t drown in the next big rain.</p><p>Next, he pulled weeds, threw down some topsoil, tore out the cracked sidewalk with a crowbar and shovel and put down patio stones instead. He planted flowers along the front of the house. A little daily sprinkling and some spring sunshine and he had a green yard bordered by colorful flowers and a pretty little yellow house, trimmed in white.</p><p>Once he was inside, which was about three weeks into his tenancy, he could work evenings when he felt like it. He tackled the easiest and most visible stuff first. He washed the nicotine off the living-room and dining-room walls, patched and painted. He borrowed a big industrial floor sander from Paul and turned the living/dining area into a beautiful L-shaped room in about ten days with paint, stain, varnish and floor wax. He scrubbed up the stone fireplace and it was looking good. Then he scrubbed down and painted the bedroom\u2014it took only a few evenings. The only furniture he had was a bed and a small table with two chairs that he left in the dining room while he tore apart the kitchen.</p><p>He\u2019d been in Virgin River six weeks, in his little rental for just over four, and he was really pleased with what a minimal amount of money and some work could do. The kitchen was going to take more than a couple of weeks, and would be a lot more expensive than the work he\u2019d done so far, but he was making good money and he\u2019d take it slow. He scraped off the old, damaged linoleum floor and removed all the cupboards, since some were already missing doors and they were too old to be a standard size. He ripped out the counters, keeping just the sink and moving the appliances away from the walls.</p><p>He got rid of the old, peeling, yellowed wallpaper, textured the kitchen walls and was painting away a Sunday afternoon when there was a knock at the door. He went, roller in hand, and opened the door. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cMy landlady. Funny, I wondered if I\u2019d ever see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house,\u201d she said. Her mouth hung open and her eyes were huge. \u201cGood God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is it okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head and he thought, for a second, she was going to say he\u2019d gone too far and she hated it.</p><p>\u201cI never even imagined it could look like this. It\u2019s incredible. When I pulled up, I thought I had the wrong house.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI should probably stop. If I do a good enough job, you\u2019re going to want it back and I\u2019ll be in the camper shell again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m never living here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d given up on you. I asked Jack if he thought you\u2019d be back and he said he didn\u2019t really know. He thought there was a chance you\u2019d just let the house go. Can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d do that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you probably couldn\u2019t. Chalk it up to some bad memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been horrific,\u201d he said, and she merely nodded.</p><p>The house wasn\u2019t the only thing that looked different. She was looking pretty good herself. The last time he\u2019d seen her, she\u2019d been hauling trash all day, but even after that, she had strong looks that held up. He put her at somewhere around thirty. Maybe five foot six or so. Slender but not skinny; long legs, good hips. She had an unfussy style\u2014hair that curled under just above her shoulders, makeup he could see her freckles through.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m owing you rent,\u201d he said, pulling out his wallet from his back pocket. But she just walked past him into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d she said. \u201cStripped bare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. This is going to take a while because of the cost. Couple of months, at least, depending on things like overtime. It needs everything. I\u2019m doing the floor and walls first, cupboards and counters next, and appliances one at a time. This is also going to be more expensive than some grass seed and paint. Lots more. I hope you\u2019re planning to let me stay here cheap for a while to make up for the investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start with that bathroom. Nice big room, but it\u2019s a nightmare the way that shower\u2019s put in. Plus, I\u2019m going to have to give up the bathroom during the remodel, and after living in a camper shell for a while, that shower, ugly as it is, comes in real handy. Especially when you work construction all day, then again at home all night.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything, just looked around in wonder. \u201cThat bathroom could use a tub and shower, and new toilet.\u201d Still, silence. \u201cI\u2019m not taking on that back room till I\u2019ve been here a year or more. Fact is, it needs to be ripped off and rebuilt. Hey\u2014we in the same solar system here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. Gee... Um, what\u2019s your name again?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDan Brady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Dan. I\u2019m just blown away by how good the place looks. And in a little over a month. You must have worked yourself to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. A little after work, a little on the weekends.\u201d He still held his wallet in his hand. \u201cI owe you like a month and a half rent. Cash all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time the rent\u2019s due, I can drop it off in Eureka when I\u2019m over there, if you\u2019ll give me an address. I get around that way at least once a month, buying stuff like paint, caulk, repair stuff. Maybe we could grab a quick bite, talk more about what I\u2019m thinking for the house, get to know each other a little, you know....\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about me, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh\u2014you lived here. Your mother died and your father is with a brother? That right? You work and live in Eureka, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic,\u201d she said, straightening almost proudly.</p><p>\u201cAh. Expensive date or enjoying sobriety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver seven months sober. I know the exact number of days. Hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. So, if it doesn\u2019t freak you out for me to know where you live and if you\u2019d like a free meal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get involved with men.\u201d</p> <p>He looked stricken for a second. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry, Cheryl. I didn\u2019t mean to mislead you\u2014I wasn\u2019t expecting to get involved. I just thought rent money, early dinner and someplace casual. Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh to herself, softly, shaking her head. \u201cParanoid,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cGoes with the territory. Listen, Dan\u2014I wasn\u2019t an ordinary drunk. I was a very drunk drunk. Did a lot of regretful things. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t come back here, where it all started, where I was at my worst. Ask anyone in town\u2014they can all tell you about Cheryl, the town drunk. You don\u2019t want to have dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a small smile. He stuck out his hand. \u201cCheryl, meet Dan\u2014ex-con.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t take the hand, but lifted her eyebrows slightly. \u201cFor...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing weed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus, you a druggie?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNever used dope, I just grew it for the money. I was in a tight spot, a family member needed help, I couldn\u2019t think of anything else and I\u2019d met a guy way back who knew someone who knew someone who could set me up and I could make a bunch of money fast. And I got caught and did time.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAsk anyone around here about Dan, the grower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? In Virgin River? Fixing up an old shit hole like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting my life back. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, touch\u00e9.\u201d She reached into her shoulder bag and pulled out a scrap of paper and a pen. \u201cHere\u2019s my phone number. Call a week ahead and clear a time with me. And I don\u2019t know about a meal\u2014I\u2019ll have to think about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think. I\u2019ll paint. And here\u2019s three hundred dollars to catch you up. Though now the place is looking better, you probably want a friggin\u2019 security deposit, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t anything bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnymore? Not so much.\u201d</p><p>Cameron had put off calling his parents for as long as he could. Though he was thirty-six, it still mattered a great deal to him what they thought of him. So, after a light dinner with Abby at the cabin, he told her he was going to call his mother. She groaned and leaned against him. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d he told her, giving her a kiss on the forehead. \u201cBut, Abby, I\u2019m not going to lie to my parents and pretend I just got involved with some pregnant girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly, nervously. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bedroom,\u201d she said.</p><p>She had no idea how happy it made him when she said that\u2014the bedroom, not my bedroom. Because night after night they lay there together, kissing, touching, fondling, not having sex but having everything else. For Abby, as huge and uncomfortable as she was these days, sex was way down on her list of things she needed. She just took comfort in the touching, the affection, nearness. For Cameron, it was a little more than that. His emotions were definitely sexually charged. He found it crazy and beautiful that he wanted her just as much round with the babies as he had the night they\u2019d conceived, when she was so small, so svelte. Of course he couldn\u2019t keep that a secret from Abby, nor did he try to. She even offered to help with that. \u201cLet me, Cameron,\u201d she said, touching him intimately. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you have to be frustrated.\u201d And he had said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting for you, and that\u2019s the way I want it. After these little ones are born and you\u2019re recovered, we\u2019re going to rock the walls of this cabin.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember a time he\u2019d been happier. And it was in that frame of mind he placed the call to his parents.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Cam. How\u2019s the little town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Pour a glass of wine, Mom. I have something important to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said. \u201cGo ahead....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2019s orders,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on now, I have a surprise. A very nice one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI hope you found yourself a wonderful woman in that little town....\u201d</p><p>He paused, hoping she\u2019d taken his advice about the wine. \u201cWell, as a matter of fact...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Who is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I found her last year. Last fall, in Grants Pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was much to say. I really fell for her, but she had complications in her life. When I met her, she\u2019d been separated from her husband for almost a year and they were getting divorced. It wasn\u2019t too soon for her to think about another man, but it was too soon for her to get involved. At that time, at least. She had to get her legal affairs straightened out. So, as much as I hated it, we lost touch for a while. We connected again in January, her divorce final. Her name is Abby and, Mom, she\u2019s wonderful. Beautiful and sweet and perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Cam, I\u2019m so happy for you. Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of reasons, one being that I wanted some time with her first. And of course, Abby having been married once, she wanted to take it slow. You understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. Where does she live, Cam? When can I meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives here now, Mom. With me. And it won\u2019t be long before you can meet her, but there\u2019s one more thing. During that short time we knew each other in Grants Pass, we had a little...ah, a little...blessing, that\u2019s what it was. We had a blessing. Well, actually a couple of blessings. On the way. Soon.\u201d Dead silence answered him. \u201cIt came as a shock to poor Abby at first, and I admit\u2014I was pretty surprised, but we\u2019re very happy about it. Happy and excited.\u201d Silence. It stretched out. \u201cMom? Twins. We know one is a boy, but the other one is hiding.\u201d Again, a vacuum.</p><p>Then he heard his mother shriek, \u201cEdward! Come here! Cameron got some girl pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! Just have a little sip of that wine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take something a little stronger! Twins? You got some girl pregnant with twins?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it\u2014he laughed. \u201cMom,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not some girl\u2014she\u2019s not a girl. Her name is Abby and she\u2019s thirty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, how in the world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mother, I\u2019m not going to explain. You\u2019ll just have to trust me, I\u2019ve never been careless and neither has Abby. So\u2014here\u2019s the deal. She\u2019s probably going to go early, though the babies are due the second of July. Anytime, Mom. Abby wants to have her mother come as soon as they\u2019re delivered, so I hope you can be a little patient. Twins is a pretty big\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron! Are you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Mom. Even though we\u2019re in this together, completely, we just haven\u2019t had time to get married. That will come\u2014we\u2019ll take care of the details. No point in rushing it now. Besides, we\u2019re not going to be fooling anybody, including the great-grandmothers and great-aunt Jean, by rushing into it right now. They\u2019re nearly here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God in heaven,\u201d his mother said. And in the background he could hear his father, Ed, saying, \u201cWhat? What? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you the moment they\u2019re born. Tomorrow, when I\u2019m at the clinic, I\u2019ll get Mel to take a picture of me and Abby and e-mail it to you. By then you will have calmed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Cameron,\u201d she said, \u201cyou haven\u2019t given me time to knit anything!\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cWell, get started. Abby\u2019s really ready to unload. She just has to make it a couple more weeks to be completely safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear God in heaven,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told me any sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were details to work out, Mother. This is how it is and you\u2019re going to be gracious. Abby is understandably stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be gracious! Just answer me one question, and be honest with me, because I always know when you\u2019re lying. Do you love this wo\u2014 Abby?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMom, I loved her the second I saw her. And I love her more every day.\u201d He heard his answer in his mother\u2019s heavy, satisfied sigh. \u201cThere now, go take care of Dad before he goes crazy, and I\u2019ll e-mail a picture tomorrow sometime. Mom, congratulations. I love you.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and got himself a beer out of the refrigerator. He popped the top and went to the bedroom, leaning in the open doorway. Abby was sitting cross-legged, her iPod earphones plugged into her ears, deep breathing with her eyes closed. He just watched, smiling at the sight. She was a vision.</p><p>She opened her eyes, took the plugs out of her ears and looked at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cShe was very surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a little pissed off that I didn\u2019t give her more time to knit something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d she said, taking a breath. \u201cDid you tell her it was an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told her it was a blessing. And the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Dan Brady had not envisioned that in just a couple of months in Virgin River, he\u2019d be able to walk into that little bar and be accepted as one of them. They didn\u2019t make a big fuss; it wasn\u2019t like Cheers with everyone shouting welcome. No, that wouldn\u2019t have been to his taste anyway. What was nice was to go during the busier times of day and sit up at the bar and chat with whoever was around, just as if he was one of the neighbors, which he was. In prior years, before he\u2019d settled in this town, he would only go to the bar at midday when hardly anyone was around.</p><p>He sat up at the bar and found himself facing Preacher. \u201cHey there, brother,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cHeineken?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dan smiled. He didn\u2019t let on how much it pleased him to be greeted that way. \u201cThanks\u201d was all he said. \u201cYou doing bar duty tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a few. Jack\u2019s over at the clinic, loading up Mel and the kids so she can take \u2019em home. He\u2019ll be right back. Paige is minding the stove while Dana\u2019s in the high chair back there, and Chris,\u201d he said, tilting his head to the far end of the bar where the six-year-old sat, \u201cis doing homework.\u201d</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cHomework? In first grade?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that crazy or what? Thank Jesus I didn\u2019t go to that school. Man, I had nuns, and I thought I had it rough.\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s trigonometry,\u201d he went on. \u201cHe\u2019s drawing pictures and making numbers and letters, but still....\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Dan agreed.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. I have to check if we\u2019re making progress.\u201d And he wandered down to his stepson.</p><p>A moment later Jack was holding the door open for Hope McCrea. She stomped inside wearing her muddy running shoes and lavender sweatsuit with brown stains on the knees. He\u2019d spent a good amount of time talking to Hope. Well, he\u2019d been listening to Hope. It was gardening season for her. She tended a very large garden every spring and summer. Living alone as she did, she didn\u2019t have much use for all her produce, so she gave most of it away and the deer and rabbits drove her crazy, getting in her garden.</p><p>She sat up beside Dan while Jack went around the bar and without being asked, poured her a whiskey. Then she pulled out her Marlboros. After a brief hack to clear her throat and lungs, she lit up. \u201cI have news,\u201d she said to Jack and anyone who would listen. \u201cI bought the church.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cThe church. The Lutherans aren\u2019t sending another minister this way\u2014we\u2019re just too small for their tastes. Or for anyone\u2019s, it appears. I\u2019ve been making offers for six years, but they were set on selling the church to some other denomination. But finally they had to admit defeat\u2014no one wants it. So I lowered my offer, crazy fools. Got it for a song.\u201d She cackled. \u201cGot it for a hymn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Hope\u2014are you just richer than God?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a couple bucks and nothing to do but buy and sell things. So, I\u2019m going to sell the church.\u201d She sipped her drink. Puffed on her cigarette.</p><p>\u201cBut, Hope\u2014you said no one wants it,\u201d Jack pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWell, none of those religions want it. I\u2019m going to sell it on eBay.\u201d</p> <p>It was silent for a second, then Jack, Dan and Preacher burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, go ahead and laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Someone\u2019s going to want a church. That\u2019s a good church. Little roughed up at the moment, but it can be considered a fixer-upper.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned on the bar. \u201cLet me guess\u2014you have some old pictures of that church, right? When it was beautiful, right? And you\u2019re going to float out those pictures and snag some poor rube, like you did Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel hasn\u2019t complained in years,\u201d Hope said, puffing.</p><p>\u201cMel?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Jack gave the counter a wipe. \u201cMel took the job here based on a bunch of pictures Hope sent of a pretty little town and a cabin in the woods she could use for free for a year. Cabin looked like new; town looked thirty years younger. The cabin was probably in worse shape than that Creighton house you\u2019re working on, and the town...? Well, you\u2019ve seen the town. Mel was furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a sharp tongue, that one,\u201d Hope said, making Jack laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, Hope,\u201d Jack said, \u201cwhat if satanists buy the church?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood luck to them,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cThis would be a real bad town for someone who\u2019s no good to try to make a go of it. I\u2019ll post up old and recent pictures, so people know what they\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d want a church?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who needs to preach, I\u2019m thinking,\u201d Hope said. \u201cOr satanists, who Jack and Preacher will run off and make sorry they ever got the idea.\u201d She sipped the last of her drink, put out her cigarette. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of venison come in the bar soon, Jack. I\u2019m going to shoot the goddamn deer if they don\u2019t get out of my yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take illegal venison, Hope. You try this every spring. Why don\u2019t you put up a good fence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have up a good fence! They jump it! And the goddamn rabbits dig under. Bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, is that any way for the owner of a church to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just own it, Jack,\u201d she said, pushing up her glasses. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly the religious sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis town could use a little religion, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a long time now, but that church used to be full all the time. Of course, it was full of poor mountain people and there wasn\u2019t any parsonage, so the pastor got himself relocated. Couldn\u2019t hardly feed himself on what poor mountain folk put in the plate. But things have gotten better around here since I was younger. Lotta farmers and ranchers and\u2014\u201d she leveled her gaze at Dan accusingly \u201c\u2014construction workers moved in. They can fill up the collection plate. It\u2019s time to try it again.\u201d She gave Dan a pat on the shoulder and left the bar, scuffling out the door.</p><p>Dan looked up at Jack. \u201cThat is one strange woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-ho, she\u2019s peculiar all right. But she\u2019s always thinking about the town. I\u2019d love to get a look at her will. She\u2019s crafty, and I think she must have a ton of money. And no living relatives.\u201d He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cLooking for a wife? Mature woman with big black glasses and mud on her knees?\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could drink that one pretty, Jack. But gee, thanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going at the house?\u201d</p><p>He sat back. \u201cThe landlady showed up today. Now, there\u2019s an interesting woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tells me she was the town drunk,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe was,\u201d Jack confirmed. \u201cShe got in treatment and seems to be doing great. She\u2019s a whole new person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the town drunk like?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Jack looked upward, thinking. Then he brought his gaze down to Dan\u2019s. \u201cKnow what? I\u2019m not going to talk about that. Cheryl is a good person who had a mighty big burden with her drinking. I\u2019ll tell you the truth, I never saw any hope. But I see her now and she\u2019s not the same woman. Honest to God, I would\u2019ve thought that even sober, she\u2019d be a little slow-witted, unmotivated. Damaged. But she seems to have beat the odds\u2014she\u2019s just incredible. I want her to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s making it,\u201d Dan said. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, that you won\u2019t talk about it. Must\u2019ve been kind of bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddy, we\u2019ve all been through bad times we\u2019d like to forget.\u201d</p><p>And like an introduction to bad times personified, the door opened and Rick came in, using just a cane for assistance. Dan noticed that Jack frowned before he smiled. \u201cHow you doing, son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he said, leaning on the cane. \u201cI\u2019m getting used to the cane. Haven\u2019t been on my ass all day.\u201d He sat up at the bar.</p><p>Dan turned toward him. \u201cDan Brady,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met once, a long time ago. You might not remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jack said suddenly. \u201cThe night Paige got snatched! You remember, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rick said, putting out a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who knocked the bad guy out with the flashlight. I\u2019d almost forgotten about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about the leg,\u201d Dan said. \u201cYou starting to feel okay with the prosthesis yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it still hurts some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watching for breakdown? That can slow you down....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about this stuff?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>\u201cA little bit. So, you watching that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only am I watching it, I go to PT three times a week where they\u2019re watching it. I\u2019m covered. Right now, all I want is to walk without pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019ll get that. Then what?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he said. \u201cJack, what do you think? Think I earned a beer and some dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo conditions. I walk you home and we take something home to your gram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Rick said, patting the bar.</p><p>He was a good nine months away from twenty-one, but he\u2019d lived a lot more than most men his age. And he\u2019d put in a rough week of three PT sessions and two counseling sessions.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing around here?\u201d Rick asked Dan.</p><p>\u201cWorking for Paul Haggerty. What are you going to do? You must have lots of options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, I don\u2019t know. Right now, I just have to get a leg. Walk in it. Then maybe I\u2019ll be able to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always school,\u201d Jack said, putting down a beer and retrieving his coffee cup. \u201cThat GI Bill, that\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Rick lifted the beer, took a sip and said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Right away Dan knew, the kid was still depressed and screwed up about the war, the injury, the missing leg. \u201cThis little town you got here, Rick\u2014nice little place. I come from down the coast. Sebastapol. Near Bodega Bay. Not exactly a real small town. You grow up here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo, when did you join the Corps?\u201d</p><p>Rick looked at Dan. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, I don\u2019t feel real talkative right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right by me,\u201d Dan said. \u201cJack, whenever Preacher\u2019s ready with dinner, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Jack said, scowling briefly at Rick.</p><p>While Rick nursed his beer and then picked at his dinner, a few people who came into the bar approached him, said hello and patted his back. Their brows were furrowed as if they were feeling sorry for him and Dan knew, not a great thing to do. Right now Rick probably felt as though that was what he needed, maybe enjoyed it a little, but this kid was tough and strong and pity wasn\u2019t going to help much.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t even see the next group come in. A couple and a girl. They sat at a table near the window. It was when Rick turned and looked that Dan followed his gaze and saw the girl connect with him. Beautiful girl. So beautiful and so sad, Dan was almost jealous for a second. He couldn\u2019t see what Rick\u2019s eyes were doing, but their eyes must have been locked together. The girl\u2019s mouth hung open at first, then closed. She turned to the woman at her table, a small redhead in her fifties, whispered something and then fled the bar.</p><p>Rick pivoted back.</p><p>Dan gave it a minute before he said, \u201cNow, that was interesting.\u201d</p><p>Rick took a slug of his beer. \u201cShe used to be my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Before the leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t deal with the leg?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Rick swiveled his angry gaze to Dan. \u201cThis your business, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan. The name is Dan. Just curious. Seemed like she looked really sad, not put off. But maybe I imagined that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not put off, but it isn\u2019t going to work for us anymore. Will that do it for you? Can you leave it alone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, kid. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>Whoa, Dan thought. This is one tough customer. He had enough mad in him to burn buildings.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t ten minutes later that the couple, minus the girl, approached Rick. The small redheaded woman put a hand on his shoulder and said, \u201cHow are you doing, Ricky? Getting along any better?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing pretty well, Connie.

She doing okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying, Ricky. She\u2019s stronger than she looks. She\u2019s trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cTake care then,\u201d Connie said. And they left the bar.</p><p>And Dan thought, this guy is imploding.</p><p>Twelve</p> <p>Walt Booth had dinner at his daughter\u2019s house at least twice a week. With Muriel away, Vanni was even more conscientious about making sure he was invited regularly. His daughter so enjoyed cooking, it was always a pleasure to have her do it for him. Then after dessert, if it was still early, he\u2019d take his coffee to the great room and sometimes rock the baby for a while before Matt was settled in bed. Sometimes Paul would join him there, take in a little of the television news, but Paul was often occupied in the garage, working on built-ins for the interior of their house.</p><p>Vanni refilled Walt\u2019s coffee while he rocked little Matt on a typical evening. \u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet lately,\u201d she said to her father.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just said everything I have to say. Maybe there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cThen tell me what you hear from Muriel.\u201d And Walt\u2019s chin immediately dropped. \u201cUh-oh. Have you and Muriel had some kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>Walt looked up. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s trouble or not, but she\u2019s not exactly pleased with me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cShe can\u2019t get away from that movie. She\u2019d like me to farm out the dogs and get Shelby to feed the horses, and for me to go to Montana for at least a long weekend.\u201d</p><p>Vanni sat back on the sofa, holding her own coffee cup. \u201cAnd the problem is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to go to Montana,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell. That must make her feel completely special.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI don\u2019t belong there, where she\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d ask you if she thought you\u2019d be in the way. In fact, it might be good for you to see her at work. I know if she\u2019d asked me, I\u2019d be on the next plane. I\u2019d love to visit a movie set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you have it, Vanessa,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself on a movie set. It\u2019s completely out of my experience. I\u2019d probably just embarrass her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat nonsense! It would be fun, Dad! You\u2019d not only learn more about what she\u2019s doing, you\u2019d have a little time together in the mornings and evenings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure it would be fun....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...? What did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>He made a face. \u201cIt\u2019s more what she said to me. I told her I didn\u2019t think it was such a good idea, me going to her movie set, and she drew a line in the sand.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNot really like Muriel, but that\u2019s what she did.\u201d</p><p>With some exasperation, Vanni said, \u201cDo you think you can possibly make this explanation any more confusing? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I told her I didn\u2019t really want to come to her movie, that I\u2019d feel out of place and strange because I don\u2019t know anything about movies, much less making them, she said...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cShe said that was ridiculous, there wasn\u2019t anything special about this location set\u2014it was just a lot of working people. Grips, carpenters, cooks, et cetera. I had to Google \u2018grips,\u2019 that\u2019s how little I know. And she expected me to make an effort or she was going to be left to assume she didn\u2019t matter enough for me to swallow down a little unease so we could have some time together.\u201d</p><p>Vanni grinned. \u201cShe told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t called since. And my calls go to voice mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has that been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll week. We usually talk every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, Dad, you haven\u2019t left the message she\u2019s been waiting for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>Vanni just stared her father down for a long time, until he said, \u201cWhat?\u201d Then she got up, went to the mantel and pulled a framed five-by-seven picture from it. She handed it to her dad, who took it with his free hand while he held on to his sleeping grandson with the other.</p><p>\u201cRemember that?\u201d she asked as he looked at the picture.</p><p>It was one of Vanni\u2019s favorite pictures. Walt was wearing his mess dress, the military version of a tuxedo, and Peg was wearing a lovely, slim black gown and string of pearls that now belonged to Vanni. A smile found his lips. \u201cYour mother was such a beautiful woman. I was never good enough for her. You look like her, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Do you remember when that was taken?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe attended a lot of military functions. I saw your mother in that dress a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>She sat on the couch and leaned toward him, her elbows on her knees and her hands clasped. \u201cYou were on your way to dinner at the White House. Not one of those big gang dinners that the president and his wife pass through for five minutes, but the real deal. There were to be twelve couples\u2014all high-ranking generals and their wives. Mom was going to meet the first lady, get a tour of the private living quarters, have dessert with the first lady. She was very nervous. I remember her saying she was going to feel out of place\u2014she was a horsewoman, private pilot, gardener, skeet shooter, mother. But it was important to you, Dad. And she was proud of you, she would do anything to show how proud she was to be your chosen partner.\u201d</p><p>Walt\u2019s eyes glistened. It was easy for Vanni to do that to him. He stared at the picture of Peg, missing her still.</p><p>And missing Muriel so much.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cI think you know what you should say in the next message you leave for Muriel. It had better have your flight-arrival times in it, or you might be kissing goodbye the best thing that\u2019s happened to you in at least five years. The way I see it, if you could expect my mother to step up and do things that made her uncomfortable because it meant something to you, you\u2019d better do so for your current woman. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to lose her. And that makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>Walt lifted his eyes from the picture.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get the horses fed and the dogs watched,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>Mel Sheridan had a wonderful time taking a few digital pictures of Abby and Cameron to e-mail their mothers. The totally unexpected part was that Abby and Cameron started to get into it, and Mel was delighted. She, naturally, loved pregnant bodies, pregnant couples. She loved preserving the images for posterity.</p><p>She took her camera out to the cabin and shot a few pictures on the porch\u2014Abby leaning against the rail beside the red potted geraniums, Cam beside her. Then Cam behind her, his hands on her belly. Then Cam behind, hands on the belly, lips on her neck. Cam kissing the belly, while Abby\u2019s head was tilted back in a laugh. All the while, Cam was whispering things that made Abby smile, touch his face, kiss his head. And before they knew what was happening, Mel had coaxed them out of some of their clothes. It took hardly any doing, really. Soon they were topless, his hands strategically crossed or placed over naked breasts, the green of the forest and dappled patches of sunlight behind them. In one, buried behind them in the trees, a doe looked on.</p><p>They were a beautiful couple, magnificent photos, Cameron and Abby so obviously in love with each other and the babies that produced that unbelievable mound. Mel spent the morning loading the pictures into the computer and then onto a disk. Cameron and Abby selected a demure, fully clothed photo to send to the mothers, but Abby took the disk to Vanni\u2019s house to let her see them all.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cThese are incredible. Which one did you send to the mothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one.\u201d She pointed. A front view, clothed. \u201cThe rest we\u2019re keeping for our private collection, but I wanted to show you.\u201d</p><p>Just viewing the pictures, so intimate, so trusting, so in love, started something of a chain reaction. Vanni said, \u201cI want to throw you a shower,\u201d she said. \u201cJust our friends, not the entire town. Right away. Saturday afternoon....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world is it going to hurt?\u201d Vanni asked. \u201cStill pretending you\u2019re not pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that ship has sailed....\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Vanni laughed. \u201cGive up, Abby. Hardly anyone has all the details, but there isn\u2019t a person around here who doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re having these babies together. You live together, for God\u2019s sake. You go to doctor\u2019s appointments together. We\u2019ll just have a nice buffet, invite couples who already know just about everything. Those people who don\u2019t already know Cam\u2019s the daddy are pretty clear he intends to be. You don\u2019t have to say anything about it. Just come and enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to check with Cameron, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron?\u201d Vanni laughed. \u201cWould this be the Cameron who begged you to be his roommate so he could be at your beck and call? The same man who can\u2019t keep his hands off you in public? Oh, you\u2019re a riot. Pregnant women really are a little out of reality, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get your point....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just for good measure, we\u2019ll invite your mothers....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now wait just a minute,\u201d Abby said, gripping her belly as if it would fly away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cThey\u2019re both on deck to get down to Virgin River the second the babies come, right? They\u2019re not going to come now, for heaven\u2019s sake. Not on such short notice with the births imminent. It would be crazy.\u201d</p><p>Abby just kept shaking her head, but she picked up the phone and called Cameron at the clinic, running Vanni\u2019s plan by him.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cA shower would be fun for you. And Vanni\u2019s right\u2014our mothers aren\u2019t going to descend on us now.\u201d</p><p>So, Abby called her mother, Cameron called his. And both sets of parents commenced packing at once.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Abby moaned, leaning back on Vanessa\u2019s couch, rubbing her belly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wig out on me,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cThey have to meet sometime. Not only am I sure everything will be fine, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll like each other very much.\u201d</p><p>Cameron held Abby in his arms, in their bed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a nice weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for going low profile,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re having a party and introducing our parents to each other. Everyone is going to know.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and ran his hands over her belly. \u201cNothing low profile about this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very close to my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s like my best friend. But even though I\u2019m over thirty, I never could let myself tell her exactly how this happened. Just that I met someone and because of the divorce, we didn\u2019t continue to see each other. She wasn\u2019t happy about the fact that I didn\u2019t contact you, but at the same time I think she was afraid for me to contact you.... In case, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case I was a real bastard, like the first guy,\u201d he supplied. \u201cAnd what have you told her about us? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I met a wonderful man who cares about me and the babies....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not that I\u2019m the same man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell her now,\u201d he said. \u201cOr my mother will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed. \u201cDo you promise not to leave my side the entire weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to protect you from our mothers. My mother\u2019s very nice, in an extremely nosey, interfering sort of way.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd mine\u2019s very nice, in an extremely bossy, conniving sort of way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut both our fathers play golf,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThat will keep them busy all weekend, going over every course and every hole they\u2019ve ever played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our mothers? What do you suppose they\u2019ll be going over?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little kiss. \u201cI promise not to leave your side all weekend,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brie called Abby on the Thursday before the shower. \u201cI have an early baby gift for you. I was hoping this would come together in time. I received a very courteous phone call from none other than Ross Crawford himself. We spoke briefly. He wondered why you wouldn\u2019t be accepting any alimony, he wanted to know if you were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell him?\u201d Abby asked.</p> <p>\u201cSimply, you needed the alimony to pay off his credit-card debt, as ordered by the court, and once that debt was cleared, you preferred to support yourself, as you always had. And that you weren\u2019t married. I did do one thing\u2014I just couldn\u2019t help it. I said that, of course, you had no knowledge of the credit cards, never held them, hadn\u2019t signed for them, had never made a charge of any kind, were never issued copies of the statements, and that it was my opinion you shouldn\u2019t have been responsible in the first place. But what\u2019s done is done and you\u2019d like to move on now\u2014no hard feelings. And like the genius he is, he asked, what credit-card debt? I told him he\u2019d have to check with his lawyer\u2014it was part of the divorce settlement he signed. He said he\u2019d do that and as far as he was concerned, everything was resolved and he sends his best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis best?\u201d she laughed. \u201cHow nice of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to follow up my letter and our phone conversation with a letter stating that he wouldn\u2019t seek any further compensation from you, signed by him and not his legal staff, saying the matter is successfully closed. He did so, Abby. He couriered it to me. I didn\u2019t want to call you until I had the document in hand. It\u2019s resolved. The prenup is in your past. I\u2019ll make a copy for your file and give you the original. You can safely assume he\u2019s not after you for any reason. How does that feel?\u201d Brie asked.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say I felt ten pounds lighter,\u201d she answered, rubbing a hand over her round middle. \u201cBut I\u2019m very relieved. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be wonderful to have it behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel a little foolish. I wish I\u2019d talked to you about this situation the second I came to Virgin River. I had no idea it could just go away like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it didn\u2019t go away just like that. According to your settlement agreement, that bill had to be taken care of. But never panic, Abby. Just as Cameron said, things like this can usually be worked out. The only important thing now is that you and Cam can get on with your lives. Are you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel enormous. I haven\u2019t seen my feet in so long, I\u2019m not sure I still have feet. My back is killing me and I have a new mystery pain every day. And I don\u2019t know if word\u2019s gotten out, but our parents are coming down for the party this weekend. They\u2019ll meet each other. Ugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about the questions\u2014none of which I feel like answering. You know the ones\u2014how did this happen and when are you getting married?\u201d</p><p>Brie laughed. \u201cTell them your attorney advised you not to answer any questions right now. You have other things on your mind. Like making it through the shower without going into labor. What does Mel say about your progress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Mel and John and Cam, the delivery team? I see them every week. We just found out Cameron\u2019s dream has come true and baby number two is a girl\u2014one of each. Just what he hoped for. It\u2019s a good thing, too\u2014I doubt anyone\u2019s ever going to talk me into doing this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so, it sounds like things are going very well for you and Cameron. You make a nice team.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind you saying so. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re fooling anyone. We\u2019re nuts for each other. Love at first sight. Instant family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbby, that\u2019s just wonderful. I haven\u2019t known Cameron all that long, but I can\u2019t help thinking he\u2019s a great guy. And with this legal business behind you, your way is clear for a very happy family life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more immediate concerns. Brie, when you were this pregnant, did you have contractions all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been that pregnant. I just had one on the way, and when I got down to the last two months, I thought I was going into labor every day, but the contractions never got regular or obvious till D-day. And there was no mistaking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a little dilemma. I have too many cooks in the kitchen. John and Cam both want to induce at thirty-seven weeks, if I make it that long. Mel wants to wing it\u2014she likes Pitocin as a delivery tool when indicated, but she prefers her women to go into labor on their own. Everyone agrees, the babies are in position and ready to go. I think the docs want to control the environment while Mel wants to keep it as natural as possible. And I don\u2019t know which way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you having the babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital. Given the facts of lower birth weight, we\u2019re erring on the side of caution. Mel\u2019s good with that\u2014she delivered babies in a big-city hospital for years before coming out to the mountains. But the doctors want to monitor everything, and she wants me to have as pure an experience as possible....\u201d</p><p>Brie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out. In fact, the decision could be taken away from you\u2014you might beat them to the punch. You\u2019re not thirty-seven weeks yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose. I\u2019m dilated a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, cross your legs\u2014I\u2019m helping Vanessa cook for the shower!\u201d</p><p>By dinnertime the Friday night before the party, the McCalls and Michaelses were in Virgin River. Cameron made arrangements for both couples to have cabins at the Riordans\u2019 little resort along the river. Abby and Cameron met them there, introduced everyone, and as Cameron predicted, they were completely polite to each other.</p><p>Susan McCall was a small, roundish woman with short blond hair who had raised an only child and worked in community service her entire married life, everything from PTA to library to charity work for the poor. Her volunteerism in Seattle was every bit a full-time job. Beth Michaels had raised three children, Cameron being the oldest, while working as a dental hygienist. She was Susan\u2019s physical opposite, tall and thin with dark hair that framed her face. They were both strong, willful, energetic women in their late fifties. Primed to be grandparents.</p><p>During their getting-acquainted dinner at Jack\u2019s, Beth Michaels said, \u201cI was just wondering if you\u2019re ready to tell us how you met and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met by chance in Grants Pass,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cAbby was attending a wedding and I was having dinner in the same place with my partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Beth pushed.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I fell right in love, and after a little coercing, Abby fell in love right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d his mother admonished, \u201cthere were very few details in that account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, sipping from a water glass. \u201cHow about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your plans for marriage?\u201d Susan McCall asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the first to know, Mom,\u201d Abby answered.</p><p>The mothers exchanged glances while Abby and Cameron clasped hands and smiled at each other. As a united front, they were holding their own very well.</p><p>Abby and Cam took them on a tour of the clinic and showed them the cabin where they were living. Before they could fuss about the size or rustic quality of the place, Cameron assured them they\u2019d be looking for something larger after the babies were born and life had adjusted somewhat.</p><p>Vanessa, Brie and Paige planned a beautiful Saturday-afternoon party to take place at the general\u2019s house\u2014Vanni\u2019s deck and yard were not yet as she wanted them to be for a party. Outside on the general\u2019s deck the men could enjoy their cigars while inside, the women would have good food, beverages, gifts and lots of space to get acquainted. Vanni invited the Sheridans, June and John from Grace Valley and their spouses, Nikki and Joe from Grants Pass, Shelby and Luke and Art.</p><p>Nikki and Joe arrived early to help with the food and decorating\u2014the women hung pink and blue streamers around the dining-room table, along with balloons.</p><p>Unlike most of the other couples present, Cameron stayed close to Abby. He fetched her food from the buffet, refilled her water glass, cooed over the gifts as she opened them. There were wonderful little outfits, practical supplies, the special extras every young mother present had found to be essential.</p><p>Preacher and Jack had closed the bar for a few hours in the afternoon, but left their wives and little ones at the shower to get back in time for the dinner hour. Everyone had such a good time and the food and drink was so plentiful, the sun was setting before people started to drift off. Cameron loaded the gifts in his SUV to take back to the cabin and the crowd had thinned before Abby said, \u201cCam, where are our mothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, looking around. \u201cAsk your dad if he knows.\u201d</p><p>Ed Michaels had no idea. Chuck McCall couldn\u2019t say. It appeared the ladies had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou and I should talk without our kids or husbands,\u201d Beth Michaels had said to Susan McCall.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Susan had replied. \u201cBut there\u2019s a party going on. Think we can slip down to the stable or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we tell someone we\u2019re leaving?\u201d Susan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s just drift away.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThey can search the whole town in five minutes. No worries. We\u2019re going to the bar.\u201d</p><p>Susan smiled back. \u201cI like the way you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. There\u2019s a reason our kids get along so well.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later they pulled up to Jack\u2019s and went in. Jack was behind the bar and the look of shock on his face caused Beth to laugh lightly and whisper, \u201cWe\u2019d better be quick. Look at him. He\u2019s going to give us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat,\u201d Susan agreed.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Beth found an isolated corner of the bar out of the range of dining patrons and they hopped up on stools. Jack was there immediately, slapping down a couple of napkins.</p><p>\u201cLadies?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMartinis, I think.\u201d Then she looked at Susan, who nodded in agreement. \u201cDry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d Jack said, turning away to fetch drinks.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI know nothing. Cameron said he fell hard for a woman, but she had divorce complications. I had no idea he had a woman in his life. But it\u2019s absolutely clear he adores her. He loves her completely. Do you know anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how closely Cameron figured in this until a couple of days ago. Abby told me that this wonderful pediatrician she met in Virgin River was, in fact, the babies\u2019 father. First I heard of it. But you\u2019re right\u2014they\u2019re dead in love. And more pregnant than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d said Cameron\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you about the divorce, however. Nasty little piece of work. I was shocked Abby married him so quickly in the first place, and I think she was, too. We met him briefly\u2014he seemed okay. But...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d Beth encouraged.</p><p>Jack put a couple of drinks down for them and stood there for a second. Then when it was clear they weren\u2019t going to talk in front of him, he moved away.</p><p>Susan told the story of Abby\u2019s terrible, short marriage to a rock star, and the prenup that bound her and sent her into hiding, and the bills he dumped on her as she was trying to get out of it all.</p> <p>\u201cShe was only with him for a couple of months before he ran out on her?\u201d Beth asked, aghast.</p><p>\u201cThat about sums it up. Somewhere in there, before she signed her divorce papers, or maybe shortly after, she met Cameron,\u201d Susan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was Cameron at the time. I didn\u2019t know who it was and frankly, all I cared about was that my daughter be safe and content. All she wanted to do was clear that debt and get on with her life, but then she met Cameron again, when she was clearly pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Beth sipped her drink and shook her head. \u201cDear God, what if they hadn\u2019t seen each other again! Cam wouldn\u2019t know about the babies! And I wouldn\u2019t know about Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t know about Cameron,\u201d Susan commiserated. \u201cWhen she said she couldn\u2019t talk about how this all happened, I never imagined a wonderful man like Cameron being involved. Beth, our children are both a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan, they\u2019re not children. They\u2019re almost as old as we are.\u201d</p> <p>Susan giggled. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, are things cleared up now? With the divorce and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe divorce is long done and the other stuff\u2014who cares?\u201d Susan said. She lifted a hand to Jack for a couple more martinis. While he was mixing them, she said, \u201cChuck and I said we\u2019d get rid of that debt for her so she wouldn\u2019t have to go to such lengths. But Abby\u2019s proud. And stubborn. When she was growing up, there were so many times kids teased her, called her spoiled, being an only child and all. She wanted to clean up her own mess. If the debt wasn\u2019t bad enough, she\u2019d gone through everything she\u2019d saved just to get through the divorce. That man\u2014the ex-husband\u2014he was ruthless. I only met him that once. Really, he seemed harmless. I was so wrong. I never expected all he put her through.\u201d</p><p>Jack put down two more martinis for the matrons who didn\u2019t look at all like matrons. He lifted an eyebrow and one corner of his mouth and went away. They were locked in some serious conspiracy.</p><p>\u201cWell, then here we are,\u201d Beth said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of kids with a couple of kids on the way, and they clearly love each other. What are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>Susan took a sip of her martini. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not going to rest until I see them married.\u201d</p> <p>Beth threw back her head and laughed loudly, earning a glance from Jack. \u201cI love an ambitious woman. So, I have a favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll be zipping down here the second the babies come and I know the mother\u2019s mother gets special privileges. Let me come soon, please. I promise not to crowd the cabin and I\u2019ll do all the shit work without getting in the way.\u201d</p><p>Susan looked up at the ceiling, thinking. Then she glanced back at Beth. \u201cGive us three days. And I\u2019ll split the snuggling and shit work with you.\u201d</p><p>Beth put a hand on her arm. \u201cYou are a good woman. I made my son-in-law\u2019s mother wait a week.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed loudly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we stand a chance of getting them married before the babies come?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They seem to have made up their minds about certain things, not that they\u2019re sharing. And Abby\u2019s very stubborn when she\u2019s made up her mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe seems to be perfect for him. Everyone\u2019s entitled to a mistake here and there. Not to mention they have babies coming. Any second...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if we put our heads together....\u201d</p><p>The door to the bar opened and in came Ed Michaels, Chuck McCall, Abby and Cameron. They stood just inside the door and stared at Susan and Beth who had a couple of empty martini glasses apiece sitting at the bar.</p><p>\u201cJust what are you two up to?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>The women grinned largely and Beth said, \u201cJust getting to know each other, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Abby tugged on Cameron\u2019s sleeve to bring his ear down to her lips. \u201cI never once thought it might be worse if they liked each other,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be a pot of trouble.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and slipped a kiss on her lips. \u201cNothing we can\u2019t handle, baby. Stick with me.\u201d</p><p>Dan Brady didn\u2019t waste any time calling Cheryl. It wasn\u2019t that he thought he\u2019d met the perfect woman. Nor that he\u2019d met someone as screwed up as he was. It was purely that she was attractive, interesting and was at work on getting her head on straight\u2014a trait they seemed to share. Finding kindred spirits was rare enough that this was worth digging into.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t time for rent money,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I have to drive to Eureka to order flooring. I thought we could have coffee or something. Or lunch. Or early dinner. Maybe Denny\u2019s early-bird special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to take it easy\u2014that I wasn\u2019t sure I was breaking bread with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d get on your dance card before you\u2019re booked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking patty melt and fries. How about you?\u201d</p><p>And she actually laughed. That wasn\u2019t a bad start. With a much nicer attitude, she asked, \u201cWhat is it you think we can talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can talk about anything you want. I can probably tell you about home construction and remodeling in Virgin River, which is what I do. Or, if you\u2019re interested, I have a little experience in agriculture.\u201d Again she laughed. \u201cYou can always tell me about your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s the thing. I wait tables in a diner. Which is why dinner at Denny\u2019s doesn\u2019t hold great appeal. You understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do get that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s probably good. Why don\u2019t I get us a couple of big, messy sandwiches, a couple of bags of chips, a couple pickles, some iced tea, and we can meet in a park? Weather\u2019s damn nice right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI only have Saturday afternoons and Sundays off. Either one of those work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunday,\u201d she said. \u201cI start at 5:00 a.m. and finish up around two. I could shower off the grease and see you around three. There\u2019s a common in Old Town...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the place,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the lunch.\u201d</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t had anything that even vaguely resembled a date in years. At least six, maybe more like eight. He\u2019d had a conversation or two in a bar that went no place, because he didn\u2019t really want it to. So what was it about Cheryl? The crazy thing was, before he knew anything at all about her, she seemed so stable. Like she had lead in her shoes and wouldn\u2019t tip over during a big emotional wind. It made him laugh to himself. And then what does he learn from her? That she\u2019s struggling to get her life back and could be on shakier ground than he ever was. Well, that might be a stretch. Hardly anyone had been on shakier ground.</p><p>On Sunday he found her in the common in downtown Eureka. She got there ahead of him. She sat at a park bench, legs stretched out, face turned up to the sun, relaxing. Eyes closed. He stood in front of her until his shadow fell over her and she opened her eyes. And she didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>But he did. He put the sack of sandwiches and drinks on the bench between them. \u201cStill pretty unsure if this is a good idea, I guess. Cold cuts okay with you?\u201d</p><p>She accepted the tea first. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cTrusting is such an issue with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMet a lot of people along the way you couldn\u2019t trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure if that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not real relaxed about my program yet. I\u2019m always on the lookout for something that can trip me up, make me decide to take a drink. Because if one thing made it through all the cement in my head, it\u2019s that if I have one drink, I\u2019m probably going to die.\u201d Then she smiled a very contrite smile. \u201cIt was nice of you to do this. But I still can\u2019t figure out why, and that makes me tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheryl, I\u2019ve been divorced over six years. I\u2019ve had my own rocky time. I grew pot and went to jail. I don\u2019t have a lot of friends. I\u2019m just starting to make a few in town. And they\u2019re cautious, as they should be. I\u2019m probably not the safest bet. I mean, I know I am\u2014because I\u2019m totally clean. But given my history...I\u2019m not surprised that people...you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you think that I would be a good gamble, given I\u2019m the town drunk?\u201d She bit into her sandwich.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re not anymore. Maybe you were, but you\u2019re not. Haven\u2019t been for a good long time. Second, I didn\u2019t know squat-diddly about you when I suggested we share a meal sometime. I just plain liked your looks. Not your beauty\u2014although you really do have that. I liked that you looked sturdy. Solid and sensible. I know\u2014you explained, you don\u2019t necessarily feel that way. But you look it. I thought I\u2019d take a chance.\u201d He ate part of his sandwich, rinsed it down with tea. \u201cWhen I was a younger man, before a bad marriage and other things, I had a lot of friends. I haven\u2019t for a long time. I\u2019d like to get back to that. Have purpose. Friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have purpose now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cI\u2019m determined to take that old house from shit hole to quaint. I can do it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that enough of a purpose?\u201d she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cFor now, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s cut right to it. What the hell were you doing growing weed? Just explain that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell, that\u2019s almost the end of the story....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a whole sandwich to eat,\u201d she said. \u201cA big one, by the way. You must have thought I looked hungry or scrawny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you looked healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to go back a ways to get to all the whys. I\u2019ll try the condensed version. I worked construction for my dad south of here\u2014tough old son of a bitch, but a damn fine builder. I went in the Marines, for a change of lifestyle and benefits and...I thought I\u2019d like the life. I married a girl way younger\u2014I was twenty-seven and she was eighteen. Anyone with a working brain would look out for the problems with that, but not me. \u2019Course, being doubly stupid, I got her pregnant right off. I was sent to Iraq, where I was wounded and medically retired. By the time I recovered, she was already moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad. A son. He got sick when he was four. An unusual and fatal heart condition\u2014he was on the transplant list. My wife had already remarried and divorced a second time and in a stupid and desperate move, I decided I\u2019d grow pot for a fast-money turn and buy the kid a heart if I had to. I wasn\u2019t exactly rational. I didn\u2019t just grow a couple of rooms full of cannabis\u2014 I set up several grow sites with caretakers to watch \u2019em. I made a lot of money, just like I intended to, but it didn\u2019t do anything to help my boy. Cash,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWe named him Cash. What irony.\u201d</p><p>Cheryl was quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, regaining his composure and eating more of his sandwich. \u201cSo, I got caught. And I cut a deal. For a couple of years I fed the local cops information about growers I knew. By the way, if you tell that part around here, it could get me some attention from bad people. It\u2019s entirely up to you, what you decide to say, but that\u2019s a fact.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might be able to keep a lid on that. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. So, I got them some serious arrests, but I knew all along I was eventually going to have to either run or do time. I actually tried to run at the last minute, but I waited too long. I wouldn\u2019t have been good on the run\u2014that was never what I wanted. What I wanted was a real life. I\u2019d had an eye on a real life for years\u2014since I was eighteen or so. I wanted to bring home a paycheck, meet my buddies for a beer some Friday nights, throw the ball out front with my kid, have someone soft and cuddly next to me in bed and maybe even bring her home flowers for no reason once in a while. I was going to be a better builder than my dad, but what\u2019s more important, I was going to be a better husband and father. I mean, my old man thought it was real sharp to be strict and stern, but I got the idea early there might be a better way. I lost sight of that goal for a while. I was kind of screwed up and just practiced being a badass\u2014way worse than anything my dad ever was.\u201d</p><p>He crumpled up his sandwich wrapper.</p> <p>Cheryl was quiet for a while. She ate a little more, then folded what was left of her sandwich very neatly inside its wrapper. \u201cGood story,\u201d she said. \u201cI bet it took you months to make that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna try your story out on me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? You think that whole thing\u2019s a line? Like I\u2019m using my prison record to get in your pants or something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cStranger things have happened,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p> <p>\u201cI highly doubt it,\u201d he said. He stood up. \u201cI got arrested right here in Eureka. Call the sheriff\u2019s department and ask for Sergeant Delaney in Narcotics. Tell him you want to know how much of a liar I am before you ever talk to me again. You know where I live. I believe you have the number.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked out of the common, got in his truck and drove out of Eureka without ordering flooring for the house.</p><p>Dan had been through enough in the past few years that he didn\u2019t ponder her reaction for too long. He knew from the start, from the second he got back from Iraq, that things weren\u2019t going to be simple for him. And after he\u2019d crossed a bunch of lines, made himself a felon, he had very few expectations of people snuggling up to him. He didn\u2019t blame her one bit. He wasn\u2019t going to bother her again. He\u2019d call her to drop off rent money if he was going to be out her way, but other than that, she had no need to worry he\u2019d stalk her.</p><p>Tuesday night, while he worked in the kitchen of the old house, the phone rang. He stared at it for a second\u2014there were three possibilities. Wrong number, someone who didn\u2019t know the Creightons weren\u2019t there anymore or Cheryl. \u201cHello?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, on Sunday I\u2019ll bring the sandwiches,\u201d she said.</p><p>He laughed into the phone. \u201cSergeant Delaney must have given me a very bad report card or I wouldn\u2019t be hearing from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I had instincts, I\u2019d follow them. I think we might be two screwed-up people who aren\u2019t exactly good for each other. Maybe we should forget the whole idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cArgue with me a little, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI know what I\u2019m up to. You have to make your own decision. Your problems, such as they are, don\u2019t worry me much. Besides, they\u2019re yours. I\u2019ve been working on mine for years now. I\u2019m feeling pretty good. Sandwiches in the park or no sandwiches in the park.\u201d She was quiet. \u201cCheryl,\u201d he said seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t have expectations. It\u2019s just time for me to move toward people again. That\u2019s all. There was no 12-step program for what I had to deal with. It\u2019s been a long, dark night.\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cOkay. Three o\u2019clock. Same bench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Walt paid way too much money for his airfare to Montana, but there were only two options\u2014book his travel two weeks out at a cheaper rate or get the hell up to Montana, where Muriel waited for him, at any cost. He\u2019d called; he left the message: \u201cI\u2019m coming. I need to be with you.\u201d And after ignoring his calls for a week, she had called right back, \u201cOh God, I need you to be! Hurry!\u201d So the Friday after the shower at his house, Walt was on his way.</p> <p>Muriel gave him an address for the house she was staying in. He arrived in Missoula by three, rented a car and by four o\u2019clock he was in a little town smack between Butte and Missoula. He bought groceries and arrived at her house by five. It looked to be a small two-story with a dormer in an old-fashioned neighborhood. Children were riding bikes up and down the street, an elderly woman was kneeling in her front-yard flower bed, digging away; an old man sat across the street on his porch and Walt automatically gave him a wave. He waved back as if they were old friends.</p><p>I\u2019m a screwup, he thought. Muriel had told him the production had rented her a nice little house in an ordinary neighborhood, yet this was not at all what he expected. He shook his head. It was exactly as she had described, and yet he\u2019d assumed it would be flashier. He\u2019d wallowed in some weird self-pity because she\u2019d gone off to make a movie, forgetting that he knew her. Knew every inch of her. He\u2019d been disgracefully out of touch, not hearing her, not listening. When he complained he didn\u2019t know anything about movie people, he had no idea how correct he was.</p><p>The key was under the mat, just as she\u2019d said. There were a couple of rockers on the porch and he was tempted to just sit there a while and take in the neighborhood. It wasn\u2019t unlike the little house he grew up in, except they hadn\u2019t had a porch. Muriel would need a porch; she loved the outdoors. Did the neighbors bother her? he wondered. If she brought her glass of wine out here, did the neighbor women all converge on her to ask questions about that movie taking place just out of town in the shadow of glorious mountains?</p><p>He carried his groceries inside first and he almost laughed. A small dining room was just inside the door and a little farther ahead was the living room\u2014just big enough for a fireplace, sofa and two overstuffed chairs, a couple of side tables. The upholstery was old, faded floral. It was clean but old-fashioned and worn.</p><p>The kitchen cabinets were painted a faded pink, of all things. The sink was even pink, the appliances old and white. When he opened the refrigerator to put away his groceries, he found her celery, carrot sticks, cheese, sliced turkey breast and hummus. He smiled to himself as he unloaded salad makings, Chilean sea bass, rice, baby green beans, French baguette and butter, white wine and a bottle of Pinch.</p><p>Then he went for his suitcase and found the bedroom she used. He left his suitcase at the foot of her double bed. That was okay, he thought. He didn\u2019t intend to let much space get between them at night. He poured himself a drink and went out to the porch to wait. He\u2019d been in the country a long time; he\u2019d missed the sounds of a neighborhood in early evening. Children laughing and yelling, women talking over the fence, a lawn mower somewhere down the block, the slap of the newspaper on the front walk as the paperboy flew by on his bike.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before she drove up to the house, turning a rented truck into the driveway that led to a detached garage out back. He filled his eyes with her\u2014she looked exactly as she did when he drove up to her house back in Virgin River. Jeans, T-shirt covered by a denim shirt with the sleeves rolled up, boots, a cowboy hat. She walked toward him, he came down the porch steps and immediately put his arms around her. He gave her a nice little kiss and said, \u201cI shopped for our dinner. I\u2019ll cook for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be so wonderful. I could have showered out at the set, but I was in a hurry to see you. It\u2019s been long and sweaty and horsey. Let me shower off the grime, then I\u2019ll join you for a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Try not to take all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quick,\u201d she promised.</p><p>She went into the house, Walt following. She hung her hat on the antique rack just inside the door, sat to pull off her boots and headed for her room. He heard a door close and momentarily, the banging of old pipes as the shower turned on. He\u2019d already checked out the bathroom across the hall from her bedroom\u2014nothing in this house was remodeled. It had a claw-foot tub with a shower curtain.</p><p>He sat at the same old hat rack and pulled off his boots, placing them next to hers. He studied the sight and liked it. Her boots should be by his all the time. He walked down the hall to her bedroom, pulled his shirt out of his pants and off, laying it over the only chair in the room. And then, despite the noise of the shower, he heard something odd. Soft sounds, as if maybe she was singing off-key in the bathroom.</p><p>He pulled off his socks and pants and decided to join her, whether she liked it or not. He gave a knock, then let himself into the bathroom. When he pulled back the shower curtain, she had the washcloth over her face. \u201cMake room,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll wash your back. Then I\u2019ll wash anything else you have in mind.\u201d And he stepped into the tub.</p><p>She turned away from him and he knew\u2014something was wrong. He turned her back and pulled the cloth away from her face. It was hard to be certain with the water flowing over her, but he thought maybe she was crying. Muriel didn\u2019t cry. Not unless the director said, \u201cCry!\u201d</p><p>He wiped a big thumb under her eye. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cSilly,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel, honey, I\u2019ve seen you knee-walking tired after working on that house of yours. You saying movie work is even harder than that?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. She put her hand against his cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cBut we talked. You knew I was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean ever,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that if I didn\u2019t come to you, if I didn\u2019t live across the meadow, you\u2019d let days and weeks and months separate us if I wanted to work. I thought I was a convenience. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d meet me halfway.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her, slipped his arms around her naked body and pulled her against him. He lifted her chin with a finger and kissed her tenderly. \u201cI was foolish,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was the matter with me. I let that whole business of you being famous intimidate me. This won\u2019t happen to us again, Muriel. The next time we\u2019re in this situation, we\u2019re going to plan our weekends and days off together. I\u2019m just so damn happy I got a second chance. I knew you were pissed.\u201d He gave a shrug. \u201cBesides, you haven\u2019t been the least bit convenient. You\u2019re actually a lot of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t make the effort. Just for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for you? For God\u2019s sake, I\u2019m in love with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hoped. But then you grew so distant. I didn\u2019t know if you were in some kind of pout, or you were letting go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest\u2014I didn\u2019t want you to leave. It took you no time to spoil me, Muriel.\u201d He kissed her and ran a hand over her breast, the other sliding over her bottom and bringing her close. \u201cIt\u2019s a real spoiled man who just wants everything to stay the same.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cAnd if there are going to be any changes to the routine, the man gets to bring it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said I should fulfill all my ambitions, that you\u2019d be rooting for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that was the only decent thing to say, and I meant it. Until you left and I was missing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand, it had to be something important for me to give up the contentment I found with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that, Muriel. By the way, this is the part where you tell me you\u2019re in love with me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx us,\u201d she said. She gave a little hiccup of emotion. \u201cPlus, I miss my animals.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head, then lowered his lips to her breast, kissing. He ran a tongue over her nipple and lifted his head and looked into her eyes. \u201cI want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, I didn\u2019t cry over my last three husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always have to bring them up?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She smiled at him as her hand wandered. \u201cMaybe we should talk about the fact that even when I mention ex-husbands, you\u2019re hard as a baseball bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done with your shower?\u201d he asked. \u201cI might have the erection of a twenty-year-old right now, but if I try to do it in this tub, I could break my sixty-two-year-old back. And then I\u2019ll be no good to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that,\u201d she laughed. \u201cAnd really, to be completely honest, that\u2019s not the erection of a twenty-year-old. At least as I recall. Go with forty-year-old.\u201d She smiled and shrugged. \u201cAs I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. He put her hand on him. \u201cThat\u2019s solid steel, right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you. It feels like the first time I\u2019ve ever been in love. I don\u2019t want it to go away. I hate being here when you\u2019re there. I can handle little bits, but not long separations. I\u2019m happiest with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let this happen to us again, honey. I\u2019m not giving you up. And if any of those hotshot movie stars flirts with you, I\u2019m going to shoot him dead.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWalt, you just sweep me off my feet when you get all tender and talk murder like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more crying, honey. I love your smile. I love your smart-ass remarks, your laugh, the way you don\u2019t let me get away with anything. Now, come on, you dry me off and I\u2019ll dry you off and then we\u2019ll go at it like a couple of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>Walt had the weekend with Muriel. After dinner, they went back to bed. She put a DVD in her portable player and they watched half a movie before pausing it to make love again. In the night, she woke him for yet another. In the morning, sex was the first thing on his mind.</p><p>Muriel took him on a tour of the movie lot on Saturday, introduced him to a few people who were working, showed him her trailer. \u201cYou could as easily live here,\u201d he said, impressed. \u201cThis is a helluva RV.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, and there are nights we work late and I just shower and sleep here. But it\u2019s good to get away from all this commotion to decompress. I like that little house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo all the other actors live in little rented houses?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey all have different needs. A couple stay on the lot, some stay in hotels in Butte or Missoula. A lot of crew stays in the motor lodge at the end of town. And some crew brought families and their own RVs. There\u2019s something like a tent city on the other side of the lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fancy,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually. There\u2019s a lot of money wrapped up in this\u2014people are working hard to get the job done, and on time. Every day we spend here costs tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d</p><p>They spent Saturday afternoon touring the local area from the car, stopping off in some antique stores because it was an addiction of Muriel\u2019s. They ate in a diner in a town no bigger than Virgin River, bought a few things to take home for dinner and Sunday-morning breakfast, sat on the front porch with their glasses of wine and people waved to them as they walked by.</p><p>They visited a local stable and took a couple of gentle horses out along a mountain trail, walked along a local river holding hands and had long, seamless, almost endless talks about everything and everybody.</p><p>And then Monday morning arrived, in spite of the fact that both of them wished it never would. Muriel had to report to the set and Walt would drive back to Missoula and fly home. She had to leave the house before he did, so he walked her out onto the front porch to say goodbye.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a damn fast forty-eight hours,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tonight, though it could be late. It was wonderful having you here, even if it was only for a little while.\u201d She smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never had so much sex in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cEven when you were younger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be getting better with age,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m coming back for another round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m going home and making airline reservations for a couple of weeks from now, so put it on your calendar. And I\u2019m going to keep coming back often until this godforsaken movie shit is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be bad luck on my Oscar for you to refer to it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope your next movie isn\u2019t filmed in some Middle Eastern desert\u2014I\u2019ve seen enough of those in my life.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cMy next movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you decide to retire for real after this one, I can live with that,\u201d he said, grinning. He ran a knuckle along her cheek. \u201cDid we talk about everything? Anything lingering out there we didn\u2019t cover?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWell, there\u2019s that one thing that kind of goes with I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you want to get married, I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s okay. As long as I have your naked body up against mine on a very frequent basis, I\u2019ll get along. I\u2019m leaving the whole issue completely up to you, Muriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Walt?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with marriage. I liked it, it worked for me. No boogeymen or curses as far as I\u2019m concerned. Whatever you decide you want to do, either way I\u2019m claiming you. Don\u2019t try to wiggle out of it. It\u2019s a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get out of it. I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d he corrected. \u201cPassionately. Desperately. Insatiably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel twenty-one,\u201d he said. \u201cHonest to God. And when the fabulous sex simmers down a little, you\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve had in a long time. Muriel, you\u2019re not a convenience. I\u2019d walk across a mile of cut glass in my bare feet to hold your hand and talk to you for one hour. You\u2019re everything to me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply and her eyes glistened a little. \u201cI\u2019d better go before I give up the only Oscar of my lifetime by playing house with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me I\u2019m everything to you, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDamned if you aren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cNow kiss me in a way that will hold me for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of took you by surprise, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he teased. \u201cAdmit it, you didn\u2019t think this would turn out to be so much, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt, the second I saw you blush when you asked if I was married, I knew. And I wanted you. Right then. Right there. Sweaty and naked on the trail.\u201d</p><p>That made his smile huge. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t wanted something like that in a long, long time,\u201d she said, smiling. Then she rose on her toes and planted a big sloppy one on his lips, holding him close. \u201cI adore you,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll count the seconds until you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Cheryl brought sandwiches to the park the next Sunday afternoon and Dan brought them the Sunday after that. It didn\u2019t take them long to fully share their unfortunate pasts. When Cheryl began telling him about when she started drinking heavily as a teenager, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me all this, you know. It doesn\u2019t make any difference to me. I like having a picnic with you because of who you are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you opposed to hearing it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. But you don\u2019t have to run it by me to see if I\u2019m going to stick or run scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019ve told the story so many times, I can do it in my sleep. That\u2019s what we do at AA\u2014tell our stories. It\u2019s kind of amazing how we can still find new things in the old story after months. After years.\u201d</p><p>So he listened. It started in high school and just got worse and worse until by the time she was in her mid-twenties, she was drunk most of the time. Then she told about Mel Sheridan coming for her one morning, carting her off to a treatment program right in Eureka and now she couldn\u2019t let herself get very far away.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a good woman there,\u201d Dan said of Mel. \u201cThat man of hers, now, there\u2019s a piece of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Cheryl asked. She laughed. \u201cOh, I had a bad thing for Jack, back when I was drinking. Bad. I\u2019d have followed him anywhere!\u201d</p><p>Dan picked up her hand and held it. \u201cYou over that now?\u201d</p><p>She got a strange look on her face. \u201cListen, I can\u2019t handle anything more complicated than friendship....\u201d</p><p>He gave the hand a squeeze and smiled. \u201cTry not to get ahead of me, Cheryl. I don\u2019t have anything complicated in mind. This is all I\u2019m looking for\u2014Sunday picnics with a nice woman, maybe a little handholding sometimes. Maybe we\u2019ll get closer down the line, maybe we\u2019ll just be friends who have a sandwich and tea. This is okay, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she said doubtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t had a regular, normal, healthy relationship that I can remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary wonderful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t making any fast moves, and it was extremely deliberate and well thought out. He didn\u2019t call during the week except to be sure they were on for Sunday. It wasn\u2019t just because she was so skittish\u2014it was also him, cautious. After a wife leaving him and a son dying was followed by a stint in jail, he wasn\u2019t at all interested in a relationship that was going to suck the life out of him. All of a sudden, after all the healing he\u2019d had to do, he was real reluctant to threaten what turned out to be peace of mind.</p><p>His recovery had been a long, arduous one. He came home from Iraq wounded and with some emotional issues, a lot like young Rick now. In fact, from the time he left for Iraq until he was released from prison, it had been one excruciating journey. Well, he was barely coming out of a long, dark tunnel. He wasn\u2019t going to throw it away by moving too fast with a woman who had her own recovery to worry about.</p><p>But he liked her. She was cool and didn\u2019t know it. When she could let go of that whole town-drunk thing, they talked about when they were real young kids and what they thought they\u2019d grow up to be. Dan had always liked to build, but he thought he\u2019d be building race cars. Cheryl loved animals, but never had a pet growing up. She had wanted to be a veterinarian, but in fact had barely finished high school. Their jobs right now were real mundane, construction and waiting tables on the early shift in a diner, yet just filling in the blanks for each other could soak up at least a couple of hours. They talked about the people they dealt with on the job and friends of theirs. Cheryl had a whole network of friends through AA who\u2019d become her lifeline and Dan claimed some of his newer acquaintances from Virgin River.</p><p>He filled her in on Rick\u2014Cheryl had known Rick since he was about two. \u201cHe\u2019s really struggling with all his stuff\u2014the war, the amputation, the girlfriend, the body image\u2014you name it. He has a smorgasbord of crap to deal with. I keep looking for an in to tell him we could talk about some of that stuff. I\u2019ve been there, man. But he\u2019s got me at arm\u2019s length. He\u2019s not letting anyone close. I think it\u2019s killing Jack slowly.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t have to get much beyond that second Sunday lunch before laughter was as natural for them to share as the stories of their hard times, their daily lives, their gossip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Really, he didn\u2019t care if it was only Sundays for a long time. He found himself looking forward to them. And he kept it his secret that he was growing more attracted to her. She was so vulnerable, he decided right away that he\u2019d give her any opportunity to move closer, but he wouldn\u2019t rush her at all. There was no question, she\u2019d run for her life.</p><p>There was something about a Friday-night dinner at the bar that called to Dan, even though he was on the job bright and early every Saturday morning. Paul had deadlines and Dan was giving his best effort to helping meet them.</p><p>Maybe it was memories of his younger years when he\u2019d either meet with the crews he worked construction with or maybe the Marines he\u2019d served with, but he rarely missed a Friday night at Jack\u2019s. He\u2019d have a cold one before dinner, often with Jack and Paul at the bar. Hope almost always made an appearance, looking pretty ratty and cranky. After a whole five days of physical therapy and counseling, Rick Sudder had a real need for that Friday-night wind-down. And Jack let him have a beer. One.</p> <p>And there was another development in the bar.</p><p>Every Friday night since the unfortunate fleeing incident, Liz would come in by herself, right around five o\u2019clock. She\u2019d ask Jack for a giant cola to go. Dan had learned that Liz came to Virgin River every Friday after school, stayed the weekend to help her aunt out in the store and went home to Eureka Sunday evening.</p><p>And Rick was always there. It wasn\u2019t like Liz wouldn\u2019t know that.</p><p>Liz always stared straight ahead while she waited for her cola; Rick glanced at her without saying hello, without acknowledging her. She never looked at him either, but when her cola was delivered, she flashed that beautiful smile of hers right at Jack, put her money down and left the bar, ignoring Rick.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t have to wonder long if that was eating at Rick. He was sitting two stools down from the kid. Paul stood at the bar beside Dan and they were talking about one of the houses under construction. Dan saw the whole routine go down. And he knew that just that smile alone, let alone that face that could stop traffic, must have been driving Rick crazy. He had to be one messed-up dude to let her go. To her back as she was leaving, Rick said, \u201cCan\u2019t you even say hello?\u201d</p> <p>She slowly turned, regarded him coldly and said, \u201cTo you? Not till you grow up.\u201d And then she left.</p><p>Dead silence hung over the bar as Rick returned to his beer. He stared into it for a while, then he pushed it back and stood up. He used a cane, but didn\u2019t really need it. He had a very slight limp, but it was getting better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you home,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014I got it! I\u2019m fine!\u201d Rick barked.</p><p>Jack stopped. He stayed behind the bar. \u201cGreat,\u201d he said to Rick\u2019s back.</p><p>It was a long moment before Dan said, \u201cThat\u2019s a powder keg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see any improvement in his attitude? He getting along any better at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one drop,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the good prosthesis now\u2014no more preparatory limb. He could be doing a lot better than he is. Attitude is holding him up. He\u2019s just plain pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd the girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe decided she could do better and broke it off with her. For a while there I was more worried about her. I thought it would half kill her. But now what we got is a different situation. She\u2019s obviously done taking his shit. He dumped her when, not only does he need her, she needs him. And now what we have are two pissed-off, hurting kids who have been through way too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been looking for just the right moment,\u201d Dan began. \u201cI could maybe talk to him. I took a bad load of shrapnel in the leg and got medically retired from the Corps. I went through a lot of painful PT and can\u2019t ever trust the leg again.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cI thought maybe I saw a limp sometimes....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and then,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t do rooftops or ladders, as I informed the boss here,\u201d he said, lifting an eyebrow to Paul. \u201cOne minute I\u2019m upright, the next I can be on my ass. You learn to live with it. But I remember having a very bad time getting there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think turned you around? If you don\u2019t mind my asking,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I had about twenty things that were no good going on all at once,\u201d he replied, shaking his head. \u201cI had a young wife. She left me while I was in country. There was illness in the family. I was screwed up on so many levels. And it didn\u2019t help that my leg hurt all the time. I think after a while I got tired of being on a constant downward spiral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a question. It\u2019s real personal, but there\u2019s a reason I have to know the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you suicidal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can tell you, no. I whimpered for a long time, then I got fighting mad. But then, I didn\u2019t exactly take the most law-abiding route to fighting back. Not a good choice for me, but there you have it. You worried he\u2019s suicidal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know when to worry about something like that,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything to me that makes me think that. But Jesus, he hasn\u2019t said much of anything at all. The kid\u2019s just tough as hell to read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always ask him,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you ask that question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say, \u2018Hey, Rick, I can\u2019t help but notice you\u2019re in terrible shape. Are you having any suicidal thoughts? I have to know.\u2019 About half the time if you ask the straight question, you get the straight answer.\u201d</p><p>Jack pondered this for a long moment. \u201cYou know, Brady, you ended up surprising me. I gotta say, I never thought I\u2019d be having a conversation like this with you. All touchy-feely and honest.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cI love you, too, Jack,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rick wouldn\u2019t even admit to himself that the counseling appointments being crammed down his throat had a payoff. There wasn\u2019t any sane reason for it, either. First of all, Jerry Powell was certifiable. Second, Rick didn\u2019t feel like talking about his issues. Third, he dreaded every one and he left exhausted\u2014wrung dry and shaky.</p><p>But, these hour-long sessions seemed to have a bizarre calming effect about two hours after they were over. Once he started opening up about his feelings a little bit, it came easier. Every time he walked in Jerry Powell\u2019s door he\u2019d say to himself, \u201cI\u2019m not telling him anything personal today.\u201d And then that whack job would ask exactly the right question.</p><p>\u201cHow are you sleeping?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s disturbing your sleep?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLots of things,\u201d Rick said. \u201cIraq. Leg pain. Stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s start at the beginning. We\u2019ve talked about Iraq\u2014want to go over some of that for me again? As it pertains to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you having nightmares? PTSD stuff\u2014pictures in your head you can\u2019t turn off? How\u2019s it affecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I have nightmares, yeah. I guess I\u2019m going to have them forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s your prerogative, but here\u2019s how counseling usually works. If you can bring it out in the light of day, take a good look at it, sometimes your mind helps you deal with it on a conscious, rational level as opposed to subconscious level, and the nightmares fade. So, my specific question is\u2014what nightmares are you having? Iraq in general? A specific incident? Your injury?\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head to try to shake the question away, but it didn\u2019t work. When he looked at Powell, the therapist was waiting. Expectant. \u201cThere was a thing that happened that I can\u2019t get rid of. The squad in front of us blew up. Eleven of them died with one survivor. Sometimes I dream I\u2019m the survivor. I\u2019d rather blow up than be the survivor. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw them die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were blown apart everywhere, right in front of us. It was a wide-awake nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Rick saw Jerry wince and it gave him perverse pleasure. Yeah, it was about the ugliest sight a guy could witness.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you see in your nightmares?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. I killed a guy in Iraq, and I saw his face. It was really too far away for this to be possible, but I swear I saw the expression on his face. It was like he saw me shoot him. Sometimes I dream about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that something you worry about? Regret or lose sleep over? How does it work on your head?\u201d</p><p>Rick thought for a minute. \u201cI don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. But I wonder how it wasn\u2019t me who was shot. Killed. We were aiming at each other and I was the lucky one. We didn\u2019t find his body\u2014there\u2019s a chance he lived through it. But I don\u2019t see how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the incident in which you were wounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s lucky,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re kept awake by it, haunted by it, like it\u2019s trying to surface....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like that. It\u2019s a blank. One minute I was walking down a street, the next minute I was waking up in Germany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the pain? Shouldn\u2019t you be ahead of the pain now? It\u2019s been a while. And you have medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s jump right ahead to \u2018stuff.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said, Iraq, pain, stuff.\u201d</p><p>Rick smiled. \u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t take notes, you have a dangerous memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d he asked again without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I think about my old girlfriend a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about her how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty smart, actually. I can probably get through this,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s giving me a hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates me.\u201d</p><p>Jerry waited patiently, irritating Rick.</p><p>\u201cI knew it was going to be hard on her, telling her we couldn\u2019t be a couple anymore. I figured there\u2019d be tears and stuff. But then she\u2019d get over it. I knew it would take a while, but then some guy would ask her out or something. Eventually she\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this is keeping you awake at night?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know, this isn\u2019t easy on me, either,\u201d Rick snapped. \u201cStaying away from her isn\u2019t exactly simple. But it\u2019s better this way.\u201d</p><p>Jerry leaned forward. \u201cListen, I think you\u2019re going to have to try to be more specific. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following. We\u2019ve talked about the girlfriend before and as I understand it, you explained to her that you couldn\u2019t be her boyfriend anymore and that upset her. Correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d he answered tightly.</p><p>\u201cAnd now she\u2019s angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Rick said, shaking his head. \u201cI go to Jack\u2019s every Friday afternoon for about an hour or so. After a week of PT and you, I\u2019m wrecked, so Jack lets me have a beer and some dinner. She comes to the bar every week, knowing I\u2019m going to be there, and she won\u2019t look at me. I mean, she won\u2019t even accidentally see me. Won\u2019t speak to me. Smiles pretty at everyone else and it\u2019s like I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p><p>Jerry tilted his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be her boyfriend anymore,\u201d he pointed out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t be. It\u2019s no good that way. For her. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me get this right,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cYou told her you\u2019re through\u2014you two cannot be together. Sounds like maybe she believes you. Did you expect her to be a little more gracious about it?\u201d</p><p>Rick glared through narrowed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart-ass, you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, that\u2019s not my intention at all. I\u2019m really trying to understand what about this is off. What about this is costing you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could say hello,\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible she\u2019s angry with your decision to break it off with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no shit! She even told me to grow up, like I\u2019m being a real baby about having my leg blown off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say that?\u201d Jerry asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but that\u2019s what she meant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m certain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you exactly why she thought you should grow up?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>\u201cListen to me! She didn\u2019t have to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see, I think. So, her apparent anger with you is costing you sleep?\u201d</p> <p>He hung his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d he said softly, temporarily defeated. \u201cIt\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t get that it hurts me, too. It\u2019s hard to stay away from her, hard not to be with her. For a long time, like four years, Liz was my whole life. I mean, everything. I was totally faithful to her while I was away from her. And she was faithful to me. She was a virgin before we...you know? She liked to tell me all the time that even though it worked out to be so hard, with the baby and everything, she was still glad that I was the first and she wanted me to be the only one. For a long time I wanted that, too.\u201d He lifted his head. \u201cI miss her a lot, you know. I miss everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d Jerry probed.</p><p>\u201cThat whole life I used to have\u2014everything. Jack and Preacher, good times, hunting and fishing, laughing at every stupid thing. It was great watching Jack get in trouble with his wife and she\u2019d dress him down good. And he\u2019d backpedal like mad.\u201d Rick laughed in spite of himself. \u201cWe\u2019d go fish and if I hooked something, he couldn\u2019t stay out of it\u2014he\u2019d be all over me, telling me what to do, like I\u2019ve never been fishing before. Once he got into it with Preach\u2014he got right in Preacher\u2019s business and told him not to get involved with this woman....\u201d Rick laughed and shook his head. \u201cPreacher took Jack out! I didn\u2019t think anyone could get a punch off on Jack\u2014Jack\u2019s a fast guy, and powerful. Preacher knocked him flat. I saw Jack\u2019s shiner\u2014it was awesome. And Preacher married that woman\u2014Paige.\u201d</p><p>It was silent in the office for a while.</p><p>\u201cI used to be part of everything that went on there. Now I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Jerry asked, \u201cDo you feel abandoned by your friends?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI cut \u2019em off. Really, I\u2019m a goddamn curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone tell you that?\u201d Jerry asked.</p> <p>He shook his head again. \u201cThey tell me that\u2019s not true, but it kind of looks like it is, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Rick sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over all this,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cAbout a hundred times. Bad things happen to people I get close to. I laid it out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recall,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about your anger.\u201d</p><p>Rick leaned back in his chair and huffed at Jerry like he was just plain ridiculous. \u201cGimme a fucking break here, Powell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014you don\u2019t feel like talking about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally pissed off. Like this is news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m all too aware. I\u2019m wondering, if you talked about it a little more, if it might become apparent that these decisions you\u2019re making to cut the important people out of your life, are driven by that anger. Rather than by sound reason. I wonder if the anger over what your war experience and injury have cost you is clouding some of your judgment in these issues. Maybe you\u2019re just so goddamn angry, you want to hurt yourself even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I shouldn\u2019t be angry?\u201d he asked, tears sparkling in his eyes. Tears that Jerry knew Rick would not let fall.</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, Rick. Anyone would be angry. But it\u2019s up to you whether you drive the anger or the anger drives you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means, you have a right to your anger. Every right. So what we should look at is\u2014what is the object of your anger? Jack? Your old girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at them, man. Well, if I\u2019m mad it\u2019s only because they want everything to be all right, and it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. How much of your anger do you direct at yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Jerry shrugged. \u201cWhy would you? Good question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not mad at myself. I\u2019m doing what has to be done, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, asshole, I have to cut Liz loose, before she wastes her whole life on me. And she would, she\u2019s that kind of girl. She hasn\u2019t gotten much good from me so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, do you have any respect for anyone?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you respect Liz, for example?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. If I didn\u2019t respect her I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you did respect her, you\u2019d probably assume she could make her own choices. I\u2019ve suggested this before, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you listen to anything?\u201d Rick demanded.</p><p>\u201cRaptly,\u201d Jerry answered. \u201cYou are doing what you think has to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept, what if you\u2019re just plain angry about the way things went in Iraq? What if the actions you\u2019re taking are a greater punishment on you than anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bullshit,\u201d Rick said, wiping impatiently at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat life you miss, Rick? It\u2019s right where you left it. But you\u2019re too angry and afraid of disappointment to let yourself return to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be stupid,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, and I\u2019m not just afraid of a little disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say little,\u201d Jerry pointed out. \u201cIn your case, weighing in combat, disability, death, I\u2019d say the disappointment is substantial. Life altering.\u201d</p><p>Rick ground his teeth. Okay, so what if that was true\u2014he was afraid that if he assumed he could slip back into his old life, he\u2019d not only let everyone else down, but it would kill him to see any of them hurt any further? \u201cYou are the most annoying jerk I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he said to Jerry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dirty job,\u201d Jerry said with a shrug. \u201cSince our time is nearly up, I\u2019d like you to think about that for next time\u2014that you\u2019re angry and afraid, which is reasonable, and also potentially destructive. If we can explore where that anger is directed, for next time, maybe we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where the fucking anger is directed!\u201d Rick nearly shouted. \u201cAt everything that happened for the last twenty years! My parents, my girl, my baby, my war!\u201d</p><p>Jerry gave him a second. Then he said, \u201cYourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rick insisted. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Jerry did not look at his watch or break eye contact to look at the clock. Finally, in a low voice he asked, \u201cDid you let them all down, Rick? By getting wounded and disabled?\u201d Rick looked at four or five different points around the room, looking high, like the answer would be in the ceiling of Jerry\u2019s little office. \u201cIf this hadn\u2019t happened to you,\u201d Jerry went on, \u201cwould you be able to pick up where you left off, carry on, with your best friends and your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are totally nuts,\u201d Rick said, but the tears that always gathered in his eyes began to roll down his cheeks and he swiped at them.</p><p>\u201cDoes the anger drive you or do you drive the anger?\u201d Jerry repeated. \u201cAre you mad at yourself because you got hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just stupid,\u201d Rick said, but he said it more softly. Then he put his face in his hands and his shoulders shook a little. It was a full minute before he lifted his head and turned glassy eyes at Jerry. \u201cFace it. If it hadn\u2019t happened, things would be all different. It was like the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I might have never seen that it\u2019s all on me, that I\u2019m the one\u2014\u201d And then he put his face in his hands again.</p><p>Jerry let him simmer for a while, pretending not to cry when he was actually coming apart. He knew Rick wouldn\u2019t reach for a tissue, that would be too telling. His shoulders trembled, but Jerry could hear the desperate mewling sounds of a man trying not to give in. When things calmed down just a little, he spoke. \u201cRick, there are some facts that have nothing to do with you that eventually you have to accept. One\u2014a drunk driver caused your parents\u2019 deaths. One hot little sperm and one determined little egg made your baby on the first strike. Most of the stillbirths recorded have no known cause\u2014a very tragic statistic. And\u2014someone threw the grenade that took you out. Everything could have been different, but there was nothing you could have done to make it so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d he asked, lifting his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get much satisfaction from blaming yourself. You\u2019ll keep going in circles because you\u2019re faultless. You\u2019ve had some rough deals, but you\u2019ve also had some extremely lucky events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Like?\u201d</p><p>Jerry kept his gaze level. \u201cOh, let\u2019s see. A grandmother, by your account a very good woman, who devoted her life to you. A couple of outstanding mentors who stepped in to father you, support you, teach you. A girlfriend... Not many men find a girl, at such an early age, with the kind of commitment you described to me. And then a few traumatic things happened that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d let them down like this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the Marines would work for me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t feel let down. Maybe you got things from the Marines that are valuable, just muddy right now because of the trauma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it,\u201d Rick said, sounding weaker. \u201cThat stuff can\u2019t happen. We\u2019re trained, alert. It\u2019s not just one pair of eyes, it\u2019s a unit. That\u2019s how we got to be the strongest force in the free world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnexpected things happen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d Rick said. \u201cIt was hostile, and our job is to evade hostile attack. I finished every training gig first in my group. First...\u201d</p><p>Jerry paused. \u201cThe stuff that happened wasn\u2019t your fault. Some bad, unfortunate things do happen to people without their participation. Like a wheel falling off a car, even though all the lugs were tight. Like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry,\u201d Rick said, glassy-eyed, stopping him. \u201cAll the wheels fell off this car.\u201d</p><p>Jerry leaned forward. \u201cRick, focus for just a second. Listen to me. I\u2019m a crisis counselor\u2014do you know what that means?\u201d Rick stared blankly at him, but he went on anyway, knowing he might have to repeat this more than once. \u201cIt means that when a crisis occurs in the life of a perfectly normal person, I have the training to take that person by the hand and lead them through the fire and out the other side, where once again they\u2019ll feel like a perfectly normal person who has dealt with trauma. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here, Rick. You and me. We\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rick was quiet for a long time.

There was no court today, so she was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. It was a good day to catch up on paperwork. She sat at her desk in the office attached to her home, little Ness asleep in her swing beside the desk, when there was a knock at the office door.</p><p>She knew at once this was probably a business call as opposed to a friend dropping by. There was a front door to her house as well as an external office door, beside which a sign was mounted that read, Brie Valenzuela, Esquire. That door was always kept locked when she was alone and not expecting anyone. She went to the door and looked out the peephole. There was a man there, mid-thirties or so. The fact that he wasn\u2019t scary looking didn\u2019t influence the way Brie handled things. \u201cJust a minute,\u201d she said.</p><p>She moved Ness, swing and all, through the door that led from her office into the kitchen, without waking her. Then she closed the door adjoining her office to the house. Having been both a criminal prosecutor and the victim of a violent crime, Brie never relaxed her standards, not even in Virgin River. She tucked her Glock into the rear waistband of her jeans and opened the door. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Brie Valenzuela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He put out his hand. \u201cRoss Crawford. How do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is unexpected,\u201d she said, accepting the hand. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d she asked without inviting him farther into her office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find Abby,\u201d he said. \u201cShe sold her town house, and her parents refuse to tell me where she is or deliver a message to her. The airline would only tell me she took an extended leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to forward a message. Would that help?\u201d Brie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI really need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Brie took a breath. \u201cMr. Crawford,\u201d she said patiently, not at all oblivious to the fact that he didn\u2019t look like a rock star. \u201cI\u2019m sure you realize that from this point on, your attorneys should do the talking. Your divorce has been final for some time and the settlement is satisfied.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not about that exactly,\u201d he said. He wore expensive jeans, no rips or tears or chains, a flawless white button-down rolled up at the sleeves, Italian boots. His hair was a bit on the shaggy side, attractively so and curling at his collar, and he was clean shaven. \u201cIt\u2019s personal stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the same, Mr. Crawford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call me Ross. Listen, I understand if you don\u2019t want to tell me where she is\u2014she wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with me now. But if you could please contact her and tell her I\u2019d like just a few minutes of her time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brie said. \u201cAnd where should I deliver her answer? That business manager\u2019s address in Los Angeles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cCould you call her now, please? I\u2019m sure you have the phone number. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr.... Ross, I don\u2019t think you should be too optimistic. Honestly, my advice to her will be that she decline. As I said, the conversation should be between\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttorneys, I know. What do you think got us into this mess? This doesn\u2019t have to do with divorce or settlements or\u2014 Well, it has a little to do with it. It\u2019s my amends, Ms. Valenzuela. I have to make amends. It\u2019s one of my steps. I\u2019m trying to graduate from a treatment program.\u201d</p><p>Brie folded her arms over her chest. She wasn\u2019t about to be reeled in by a smooth-talking addict. \u201cAnother one?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThird time,\u201d he said, lifting his chin and straightening. \u201cI\u2019m a real hard sell. If you\u2019ll please call her and ask her if she\u2019ll give me fifteen minutes of her time, I\u2019ll never bother her again. Believe me, I know I\u2019m asking a lot. The rule is, make amends where it won\u2019t make the life of the person you\u2019re apologizing to more difficult. And the list is long. So long. I\u2019ll meet her somewhere neutral if she\u2019d like. You can be there\u2014it wouldn\u2019t change what I have to say. Please?\u201d</p><p>Brie took a breath. \u201cDo you mind waiting in your car? I should have some privacy for the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Listen, please tell her I don\u2019t want to upset her life in any way. I swear I\u2019ll leave her alone after this. And really, tell her, I\u2019m an idiot, a fool, an addict and imbecile, but I\u2019ve always been nice when I\u2019m clean. I\u2019m fair. She\u2019ll remember that. Hand to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Crawford,\u201d Brie said sternly. \u201cBe prepared. The answer could be no. In which case you\u2019ll have to complete your steps without her assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, hanging his head, \u201cI hope she\u2019ll see me. If only for a few minutes. I\u2019d like both of us to be able to get this behind us so we can move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell her you said that,\u201d Brie promised. \u201cExcuse me now.\u201d</p><p>Brie sent him back down the walk to his car. She took a deep breath, checked on the baby first and when Ness was found sleeping contentedly, she called Abby at the cabin. She explained everything Ross had said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s included in his amends, Abby, and I don\u2019t want you unnecessarily upset. I\u2019m not sure I recommend this, even though I\u2019m all for working through domestic disputes and laying them to rest, if there\u2019s a mediator present. I can serve in that capacity, unofficially. Or, it\u2019s perfectly all right to decline this request. In fact, I could tell him that you\u2019ll reconsider in a few months\u2014that right now is not a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know he never once took my calls when I wanted to know what was going on with him? When I wanted to discuss the terms his lawyers set forth? I wish I wasn\u2019t curious. The fact is, I\u2019d like to know what he has to say about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very pregnant. I don\u2019t want you back in court because of some egregious prenup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have this letter saying it\u2019s over. Right? I\u2019ll see him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut only if you\u2019ll be present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me and the baby here,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI can\u2019t reach Mike. Would you be comfortable bringing Cam? If not, I\u2019ll call Jack. He\u2019d come out. Just to hedge against any kind of reaction that you and I and little Ness can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think Cameron would miss this for anything,\u201d Abby said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s tied up with patients, I\u2019ll stop by the bar and grab either Jack or Preacher.\u201d</p><p>Brie took a couple of minutes to brew coffee, change the baby, fix up a bottle that would keep her quiet and then, after a good fifteen minutes had passed, with the Glock stowed away again and Ness on her hip, she opened the door to signal Ross from his car. \u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d she told him when he came up the walk.</p><p>\u201cAh. She is here, then.\u201d</p><p>Brie tilted her head. \u201cWith all your resources, you probably could have learned that on your own, without coming to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been too much of that sort of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I just sit over there and wait?\u201d he asked, indicating the sofa and chair in the corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cSure. What do you mean, there\u2019s been too much of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, my manager hired people to keep my back. It was supposed to be for the crazies, you know? I get \u2019em sometimes. Abby\u2019s not crazy. She\u2019s just a nice girl who got hooked up with a wrong guy.\u201d</p><p>Brie shook her head sadly. \u201cTurns out we agree on some things,\u201d she said, going back to her desk. She sat in her chair and gave the baby a bottle while Ross opened a thick spiral notebook, pulled out a pen, flipped it open and began writing. After a few minutes he looked toward Brie and Ness and said, \u201cHow old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you manage a baby and lawyering?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small town,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m seldom overworked. Which is how I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you meet Abby?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was referred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she had a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d Brie asked, although she knew. Brie was of the opinion her former attorney hadn\u2019t helped her much. Or maybe he was just up against too much of Ross\u2019s money. \u201cAre you documenting this meeting?\u201d Brie asked him.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d he asked, tapping the notebook. \u201cOh,\u201d he laughed. \u201cNo. This is my compilation of sins and crimes. It\u2019s not easy to remember every one of them, since I was high and plastered most of the time.\u201d He went back to writing.</p><p>Brie heard the car door outside and lifted Ness into her swing, getting it started. She went to the door before they could enter and opened it for Abby and Cameron. Ross put down his notebook and stood expectantly. \u201cHi, folks,\u201d Brie said, holding open the door.</p><p>And then she came inside, Cameron close on her heels.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Abby!\u201d Ross nearly shouted. He hit himself in the chest and wobbled a little on his feet, his eyes wide and shocked. \u201cGod!\u201d Then he shot a look at Brie. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me she was pregnant? I mean, pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my place to tell you. It\u2019s certainly not pertinent to your business.\u201d</p><p>He walked toward her and reached for her. \u201cGood God, come over and sit down.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him. Cameron was at her back, his hands on her upper arms. \u201cYou\u2019d better leave Abby to me,\u201d Cameron said calmly, firmly.</p><p>\u201cOh man,\u201d Ross said, running a nervous hand over the top of his head. \u201cSorry, man.\u201d Then he stuck out a hand, careful not to get too close. \u201cRoss Crawford,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cameron gave a curt nod over Abby\u2019s shoulder rather than shaking hands. \u201cDr. Michaels,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her doctor?\u201d Ross asked.</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Ross laughed. \u201cOkay, this is just a surprise, that\u2019s all. If you don\u2019t mind me saying so, you could use a little more than a fianc\u00e9 there, Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mind,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, what\u2019s so important, Ross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a second,\u201d he said, looking at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re awful pregnant, Abby. Kind of distracted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell get a hold of yourself and get down to business. This is pretty inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it is. Sorry. Um, can we sit?\u201d he asked, swinging a hand toward the sofa and chair. He stepped out of the way. \u201cGo ahead, you two. Gee.\u201d</p><p>Once they were all seated, Ross just stared at Abby. Cameron put an arm around her shoulders and said, \u201cCan we please move along? I might have patients waiting back at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, sorry, Doc. Abby, I didn\u2019t know what was happening to you with that whole divorce thing. I was high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t they your lawyers, Mr. Crawford?\u201d Cameron asked tensely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sort of. Listen, I\u2019m here to make amends, but it\u2019s dicey. I have to do this without making excuses, so I\u2019ll try. I went back on the road after we got married and after only about a week I started using. I met a woman at a party of some kind and gave her a job as an assistant band manager. The other guys said she was trouble and wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her, but I had started sleeping with her, so I ignored them and let her take care of some of my stuff. She got herself some credit cards. I didn\u2019t even remember about them until your lawyer told me. They were supposed to be for business expenses, but I didn\u2019t pay any attention. She played go-between with my lawyer and I signed anything she put in front of me. Hell, I think she was the one who contacted the lawyer, I was too toasted to do that. I\u2019ve been either high or in treatment for the last year and a half. My last incarceration was for six months in Mexico. It wasn\u2019t until I talked to your lawyer here that I found out you got soaked for all her charges. I never saw those cards either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you sober long enough to look at the paperwork you signed?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNah, I was messed up. Sometimes I was in worse shape in treatment than when I was using and playing guitar. But\u2014I\u2019d been out of the last treatment center a couple of months when the letter came from Ms. Valenzuela saying you\u2019d paid off the credit-card debt and didn\u2019t want any more alimony. My brain was working pretty well by then, so I called your lawyer here. I was finally cleaned up enough to look into it. Abby, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I would never have asked you to pay any of my bills. I wouldn\u2019t have stuck you with her bills, for sure. Your lawyer shouldn\u2019t have allowed it.\u201d</p><p>She scooted forward as much as she could. \u201cRoss, I had one lawyer, the best one I could afford after I took all the equity money out of my town house and cashed in my 401k, but you had four lawyers. Four, Ross. By the end of it, I felt lucky to get out of the whole mess as cheaply as I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, Abby, those were just back-up thugs from his office\u2014I didn\u2019t hire \u2019em. Man, you must hate me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d she said, folding her hands over her belly.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014this is not funny. But you look so cute. Really big. You ready to give birth or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. Okay, so the woman, the assistant manager, her name was Autumn, she got fired a long time ago. The boys picked out a new treatment center and said that was it\u2014if I committed for six months of treatment and stayed clean for a year, they\u2019d consider giving me another chance in the band. Otherwise, that was it for me. They told Autumn to hit the road, and I went into treatment for the third time.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI wish I could find someone to blame for the drugs, but the truth is, it was all me. I thought I was such hot shit when the band picked me up and the first time I saw that white powder, I plowed into it so fast.... And man, I loved the stuff. I\u2019ve been mostly high for over ten years. I hate what it did to my life, but I did love the stuff. Made me feel invincible.... Until it didn\u2019t anymore.... I\u2019m learning to like being level and not so destructive. But sometimes it\u2019s powerful hard.\u201d</p> <p>Abby struggled a little bit to get to a standing position, Cam at her side giving assist. \u201cWell, I hope you make it this time, Ross. When you\u2019re straight, you\u2019re not a bad guy. Too bad it\u2019s so scary to count on you staying straight.\u201d</p><p>Ross stood. \u201cAbby, you never asked for anything in the settlement, you should have gotten out of the whole thing without a problem, without it costing you a cent. You shouldn\u2019t have needed a lawyer at all. And, you were supposed to be getting some support while we were separated. Close as we can figure, that went in Autumn\u2019s purse, too. Staying crocked all the time is real expensive all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we just close the door on it now?\u201d Abby asked. \u201cI really need to get on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure do,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>She winced and leaned over her stomach slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, babe?\u201d Cameron asked softly, bracing her from behind.</p> <p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t grow anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to be going, Mr. Crawford,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cAbby needs her rest. She\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll hurry this up,\u201d he said. \u201cI fired the lawyer. I\u2019m using Greg\u2019s firm now. The lead singer\u2014remember him? He\u2019s straight as an arrow and has some good people on retainer. I gave them the job of figuring out what my shyster set you back and I want to make restitution....\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Abby said. \u201cThe credit-card bills were paid off with your alimony and I don\u2019t want your money. I want it over, once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll get that. I promise, I\u2019ll never bother you again after\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you spent enough money on drugs, treatment, lawyers and bad managers who robbed you blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I lost a ton of money on stupidity. There\u2019s a little left. It feels kind of good to spend some responsibly for a change. Let\u2019s see, there was forty-seven thousand in Autumn\u2019s credit-card bills, your 401k wasn\u2019t that big\u2014just twenty-two. Six years in that town house only earned you about thirty in equity\u2014should\u2019ve been more, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoss! Forget it! I defied your prenup!\u201d Her hand covered her mouth suddenly and her eyes darted between Brie to her left and Cameron behind to her right. \u201cShit,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But Ross grinned. \u201cReally? You mean while I was sleeping with Autumn\u2014as she robbed me blind\u2014you were having a relationship with this doctor dude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until the weekend before I signed the papers. So keep your money and just let me go.\u201d</p><p>Ross shook his head almost sadly. \u201cYou were alone for nine months? Aw, Abby, I agreed to that prenup safeguard when it was suggested, but I never would\u2019ve held you to it when I was stepping out on you at the same time. I mean, I\u2019m a lot of things, but I\u2019m not pure evil.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI guess it could happen that a woman you\u2019ve been married to a few months takes you for millions,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I should guard against that, but hey, I\u2019ve made more than one mistake, obviously. I\u2019m just happy that you found a good person and you\u2019re having a family, like you always wanted. And I\u2019m jealous\u2014I wish I could have that life. It\u2019s going to be a long time before I\u2019m sane enough for a relationship with anyone besides a sponsor.\u201d He pulled an envelope from his back pocket. It was folded in half.</p><p>\u201cRoss, I mean it\u2014your money is just going to mess me up. Cameron and I, together, we\u2019ve cleared all this up so we have a fresh start, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really for you,\u201d he said, handing her the envelope. \u201cIt\u2019s for me. It\u2019s very important to me that at the end of the day I made it right with one of the nicest people I know. After about ten years of screwing up people\u2019s lives, you gave me a chance, Abby. You believed in me when you shouldn\u2019t have, and all the thanks you got was getting screwed because I cared more about drugs than I did about you, or me, for that matter. If you don\u2019t want it, donate it to charity. Start a college fund for the kid there. Do whatever you want. It\u2019s real important to me\u2014it\u2019s helping me get well.\u201d</p><p>She took the envelope gingerly. She peeked inside and screamed. \u201cEyyyyyyeeee!\u201d She scrunched the envelope in her fist.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt it, Abby,\u201d Ross said, taking a nervous step toward her.</p><p>\u201cRoss, you\u2019ve lost your mind! It\u2019s for a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a little short. It should be bigger, figuring for nine months of support you never got before the divorce was final. I swear I told her to send you money. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know about all this sooner. Right about the time our divorce was final, I entered treatment for six months. I was out of pocket, just got out a couple of months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoss, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, do something good with it. Feed the hungry. Educate poor children. But, Abby, it\u2019s a cashier\u2019s check and it\u2019s money you were swindled out of. If you burn it, it\u2019s like burning cash, so don\u2019t go nuts. Doc? Maybe you could talk some sense into her. I mean, I appreciate how honorable she is, but it\u2019s her money. It\u2019s not a donation\u2014it\u2019s just what it cost her to get screwed around by my business manager and lawyer. And me. I guess first off it was me. Abby was robbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it,\u201d Cameron said, taking the squashed envelope out of her hands. \u201cIt won\u2019t be burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me, but hell\u2014try to use it on yourselves. It was her retirement and condo, for God\u2019s sake. She worked hard for that. Abby, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy. I really am.\u201d Then he smiled sadly.</p><p>Abby turned around to face Cameron. She had tears in her eyes. \u201cAre we done now?\u201d she asked Cam.</p><p>\u201cI think so, honey. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus, why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure. Now? I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sit back down here,\u201d he said, tossing the envelope on the side table and easing her down onto the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s take a minute to see what we\u2019ve got before we activate Mel and John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got one right after another,\u201d she said. \u201cHard. Long. Getting stronger. Pretty soon I\u2019m going to have to start deep breathing.\u201d</p><p>Brie got right over there. \u201cAny idea how far apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI was listening to Ross. But close and getting closer. This has been going on since you called, but I saw a chance to have this over with him before the babies came and I\u2014 Cameron?\u201d she asked, turning her frightened face to his. \u201cI\u2019m nervous. Is it okay? It\u2019s over thirty-six weeks, right? We\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine, baby. And they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they come too fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have Mel pick us up in the Hummer just in case. Brie? Call Mel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, heading for the phone. When she turned to pick it up, she saw Ross backing toward the door, his eyes on Cameron and Abby.</p><p>Abby had her hands on Cam\u2019s face. \u201cI love you so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we\u2019d just gotten married when you first suggested it. I want them to have a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a father, baby. We\u2019ll get it done as soon as you\u2019re recovered a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll put your name on the birth certificates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do anything you want. Right now it looks like we\u2019re going to deliver.\u201d He smiled and gave her a kiss. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to wait for the Pitocin, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it long enough for them to be healthy,\u201d she said, leaning against him. \u201cDidn\u2019t I? Please tell me I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to be perfect, Ab. Trust me, honey.\u201d</p><p>Brie watched Ross. He had a melancholy look on his face as he lifted a hand to her to wave goodbye. For a second she was frozen, then she lifted her hand in return. No time for farewells between Abby and Ross, which was probably for the best. She made a mental note to retrieve and protect the check that lay on the table.</p><p>She dialed as the door closed behind Ross. How must it feel, she wondered, to know that you\u2019ve squandered your life? To see all you lost?</p><p>\u201cMel? Hey, Cam and Abby are here and she\u2019s in labor. Contractions very close together and she says they\u2019re strong and long. Cameron asked if you\u2019d bring the Hummer to take her to the hospital, just to be safe. Very good\u2014I\u2019ll tell them.\u201d She disconnected and said, \u201cAs soon as she can leave the kids with Jack, she\u2019s on her way.\u201d Brie grinned. \u201cSo\u2014what an exciting day this turned out to be. So much for boring paperwork!\u201d</p><p>When Mel arrived at Brie\u2019s office, she took a couple of minutes to talk with Abby about her contractions. \u201cGet in back with her, Cam, and I\u2019ll drive. Her water hasn\u2019t broken and I think we have time. Tell me if I have to pull over and trade places with you.\u201d</p><p>While Mel drove, she listened to Cameron trying to coach Abby through her breathing, trying to soothe her, rubbing her back. But when they arrived at Valley Hospital forty-five minutes later, she heard Abby snap, \u201cOf course I\u2019m doing fine. Can you stop touching me so much?\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled to herself, but then she hurried. She put the Hummer in park at the hospital\u2019s emergency entrance, ran around to the back and lifted the hatch. \u201cI want you to stay on the gurney, Abby,\u201d she said. \u201cCam, give me a hand here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can probably still walk,\u201d Abby began to argue.</p><p>\u201cNo, do as I say,\u201d Mel instructed. When she and Cameron had rolled her into the hospital and up the elevator to labor and delivery, they were expected. Mel asked a nurse, \u201cIs Dr. Stone here yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but he said he was coming right over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you can still reach him, tell him to put a wiggle in it\u2014I think I\u2019m going to find she\u2019s in transition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d the L&amp;D nurse assured her.</p><p>In the birthing room there were two plexiglass bassinets, two warmers stocked with diapers so tiny they could fit in the palm of her hand, monitors and IV stands. Cameron and Mel cautiously transferred Abby to the bed. Mel pulled off Abby\u2019s shoes. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask Cameron to help you get into a gown, Abby, while I change into scrubs. When we\u2019re both changed, I\u2019ll check you. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, rolling carefully into a sitting position on the bed. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, honey?\u201d Cam asked her.</p> <p>\u201cMy water! Oh God, I\u2019m totally sitting in a puddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s change quickly, shall we?\u201d Mel said, throwing her purse and bag in a corner out of the way and heading out of the room for a quick change. On her way toward the nurses\u2019 lounge and locker room she said to one of the nurses, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna roll in there. Get me the pediatric nurse and I\u2019ll need some help until Dr. Stone arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve arrived,\u201d she heard a voice say.</p><p>She turned and smiled at John Stone. \u201cGreat timing. Our patient is moving up on the docket, water just broke, and I haven\u2019t even checked her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine or ten,\u201d Mel said with a shrug. \u201cShe had a nice little personality shift just as we were arriving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll check her.\u201d Then he smiled at the L&amp;D nurse. \u201cShe\u2019s got great instincts. Get your delivery team in there.\u201d</p><p>The room became busy even before Cameron had helped Abby all the way into her gown. John Stone was waiting for her to ease back on the bed, snapping on a pair of gloves. People started filling the room\u2014two pediatric nurses, a couple of labor-and-delivery nurses, the pediatrician arrived, and Mel was back by the time Abby\u2019s knees were raised and John Stone was examining her. One of the nurses was monitoring fetal heartbeats. \u201cWhat are you feeling, Abby?\u201d John asked her.</p><p>\u201cPressure,\u201d she said. \u201cLow pressure. I think maybe I have to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>John pulled out his hand, stripped off the glove and said, \u201cNot anymore, Abby. Let\u2019s break down this bed,\u201d he said to one of the nurses. \u201cAbby, there\u2019s only a tiny strip of cervix left\u2014you ready to push?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could try,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn a second or two, you\u2019re not going to have to try.\u201d No sooner said than she was lifting off the bed on pure instinct, bearing down. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cMel, take the first one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d she said.</p><p>The L&amp;D nurses removed the bottom half of the birthing bed, rolled forward a table on which the delivery instruments and equipment lay under a sterile drape, and Mel and John shared the space at the end of the bed. Mel pulled a stool up to the front-row seat where she was rhythmically and systematically stretching Abby\u2019s vagina around a growing crown of hair. She was telling Abby to push push push push push and, \u201cGo ahead and rest for a minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI missed the epidural,\u201d Abby said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Mel laughed. \u201cReady to go again, Abby?\u201d</p><p>Abby lifted slightly, Cameron assisting at her shoulders, and before even fifteen minutes had passed, Mel said, \u201cHere we go, just one more,\u201d and a baby came into her hands. While holding the baby in her lap, she deftly clamped and cut. \u201cAh. Ladies first.\u201d And within moments she had moved out of the way for John Stone to take over, bringing the newborn up onto Abby\u2019s chest. \u201cNice, very nice. Take a moment to rest and meet your daughter, then we have to do that again. Let\u2019s dry her off, Cam,\u201d she said, rubbing a soft towel over the baby\u2019s tiny body.</p><p>\u201cIs she big enough? Is she, Cam?\u201d Abby asked. \u201cShe looks so tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing five pounds,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cWhat do you think, Mel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she liked it in there. Look at those arms flail, listen to that voice. Oh, you two are going to be busy. Abby, have a quick look, sweetheart, then let\u2019s get her warmed up and bring out her brother. Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let go of her,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get her right back. She just needs to be cleaned off, warmed up, diapered and swaddled. By that time, you\u2019ll be counting fingers and toes on her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, look at her, Cameron. How can I be in charge of something this tiny?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou should get help from a pediatrician. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I just marry you when I had the chance?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and put a kiss on her lips and on the baby\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, honey.\u201d</p><p>Abby and Cameron had less than two minutes to examine and fawn over their daughter, when a low groan came from Abby. That sound alone brought the pediatric nurse to the bedside, scooping up the baby to get her cleaned, weighed, measured and checked over by the doctor. As soon as the baby was cleared from her, John Stone said, \u201cGo ahead and push when you\u2019re ready, Abby. We\u2019re going to bring this fella down and into the world.\u201d</p><p>Just a couple of minutes later, Abby had another baby in her arms. Mel and Cameron were drying him off while Abby was cooing over him, touching him, kissing him. She didn\u2019t even notice that the nurse was washing her up, that the field of birth was being cleaned and cleared away, the bed reassembled. It was only another fifteen minutes before Abby held their daughter while Cameron held their son.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter is five pounds, two ounces and your son a strapping five-seven. Both of them eighteen inches. Nice work, Abby. You grew them into going-home-from-the-hospital weight. They\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Abby, holding her daughter close, looked up into Cameron\u2019s eyes. She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re a family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey.\u201d He leaned down to give her a kiss. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>There was a lot of commotion at the bar when Hope came in and announced to Jack, Paul and Dan that her third attempted eBay auction on the old church was under way and the bidding started high enough for her to actually sell the property.</p><p>\u201cYou are kidding me,\u201d Jack said, astonished. \u201cDo you know who to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of contacts, asking for details. One is a minister who\u2019s been teaching for the past few years and wants to get back in the pulpit and another is an artist who wants to live in the church and use it as a shop to make everything from stained-glass pieces to decorative candles. There\u2019s one other\u2014I have no idea who. It\u2019s going to go by midnight next Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Preacher\u2019s watching it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t figured out that whole eBay thing yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, it\u2019s eBay-dot-com,\u201d Dan said. \u201cYou can do this. If you need me to, I can come over to the house and show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I want you to know where I live,\u201d Jack said, wiping the counter.</p><p>Dan grinned. He liked that\u2014some grief from Jack. Buddies ribbed each other, and if a guy liked you a lot, he hit below the belt now and then. \u201cMaybe your wife could get you checked out on eBay. You could put in a bid, raise the stakes for Hope here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and end up with a church. Just what I need.\u201d</p><p>Paul lifted his beer. \u201cI hope whoever gets it needs a good builder for a remodel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get a contract on that church, it\u2019ll take the new guy a year to put it right,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Rick listened to all this with half an ear. He didn\u2019t really participate in the discussions at the bar. Each week he sat farther to the end of the bar so he wouldn\u2019t be expected to say anything. The joke was on him, he thought. No one was in the mood to cajole him into being sociable anymore. Jack let him have his beer and before he was half through it, put a plate of food in front of him.</p><p>He\u2019d trained this old town of his pretty well\u2014he gave them an hour or so of glum silence once a week and now they didn\u2019t pester him, asking him how he was getting along, et cetera.</p><p>Then it happened, as it always did. She came in. He could set his watch by her\u2014five o\u2019clock Friday night. He couldn\u2019t really say whether she came to the bar other times, because he didn\u2019t. Of course, he could change his schedule and avoid her. But no, he couldn\u2019t make himself do that.</p><p>She looked so damn beautiful. All of eighteen. How could she look so pure and innocent when he knew she\u2019d been having sex since she was fourteen? With him!</p><p>\u201cHey, Lizzie,\u201d Jack called out. \u201cWait till you hear this! Hope\u2019s got bidders on eBay for that old church!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she said, her smile beaming. She walked right up to the bar and stood between Dan and Hope, elbows on the bar.</p><p>\u201cWay,\u201d Hope said, pushing her glasses up on her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make a killing, but I might get it opened up again.\u201d</p><p>Rick secretly admitted he\u2019d started sitting at the end of the bar so he wouldn\u2019t have to turn his head to look at her when she came in. Or when she left. He wanted to be absolutely sure she wasn\u2019t even glancing around, checking to see where he was, and still manage not to even see him. She wasn\u2019t. It was as if he was invisible.</p><p>\u201cBut will you get a minister to open it up?\u201d Liz asked.</p><p>\u201cWith a little luck. But if you think about it, the most important thing is that it not look like a boarded-up old church anymore. Goddamn thing\u2019s an eyesore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice talk for the owner of a church,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAch, I\u2019m just a broker. How was your high-school graduation, Lizzie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d she answered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly valedictorian or anything, but I graduated on the honor roll. A miracle.\u201d She beamed proudly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you partied?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cThere was a big open house at the school. Then there were some other open houses around town\u2014I went to a few. Some girls and I had a sleepover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome girls?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cShoot, what\u2019s happened to this world? When I graduated high school, a long time ago by the way, there was an all-night party for boys and girls. And a lot of funny business.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cThere was an all-night party, but I just passed on that. I hung out with my girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Jack said. He pulled a big envelope out from under the till and handed it to her. \u201cMel and I are very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack! What\u2019s this? You shouldn\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie, sweetheart, you showed \u2019em. You worked your tail off. That deserves a reward. You\u2019re...what do they say now? You\u2019re bad?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI think that one\u2019s over. You\u2019re the bomb is still around\u2014for people your age.\u201d</p><p>Jack just shook his head. \u201cHard to keep up. I bet you\u2019re glad the long haul is behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. I\u2019m working full-time all summer, then I start at College of the Redwoods in September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking groceries at Albertson\u2019s Sunday through Thursday\u2014all p.m.\u2019s of course, since I\u2019m new. And at Connie\u2019s on Friday and Saturday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than full-time, that\u2019s two jobs,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWhen are you going to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornings, I guess,\u201d she said with a smile. She ripped open her card to read it to herself and when it opened, a hundred-dollar bill fell out. \u201cAw, Jack,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAfter all you and Mel have done for me, you sure shouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d He just shrugged and Liz put the card down, stuffed the bill in the pocket of her jeans and reached out for him, circling his neck with her arms so she could give him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cThank you, Jack. That\u2019s so sweet. I\u2019ll thank Mel myself later.\u201d</p><p>Rick was dying as he watched. Of course, he hadn\u2019t bothered going to her graduation, nor had he given her a card or even congratulated her. And he wanted those arms around him, those lips on his cheek. Not that he\u2019d done one thing to deserve it.</p> <p>Jack fixed up her giant Coke to go and put it on the counter. \u201cOn the house, Liz. We\u2019re all proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Paul said, lifting his beer. Hope raised her Jack Daniel\u2019s, Dan lifted his bottle of Heineken, Jack toasted with his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cThanks, that means a lot,\u201d she said softly, maybe emotionally. \u201cI\u2019d better get over to Connie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later, honey,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Rick felt his eyes burn and his head start to pound as he watched her leave. His eyes dropped to her perfect butt, her long legs, that beautiful sheath of soft hair, and remembered how every inch of her felt under his hands. He could smell her, taste her. This was the love of his life, his childhood sweetheart, the girl he was going to marry, until life threw them a curve. He turned on his stool, grabbed his cane and followed her. Because he was slower getting around, she was nearly to the corner store by the time he was at the porch steps. \u201cHey!\u201d</p> <p>She turned toward him, frowning.</p><p>He slowly and clumsily descended the porch steps, walking toward her, his limp suddenly much more pronounced.</p><p>Dan saw Rick leave and followed, standing just outside the bar door on the porch, his arms crossed over his chest. Watching. Listening.</p><p>\u201cYou do that on purpose?\u201d Rick yelled at Liz. \u201cJust to punish me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He got a little closer. \u201cActing like I don\u2019t exist like that. You won\u2019t even look at me. Is that how bad I gross you out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up, Rick. You\u2019re acting like an ass again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an ass? For asking why you won\u2019t even look at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that\u2019s what you wanted! You want everything we were to just go away! Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBullshit, it is like that! You said we can\u2019t even be friends! So back off\u2014you got just what you wanted!\u201d</p><p>Jack had heard the shouting, knew who it was and stepped out of the bar. He was about to go after Rick, shut him up before it got worse, but Dan put an arm across his chest. \u201cLet it happen,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI care about Liz. If Rick\u2019s going to be a jackass, she doesn\u2019t deserve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it happen,\u201d Dan said. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jack said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their bone, Jack. Don\u2019t chew on it.\u201d</p><p>And Jack stayed, joined by Paul a moment later.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not what I want! It\u2019s how it has to be!\u201d Rick was yelling at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You never did say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why\u2014I did too say! Because you can do better, that\u2019s why!\u201d</p><p>She laughed meanly. \u201cAin\u2019t that the truth! But why? Is it about the leg or the fact that you\u2019re such an asshole and you treat your best friends like crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry if I\u2019m not a happy-go-lucky idiot, Liz!\u201d he shouted, leaning heavily on his cane. \u201cI might have one or two things on my mind, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. You. Your mind is all filled up with yourself and how much you pity yourself. Because you\u2019re the only one ever hurting, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around,\u201d he yelled, and it was at that point that he saw the three men on the porch. He didn\u2019t care. \u201cHow many other one-legged dudes you see hanging out here. Huh?\u201d He stepped closer and so did she. Even though they got closer, their voices got louder. \u201cMaybe you could just cut me some slack, Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve cut you plenty of slack, Rick, but I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t do anything to please you. You want me to go away quietly, then you want me to fuss over you like you\u2019re some old friend of mine? Or maybe I\u2019m supposed to feel sorry for you because you\u2019re a cripple! You\u2019re out of your fucking mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that word,\u201d he yelled at her. \u201cDon\u2019t say words like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Words like mind? Which you\u2019re fucking out of? Go to hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear like that! You\u2019re not like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what, asshole\u2014I don\u2019t belong to you anymore, so you don\u2019t tell me how you\u2019d like me to talk!\u201d</p><p>When she turned to go, Rick grabbed her wrist and whirled her back toward him, which caused her to drop her Coke and graduation card in the street.</p><p>Again Jack stepped forward to intercede. This time it was both Dan and Paul who pulled him back. \u201cDon\u2019t get in this, Jack,\u201d Dan said. \u201cHe has things to work out. So does she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t raised like that,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t raised to go to war and get wounded either. Let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Liz asked Rick, twisting her wrist out of his grasp. \u201cMaybe you like to see me look at you all sad and hurt so you can feel like big stuff. Or maybe you were expecting me to beg. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to look at me! I want you to say hello to me! I want you to treat me like a human being!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I wanted that from you, too! But you don\u2019t think anyone besides yourself deserves to be treated with kindness or respect. You have to give as good as you get, Rick, that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry if I\u2019m not unselfish enough for you, Lizzie! It gets tough, trying to figure out how to take a goddamn shower much less how to get the rest of your life back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re the only one who wants their life back? Maybe you think you\u2019re the only one who needs understanding, is that it? You hurting, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Liz! Yeah! I\u2019d trade anything to just be what I was before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so would I!\u201d she screamed at him. \u201cI\u2019d give both my legs if you could have yours! You think I wouldn\u2019t have given my arms and my legs just to see you holding a living son in your arms? You think I wouldn\u2019t give my eyes so you wouldn\u2019t have a limp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! Don\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! It\u2019s the truth! And not for me\u2014for you! Hell, I don\u2019t care if you limp. I don\u2019t care if you wheel yourself around\u2014it\u2019s not your stupid goddamn leg I care about. I prayed all the way to Germany! I told God if you were dead when I got there, I wish I could go with you! But when I got there, you weren\u2019t dead! You just told me to go away! Like I was dead. Sometimes I wish I was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give my life if you could be happy again! I swear to God, I\u2019d give my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that!\u201d he screamed, and he shoved her. She was pushed backward a few stumbling feet.</p><p>Jack took a giant step forward and Dan pivoted quickly, putting himself in front of him. \u201cGotta let \u2019em do it, Jack. It\u2019s their battle right now. We\u2019ll get a piece of it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should stop it before it gets\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan looked over his shoulder in time to see Liz turn and run toward the corner store, but instead of going inside, she got in her car. She pulled away from the store and drove out of town. Dan looked back at Jack. \u201cYou. Stay put. You\u2019re way too close to this.\u201d</p><p>Dan went down the porch steps and moved toward Rick. Because he was moving kind of fast, he had a little hitch in his step. When he stood in front of Rick, he put his hands on his hips. \u201cDid you actually push that female?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow about you mind your own business,\u201d Rick said hotly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not gonna happen, boy. Where I come from, we don\u2019t stand around and watch a man get physical with a woman and mind our own business. You looking for a fight, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of my way,\u201d Rick said, leaning on his cane and trying to get around Dan.</p><p>Dan kicked the cane, sweeping it out of Rick\u2019s hand and sailing a few feet down the street. Then he gave Rick a shove, just like he\u2019d given Liz, and in just one second, Rick was flat on his ass.</p><p>\u201cHey! What the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you fight with someone who isn\u2019t afraid to hit back? How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Rick said from his place on the ground, \u201cI think you might have a little advantage there, friend.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>Dan bent at the waist, leaned over and began unlacing his boot. He pulled it off, leaving a thick white sock. He straightened, unfastened his belt and dropped his jeans to mid-thigh and there it was, the silicon sleeve of a prosthetic limb right shy of his boxer shorts.</p><p>Dan lowered himself to the ground slowly, carefully, then pushed the pin to release the suction on the sleeve to free his stump. Since the ankle of his prosthesis didn\u2019t bend, he had to work the artificial limb up through his pants\u2019 leg and lay it on the ground. With the help of his hands, he pushed himself up on one leg, balancing with some difficulty. Once standing on one leg, he pulled his jeans up again, zipping and belting them. He pulled the empty pants\u2019 leg up and tucked the end in the front pocket of his jeans. And with all the grace of a ballet dancer, he was solid on one leg. Totally solid.</p><p>On the porch, Jack muttered, \u201cHoly Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered about that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat unsteady knee of his isn\u2019t his. Well, I mean, I\u2019m sure he owns it and all...\u201d</p><p>Dan balanced nicely. Years of practice had left him quite proficient. \u201cYou think the playing field is level yet?\u201d he asked Rick. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t take off the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Rick said, raised up on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, you keep yours and we\u2019ll go a few rounds. I\u2019m no little girl. And I\u2019m just as gimpy as you. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not fighting with you, man,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to be ashamed, treating that girl so bad,\u201d Dan said calmly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s got into you. If yelling at her isn\u2019t bad enough, you put your hands on her. And not in a sweet way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your business,\u201d Rick said, but some of the hostility was gone.</p><p>\u201cThought I explained about that,\u201d Dan replied. \u201cI don\u2019t stand around and watch a man get tough with a woman and look the other way. You have to answer for it. For being one mean, weak dick. You want to answer to me or to her?\u201d</p><p>Rick just stared up at him. \u201cHow you stay upright like that, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much practice?\u201d Rick asked. \u201cHow long have you had it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a few years now. I got mine in Iraq, too. And I was just as screwed up as you. Time we got this all straight, boy. You\u2019ve whined and whimpered about long enough now.\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t even wobble around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the neat little tricks I wish I\u2019d never had to learn.\u201d Dan reached in his pants\u2019 pocket. \u201cDo you know where to find Liz?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rick nodded.</p><p>Dan threw his keys at him, hit him in the chest with them. \u201cGo find her. Beg her to forgive your sorry ass. That, or go a few rounds with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I can\u2019t drive!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? You gonna get rides the rest of your life? It\u2019s the Ford truck with the camper shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my right leg!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen accelerate and brake with the left! Jesus, have you been in a coma all this time? Aren\u2019t you even thinking about how to get on with your life?\u201d Dan put out his hand and with the help of that and his own hand pushing himself up, Rick got off the ground. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, be careful. It\u2019s the only truck I have. When you find her, don\u2019t be too surprised if she breaks your other leg. If I were her, I would.\u201d</p><p>Standing, and in considerable awe of the one-legged man he faced, Rick said, \u201cListen, I know you mean to help, to teach me a lesson, but I\u2019m not screwed up on purpose....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, son. But you can get better on purpose. You ever want to talk about it with someone who\u2019s been there, I can do that. But not right now. Right now, take care of that girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to tell her? Because we both know I\u2019m not good enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest, right after you beg her to forgive you, you thank her. Because she\u2019s just crazy enough to think you are. Now, my beer\u2019s getting warm. We about done with this circus?\u201d</p><p>Rick tossed the keys in his hand. Then he turned and went to fetch his cane, carefully bending to get it off the ground.</p><p>Dan stood in the street until Rick had backed the truck out of its parking spot, accelerating too fast, breaking too hard, almost taking out the vehicle it was parked beside. Dan winced. It wasn\u2019t as though that old truck didn\u2019t have plenty of scrapes, but if the kid drove it right off the mountainside, he\u2019d be real sorry he staged this whole production.</p><p>He bent to lift his prosthesis and boot. He started hopping back toward the bar. Before he got far, Jack was down in the street, draping Dan\u2019s arm across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cFancy,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou should be an acrobat. You have some serious skills.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHalf the time I am an acrobat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you send Rick in your truck?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI told him to go find Liz and beg her forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they just duke it out again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t worry. She can probably take him. Now, I need a bathroom or someplace private to drop my drawers and reassemble. I don\u2019t want to show Hope my shorts.\u201d</p><p>Rick had lied when he\u2019d said he knew where to find Liz\u2014he could think of a hundred places. One of those places was her house in Eureka. As he drove out of town, his first thought was that he wasn\u2019t ready to drive on freeways. He wasn\u2019t even ready for these country mountain roads he\u2019d grown up on. He was going real slow, breaking cautiously around the curves. He\u2019d almost forgotten about looking for Liz. He was busy learning to drive again.</p><p>But driving turned out to be okay. He was a little clumsy on the gas and brake for about ten minutes, so he headed for Valley High, though he knew she wouldn\u2019t be there. He just wanted to practice, to be sure he wouldn\u2019t end up in a ditch.</p><p>Twenty minutes into his driving experiment, he decided to go looking for her, and it was not because Dan told him to. The second she ran away from him, he knew. He wasn\u2019t getting out of this business the way he\u2019d planned. He felt two choices staring him in the face. Either he had to make peace with his leg and his life or he had to go away somewhere he could be alone forever. Where no one would ever remind him of all his bad experiences, all his losses. When he thought of making things right, he felt the sting of tears in his eyes, but when he thought of being alone forever, his throat closed so tight he couldn\u2019t breathe. He had both reactions, to facing those two alternatives, within a matter of less than sixty seconds.</p> <p>He drove out to a place in the woods where they used to park\u2014no one was there. He drove through some vineyards in the valley, passed a couple of big trucks on a two-lane road, a daring move for a one-legged driver. The sun was starting to sink behind the mountains to the west; he\u2019d have to get the truck back before long. The crazy fool, giving him a truck! Wasn\u2019t he worried that Rick would just take off and never come back?</p><p>He drove aimlessly for a while, wondering how that guy was an amputee and nobody had even known it. Or maybe some people had known, but not Rick, because he was in his own head all the time. It was the act of driving, the freedom of driving, that made him wonder about some things. Like, had he expected Jack to drive him everywhere for the rest of his life? One of the first things they taught him in PT was to have a bar installed in the bathroom, something to hang on to, steady himself. It was definitely time to do that now. He\u2019d fallen twice and took a lot of baths sitting on the edge of the tub. He hated baths.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect to find Liz. He\u2019d go to the store later tonight or tomorrow and find her, talk to her. Or, failing that, he\u2019d either get Jack to drive him to Eureka or borrow Jack\u2019s truck. He had no idea what he\u2019d say, but...</p><p>But would he work? Go to school? Hunt? Fish?</p><p>She\u2019d killed him with what she\u2019d said. She wished she was dead?</p><p>He thought back, way back, to when she was lying in that bed at Doc\u2019s, writhing in pain as she tried to give birth. He\u2019d held her small, sweating body close to his chest, promising her he\u2019d never let her go. They knew the baby was dead, but there were times during that nightmare that he remembered thinking that if he lost her as well, his life would never mean anything again. And back then he\u2019d still been a little confused about whether he loved her enough to make a life with her, and yet he knew losing her would kill him. It was the same right now\u2014he\u2019d told her they couldn\u2019t be together, but the thought of her dying ripped his heart out.</p><p>What had he done to her? And why was he kidding himself? He\u2019d never stop loving her.</p><p>He found himself headed for the river and once there, he saw her car. He shook his head\u2014he should\u2019ve known. It was the last place they\u2019d been together. He parked, swallowed his fear and got out. He used his cane, careful of rocks and holes, and made his way to the river\u2019s edge. She was leaning back against a big boulder, half sitting, half standing. \u201cLiz,\u201d he said to her back.</p><p>She looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cGo away,\u201d she said.</p><p>He walked toward her. \u201cLiz, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at the river. \u201cJust go away. I refuse to fight with you. And I can outrun you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly in spite of himself. \u201cNo kidding.\u201d He went to stand in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Liz. I am out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed,\u201d she said with a sniff. She turned away from him to swipe at her damp cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be this way,\u201d he said. \u201cBetween us, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him. \u201cWell, Rick, I have to admit, I don\u2019t have a clue how you want it to be. You told me to go away and I tried. You made it real clear you didn\u2019t love me anymore.... All those phone calls... I thought maybe...\u201d</p><p>He gave her a second. \u201cYou thought what, Liz?\u201d</p><p>She looked down and took a breath. \u201cI thought after a while you\u2019d start to think like your old self again and you\u2019d appreciate it\u2014that I never gave up on you. That I loved you no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, Liz. Appreciate it. I just thought you\u2019d be wasting your life on someone like me.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened slightly. \u201cBecause of your leg? Your stupid leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went past the leg,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that I brought bad luck. That a life with me would be full of bad experiences. I mean, you and me, we\u2019ve had our share. You know?\u201d</p><p>A huff of laughter escaped through her tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was me. I thought if it wasn\u2019t for me, everything in your life would be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, didn\u2019t I get pregnant right away? I had just barely gotten my period back then. And then I let our baby die. And then because that hurt you so bad, you went to the Marines....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Jesus,\u201d he said. He reached for her, his arms going around her waist, pulling her hard against him. \u201cHow could you think that? You didn\u2019t make any of those things happen!\u201d</p><p>She held on to him, putting her head against his shoulder. He felt her shrug. \u201cAs much as you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d he muttered, \u201cwe are so screwed up.\u201d He felt her arms tighten around him, holding him as she sobbed against his shoulder. He ran his hand down that wonderful silky hair. \u201cHey, hey,\u201d he said softly. And it all came back to him, how it felt when he held her, comforted her. \u201cCome on, baby, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said. In the back of his mind he wondered why he wasn\u2019t able to do this three months ago. It was so natural, so right. It felt so good to be the man.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve waited for you to hold me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve held you before. Right here, in fact,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She shook her head against his shoulder. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an ounce of love in that,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pulled away from her a bit, lifting her chin with his thumb and finger. \u201cNothing like that\u2019s ever going to happen between us again, Liz. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is going to happen between us?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cAre you just trying to make me not mad at you, but then go back to that business that we can\u2019t be together anymore?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and kissed her cheeks one at a time, softly, gently. \u201cWe have to be together. If we just bring each other a ton of bad luck, we\u2019ll need someone to hang on to through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said, laying her head against him again, crying. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to ever see me cry again,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI hate being a wimpy girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. I wish I was as strong as you. I don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t get it together. Jesus, I just couldn\u2019t get any of it, you know? You better understand something, Liz\u2014I\u2019m never going to be like I was. I\u2019m never going to be that kid that just grins through every ugly thing. That part of my life got blown up.\u201d</p><p>She leaned away from him. \u201cReally? And you think I didn\u2019t get blown up, too?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cJack said, when a soldier gets wounded, everyone who loves him gets wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d he said, as if he just thought of him. \u201cAw, Jesus, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh man. Did he ever say anything to you about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLike he was counting the minutes till he could put me down like a sick dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack? Of course not. He\u2019s been worried, I know that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I treated you bad, I treated Jack worse. God, I don\u2019t know how to fix that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better fix this up first,\u201d she said with an assertiveness he was unaccustomed to in her.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back and forth on this, and just because you feel guilty about yelling at me doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re okay. We have problems, you and me. Like you said, we\u2019re so screwed up. I want to get out of this mess and be as much like regular people as we can. When the baby died, the school counselor got me a therapist who helped me with that and after a while, I could talk about it without being angry, without crying. That\u2019s what I want for us, Rick. I don\u2019t want to always be scared that you\u2019re going to leave me any second.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work at that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a lot of talking.

What was one more counselor? \u201cSure, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice. He\u2019s helped me so much. He\u2019s kind of goofy, but you might like him.

That if we got back together, we should have counseling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she said with a nod. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s right. No way I could have gotten through the past few months without him. If it hadn\u2019t worked for me before, I probably wouldn\u2019t insist on this, but I\u2019m a believer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd promise you won\u2019t make fun of him. Just put out of your mind that he\u2019s strange and listen and talk. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rick agreed. \u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about him?\u201d Rick asked, thinking about adding another weirdo into the mix. But what the hell, his weirdo had worked out.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s funny looking. Tall and skinny with big ears and a long, hooked nose. And he thinks he was abducted by aliens.\u201d</p><p>Rick pulled back, holding Liz\u2019s upper arms. His face was frozen in shock for a moment, then a huge laugh erupted from him. \u201cYou are fucking kidding me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see how it is\u2014you can use the F word whenever you want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry Powell? Liz, that\u2019s who I\u2019ve been seeing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s the nutcase that got me this far. Honest to God, sometimes I hate that psycho\u2014but I have to admit, it\u2019s helped, though I sure couldn\u2019t tell you how.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see Mr. Spaceman with you. Can we merge our appointments so I don\u2019t have to put up with him three or four times a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cLiz, it\u2019s the rules. He doesn\u2019t talk about patients.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop laughing and it felt both strange and familiar at the same time. He used to be a laughing fool. Lately he\u2019d found it hard to find humor in anything. \u201cWhat a kick. Come on, Liz, I gotta get the truck back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truck?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Guy at the bar\u2014Dan\u2014he loaned me his truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you think I got here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI figured Jack was waiting on the road.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah. Old Dan, he picked a fight with me. He didn\u2019t like how I was treating you and he was right. Also, he took off his leg. I had no idea he was an amputee. That showed me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cPeople have been talking to me for months, and they weren\u2019t all able-bodied like our whack job Powell or Jack\u2014I was in group therapy with amputees who made it all look easy. But something about today changed everything. I\u2019m going to figure out what after I try to apologize to Jack and return the truck.\u201d</p><p>But he knew what. Several factors collided. Jerry got through to him, made him see that he was unsuccessful in escaping his old life. Then Liz fought back, giving him every punch he deserved. Then Dan took off his leg and balanced perfectly on one. Perfectly, like he didn\u2019t even need the prosthesis. Then he held Liz the way she was meant to be held, with tenderness and love. It was all coming together. Took too damn long, but it was coming together.</p><p>Rick followed Liz back to town, gave her one more kiss and made a date to meet her on his grandma\u2019s front porch later. Then he took a deep breath and made his way into the bar. He recognized Dan\u2019s back at the bar. His leg was all put back together. Friday night, the place was pretty busy, but there was an empty stool on Dan\u2019s left.</p><p>Rick maneuvered himself onto the stool and put the keys down next to Dan\u2019s coffee cup. \u201cSorry. Took me a while.\u201d</p><p>Dan turned and peered at him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait. I\u2019d have gotten the truck back to you somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wait,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI had dinner and I can walk home from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have this whole business down pretty good now, huh?\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like missing a couple of teeth. You learn to chew on the other side.\u201d</p><p>Rick laughed in spite of himself. \u201cTeeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI took the hard way. You don\u2019t have to. Lotta help around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, speaking of help...\u201d Jack was on his way down the bar. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>Jack grabbed a towel and a glass. Then he was in front of him, glaring down at him, wiping the spots out of the glass to keep from choking him. \u201cLiz all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I found her out at the river and we had a talk. Nice and calm. I told her I was sorry for that whole business. For everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ever see anything like that again, I don\u2019t know if I can keep from beating the shit outta you. I know I taught you better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. That was horrible and I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all I could do to keep from dragging you behind the shed.\u201d</p><p>A smile came to Rick\u2019s lips. Jack was in everything, meddling, and it often got him in trouble. \u201cI\u2019ll bet,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>\u201cI think we step up the counseling appointments. If you can\u2019t adjust, maybe you can learn restraint.\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cThat\u2019s never been your long suit, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it turns out, that\u2019s going to happen. Liz won\u2019t get back with me unless we go to the counselor together.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s head swiveled sharply toward Rick. \u201cYou sure she\u2019s just eighteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had to grow up fast,\u201d Rick said. \u201cJack, I know I owe you a ton of apologies. I\u2019ll walk down after breakfast tomorrow. We can talk about it. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying you turned a corner here?\u201d Jack couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking.</p><p>\u201cSort of. It was kind of like a bomb went off in my head.\u201d Then he winced. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t said it like that.\u201d</p><p>With the towel in one hand and the glass in the other, Jack leaned his big, meaty hands on the bar. \u201cYou telling me that this lunatic taking off his leg was all you needed?\u201d</p><p>Again Rick laughed. \u201cYes and no. It was probably more about seeing how I\u2019d treated Liz. I love that girl\u2014but I\u2019ve been treating her like crap for months. I hurt her so bad, just because I have shit to deal with. And her saying she\u2019d give up both her legs if I could have mine? Give up her life if I lost mine? God.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been getting to this. That nutcase you send me to twice a week said sometimes people have to hit bottom before they start to build up their strength again. The way I treated the girl I love, after the way I was brought up, first by my gram and then by you\u2014shit, man. We don\u2019t treat our women that way and I know it. I saw the bottom, saw what kind of man I could turn into if I don\u2019t get a handle on this. He also said I was more mad at myself than anyone else. I think I was getting close to sanity anyway. Then this crazy loon took off his leg. I\u2019ve never seen anyone stay upright on one leg like that.\u201d Rick grinned and elbowed Dan. \u201cThat is truly awesome. I don\u2019t know how you did that. It\u2019s like you studied under a karate master or something. I\u2019m so going to learn that. But first I\u2019m installing a bar in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that, kid,\u201d Dan said, sipping his coffee.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a Coke, Jack?\u201d</p><p>Jack was speechless. Stunned. \u201cI...ah...need some glasses. \u2019Right back....\u201d</p><p>Jack escaped into the kitchen. He wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think that all Rick\u2019s adjustments had suddenly fallen into place, but in four months this was the first glimpse he\u2019d had of his boy, the boy he loved like a son, the boy he\u2019d gone all the way to Germany for, even though there\u2019d been a chance he\u2019d have to bring him home in a box.</p><p>He leaned on Preacher\u2019s worktable for a second, staring down, his breath coming hard and shallow. He felt the tears in his eyes and his heart pounded. For a while he didn\u2019t think it would ever happen. He\u2019d been afraid Rick was going to be mean and angry for the rest of his life when there was no young man Jack had ever known who used to be more filled with light and joy. Not in all his years. Rick was the finest example of a young man Jack could name.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Preacher asked. Jack looked up. \u201cAw, did you do it again? Did you wash the bar sink with that disinfectant and then touch your eyes? Christ, you are the slowest learner I know. Come on, come on over here and we\u2019ll rinse \u2019em. Flush \u2019em out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re rinsed,\u201d Jack said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta watch that, man! You\u2019re gonna go blind, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it. I need a rack of glasses,\u201d Jack said, sniffing.</p><p>\u201cI just put a rack out there not five minutes ago,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>Jack ground his teeth. Inside he felt as if he\u2019d just been born. But he said, \u201cGimme a rack of goddamn glasses, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cIf you drink a little of that disinfectant, might kill the bug up your ass.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>By the end of June, Rick and Liz had met with Jerry \u201cthe Spaceman\u201d Powell several times. It had been a hectic month for both of them. Rick was still going to physical therapy twice a week, but now he was driving himself. He\u2019d found himself a Toyota truck with an extended cab that would keep him in wheels for a few years; his monthly disability check covered the payments. And Liz was working two jobs, leaving only her mornings and Friday and Saturday nights free. They didn\u2019t have a lot of time together, but the time they did have was sweet.</p><p>There was something to be said for growing up with your mate, learning from each other as experimental kids, taking that knowledge to the next level. That guy from rehab in San Diego was right\u2014the prosthesis leaned right up against the wall while Rick and Liz made love. Tender, wonderful, sometimes a little wild, always satisfying love. The missing leg didn\u2019t seem to matter at all.</p><p>\u201cYou sure this is enough for you, Liz?\u201d Rick asked her. \u201cA guy with one leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, we have a lot of years ahead. There are going to be times I\u2019ll come up short, I just know it. I expect you to love me the same even in those times. Is that too much to expect out of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You\u2019re more than I can deserve in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo answer your question, I never even notice that the leg is gone. Really. The only time I notice is when you complain about the stump hurting. The truth is, I find you stronger. Braver. Smarter. I\u2019d say I love you even more, but that\u2019s just impossible.\u201d</p><p>After Liz and Rick had their Friday-afternoon appointment with Jerry, Rick would follow her back to Virgin River. They\u2019d go to the bar together where Liz would get her large cola to go on her way to work at her aunt\u2019s store and Rick would stay on for a while, visit with the neighbors, have dinner and meet Liz on his gram\u2019s front porch after the corner store closed.</p><p>So much had changed for both of them in just a few weeks. Rick was no longer the quiet and morose young man who kept his friends and neighbors at bay with unfriendliness. He looked forward to having that one beer a week with the guys, and even turned up at the bar more often, just to visit. And far from being embarrassed by his amputee status, he wore long shorts and laced boots, his prosthesis visible. And while his gait might be a little slow and at times unsteady, he no longer used a cane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On just such a typical Friday afternoon, Rick and Liz walked into Jack\u2019s, holding hands. They jumped up on bar stools and met with his grin. \u201cHey, kids, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarge cola to go,\u201d Liz said.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, sweetheart. Rick?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cOh, you know what I want. Cold draft, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up.\u201d Jack put it in front of him and asked Rick, \u201cYou starting to work out a little bit?\u201d</p><p>Rick took a sip and draped his arm around Liz\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSome light weights. But I\u2019ve gained about ten pounds since I\u2019ve been home.\u201d He gave Liz a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over to Connie\u2019s,\u201d she said, giving Rick a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, baby,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When she was gone, Jack lifted an eyebrow. \u201cLooks like things are going better for you and Liz these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter and better. I have some plans for the rest of the summer, starting with, I\u2019m going to help Paul part-time. I talked it over with him\u2014neither one of us knows how much help I\u2019ll be, but I\u2019m sure I can stay upright and hold a paintbrush. He said he might put Dan in charge of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrady,\u201d Jack laughed, shaking his head. \u201cWho would have guessed he\u2019d work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure out how he got up that hill so fast back when we were looking for Paige. I didn\u2019t see him do it, but remember? Before we knew it, he was up the hill and bonked that guy on the head, knocked him cold.\u201d Rick took a drink of his beer. \u201cHe said when I get a little more confident, he\u2019ll show me some one-legged tricks.\u201d Jack laughed.</p><p>\u201cI signed up for Redwoods\u2014I\u2019m going to school in the fall. I\u2019ll go with Liz.\u201d</p><p>Jack took a breath. \u201cKid, you don\u2019t know how good it makes me feel that you\u2019re making plans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be at Redwoods long,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be forced to leave the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like I won\u2019t be around,\u201d Rick said. \u201cYou\u2019re here. Gram\u2019s here. And who knows, I might be getting ahead of myself here, but I\u2019m interested in architecture. And there\u2019s no bachelor\u2019s program around here. Humboldt U doesn\u2019t have one in that major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchitecture? That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard that,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Me and Liz went over to Redwoods and Humboldt U, looking through all the catalogs. I met with a counselor, talked to some people. I\u2019m good at math and I like drawing and building. I talked to Paul a little bit. My main interests and abilities seem to lean toward architecture or engineering. I\u2019m thinking way ahead now, but it looks like I might aim for the University of Oregon in Eugene.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked down and wiped the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna get all funky about that?\u201d Rick asked. \u201cAbout me going away?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked up. \u201cRick, if I can send you off to the Marines and stay standing, I guess I can handle sending you off to college. I put a little something aside for that, you know. We talked about it. I\u2019d like to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack, you don\u2019t have to do that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot, Rick. When I said a little something, little was the operative word. You\u2019ll have the GI Bill, but you also have living expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sticking around through summer,\u201d Rick said. \u201cTo work, see what I can learn from Paul and gimpy Dan, to stick with Jerry the Spaceman for a while.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThat nutcase has some ideas that just fit in the slots, you know? One look at him and you\u2019d never guess it\u2014he\u2019s really such a dork. Toward the end of summer, before school starts, me and Liz are going to find a place of our own in Eureka. She\u2019s got a really good job at that Albertson\u2019s grocery. She thinks she can keep it while she goes to school. She might have to go to part-time if school is hard for her, but you know what? She\u2019s finding out she\u2019s way smarter than she thought she was.\u201d He grinned proudly.</p><p>\u201cSettling down?\u201d Jack asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cThis will be it,\u201d Rick said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving ahead. We\u2019ll live together now, that\u2019s how it has to be. Living apart isn\u2019t working for us anymore. You have to give us some credit\u2014we waited. We\u2019re not teenagers anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jack said cautiously, \u201cshe is.\u201d</p><p>Rick grinned. \u201cShe has till the end of August to change her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicky, buddy, did Liz talk you into this? I know she\u2019s always wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was my idea, Jack. It\u2019s just better with her. But we\u2019re trying not to move too fast. First we live together and do a year of Redwoods college and next summer we get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need each other, Jack. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone I counted on more than I did Liz. You, maybe, but you\u2019re just not as soft and cuddly.\u201d He grinned boyishly. Then more seriously, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in just finding things to keep me busy while we get older. Besides,\u201d he said, lifting his beer and taking a sip, \u201cwhen you think about it, we\u2019re not all that young. Maybe in years, but not in experience. Me and Liz, we had to grow up kinda fast. And the only thing that hasn\u2019t worked against us\u2014we never lost interest. We\u2019ve always loved each other. That\u2019s been put to the test a bunch of times.\u201d</p><p>Jack was quiet for a minute. Then very solemnly he said, \u201cThere\u2019s just one thing that worries me, Rick. You two, you\u2019ve gotten real good at holding each other up during the hard times. How about when there aren\u2019t any hard times? How will you hold up then? Will you take each other for granted? Get bored?\u201d</p><p>Rick cracked a big smile and let go a laugh. \u201cOh man! Please\u2014throw me in that briar patch, huh?\u201d</p><p>Jack turned away and pounded on the wall, bringing Preacher out of the kitchen with a pretty confused and interrupted look on his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d he scowled.</p><p>Jack was already drawing a couple of beers. \u201cRick\u2019s got some plans, Preach. Go ahead, Rick. Lay it on him.\u201d</p><p>Rick gave Preacher the condensed version. Unlike Jack, who was known to borrow trouble, especially where relationships were concerned, Preacher just stuck out a big hand. \u201cGood for you, Rick. Congratulations. I think you kids are due a few good breaks.\u201d Jack handed him a beer. \u201cHere\u2019s to you. You and Liz. I\u2019m real happy for you.\u201d</p><p>The three of them raised their glasses in a toast.</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI\u2019d never have made it through anything without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have made it without you either, buddy,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m real happy for you. And I\u2019m real damn proud of you, son.\u201d</p><p>Dan Brady had been meeting Cheryl in the park in Old Town Eureka every Sunday for a couple of months and looked forward to every one. Those afternoons became one of the highlights of his week. He took great pride in filling her in on all the Virgin River happenings, and while their lunch together had covered an hour in the early weeks, by the end of June it had stretched to almost three.</p><p>They had covered pasts that were difficult to overcome, for both of them. Some of that had to be talked about and put away if they were going to accept each other as friends. But once that was dispensed with, their picnics became an easy three hours, filled with storytelling and laughter and ending with an affectionate peck on the cheek. The kind casual friends gave each other. When he told her about the day he dropped his pants and took off his prosthetic limb to make a point for Rick, left hopping one-legged in the street, she laughed so hard she had tears running down her cheeks, and people in the park were staring.</p><p>Dan was no longer unsure of how he felt about her. Cheryl was no longer suspicious of Dan\u2019s motives.</p><p>He draped an arm along the back of the park bench while he talked to her. \u201cSo, Rick started working for Paul Haggerty, and Haggerty told me to keep him with me, to train him, keep an eye on him, make sure he didn\u2019t take on too much. Boy, if Rick knew Paul was looking out for him that way, it might piss him off. He\u2019s a lot better, but he\u2019s still got that edge of pride, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing on the job?\u201d Cheryl asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days and he\u2019s holding up pretty good. If he didn\u2019t have a new prosthesis, I\u2019d have him hauling trash. But I\u2019m teaching him drywall and texturing. I figure anyone can paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone but me,\u201d she laughed. \u201cThere must be a trick to it. I tried to paint my bedroom where I\u2019m staying. It looks like I went after the walls with a scouring pad and dirty white paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How\u2019d you like me to fix that up for you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. But I wouldn\u2019t mind if you told me the secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo secret, kiddo. Good brushes, good paint on a clean wall and a primer if the wall isn\u2019t going to hold the paint\u2014like if you stripped off wallpaper and there was some backing left. People run into trouble when they buy the cheap stuff or don\u2019t prime a wall that needs it. I can show you how to use masking tape and caulk to make a straight line.\u201d He ran a knuckle along her cheek. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we fix it up together. I\u2019ll give you some tips so you never need me for painting again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to tempt me into letting you get closer into my life,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cTempting me with paint.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cNo. I\u2019m looking for an invitation to your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are five women living in that house. If you\u2019re ever in that bedroom, it\u2019ll be for painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be embarrassed?\u201d he asked her, lifting his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou might be attacked. Only one of the five has had a man in her life in the last millennium. And it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheryl, I don\u2019t want to scare you, but I think maybe you have a man in your life now. You just haven\u2019t had sex. That I know of,\u201d he added with a shrug.</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWhat have I done, getting mixed up with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s been nice. Admit it,\u201d he said, leaning toward her and brushing his lips against hers. \u201cNice. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you know I don\u2019t want to get into anything complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, Cheryl, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to mislead you. I didn\u2019t have anything complicated in mind...\u201d Then he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve used that line on me before.\u201d She put a hand against his cheek, then she grew briefly serious. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty screwed-up people, you and me. We have some heavy past issues. What if we get together, then go back to being those screwed-up miserable people and take each other down into the hole?\u201d</p><p>He thought about this for a moment, looking deeply into her eyes. \u201cHoney, I\u2019ve been there, down in that hole. I\u2019m not going back that way. You can\u2019t make me. And I, for God\u2019s sake, have no interest in ruining you. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cToday? I\u2019m thinking a real kiss, arms around each other, pressed close, wet and sloppy and longer than half a second. And then, I think I\u2019ll call you Wednesday night after work, just to see how your day was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an AA meeting Wednesday night....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could tell me what time is good to call. I\u2019m very flexible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of these days I\u2019d like to take you out to a nice dinner. Nothing scary or fancy, just nice. Quiet, good food, a place to talk while we eat where there\u2019s no risk of bird shit. I don\u2019t expect you to miss a meeting, I could pick you up afterward. Get you home early enough to get some rest before the early shift at the diner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a couple of days off a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI could hit an early meeting and we could actually have dinner at dinnertime.\u201d Then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fighting me on the idea,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cSo far you haven\u2019t suggested anything that I ought to beware of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney, I have no interest in scaring you.\u201d He rubbed that knuckle along the smooth skin of her jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty and smart and being with you is good. If it\u2019s good for you, too, we\u2019ll keep going. The second it stops being what you want, all you have to do is say so.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and smiled. \u201cIf I\u2019d run into someone like you years ago\u2014 Aw, forget it, that had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just this trap alcoholics sometimes get tempted by. Like if my life had been better, I wouldn\u2019t have been a drunk. The truth is, my life wasn\u2019t better because I\u2019m an alcoholic. It had to do with addiction, not luck or intelligence or the right man.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI sensed a suggestion that you might almost think I\u2019m the right man.\u201d</p> <p>She patted his cheek. \u201cYou seem to be working out so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put in appliances in a couple of weeks. That old place of yours is starting to shape up nice. Any interest in seeing it?\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dan. I know you\u2019ve worked hard and spent good money. I don\u2019t mean to downplay that. It\u2019s just that house, you know? I hate who I was when I was there. Just stepping in the door, even when it\u2019s all fixed up, takes me back. I hate it. I don\u2019t care if I ever see it again. And I\u2019m so sorry because that must hurt your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, pressing her hand against his cheek again. \u201cNot a problem. In fact, why don\u2019t I just finish the job fast as it can get done and you can put it up for sale, get it out of your life. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014I\u2019ll snap a few pictures for you. That way you can get an idea what I\u2019ve done and not have to walk through the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I sell it, where will you live?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll find something.\u201d Then he smiled. \u201cMaybe something a little closer to you, if you don\u2019t think that\u2019s too pushy.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, honey, you\u2019re one of the most special women I\u2019ve known. I\u2019m real sorry you lived so many years without knowing that, but if that\u2019s what it took to get you to this place in your life, good for you. I\u2019m proud of you. Plus, I\u2019m just plain attracted to you. Sorry, it\u2019s the God\u2019s truth, but don\u2019t get worried. I can deal with the fact that you turn me on.\u201d He grinned. Then he became serious. \u201cCheryl, you\u2019re sweet. Good to the bone, kind-hearted, strong, beautiful, so easy to talk to...\u201d Tears started to run down her cheeks. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, wiping away a tear with his thumb. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m pushing on you\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and sniffed. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever talked to me like that before. No one\u2019s ever said those things about me before.\u201d She sniffed again. \u201cI think that\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me.\u201d Then she got a scowl on her tear-stained face. \u201cDan Brady, if you\u2019re playing me to get in my pants, I\u2019m going to shoot you dead.\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter and pulled her against him. \u201cOkay, Cheryl. If it turns out I\u2019m one of those no-account losers just looking to get laid, you go ahead and kill me. But if you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll wait till I get that god-awful bathroom remodeled. Jesus, that\u2019s going to be a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled in his embrace. \u201cDon\u2019t make me shoot you dead,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, darlin\u2019,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHow about a phone call on Wednesday night and you see if you can wrangle a night for dinner. That work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s gonna work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome a little closer. Press up against me here, right on this bench. Kiss me like a girlfriend, I want to see if I should go to the trouble of calling Wednesday night.\u201d She scooted closer. He threaded his fingers into her soft hair, cradling the back of her head in his palm. He pulled her mouth against his and let his eyes lower as he moved over her mouth slowly, deliberately, deliciously. Their heads tilted for a better fit; their lips parted and they both moaned softly. They didn\u2019t hurry. When the kiss broke, he smiled very sweetly. \u201cMight not call Wednesday,\u201d he said. \u201cMight have to call Tuesday. And Thursday. Unless I\u2019m crazy, you\u2019re ready for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s about all I\u2019m ready for....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI like the job of talking you into things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity, do you make love with the fake leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cI make love with lips, fingers, words and essential body parts. It\u2019s been a really long time, but I think once I get in the stream of things, I\u2019ll remember how it\u2019s done.\u201d He gave her forehead a kiss. \u201cYou worried about it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me plenty of time, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and brushed her hair over her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you anything you need.\u201d</p><p>Walt Booth leaned against his truck in the small parking lot at the Garberville airport, the runway on the other side of a fence. Muriel had called him from the jet shortly after takeoff to tell him when she\u2019d arrive. The studio Lear was dropping her in northern California and then proceeding to L.A. with the director and another actor. It wasn\u2019t long before the aircraft was in sight. He watched a perfect landing, then the Lear taxied to the boarding area. Airstairs popped out and Muriel was the only one to deplane.</p><p>She returned as she had left, wearing jeans, boots, a light suede jacket even though it was almost July, and the cowboy hat. She was followed down the stairs by the uniformed cabin steward who handed her a small carry-on bag. But unlike at her departure, she now had more luggage and a very large suitcase had to be retrieved from the baggage compartment. She shook the steward\u2019s hand and pulled her bag behind her on its own wheels.</p><p>Walt had told her exactly where he\u2019d be waiting. He pushed his hat back on his head, crossed one long leg over another, his thumbs hooked into the front pockets of his jeans, and waited for her to come through the small building that served as passenger check-in, dispatch, offices. He enjoyed the sight as she walked toward him, admiring her long, slim legs. She stopped a few feet away from him and smiled. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust about done,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cJust about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to travel some when it\u2019s out, do some promo. And there will be events\u2014Cannes, the Oscars, Golden Globes, that sort of thing.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll have to get manicures and pedicures and special gowns. And you\u2019ll have to let me dress you up for that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t argue about this, would you? I want you with me for things like that. I want you right beside me, and we\u2019re leaving the pitchfork at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be kind of coming out to the world, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would,\u201d she affirmed.</p><p>\u201cSpoil your chances of getting it on with your personal trainer, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy personal trainer is named Helga, and most of the time I hate her!\u201d He laughed at her, tilting his head back. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to fly to Montana every couple of weeks. You should be thankful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might miss Montana,\u201d he said. \u201cGood things happened with us in Montana. Full weekends of good things.\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to laugh. \u201cI can make sure you don\u2019t miss Montana too much.\u201d</p><p>He grew serious. \u201cI\u2019m so damn glad you\u2019re back. I can see you every day.\u201d</p><p>She stepped toward him, leaving her suitcase behind. She put her hands on his shoulders and he put his on her waist.</p><p>\u201cI need to fatten you up a little,\u201d he teased. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeight I could stand to lose, too. Just being with you seems to plump me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worn out, honey?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m so looking forward to lying in your arms tonight for a good long sleep. Do we have obligations?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI told Vanni you were coming home this afternoon and that I would be indisposed for at least twenty-four hours. We\u2019ll catch up with all of them on the weekend.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer and swept the hat off her head, pressing his lips to her forehead. Just as he did that, there was a click-whir click-whir click. They both turned their heads toward the sound, startled. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJesus, that makes no sense,\u201d she said, spying a photographer with a powerful camera sneaking up on them from behind a parked car. \u201cMe? Why would anyone want a shot of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s who you\u2019re spending time with that\u2019s the news,\u201d Walt said with a shrug. He pulled her closer against him. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure there isn\u2019t any doubt about that.\u201d And he swept over her mouth with powerful intentions and, just as he had secretly hoped, the clicking went on and on and on. When he let the kiss run its course, he pulled back just a little and laughed. \u201cThat ought to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was very unlike you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally like that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel, honey, I\u2019m dead in love with you and it suits me just fine for the whole world to know it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll let me dress you up for the production events?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead in love with you, too, darling. And so damn glad to be home. Where I hope to stay for a good long time. And, you\u2019re going to wear whatever I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my aim to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek and smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do just fine, you and I. Let\u2019s get out of here and be alone a while. I need some peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Virgin River?\u201d he said with a hearty laugh. \u201cGirl, this little town can fill up with more drama than your movie set.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
