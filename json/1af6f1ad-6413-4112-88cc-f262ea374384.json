But, hey, at least Gloriana St. Clair still had a lover to meet. There had been some nights recently when I\u2019d been afraid I\u2019d have to give celibacy another shot. You think a woman PMSing is bad? Try taking on a celibate vampire. But no worries. My guy was waiting just around the corner.</p><p>I adjusted my black \u201cCher in the eighties\u201d wig, slung my purse over my shoulder and navigated the alley in my five-inch heels.</p><p>\u201cJeez, something reeks.\u201d Valdez, my bodyguard, sniffed.</p> <p>\u201cYou got that right. Even ritzy hotels have bad garbage.\u201d I had a leash attached to him, but God forbid I actually tug on it. We gave the Dumpster a wide berth and walked right into a guy with a camera. Guys with cameras were the reason we were sneaking out the back door in the first place.</p><p>Camera Guy looked me over, trying to figure out if I was \u201cSomebody.\u201d Then he eyed the dog on the end of the leash. Apparently even the canine failed the test.</p><p>\u201cForget it. I\u2019m getting out of this pit and hitting the front door.\u201d The photographer snorted in disgust.</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I heard Usher\u2019s coming down.\u201d I saw him sprint away and glanced down at Valdez. \u201cYour disguise did the trick. Mine is pretty lame. Anyone can throw on a wig and sunglasses. But yours is the bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I tell ya? I\u2019m brilliant.\u201d Valdez grinned and practically dragged me to the street. \u201cBlade\u2019s here. He\u2019s got Flo and Richard with him.\u201d</p> <p>I still couldn\u2019t get used to my shape-shifting dog\u2019s new look. A Rottweiler. Cute, with his pink tongue and black mouth, but he looked a lot more dangerous than his usual curly coated Labradoodle self. Then I saw Blade, Jeremy Blade, my four-hundred-year-plus lover and the man who\u2019d made me vampire all those centuries ago. Then he\u2019d been known as Angus Jeremiah Campbell III, heir to Clan Campbell. With his father an immortal vamp too, though, it didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d be laird anytime soon. Which was fine by me. It left him free to roam the world. Lately that had included following me to Austin and now this little trip to Los Angeles.</p><p>I stopped and checked him out. He always looked so good to me. Tall, buff and sexy as hell. But tonight he was in a Hollywood-style white silk shirt that made the most of his dark hair and eyes. Add expensive trousers with loafers and no socks and I wondered if some stylist had gotten hold of him.</p><p>Before I could ask, he had me in his arms and up against all that hard maleness. Yum. He tasted delicious, and I could feel his fangs when he kissed me. Great start to my evening.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you too, Jerry.\u201d I grinned up at him when he let me come up for air.</p><p>\u201cYou look very sexy. Forget going out. Let\u2019s go back to my hotel room, Gloriana.\u201d He obviously appreciated the effort I\u2019d taken with my wardrobe choice.</p><p>When you\u2019ve got too much in the caboose like I do, you learn to play up your assets. So I\u2019d chosen a plunging neckline with blue sparkles that matched my eyes. Add a push-up bra and I guarantee male eyes never went below my personal equator. I\u2019d put on a twirly skirt in black with some strappy black heels that were just made for dancing. So no hotel room. I wanted to hit some clubs.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out, Jerry. I\u2019m sure Flo is with me on this.\u201d I pushed him toward the car he\u2019d rented.</p><p>Do you wonder why we\u2019re not staying at the same hotel? Why we\u2019re sneaking around Dumpsters? Gee, nosey, aren\u2019t you? Okay, it\u2019s like this. I\u2019m pretending to be engaged to a newly turned vampire, rock star Israel Caine. Since I\u2019m indirectly responsible for his \u201ccondition,\u201d I\u2019m mentoring him, helping him deal with the complications. Like no daytime gigs. You see where I\u2019m going with this? So when the paparazzi, like that guy I just avoided by the Dumpster, kept seeing us together, they assumed we were an item. Ray (all his friends call him Ray) decided to go along with it, and next thing you know, we\u2019re pretending to be engaged.</p><p>Now, I know I should have called a halt to things, but, sue me, I kind of groove on the idea of the world thinking I\u2019m a rock star\u2019s main squeeze. I mean, me, slightly chubby Glory St. Clair, who is nobody, living in the fast lane? I\u2019m just the \u201cbarely making ends meet\u201d owner of a vintage-clothing shop in Austin, Texas, and a sort-of ancient vampire, yet I\u2019m engaged to a rock star. How cool is that?</p><p>And Ray is totally hot, sexy and when he sings . . . I was hooked on his music before he\u2019d ever been dumped on me. Literally. Then he turned out to be a great guy and\u2014would you believe it?\u2014into me. I know, I thought I was dreaming. Sure, it\u2019s 90 percent gratitude for saving his life. Whatever.</p><p>It made Jerry superjealous. And that\u2019s not such a bad thing in a long-term relationship. Guys can get to taking you for granted after the first few centuries. Anyway, Ray\u2019s up for a Grammy. And the awards are in a week. So we\u2019re here in Hollywood. Israel Caine and Gloriana St. Clair, the happy couple. I promised Jerry I\u2019d break up with Ray when we got back to Austin. After I get to wear the fabulous dress a designer is whipping up for me as we speak. For when we walk the red carpet. You see why I couldn\u2019t dump Ray just yet?</p><p>Now, can we get back to me sneaking out to meet Jerry? Ray\u2019s at press briefings, or rehearsals or something. He doesn\u2019t need me so I arranged to go out, discreetly, of course. Ray knows I\u2019m really with Jerry. No big deal, darn it. Except Ray had insisted on separate hotels so maybe he\u2019s a little jealous. Hmm.</p><p>My best friend, Flo, and her husband, Richard, came along on Jerry\u2019s chartered jet (yeah, Jerry\u2019s rich). Now I want to have fun. And not just one-on-one in a hotel room. We can do that, and have done that, many times, in Austin. All over the world, for that matter. And, after some dancing, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do it again\u2014I gave Jerry a hot look\u2014and again.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to wait?\u201d Jerry had read my mind and his own mental message promised all kinds of special services while his hand slid over my backside.</p> <p>Valdez tugged on his leash and I snapped back to the here and now.</p><p>\u201cAnticipation makes everything better.\u201d I grinned and patted Jerry\u2019s cheek. \u201cHi, guys. I love this car. You rented this, Jerry?\u201d A vintage white Cadillac convertible with red leather interior sat at the curb. The top was down and three vampires lounged in the backseat. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo talked me into it. She said the Mercedes I was going for was stuffy.\u201d Jerry grinned. \u201cShe picked out the clothes too. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Florence da Vinci should be on your payroll as your stylist.\u201d I ran my finger in between Jerry\u2019s button holes to the smooth skin of his chest. \u201cYou look unbelievably hot.\u201d I leaned in and ran my mouth along his jugular. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how hot later. She tell you to go commando?\u201d I felt Jerry swallow against my lips.</p><p>\u201cFlo, you\u2019re hired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. See, Jeremiah? You must always listen to me, caro.\u201d Flo jumped up on her knees. \u201cGlory, that wig is not your color. You should have gone for a deep auburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to take what I could get, Flo. Barry, Ray\u2019s publicist, brought it to me. Maybe you can find me something better for tomorrow night.\u201d I smiled at Richard, then at the man on Flo\u2019s other side. \u201cDamian, didn\u2019t know you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided you needed a guide. I know this area. You want to explore the vampire scene here? I\u2019m your man. There\u2019s a club on Hollywood Boulevard you must go to.\u201d Damian Sabatini, Flo\u2019s brother, winked. \u201cJeremiah isn\u2019t crazy about the idea, but I say, what\u2019s the harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many vampires in one place is asking for trouble.\u201d</p><p>I slipped into the front passenger seat, laughing when the grumbling in the back started. Because there was nowhere else for Valdez to go. The front had a console and there was a seat belt law. So the three vamps in the backseat had to make room for my pooch.</p><p>I don\u2019t go anywhere without my dog slash bodyguard. Not my rule\u2014Jerry\u2019s. Since he\u2019s paid for a succession of Valdezes for centuries, even when Jerry and I aren\u2019t a couple, I go along with it. It\u2019s a safety issue. Valdez makes me feel protected. A single girl can\u2019t be too careful, you know. And I\u2019ve had some close calls lately. Not everyone loves me. Can you imagine that?</p><p>Jerry drove and Damian gave him directions. It was a cool, clear night and traffic was heavy but moving. Flo and I had fun spotting famous boutiques along Rodeo Drive. Many of them were open late and we promised ourselves a shopping trip another night. Not that I could afford anything in those shops, but I did have enough credit on one of my cards to splurge on something if we could find a resale shop.</p><p>When Jerry pulled up in front of an art gallery, Flo and I looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? I thought we were going dancing.\u201d I leaned over the backseat. \u201cDamian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here. But in back. Behind the gallery. We\u2019ll enter through the alley.\u201d Damian told Jerry where to park and we were soon on the sidewalk.</p><p>There was plenty of people-watching here. Interesting. And not just humans in the swim. There were the usual Goths, vamp wannabees and tourists clicking away with their digital cameras. But there were other entities too. The real deal who looked more human than the humans. They exchanged knowing looks with us as we window-shopped various galleries and headed for a narrow gap between buildings. The fearful wouldn\u2019t have ventured down the dark walkway. We zipped along at vamp speed.</p><p>I was glad to be in the gloom and eager to see what a real vampire club looked like. I\u2019d avoided them in the cities I\u2019d been in before, not sure I\u2019d be safe as a woman without a protector. Now, surrounded by Blade, Richard, Damian and Valdez, I figured that I had an army at my back. And, hey, Flo and I could kick butt ourselves.</p><p>The door in the alley was painted gray and had an old-fashioned hatch in it. Like a speakeasy I\u2019d been to once, back in the roaring twenties. Damian dialed a number with his cell phone, proving that this was twenty-first-century stuff, and the hatch opened. A man\u2019s face appeared, his nose quivered, then he glanced at us before he nodded and threw open the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d The man was dressed in L.A. evening wear. Expensive, casual and mostly black. He was tall, slim and vampire. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the shifter will have to wait outside unless he wishes to assume a more human form.\u201d</p><p>Not a conventionally handsome guy, but I wouldn\u2019t toss him out of my bed. Hey, figure of speech. I glanced at Jerry and smiled. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t reading my mind; he was busy assessing the environment, checking for dangers, that kind of thing. Once a warrior, always a warrior.</p><p>\u201cNo, the shifter will wait out here.\u201d Jerry signaled Valdez, who grumbled, but settled next to the door outside.</p> <p>Inside, there was music with a good beat, loud enough to encourage dancing, and a lighted floor crowded with couples. Some were same sex; some weren\u2019t. A bar in the corner was also crowded and I could see martini glasses being drained. Either they were selling synthetics or they had a supply of the real deal. My nose told me there was some fresh on hand and I was suddenly very thirsty. There was lots of chrome and glass and shiny gray walls that seemed to glow until the lights were dimmed as the music slowed. The effect was very urban chic, not the \u201cdark, creepy crypt\u201d thing that a mortal would expect from a vampire club.</p><p>Our greeter was still by Jerry\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019ll need a credit card from one of you to run a tab. There\u2019s a cover, plus if you want to use one of the donors, we have private booths. I can get you a menu if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Damian handed him a Platinum Card.</p><p>The vamp smiled and showed fangs. \u201cI\u2019m Stephen, your host tonight. Let me know if you need something or someone you don\u2019t see on the menu.\u201d He snapped his fingers and a woman in a skimpy costume \u00e0 la Star Wars handed each of us a laminated card. \u201cAnd if you need an explanation of any of our choices, just ask your waitress. Let me lead you to a table.\u201d He took off across the crowded room and I, for one, wasn\u2019t going to let him out of my sight.</p><p>Wow! Talk about a menu. What was a \u201cTrain Wreck\u201d? And what about a \u201cThree Alarm\u201d? Since my shop had been firebombed, I really didn\u2019t have the urge to check out anything to do with fire. Unless . . . three donors? Damian grinned and winked at me, obviously reading my mind. Hmm. Guess I was being too literal.</p> <p>I did see that they sold fresh AB negative by the glass, hopefully from a blood bank somewhere. I\u2019d sworn off feeding from humans. Stephen got us a round table near the dance floor and introduced Mandy, another barely dressed space cadet, as our waitress. Soon we each had a glass of our favorite blood type in front of us and I was ready to dance.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jerry. They\u2019re playing our song.\u201d I pulled him to his feet. I dropped my wig and sunglasses on the table.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard this song before.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Of course he hadn\u2019t. Jerry\u2019s not exactly into rock bands. I stay very current. Because I believe in blending with my environment. As a rocker\u2019s girlfriend, I\u2019d been really into this kind of music lately.</p><p>\u201cHumor me, Jerry. Just stand there and look good and I\u2019ll dance around you.\u201d I leaned into him and gave him an encouraging kiss. That got him headed in the right direction and we were soon moving to the music.</p><p>When things slowed down and the lights dimmed to almost complete black except for the glowing pedestals under each table and the base of the bar, he pulled me into his arms. He\u2019d taken some dance lessons not too long ago, but forget those. This was all about bodies and a rhythm that had more to do with sex than dancing. I held on to him and breathed in his yummy male essence. The music sped up, the lights got brighter and I\u2019d just about decided that Jerry\u2019s hotel room was the right place for us after all when I felt a hand land on my back.</p> <p>\u201cGloria Simmons! I swear to God, I never thought I\u2019d see you here in L.A.\u201d</p><p>I turned, ready to deny the alias, though that had been the name I\u2019d gone by in Vegas for almost two decades. But when I saw who it was, I forgot all about denials.</p><p>\u201cSheri!\u201d I threw my arms around her neck. I\u2019d had one good vampire friend in those days, and Sheri had been it. I\u2019d told her I was leaving town and intended to keep in touch, but the e-mails had dwindled lately. \u201cIt\u2019s Glory St. Clair now. This is Jeremy Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me this isn\u2019t the Scotsman you were pining for all those years.\u201d Sheri looked Jerry over from head to toe. \u201cGirl, you were crazy for avoiding him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I keep telling her.\u201d Jerry pulled both of us off the dance floor toward our table. \u201cGloria Simmons was your name in Las Vegas. Glory didn\u2019t really dance topless, did she, Sheri?\u201d</p><p>Sheri winked at me. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she? She\u2019s got the perfect equipment.\u201d She threw back her shoulders, stunning in a short red dress cut low in front. The clingy material made it clear her dancer\u2019s body was perfect. I\u2019d always used tricks to make mine look good.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sheri. It really is great to see you. Remember, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.\u201d I winked back at her and smiled at Jerry.</p><p>\u201cI hear ya. But, Glory, honey, you should come back. I\u2019ve got a part in the new vampire show. You\u2019d love it. They want you to wear fake fangs, even troll through the casino in them.\u201d She laughed and tossed her dark hair. \u201cThey figure I\u2019m one of their best erotic angels. \u2019Cause I wear my fangs everywhere I go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSheri, you\u2019ve got to meet my other friends.\u201d I didn\u2019t see Flo and Richard but Damian strolled up to the table, a full glass in his hand. \u201cDamian, meet my old friend Sheri LaDouce. Sheri, this is Damian Sabatini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, this year it\u2019s Sherry Landolt. You know how it is.\u201d She turned and got an eyeful of Damian. \u201cWell, hello there.\u201d</p><p>In typical Damian fashion, he picked up her hand and pulled it to his lips. \u201cBonjour, mademoiselle. Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais oui.\u201d Sheri fluttered her eyelashes. \u201cLet\u2019s cut the foreign stuff. Glory never could get her mouth around any of that. But it makes for wonderful pillow talk, don\u2019t you think, cheri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I think we already speak the same language.\u201d Damian grinned at me. \u201cI love your friend. Will you dance, Sheri?\u201d He gestured at our waitress, pressed some bills in her hand and in moments, the lights dimmed again and there was another slow, sensual song playing.</p><p>\u201cOh, boy, I think I\u2019m going to have my hands full, literally.\u201d Sheri laughed and let herself be pulled toward the dance floor. \u201cNice meeting you, Jeremy. See ya, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you warn her about Damian?\u201d Jerry looked like he wanted to go after the couple.</p><p>\u201cShould I warn Damian about her is the question.\u201d I laughed and sat at the table. Damian\u2019s a Casanova type, but I knew Sheri was more than a match for him. \u201cYou should have seen her operate in Vegas. Sheri never has money problems because she always has a sugar daddy. Damian better get that Platinum Card ready. Before Sheri gets through with him, she\u2019ll have shopped Rodeo Drive from one end to the other, courtesy of his plastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her. He can afford it. Now, about that topless thing.\u201d Jerry stared at my cleavage. \u201cI know you\u2019d look good, Glory, but the thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s Flo and Richard. I wonder if they found out what a \u2018Train Wreck\u2019 is.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to let Jerry know if I\u2019d danced topless or not. I figure a little mystery in a relationship is a good thing.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you\u2019ll never guess who we just met.\u201d Flo sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bogus. Don\u2019t get her stirred up about this nonsense.\u201d Richard sat and tapped his fingers on the table. He looked as handsome as Jerry did, but Richard is white blond and tanned with bright blue eyes. Obviously Flo had picked out his wardrobe too and he had a \u201cBeverly Hills hottie\u201d look to him that had other women in the room licking their lips. I\u2019m sure Flo had been busy sending mental messages to those vamps to back off or die.</p><p>\u201cYou never know, Ricardo. It might be true. I owe it to my best friend to let her know, amante, that what she thought is impossible could be possible.\u201d Flo grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What\u2019s impossible?\u201d I winced. Flo\u2019s got a grip on her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man here tonight. He\u2019s famous among the Los Angeles vampires. He claims he can make anyone, even vampires, lose weight.\u201d Flo frowned down at her thighs and I wanted to slap her. Excuse me? They were barely a six. What did she want? A four?</p><p>Wait. Had I heard her right? Not possible. Back in 1604 when Jerry had turned me vampire after I\u2019d begged him to\u2014so we could be together forever\u2014I\u2019d been \u201chealthy.\u201d I mean, women who carried some extra weight back then were voluptuous and proud of it. So I didn\u2019t think ahead. If I\u2019d known then what I know now, I\u2019d have fasted a few days before the big turning. Lost ten pounds or so first. But, no, Glory was bloating, or at least that\u2019s my story and I\u2019m sticking to it. So I was stuck forever with hips that would have been great for delivering twelve-pound babies if I\u2019d ever had that option. And thighs . . . Well, God knows if I were a Thanksgiving turkey, entire Pilgrim villages could have feasted on one of my thighs.</p><p>\u201cFlorence da Vinci. Are you telling me that there\u2019s a man here who says he can help a vampire lose weight?\u201d I stood. Ready to ambush this guy and use every bit of my credit limit for a shot at skinny.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, stop this nonsense. You\u2019re perfect. Why would you want to lose weight?\u201d Jerry stood beside me and patted my rump. Wrong move.</p><p>I turned slowly and looked him in the eye. He must have seen something there, because big, brave warrior Jerry actually backed up a step.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever pat my butt in public again.\u201d I said this past the fangs that had shot down into my mouth like maybe I was thinking about ripping out Jerry\u2019s throat. Overreaction? Maybe. But, come on. Do you like having your fat ass patted in public? Why not just shine a spotlight on it? Or hang a sign? Hey, world, look at my lady\u2019s big butt. I just couldn\u2019t take it at that moment. Not when I suddenly, against all reason and rational thinking, had a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I might finally be able to do something about a problem that had weighed me down for centuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I reached for my vintage black satin bag and pulled out my lipstick, quickly slicking on a fresh coat. Then I checked my hair by feel. Damn, Jerry had flattened one side when he nuzzled my neck during our slow dance. I finger combed it and glanced at Flo.</p><p>\u201cYou look great. He\u2019s in one of the booths over by the exit. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Flo frowned down at Richard\u2019s hand on her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of stopping me, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like his looks. I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d Richard exchanged stares with Jerry.</p><p>\u201cYou spent two minutes with the man. He was surrounded by beautiful women.\u201d Flo\u2019s smile was tight. \u201cBeautiful, skinny bitches who got more than a casual glance from you, caro. If you don\u2019t want to sleep on the floor, I suggest you demonstrate your trust, eh?\u201d</p><p>Richard backed up, his hands in the air. \u201cDid I say I didn\u2019t trust you, my heart? It\u2019s the man I don\u2019t trust. I\u2019m just suggesting to Blade that he go with Gloriana, see the man for himself. Assess the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssess this, Richard.\u201d I got up in his face. \u201cI can decide for myself who I trust or not.\u201d I whipped around when I heard a sound from Jerry. \u201cYou will not come with me. I know you don\u2019t get that this is important to me. Tough. I want to meet the guy. I\u2019m going to meet the guy.\u201d Damn it, I was shaking and my stomach was in a knot. And it didn\u2019t take mind reading to know that Jerry thought this was a silly overreaction. Well, what did I expect? I took a breath and changed strategies.</p><p>\u201cJerry, lover, I know you appreciate my curves.\u201d I wrapped my arms around his waist and leaned against him. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I love you. You\u2019ve always accepted me just as I am.\u201d I looked up and smiled, then kissed his strong chin. \u201cBut times have changed and thin is in. I want to see what this guy has to say. Humor me and stay here. Talk to Richard. Read the menu. Hey, check out the Train Wreck.\u201d I glanced at the curtained booths. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t involve rescuing beautiful naked women from the caboose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe only caboose I\u2019m interested in is yours, which is perfect, by the way.\u201d Jerry grinned and held me close, smart enough this time not to touch the caboose area. \u201cHurry, and you and I can play Train Wreck back at my hotel.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his smiling lips and patted his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s a date. Flo, let\u2019s go. What\u2019s this guy\u2019s name anyway?\u201d</p><p>Flo glanced at Jerry. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you on the way. Come on. I think he was leaving and I don\u2019t want you to miss him.\u201d She grabbed my hand and dragged me across the room. \u201cRichard, no beautiful naked women for you either, amante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than enough woman for me, Florence.\u201d Richard\u2019s voice was amused as we left the men behind.</p><p>As soon as we were on the other side of the dance floor and the music was back to a loud rock song, I dragged Flo to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to tell me this guy\u2019s name in front of Jerry? What\u2019s up, Flo?\u201d I studied my friend. She looked perfect as usual\u2014red wrap dress and high, high heels that brought her up to my chin. Her dark hair was in a new tousled do that looked like the work of a high-priced L.A. beautician. She glanced back at our table, but the crowds of paranormals at play blocked our view.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Scot. I think Jeremiah might know him. And not in a good way.\u201d Flo bit her bottom lip. New shade of lipstick. I was definitely going to have to find out the name. The red reminded me of\u2014</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re not that big on history. At least not Scotland\u2019s, as far as I know. Unless he\u2019s an artist.\u201d I grabbed her arm. \u201cWho is this guy? Did he say something to make you think he knows Jerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve heard this name before. You know I\u2019m friends with Magdalena and Angus. They don\u2019t like the men of this\u2014how they call it?\u2014clan.\u201d Flo made a face. \u201cFoolish feuds. But they\u2019ve hated each other for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Angus and Mag, Jerry\u2019s parents. Angus likes me okay, but Mag hates me with a passion usually reserved for head lice and bad haircuts. I knew of only one clan that the Campbells had a real hate on for.</p><p>Damian walked up, Sheri by his side. \u201cThere you two are. Florence, I\u2019ve been keeping Ian here like you asked, but he\u2019s ready to leave. Gloriana, you won\u2019t believe this guy. Actually claims he can make a vampire lose pounds and inches.\u201d Damian laughed and slung his arm around my waist. \u201cStay away from him. You don\u2019t need to do either.\u201d He slid a hand dangerously close to no-man-but-Jerry\u2019s-land, and I grabbed his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Damian, but I want to hear what he has to say anyway. Would you go get him and introduce us? Please?\u201d I knew better than to take his flirting seriously, but I couldn\u2019t deny it felt good to have a handsome man making that kind of move on me.</p><p>\u201cAt your service, cara. Always. Remember that the next time Blade leaves the country.\u201d He winked, then disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>I sighed, then noticed Flo and Sheri checking each other out. \u201cSheri, this is Florence da Vinci Mainwaring, my best girlfriend in Austin. Flo, Sheri Landolt, my best girlfriend in Las Vegas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Damian\u2019s sister, right?\u201d Sheri smiled and nodded. \u201cBet you\u2019ve got some great stories about your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah, forget him. I want to hear about Las Vegas. Did you and Glory really dance topless?\u201d Flo moved closer. \u201cI would like to do that, but I\u2019m so short, you see. Do you think they would have a place for me in the chorus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it, Flo. Your husband would have a fit if you danced like that for anyone but him. And, trust me, dancing in high heels while balancing a gigantic headdress night after night isn\u2019t as much fun as it sounds. Am I right, Sheri?\u201d</p><p>Sheri said something to Flo about the killer heels while I zeroed in on Damian coming toward us, and the tall man walking beside him. Obviously this was the diet guru, though he looked more like a Viking warrior with his long blond hair, hawklike features and blue eyes. Damian said something and those brilliant blue eyes suddenly zeroed in on me. They were so penetrating that I threw up a shield to keep him from reading my thoughts. And my thoughts? Those naughty girls were stripping the finely tailored suit off his buff body and imagining him in a loincloth and at my mercy.</p><p>The men shouldered their way through the crowd toward us, leaving women and several men panting in their wake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still like to try it at least once. If only to see the look on Ricardo\u2019s face.\u201d Flo laughed and turned to check out what I was staring at. \u201cHmm. Molto bello. Eh, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d I couldn\u2019t drag myself back from the fantasy of peeking under the loincloth. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Damian stopped in front of us and smiled. \u201cGloriana, allow me to introduce Ian MacDonald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d I clapped a hand over my mouth. But honestly, things had just gone to hell in a big way.</p><p>Ian laughed and held out his hand. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a first. Good evening, Gloriana. What did I do to deserve such an enthusiastic greeting?\u201d</p><p>I took his hand, drawn to the twinkle in his eyes and the flash of his white, white teeth. His grip was firm and too brief. I bit back a sigh.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, Ian. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re a MacDonald and I\u2019m here with a Campbell. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of him. Angus Jeremiah Campbell III.\u201d I winced when Ian\u2019s face lost its charm and he spat something in what I figured was the old language. His hand went to his back in a gesture I knew well. Jerry did the same thing in certain situations. Reaching for his broadsword. Didn\u2019t have it on him, of course. Just a reflex. But I knew Jerry carried a knife hidden in his waistband under his shirt. Did Ian? I hoped I didn\u2019t have to find out.</p><p>\u201cRelax, my friend. This is the twenty-first century. Surely old feuds can be forgotten.\u201d Damian clapped Ian on the shoulder and looked over the crowd, obviously checking to make sure Jerry wasn\u2019t within dagger-throwing range. Because, hello, Ian had produced one from somewhere. A sharp silver knife gleamed in his left hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Ian\u2019s voice had gone from charming to stone cold.</p><p>I wanted to cry. My diet dreams were evaporating because of a damned centuries-old feud. No way. I stepped in front of Ian and put my hand on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not close by. I am. Talk to me. About this diet thing you\u2019ve got going.\u201d I smiled and leaned in, flashing cleavage. \u201cLook. I know your feud is important. It\u2019s a matter of honor, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I felt the muscles clench under my fingertips and glanced at Flo and Sheri. \u201cCampbells versus MacDonalds. It goes back a long way, a really long way. But a canny Scot knows when to put business first. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>We all watched Ian visibly struggle to regain his sophisticated veneer. A really thin one, obviously. Because all it had taken was mention of his old enemy and he was right back in primitive killing-machine mode. Finally he slid the dagger out of sight and ran his long fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cSorry, ladies. I don\u2019t usually lose control like that. Of course I\u2019m interested in your business.\u201d He was still scanning the room, my cleavage obviously not tempting enough to keep his mind off his target. And I bet he\u2019d noticed that I wasn\u2019t exactly sporting designer labels or wearing a load of diamonds like my buddy Flo. She waved her hand and her six-carat rock seemed to snap him back to attention. At least he looked at me when I squeezed his biceps.</p><p>\u201cWe understand, don\u2019t we, ladies? Who here hasn\u2019t had a hate on for someone?\u201d I glanced at Sheri.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Glory, do you remember that freak who used to do our hair at the Grand? I swear, she just loved to bring tears to my eyes.\u201d Sheri snarled and we all saw that my beautiful friend had an edgy side. \u201cI finally had enough of her trying to snatch me bald.\u201d She looked at Damian through her thick black lashes, obviously enhanced with some extensions. \u201cWant to hear how I got even, big guy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, cheri.\u201d Damian grinned, clearly liking his women with some bite. \u201cExcuse us.\u201d He leaned down and whispered in my ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop and make sure Blade doesn\u2019t head this way, but don\u2019t linger, Glory. This man is dangerous. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled and slid his arm around my shoulders as soon as Damian disappeared into the crowd with Sheri. He\u2019d obviously heard Damian\u2019s warning.</p><p>\u201cDamian\u2019s right, Gloriana. I can be dangerous. But not to you and Florence. You came over here to ask me about my special products.\u201d He gestured toward one of the secluded booths. \u201cJoin me for a drink and I\u2019ll tell you all about them.\u201d He swept his eyes from my head down to my toes, lingering at the spots where I\u2019d like to lose some inches. \u201cBack when I was a lad, you would have been considered a handsome armful. But times change, don\u2019t they, lass? Bad for you, good for me and my business.\u201d He smiled sympathetically. \u201cWhen were you turned?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEarly sixteen hundreds.\u201d This man understood me like Jerry never had. I wanted to press my face to his strong chest and sob about all the times I\u2019d felt bad about my size.</p><p>\u201cYour figure was perfect then. Still is to an ancient vampire like me.\u201d He slid his hand from my shoulder down to my arm. He finally seemed to be giving my cleavage the attention it deserved. \u201cBut these modern times are different. I can tell from the way you\u2019re dressed that you\u2019re a woman who likes to stay current. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I blinked before I let him whammy me right into one of those curtained booths and into something I might regret. This guy had some serious intuition. Or experience with women. Of course he did. It was his business to know what a woman wanted.</p><p>He turned to Florence. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine, Florence, that you\u2019re serious about needing to lose weight. You\u2019re here to support your friend, of course.\u201d</p><p>Flo smiled, preening under his dazzling smile and obvious approval of her perfect figure. \u201cI think Glory looks great. As you say. But she wants to be smaller. So I have to help my BFF.\u201d Flo ran her hands down the sides of her hips in her size-six designer dress that was obviously straight from a Rodeo Drive boutique. \u201cI would like to lose just a few pounds. If I could choose where they would come from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike the liposuction that mortals use.\u201d Ian shook his head. \u201cAfraid I can\u2019t help you there. There\u2019s no predicting where the weight will come off. I say you should leave your body alone. What does your husband say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I wouldn\u2019t dream of asking him.\u201d Flo glanced at me. \u201cWe are still on our honeymoon. Now, after centuries of being on my own, I can\u2019t imagine asking Richard\u2019s permission for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Ian winked at me. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure a clever woman like yourself makes your Richard think he\u2019s in charge, eh, Florence?\u201d</p><p>Flo smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a game I play. I ask him for some things. If he really loves me, he must give me what I want. He always does. And it makes him think he\u2019s my lord and master.\u201d She shrugged, the gesture pure Italian. \u201cSo I do a little manipulation. It\u2019s a survival skill that has served me well for centuries. Capisca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I get it. It\u2019s a fine art, one I admire in a master crafts-man or craftswoman.\u201d Ian moved a step closer to Florence.</p><p>Flo\u2019s eyes narrowed on Ian and she shook her head. \u201cWhy I tell you this? I think I\u2019m not the only one who likes a little manipulation.\u201d</p> <p>Ian just kept watching my friend while I tried not to screech at both of them to get back to what was important here, namely my hip measurement. Flo and Ian engaged in a stare-down until Flo suddenly nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo. We are here for my friend. Help her. Glory looks like she is ready to scream, she\u2019s so tired of waiting to find out if this diet thing is true or not.\u201d</p><p>Ian turned and grinned at me. \u201cRelax, Glory. It\u2019s true and I think I can help you. Let me guess. You want to lose ten, maybe fifteen pounds. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>For once I was speechless. I swayed toward him. My ultimate dream would be to lose twenty. So that people would come up to me and ask me if I\u2019d been sick. Urge me to eat. Who knows? I might even discover cheekbones I never knew I had. You get my drift? I was jerked back from my fantasy by a hand on my other arm.</p><p>\u201cThis is good news. But we must go now, Glory. Jeremiah will be looking for you. You must meet with Ian later. When you are not with his enemy. S\u00ec?\u201d Flo smiled at Ian. \u201cIs it really possible? You\u2019re not playing with us, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s possible. Just not sure it\u2019s something I\u2019m willing to do for a Campbell\u2019s woman.\u201d Ian frowned. \u201cWhy would I do one of those dung-eating sods a favor?\u201d</p><p>That certainly snapped me out of my hero-worshipping trance. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be doing him a favor; you\u2019d be doing it for me. I\u2019m engaged to another man. Seriously. Read the tabloids if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d I knew I wasn\u2019t making sense and took a breath. \u201cJerry\u2019s my sire. He made me vampire centuries ago. So I owe him, you know? But I\u2019m engaged to Israel Caine, the rock star. We\u2019re out here in Los Angeles for the Grammys. Jerry followed us.\u201d I was shielding my thoughts with a block the size of the Great Wall of China. \u201cI came to the club to be with my friends Flo, Damian and Richard. Israel\u2019s busy with Grammy stuff tonight or he\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re engaged to a mortal?\u201d Ian stared at me, those sapphire eyes rightly very suspicious. He had up his own block and there was no reading his mind.</p> <p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d I really shouldn\u2019t have been telling this, but I guessed Ian would find out if he was going to work with me. \u201cRay\u2019s a vampire.\u201d I saw a flare of surprise before Ian went back to suspicion again. \u201cSeriously. He is. But that\u2019s a deep, dark secret. I know you won\u2019t tell anyone. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in business long if I didn\u2019t know how to keep a secret, Gloriana. As to whether I believe this . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick up a tabloid. Any of them. You\u2019ll see. I\u2019m the big fat blueberry Ray\u2019s engaged to. They call me a blueberry because I had on this blue sweater the first time we were seen together and I\u2019ve got these\u201d\u2014I looked down at my boobs and flushed\u2014\u201cwell, you know. It\u2019s been a sensation for weeks. I even have a fan club. Other women of a certain size are rooting for me.\u201d I grabbed Ian\u2019s shirt, but his bodyguards\u2014both vamps, but tall, tanned California-surfer types\u2014moved in, obviously not too happy about my touching their boss with anything resembling aggression. He shook his head and they backed off without ripping out my throat. Whew. I carefully smoothed out his shirt.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Ian. Listen, though. I don\u2019t want my size to make me a tabloid headline. This weight-loss thing would be a dream come true. I\u2019m not with Jerry, uh, Jeremiah Campbell, except when he commands my presence. You know, as my maker. Like he did tonight. Ray, Israel Caine, is my guy now.\u201d I gave Flo a warning look when she made a sound. \u201cPlease consider taking me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously we can\u2019t discuss anything here. Not with a Campbell close by. Men of that ilk would just as soon knife you in the back as not.\u201d Ian gestured and his two bodyguards flanked him.</p><p>I bit back my knee-jerk response, which was to defend Jerry\u2019s honor. Of course he wouldn\u2019t knife Ian in the back. But he would take great pleasure in killing a MacDonald. Or in trying to. God, I didn\u2019t want to see Jerry fight anyone, ever again. And this would be three against one unless Richard and Damian threw themselves into the fray. Of course Valdez was outside . . .</p><p>Forget it. No violence. I\u2019d had enough of it lately, back in Austin, to realize it scared the hell out of me. Sorry if that disappoints you. Not all vampires are bloodthirsty. Well, okay, I\u2019m thirsty for blood, just not for fighting, slashing and general mayhem.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I followed Ian and his men as they headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have another engagement that I\u2019m already late for.\u201d Ian handed me a card. \u201cIf you wish to hear more about my program, call me tomorrow night and we\u2019ll set up something. A private meeting. Without Campbell interference.\u201d He grabbed my shoulders and looked me in the eyes.</p><p>I shivered. This guy took intense to a whole new level. But if he could make me thin . . . \u201cSure, I can manage that. Like I said, Jerry doesn\u2019t own me. I\u2019m an independent woman. This was a one-shot deal tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Israel Caine is a vampire. I\u2019ll want to verify that. Bring him when we meet.\u201d He grinned when I stiffened. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know how to be discreet or I wouldn\u2019t have a business. And this procedure isn\u2019t cheap. I assume your fianc\u00e9 will be willing to pay the freight?\u201d</p><p>I determinedly kept from collapsing into a sobbing heap. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to work something out, though Ray is happy with my figure the way it is. I\u2019m the one who wants to lose the weight.\u201d Money. Why hadn\u2019t I realized this wouldn\u2019t come cheap? And I sure wouldn\u2019t ask either guy in my life to pay for it. Damn, damn, damn. I bit back a question about payment plans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have great powers of persuasion, Gloriana. I\u2019ll be expecting to hear from you.\u201d I shivered when he slid a fingertip down my cheek. Then he gestured to his men and strode out the door.</p><p>I stood there and stared for a moment. Flo came up behind me.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work, is it, mia amica?\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but I\u2019m not giving up just yet.\u201d I straightened my spine. \u201cWhere are the guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a private booth and a thing on the menu called \u2018Las Vegas.\u2019 Shall we go see?\u201d Flo tugged me toward a curtained area a few yards away.</p><p>Behind a black velvet curtain, Richard and Jerry were seated at a poker table. Each had a glass of dark red at their right hand, a thin cigar hanging out of their mouths and cards on the table in front of them. The stacks of chips showed that the play was about even. A scantily clad waitress hovered nearby to keep their glasses full and their ash-trays empty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, this is interesting. When does the floor show start?\u201d I leaned over Jerry\u2019s shoulder and saw that he had a pair of nines and a pair of threes.</p><p>Richard laughed. \u201cGlory, you should have blocked your thoughts. Now I\u2019m folding. You win, Blade.\u201d Richard threw in his cards and turned to Flo. \u201cCan we leave now? Are you both through with your diet wizard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a phony, like you said, amante.\u201d Flo looked at me. \u201cWe waste no more time on such as that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Jerry raked in the poker chips. \u201cRichard, you owe me big bucks here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how I\u2019ll repay you. Flo and I are leaving and you and Glory can have this room to yourselves. We\u2019re taking KiKi with us.\u201d Richard smiled at the waitress and pressed what looked like a large bill in her hand. \u201cNo one will disturb you for the next hour. How\u2019s that for a payback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d Jerry grinned at me. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally going to see how Glory danced in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d I strolled around the room. Sure enough, there were some costumes on the shelves in one corner behind a screen. So role-playing was encouraged here. Well, that was something I could get into. There was also a small stereo and a selection of music that could work for a dance number. I peeked out from behind the screen. \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys say you were leaving? Dim the lights on your way out.\u201d I grinned and winked at Flo. My friend had known just what to say to cover for me. I\u2019d worry about diets and money tomorrow night. Tonight I was going to appreciate the guy who loved me as is, curves and all.</p><p>Jerry leaned back in his chair, the cigar stubbed out in an ashtray and carried off by KiKi. The stained glass lamp hanging over the table dimmed to cast a red glow, and Jerry looked handsome and mysterious in its light.</p> <p>\u201cGive me a minute to put on my costume, lover, and I\u2019ll dance for you.\u201d I gave him a finger wave, then disappeared behind the screen. The costumes were skimpy and sparkly. I chose one that had fishnet hose, a bikini bottom with gold spangles that hit halfway down my thighs and a bra top cut low enough to leave little to the imagination. Both bra and bikini were made of a sheer material guaranteed to make Jerry\u2019s eyes bug out.</p><p>I hit play on the stereo and picked up a black feather boa. When the music started, I eased one arm out from behind the screen and waved the feathers. Gradually, I revealed myself until I could strut around the table toward Jerry. His eyes weren\u2019t bugging out. They were narrowed. On me, on my costume. On the way I moved my hips as I walked in my high heels, while staying just out of his reach. Not that he was trying to grab me. Nope. He just stared, his mouth firm, his eyes dark. What was he thinking? That I was a lowborn slut like his mother had always said? I stumbled, then steadied.</p><p>Not thinking that way. I was a good dancer. I\u2019d done what I\u2019d had to do to earn a living. I\u2019d been a product of my times. In 1604 I\u2019d had no opportunity to be educated, to learn a trade, and I\u2019d not had the luck to be born into a noble family. I\u2019d been the widow of an actor when Jerry had met me. In the centuries since then I\u2019d used my wits to survive and educate myself. I\u2019d refused to depend on him or his money. Glory St. Clair, the original independent woman.</p><p>So I continued to dance, to strut my stuff. And I finally relaxed enough to let the music take me, and to just feel it and flow with it. I looked at Jerry again and his eyes were glowing. With desire. Ahh. So he did like what he saw. I ventured closer and trailed the feathers across his face. He reached for me and I danced out of the way.</p><p>I decided to up the stakes in this Vegas game and dropped the feathers on the table, then reached behind me for the bra clasp. When it came open, I slowly shimmied out of it and dropped it on the table. I saw Jerry lick his lips, his fangs glinting in the light. Ah.</p><p>I danced closer, then behind him, letting the tips of my breasts brush his soft hair. With a growl, he snatched me around the waist and lifted me into his arms. He stood there for a few endless seconds, a strong silent vampire with ravaging on his mind. I could see it, sense it and wanted it more than anything.</p> <p>Then he raked the table clean with one arm, chips flying everywhere, his empty glass hitting against the wall. It landed on the carpet with a thump without breaking. He laid me gently on that table and stared down at me. The music still played, sensual, with a throbbing beat that echoed the pulsing going on inside both of us. I knew it because he let me read his mind. He pulled my hand to his chest and I felt the slow thrum of his heart. Very slow, but there, just as mine was. Then he slid my hand lower, to the heat and hardness of his cock, which was clearly aching with need . . . for me.</p><p>I took his other hand and put it to my breast. He covered it, my nipple tight against his palm. Then I pulled his hand down to where I needed to feel him inside me, and the pressure almost sent me over the brink before I\u2019d even managed to wiggle out of my costume.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou rob me of speech.\u201d Jerry bent to take my breast into the heat of his mouth.</p><p>I wanted to ask what he meant. No speech. Good? Bad? What the hell? He was in \u201cdriving Glory insane\u201d territory with his clever lips and tongue. And he was helping me get those bikini bottoms off without ripping the fishnets. I kicked off my high heels and concentrated on unbuttoning his shirt with shaking fingers. Loved the shirt or I\u2019d have just ripped it off of him and tossed it aside. Really loved his chest, so manly, scarred from long-ago battles before he\u2019d been turned vampire. No modern workouts for my guy. He\u2019d earned his muscles the hard way, by wielding a broadsword taller than I am.</p><p>I knew every inch of him. I could, and had, traced this territory blindfolded more times than I could count, yet I never tired of exploring it. I went to work on his belt and trousers, and soon had him as naked as I was. I hoped to hell Richard had posted a Do Not Disturb sign on our love nest, because I\u2019d hate to be interrupted just as Jerry began licking his way down my body to my favorite place for him to drink from me. Yep, there\u2019s a vein there at my inner thighs . . .</p><p>\u201cJerry, I love you.\u201d I had his hair in a grip that was probably painful, but he was bearing up. He had my legs over his shoulders and his eyes on the prize. \u201cDrink from me.\u201d</p><p>He jerked me closer, his hands digging into my ass as he held me to him. \u201cGloriana, lass, you\u2019re beautiful. Just as you are. Never forget it.\u201d With a growl of pure predatory lust, he sank his fangs into the sweet spot. I flung myself into an orgasm that was of the \u201cscreaming like a banshee\u201d variety. Lucky for both of us, banshees must be regulars at this club, because nobody came running in to check on us. Or, if they did, neither of us noticed.</p> <p>Once he\u2019d drunk his fill, Jerry eased me down and plunged into me the old-fashioned way. Which was great for orgasm number two, or was it three? God, the man had a way about him. I was so busy kissing and biting him myself, I lost all claim to reason. I inhaled his sweet scent and sank my fangs into his jugular, drawing his life force into me as another orgasm roared through me. He held me close, the throb of his heartbeat echoed by my own as he waited for me to withdraw and lick the punctures closed. I held him tight, my body wrapped around him as we pulsed together. I felt powerful, energized and sexy as hell.</p><p>Oh, God, but he was still inside me, moving again now with a power no mortal could ever hope to match. He covered my mouth with his, his fangs lightly scraping across my lips as he tied my hands together with the feather boa. He shoved them over my head, then leaned down to draw one of my nipples into his mouth, using a stray feather to tease the other.</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I gasped, playing along even though I knew I could pull my hands apart without much effort.</p><p>\u201cI want the truth now, Gloriana.\u201d He sat up, the strength of him throbbing inside me as he reached down to slide that feather down between us. \u201cDid you or did you not dance topless in Las Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Truth. At this point, it was all I could do to remember my own name.</p><p>\u201cNot an answer I\u2019ll accept, lass.\u201d He ran the feather down one of my thighs, then dropped it to pull me tighter against him. He slid out of me until he was a mere inch from leaving me altogether. \u201cYes? Or no?\u201d He eased back inside but not nearly deep enough to satisfy me.</p><p>I raised my bound arms and leaned up to loop them around his neck. I ran the feathers close to his ears and grinned to see him give an involuntary shiver. Hah! Jerry doing anything involuntarily was a triumph as far as I was concerned.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous, Jeremiah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of strangers seeing you half-naked.\u201d He growled and kissed me like he was laying a claim.</p><p>I certainly couldn\u2019t complain about that. But we hadn\u2019t been together when I\u2019d lived in Las Vegas. And I\u2019m not the world\u2019s most talented dancer. At five feet five, I\u2019m pretty short by Vegas standards too. So going topless was sometimes the only way I could get work. Jerry wasn\u2019t going to like it, but I wasn\u2019t going to lie to him about this anymore. I had other, more important secrets to keep.</p><p>I opened my mind and let him see my answer. He frowned. Then, instead of shoving off of me like I was afraid he would, he leaned down to kiss me with the finesse of a master crafts-man. Which he was and is. I\u2019m a sensual woman and I\u2019m convinced that Jerry had seduced me into becoming vampire all those centuries ago. He\u2019s that good.</p><p>When he finally pulled back, he looked down, his face solemn. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory, that you had to demean yourself in that way. I should have provided for your financial security better than that. I\u2019m responsible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t start this again. I chose the vampire life. I get the consequences. I managed. Will always manage. And it wasn\u2019t demeaning. It was liberating.\u201d I reached up and smoothed the frown lines between his dark brows. \u201cCan we drop it now? A few moments ago I was having a fine time. Even thinking about a big finish before someone else bursts in here and demands to use this room. What do you think, big guy? Got one more round in you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jerry looked down at my breasts, obviously imagining them on parade. Of course he\u2019s proprietary. It\u2019s flattering, but has come between us before, when it gets to be too much for me. Right now, the issue would just have to be put aside. Jerry obviously decided he was able to do that. Because he lifted me into his lap, with us still connected, and let me feel just how big a finish he had in store for us.</p><p>\u201cDamn you for being independent, woman.\u201d He pushed into me and I gasped. \u201cDamn you for being prideful.\u201d He pushed into me again and my eyes crossed. \u201cDamn you for being the only woman I can\u2019t ever seem to forget.\u201d He pushed into me once more and I arched my back and dug my fingernails into his shoulders. \u201cAnd damn you for holding my heart in your contrary hands.\u201d He lifted me and sat me down on his shaft with such force that I screamed and we came together with a shudder that seemed to go on forever. When the tremors finally stopped, we leaned against each other and just held on.</p><p>\u201cViva Las Vegas,\u201d I whispered. I heard and felt Jerry\u2019s tired chuckle rumble through his chest against my cheek just before there was a knock outside the door.</p> <p>Three</p><p>\u201cGlory, you\u2019ve got to tell me what happened in there. Your mind has been closed as tight as a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit badgering me, Valdez. They had private booths. Blade and I had \u2018fun.\u2019 That\u2019s all. Do I need to draw you a picture?\u201d I turned and saw that my bodyguard had shifted back into his usual Labradoodle form during the ride up in the elevator. \u201cWhen we get into the suite, cool it. You know Ray and I are \u2018engaged\u2019 so we have to put on the lovey-dovey act. Do your thing and quit pouting about being left outside.\u201d</p><p>I was just glad we hadn\u2019t run into a MacDonald ambush once Jerry and I had left the club. But I guess Ian had really had an appointment. To keep up my charade as Ray\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Jerry\u2019d dropped me off behind the hotel again. So now I was back there and about to enter rock-star world again. Trust me, it\u2019s not as glamorous as I\u2019d once dreamed it would be. This week was all about work for Ray. He\u2019d had a heck of a time setting up his interviews and rehearsals after dark. His new vampire status had done a number on his career.</p><p>I slid the key card into the lock and threw open the door. Usually I\u2019d catch at least a few of his band members and their ladies hanging around, along with Ray\u2019s best friend and manager, Nathan Burke. Music always shook the walls, whether from the stereo system, the big-screen TV or, what was really cool, the guys jamming on their instruments.</p> <p>Tonight it was quiet. Too quiet. The living room was empty. Well, except for the debris, evidence that mortals had enjoyed room service and the bar. The two bedroom doors, on either side of sliding glass doors leading out to the balcony, were closed. Ray and I shared one and Nathan slept in the other. Valdez would\u2019ve made it a cozy threesome in ours if I\u2019d let him. But I figured he could guard both of us quite well from a spot on the living room couch.</p><p>Blade signs V\u2019s paychecks. The only things I let my lover pick up the tab for are the bodyguard gig and our dates. We\u2019ve had this arrangement for centuries and I\u2019ve come to terms with it. I sure couldn\u2019t afford daylight protection and Valdez is way better than me burying myself in the dirt every day. Well, you get the picture.</p><p>I guess I\u2019m lucky Jerry has this responsibility thing because he made me vampire. I\u2019m pretty independent otherwise. So we compromised. Right now we\u2019re together, but there have been decades when we haven\u2019t been. The bodyguards made Jerry feel better about that. Keeping them in dog form is Jerry\u2019s way of making sure I didn\u2019t enjoy the bodyguard a bit too much. Yeah, he\u2019s the jealous type. Which is kind of cute, actually.</p><p>Seriously, though, if I decided to make love to every man in this hotel, I was free to do so, thank you very much. Unfortunately, until I spelled out for V that I wanted alone time with Ray, Valdez was going to, pardon the expression, dog us until we passed out at sunrise to make sure all we did was sleep in our bedroom.</p><p>I usually didn\u2019t have a problem with V\u2019s protectiveness. Vamps are dead all day, literally. The V-man kept out anyone who dared try to enter the bedroom while we\u2019re \u201casleep.\u201d The housekeepers knew that firsthand. Nathan had tipped them big to make sure they only made up the bedrooms after dark.</p><p>\u201cRay? Nathan?\u201d I walked over to our bedroom. I always knocked as a courtesy even though I\u2019ve seen Ray naked. It had been a pure pleasure and I wouldn\u2019t mind a replay. Not that we\u2019ve been lovers, darn it. Okay, not really \u201cdarn it.\u201d When Jerry and I are together, like we are now, I\u2019m true to him. But what woman with an ounce of hormones wouldn\u2019t be thrilled that a yummy guy like Ray had actually made some moves on her? I\u2019ve resisted, even though he\u2019s tempting beyond belief.</p> <p>As payback, because the mind-reading jerk knows how hot he is, Ray flaunts himself. He doesn\u2019t seem to have a self-conscious bone in his body. Not like me. I wear shapeless things to bed that hit me somewhere about midcalf. Not only to avoid stirring up stuff that I don\u2019t intend to act on, but if you don\u2019t got it, you don\u2019t flaunt it. Know what I mean?</p><p>Anyway, I knocked. Waited a beat, then turned the knob. I opened the door and came face-to-face with a woman I recognized immediately. I had her CDs at home. She was up for a Grammy, album of the year. And she was wearing one of Ray\u2019s T-shirts and nothing else.</p><p>I snarled. Yep, a primitive snarl that I barely kept my fangs out of. You should have seen that bimbo\u2019s face. She jumped back a full three feet, then landed on her skinny ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on here?\u201d I played the outraged fianc\u00e9e to the hilt. Sure, this was a pretend engagement, but I doubt she knew that. I stomped into the room, Valdez on my heels. He got with the program, his growl raising the hair on my arms. I halted within scratching range of the woman\u2019s eyes and gave my sidekick an encouraging pat.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, Ray, I mean . . .\u201d She glanced at the rumpled sheets on the king-size bed. Big mistake.</p><p>I reached down and grabbed her by one of her twig arms. I could have snapped it between two fingers and actually thought about it. Not that I\u2019m in love with Ray, though I\u2019m really, really fond of him. But this betrayal hurt. Betrayal? Whoa. I didn\u2019t have the right to think like that. Still, this did feel like a cheap shot. I mean, what was he thinking, bringing a woman into our bed? At least I took my action off the premises.</p><p>I blinked back stupid tears and sniffed. Second big mistake. I got a whiff of human blood pumping through bimbo\u2019s veins and I was suddenly starved. Too bad her pale face made it clear she\u2019d already donated tonight. Damn it. Ray\u2019d had sex and dinner.</p><p>\u201cGet out before I . . .\u201d I lifted my fist, narrowly missing her surgically altered nose before I waved it at a pile of clothes by the bed. Tiny push-up bra that Victoria\u2019s Secret didn\u2019t even carry in my size, miniskirt that I couldn\u2019t have squeezed over even one of my thighs and a T-shirt that she\u2019d obviously borrowed from a Chihuahua. Shit.</p> <p>\u201cTake your clothes and get the hell out of here.\u201d I heard my voice quiver and hated it. The shower went off. \u201cNow.\u201d Okay, that was a hiss. Much better.</p><p>Little Miss Stick Figure got the message and hustled her butt like her feet were on fire. Valdez nipped at her heels in case she needed incentive. I slammed the door as soon as they both cleared it. I knew Valdez would keep her moving until she hit the hall. Then he\u2019d come back to sit next to the door and listen in. Fine. But I didn\u2019t want or need his eyes on me during this showdown.</p><p>Ray came out with a towel around his lean middle. \u201cGlory.\u201d He looked around, alarmed, like maybe he\u2019d see a drained body on the floor. \u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>I held up my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t say her name. She\u2019s alive. No broken bones. Which is a miracle, come to think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Ray sat on the foot of the bed. \u201cGuess this wasn\u2019t such a hot idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d I paced the carpet in front of him and saw his nostrils flare. I really didn\u2019t have the right to say much of anything to him. Of course he smelled Blade on me and the evidence that I\u2019d had recent sex. Lots of recent sex. And Ray had warned me not too long ago that he wasn\u2019t into celibacy. Of course he wasn\u2019t. He was a virile man in his prime. And a newly made vampire with the libido to match. Since I wasn\u2019t going to scratch his itch, I\u2019d known it was only a matter of time before he\u2019d find someone who would.</p><p>\u201cWell, go ahead. Ream me out. I didn\u2019t plan this, but that\u2019s no excuse.\u201d Ray ran another towel over his wet hair.</p><p>\u201cI was rough on her. Blame it on the shock factor. But you certainly have the right . . .\u201d I sat beside him, biting back the snarky comments I wanted to make. Did he have to pick someone so thin? His bedmate couldn\u2019t have been more different from me, even down to the dark hair and bikini wax. Oh, man, I so didn\u2019t want to go there.</p><p>He slid his hand over mine and squeezed. \u201cForgive me? I\u2019m a stupid jerk. We should have taken this somewhere else. I\u2019m really sorry if you were embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, all sincere apology and charm. I guess I\u2019d always be attracted to him. He was handsome, built and had the kind of talent that sang to my soul if I let it. I\u2019d been a fan even before he\u2019d been tossed naked into my bed as a newly made vampire. The fact that now we were thrown together all the time had made it worse for a while, but I always went back to Blade in the end. So I knew it wasn\u2019t fair to expect Ray to just hang around in case I decided to drop Blade and pick up someone else.</p><p>\u201cNot embarrassed so much as surprised. I threw a temper fit. Like a fianc\u00e9e would under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt her?\u201d</p><p>I managed a shrug. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And there won\u2019t be a next time. Not here, anyway. DeeDee and I have a history. We\u2019re friends with benefits, I guess you could say. When we\u2019re not with someone else, we hook up.\u201d Ray dropped the hair towel into his lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how did you explain that you\u2019re engaged, but you\u2019re not \u2018with\u2019 someone?\u201d I jumped up again. \u201cDamn it, Ray, if this gets into the tabloids, I\u2019ll look like a fool and you\u2019ll look like a jerk.\u201d The tabloids already thought Ray was crazy for hanging out with a woman who wasn\u2019t model thin or famous in her own right. DeeDee was both. Damn. If I didn\u2019t quit grinding my teeth, I was going to loosen a fang.</p><p>Of course the tabloids figured I was springing the baby trap. What irony. \u201cMade\u201d vamps like me can\u2019t reproduce. Sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t get out. I told her you and I were breaking things off right after the Grammys. That\u2019s still what you plan, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ray stood and faced me. He knew the answer and was probably counting on it being the same. He didn\u2019t want this sham to go on any more than I did. He was grateful to me for mentoring him through his vamp adjustment period. Judging by what he\u2019d just done, he was getting into the vampire groove now and wouldn\u2019t need my help much longer.</p> <p>Besides, any vampire who thinks he wants to be hooked up to the same person for eternity needs to get a clue. Call me heartless, but I sure never thought it was a good idea or I would have caved and said the vows with Blade a long time ago. Even soul mates need a break once in a while.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Ray. You\u2019re off the hook. After this awards show, when we get back to Austin, we\u2019ll announce irreconcilable differences and you can openly date whoever.\u201d I kicked off my high heels and sighed with relief. \u201cYou sure you can trust this lady? You did erase her memory, didn\u2019t you? Because unless she\u2019s anemic, I think the girl made a donation while she was satisfying your other urges.\u201d</p><p>Ray grinned. \u201cHell, yes, I fed from her. That part was almost better than the sex, if you want to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Yep, Ray was definitely a full-fledged graduate vampire now. It was all about the blood. And when you got human blood and great sex at the same time? I sighed, remembering.</p><p>\u201cHer memory, Ray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I wiped her memory and the fang marks. All she\u2019ll remember is the great sex.\u201d He lost his smile. \u201cDamn it, she did look pale. I tried to take it easy but it had been a while since I\u2019d had fresh and it was so fine . . .\u201d He gave me a worried look. \u201cI might have taken too much. Think she\u2019ll be all right? Should I go up and check on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way she ran out of here? I think she still had plenty of juice.\u201d I worked up a grin, trying really hard to act like I didn\u2019t give a damn. I turned away from him to pull off my earrings and drop them on the dresser. \u201cGive her a call, though, if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared her, did you?\u201d Ray got up and moved behind me to slide his arms around my waist. \u201cCome on, Glory. Face facts. You\u2019ve got Blade. I can smell him on you. And you have the look of a woman well loved. You\u2019ve got to know it drives me crazy every time you come back after a night with him. I needed an outlet, you know? I was hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ray. I guess I can\u2019t blame you for wanting someone to, uh, take care of your needs.\u201d I covered his hands with mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd DeeDee\u2019s all right. She won\u2019t tell a soul. That\u2019s why we hang out together. She\u2019s got the same issues with the gossip rags that I\u2019ve got. Her room is two floors up. It was easy for her to sneak down here.\u201d He rested his chin on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow convenient.\u201d I heard myself go snarky and took a breath. Stupid. Ray could screw every woman in Los Angeles for all I cared. \u201cI didn\u2019t rip open her throat, but I put on a pretty scary show. Valdez too.\u201d I turned to face Ray.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet you did, vamp girl.\u201d Ray bumped against me, his hands on the dresser on either side of me so that I was trapped, or not. My choice. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in action against some serious bad guys, remember? A mere mortal female wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I was actually holding back, but your \u2018friend\u2019 might not see it that way. So you may have to do some fast talking to get her to give you another shot.\u201d I smiled and caught a drop of water that slid down one of his lean cheeks. He was flaunting himself again, standing close in nothing but a towel. Ray was beautiful, from his broad shoulders to his narrow hips and everywhere in between. Thanks to a bitch who\u2019d decided that turning him vampire would be the perfect payback for a man who\u2019d loved playing in the sun, Ray would look like this forever\u2014tanned, toned and 100 percent every woman\u2019s fantasy.</p><p>I licked my lips, a reflex I immediately regretted when Ray grinned and bumped against me again. I glanced down at the invitation under the towel and felt a flush warm my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI like you jealous. It\u2019s hot. And you\u2019d better block your thoughts, Glory girl.\u201d His sapphire eyes sparkled. \u201cYou\u2019re looking like you want to take up where DeeDee left off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself, Caine. I was playing a part earlier. Outraged fianc\u00e9e. Now that we\u2019re alone, forget it.\u201d I put my hand on his bare chest and gave him a gentle shove to give me some space. \u201cI\u2019ve been more than satisfied tonight. Maybe you\u2019d better see if DeeDee will give you another chance, though I wouldn\u2019t drink from her again. She needs some recovery time.\u201d I yawned and stretched. \u201cI feel the sunrise coming, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I and I don\u2019t do quickies. I like to take my time.\u201d He grinned, a wicked twinkle in his eyes. \u201cI imagine I can talk DeeDee back into bed eventually. She and I have a really good time together. You and I could too if you just let me show you my moves.\u201d He slid one finger along my collar-bone.</p><p>I smiled and grabbed his hand. \u201cGive Blade some credit. I am a woman well loved. Very well loved.\u201d I yawned again. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to throw on my gown and crawl into bed. Would you let in Valdez? I want to say something to him before I conk out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to tell him to stay the hell in the living room during the day. He\u2019s supposed to guard the door, but I think he climbs in right between us as soon as we close our eyes. I swear these pillows smell like dog when I wake up. I haven\u2019t forgotten that he\u2019s really a man, you know.\u201d Ray walked over to the bedroom door.</p> <p>\u201cHey, he\u2019s protecting both of us. Something happens during the day? We\u2019re golden. He\u2019d die before he\u2019d let harm come to either of us.\u201d I had to admit, I\u2019d thought V was staying in the living room. Weird if he was actually in the bed with us. I didn\u2019t doubt that he could open and close doors, even in dog form. The shifter has some mad skills, not just shape-shifting either.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I get it. But he can do that job just as well outside the door as in.\u201d Ray threw open the bedroom door. \u201cOkay, dog breath. Come in. I want to go over the rules with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, a-hole, you don\u2019t make the rules. Glory does. And next time you want some nookie, take it upstairs. Glory doesn\u2019t need to walk in on a scene like that, you hear me?\u201d Valdez growled as he walked by Ray\u2019s knees.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that anyway. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d Ray dropped his towel, grabbed a pair of silk boxers and stepped into them.</p><p>\u201cNot with the brain in your head anyway.\u201d</p><p>I left them bickering and headed for the bathroom where I\u2019d hung my shapeless nightgown. I still had a queasy feeling in my stomach after realizing Ray had spent a night making love to another woman. And now I\u2019d have to sleep on the same sheets. Yuck. And ouch. This was cruel and unusual. You know?</p><p>\u201cMy schedule\u2019s pretty full, Glory. Who is this guy anyway?\u201d Ray polished off a bottle of CrimsonCrush, our latest find in the synthetic blood brands, while I paced the living room.</p><p>I was embarrassed to admit it, but if Ian wanted to meet Ray, then I was going to have to drag my \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d along. A call to the diet guru to set up the meeting had made it clear: no rocker, no interest in helping a Campbell\u2019s woman. Damn.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vampire who has a special product I need. I really want to do this, Ray, but he won\u2019t deal with me unless he gets to meet you. He\u2019s a big fan.\u201d I glanced at my watch. I had a pretty full schedule too. First, I was meeting with designers who were making a dress for me to wear on the red carpet at the Grammys. I was nervous. This was a big deal and I wasn\u2019t a size zero.</p><p>Ray\u2019s publicist, Barry Donaldson, had arranged for me to be a guest judge for a segment on the design reality show Designed to Kill. The competitors would meet with me today to measure me and ask questions. All of this would be on camera, of course. If a vamp could dream, I would have been having nightmares about this. Imagine your measurements televised to millions. Somehow my waist, hip and thigh measurements were not going to be aired. Maybe there was a contract clause that Nathan could insist on. I looked around for Ray\u2019s best friend and business manager and saw him coming out of his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cNate, please, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Glory, but make it quick. I\u2019ve got Grammy stuff to do tonight. They made an album of hits and Ray\u2019s duet with Sienna Star was on it. It\u2019s gone platinum and I want to make sure our cut of the money\u2019s right on it.\u201d Nathan was dressed in his usual Italian suit, silk tie and white shirt. Against his dark skin, it was a hot look and he usually had a beautiful woman on his arm. Oops, guess I got that right because here came one out of his bedroom, hopping on one foot while she stuck her other foot into a Louboutin pump. She grabbed Nathan\u2019s arm to steady herself, kissed his cheek, then headed out without waiting to be introduced to the rest of us.</p><p>Nate and Ray knocked fists while I just shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWho was that? She was gorgeous.\u201d I really didn\u2019t have time for idle chitchat, but Nathan, who grinned and paced in front of the big-screen TV, was obviously bursting to share.</p><p>\u201cNiki\u2019s the coordinator for the cable network we talked about, Ray. I may have a deal for you, if you\u2019re still interested in a music special.\u201d Nate grabbed a bottle of water. \u201cNow, Glory, what did you need?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe designers are coming for this reality show. What rights do I have?\u201d I hated how insecure I sounded. I mean, I\u2019m a vampire. I could lay waste to the entire crew and just disappear and forget the whole thing. I glanced at Ray and Valdez when they both laughed.</p><p>\u201cHey! This isn\u2019t funny. I don\u2019t want to be made to look ridiculous. This will be seen by millions of people. And it\u2019s publicity for you, Israel Caine. Help me out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s right. And tearing out the throats of an entire cast and crew of a major cable network show would make headlines, but maybe not the kind you\u2019re looking for.\u201d Ray threw his arm around my shoulders.</p> <p>Nathan looked alarmed. \u201cCalm down, Glory. What\u2019s got you so worked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me. These designers are going to come in and measure me. I don\u2019t want those numbers blasted over the TV. I\u2019m not stupid. Ray\u2019s last hookup had a waist measurement smaller than that of my right thigh.\u201d Valdez and Ray nodded and I gave them both \u201cGo to hell\u201d mental messages.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that can\u2019t be right.\u201d Nate glanced at his friend, but Ray wisely kept his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cI know how these shows operate, Nate.\u201d I stopped just short of grabbing him by the lapels and shaking him. \u201cDon\u2019t I have some kind of creative control?\u201d</p><p>Nate frowned and moved back a step. \u201cBarry\u2019s handling this. He didn\u2019t bring me a contract other than a standard release form. I never realized you\u2019d have\u201d\u2014he looked me over\u2014\u201cissues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look great. Worse comes to worst, you and Ray whammy everyone here and plant new numbers in their pointy heads. Give you a waist like Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s in Gone with the Wind if that\u2019ll make you happy.\u201d Valdez bumped against me.</p><p>\u201cGet a clue, Valdez. Then the dresses won\u2019t fit.\u201d I looked longingly at the bedroom and wondered if I could just lock myself in. Valdez planted himself in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cCaine, you\u2019ve got to back up Glory on this. Stay here while this circus is going on. Make sure they treat her right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do what I can, but I don\u2019t have all night. I\u2019ve got rehearsals.\u201d Ray jumped back when I glared at him. \u201cHey, babe, I get it. This is for me. As long as it takes. I\u2019m here. But it will all be on tape. That might be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFix it so there were technical difficulties. Use your vampire skills. Just don\u2019t kill anybody with them.\u201d Nathan glanced at his watch. \u201cHell, you two can work this out. And these shows are run by professionals. Just speak up, Glory. Let them know up front how you want it to be or threaten to walk. I\u2019ll deal with any legal fallout later if it comes to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose would be fun headlines: \u2018Thighs Matter. Grammy Gown Used as Awning after Glory Waddles Away in Outrage. \u2019\u201d I collapsed on the couch, ignoring Valdez, who\u2019d buried his nose in a cushion to stifle his howls of laughter. Ray\u2019s snort turned into a cough when he saw my stare in his direction.</p> <p>\u201cAs usual, you\u2019re too hard on yourself. Am I right, Ray?\u201d Nate smiled and patted my shoulder.</p><p>Ray pulled himself together and nodded vigorously. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect, Glory. I\u2019ve never seen you waddle.\u201d That gaffe earned him a gesture and sent Valdez into a roll across the floor.</p><p>Nate gave my bodyguard a hard look. \u201cSeriously. These people want to make you look good so they can win. The prize is a contract for a clothing line. I personally can\u2019t wait to see the winning dress. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll make you look hot. One warning, though. Make sure you and Ray are aware when they\u2019re filming. There\u2019s nothing these shows like more than to catch you off guard. You and Ray need to be 100 percent together, if you know what I mean.\u201d Nate stared at Valdez. \u201cAnd the dog needs to keep his trap shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I know how to do my thing in public.\u201d Valdez followed him to the door. \u201cYou should have done yours. What kind of manager doesn\u2019t check the contracts? Glory should have had some say in how this was going down.\u201d</p><p>I heard the door close and sank down on the couch. Had I even dressed right for this? I wore what I considered slimming black jeans and an Ed Hardy tee. I wanted to look like a rocker\u2019s woman. Not easy to do without a single piercing or tattoo. Been there, done that. Woke up after a day of healing sleep without either one. Bummer.</p><p>\u201cYou look great, Glory. And I\u2019ll do what I can to make sure they treat you right.\u201d Ray sat beside me, then jumped up and gathered the CrimsonCrush bottles and tossed them in the trash in our bathroom before closing the door. Housekeeping had been in during the day and cleaned the suite\u2019s living room, so we were ready when the knock came on the door.</p><p>When Barry ushered in a cast of thousands (okay, slight exaggeration), I wanted to retreat to that bathroom and never come out. Not that Barry would have hesitated to call in the Jaws of Life to pull me out of there. All of it sure to be caught on film.</p><p>First, we were introduced to Zia, a former model and hostess of the show. She was obviously a lot more than set decoration, though it didn\u2019t take mind reading to see that Ray was admiring her perfect body and gorgeous face. We were both blond and blue-eyed with a generous bustline. I liked to think she was me, only six inches taller, twenty pounds lighter and with the blessings of the gods as far as beauty was concerned. Okay, so she wasn\u2019t even close to being me.</p> <p>\u201cListen, people, let\u2019s not waste Ray\u2019s valuable time.\u201d Of course she and Ray were already on a first-name basis. And my time? Not on her radar. She got us organized with the help of a pack of assistants and soon the contestants were firing questions at me.</p><p>Valdez managed to be an immediate hit with the cast and crew, posing shamelessly for the camera as they bickered the way they do on these reality shows. The three finalists, two guys and a girl, were really into winning.</p><p>\u201cGlory, what\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d Melanie asked. She looked like she belonged with Ray more than I did. I admired her dragon tattoos. She had a hard time focusing on me and kept glancing at Ray and licking her pierced lip with her pierced tongue.</p><p>\u201cRed. And blue to go with my eyes, but I wear a lot of black. Because I think it\u2019s slimming.\u201d I ran my hands down my sides and hips in case the group missed the area I wanted to slim. We hadn\u2019t measured yet. I was sick with dread.</p><p>\u201cCan we see your closet, Glory?\u201d This from Butch, who wasn\u2019t, if you know what I mean.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a lot with me.\u201d I glanced at Ray. The housekeepers had been allowed in to change the sheets fairly soon after sunset, so the bedroom was presentable. \u201cSure, come on.\u201d</p><p>This got everyone all excited and the gang trooped into the bedroom. My paltry offerings were brought out and examined.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to like short skirts and low-cut tops.\u201d Darren, the third finalist, was busy writing in a notebook. He seemed the most intense and had a no-nonsense vibe I liked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got great assets and knows how to use them.\u201d Ray pulled me close to his side. \u201cGlory always looks good. She\u2019s an expert on fashion herself. You should see her store in Austin, Texas. Vintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium. If you\u2019re ever there, it\u2019s on Sixth Street, a cool area surrounded by clubs and other funky shops. A great place to hang out and buy vintage clothes.\u201d</p><p>I gave Ray a kiss on the cheek. Could I have asked for a better commercial? Valdez pushed between us and I reached down to pat him on the head. We were the picture of one big happy family.</p><p>Zia smiled and managed to pull Ray to her side. \u201cAnd what would you like to see Glory wear, Israel Caine? This will be a big night for you.\u201d She went on and on about Ray\u2019s duet and the award he was up for. I could practically see his head grow three sizes.</p><p>Finally he had a chance to answer. \u201cLike I said, Glory looks good in anything.\u201d He tucked me against him again. \u201cBut I really like it when she wears stuff that\u2019s cut low in front.\u201d He grinned into the camera. \u201cMy girl\u2019s got great\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay!\u201d I put my hand over his mouth. \u201cI think we\u2019d better let the contestants and the audience figure that one out for themselves.\u201d I felt him lick my palm and had to laugh. Zia\u2019s smile looked painted on when Ray pulled my hand away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019. Anyone can see I\u2019m a lucky man, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks.\u201d I kissed his cheek, then turned to the contestants. They were all writing in their notebooks. \u201cNow, about the dress. I guess I should wear something long. But I\u2019m anxious to see what you guys come up with.\u201d I smiled at them. \u201cI want to look fabulous, of course.\u201d My smile froze when I saw a yellow measuring tape appear in each contestant\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cCan we turn off the cameras for a moment?\u201d Ray held up both hands, then pulled Zia to the side and began whispering to her. She frowned, but finally nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, people, we\u2019re all going to wait in the living room while the contestants measure Glory in here. Off camera.\u201d There were gasps from the crowd. \u201cRay\u2019s going to give us an interview. We can use some of it for our promos for the show.\u201d There was some murmuring, but the room cleared while I shot Ray a grateful look. Valdez stayed behind, of course. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to blast him out of there when I was surrounded by mortals he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Melanie was first. She was brisk and efficient. I didn\u2019t even see the numbers she wrote in her little notebook, but she measured everything, even my wrists. At least she didn\u2019t gasp in horror but she did shake her head once and even clucked, I swear it. She caught herself and smiled, obviously remembering too late who was the judge here.</p><p>\u201cYou have tiny wrists.\u201d The suck-up smiled, her piercing clanking against her teeth. \u201cWhy no tats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allergic to the dyes.\u201d I\u2019d prepared the story years ago. This wasn\u2019t the first time the question had come up. \u201cTried it once.\u201d I pointed to my bikini line. \u201cYou should see the scar. Never again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo bad. Rockers dig tattoos.\u201d Melanie wrote something in her notebook.</p><p>I pulled a face. \u201cDon\u2019t I know it. Ray\u2019s are awesome.\u201d</p><p>Melanie looked thoughtful as she slipped out of the bedroom and shut the door. I turned to Darren. \u201cAre we done now? Can\u2019t you people just share the measurements?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Darren smiled coldly. \u201cYou think that bitch would give me the correct ones? Right now she\u2019s copying the numbers and changing them in case I try to look at her notebook. She\u2019ll have the real ones stashed someplace safe.\u201d He whipped out his measuring tape, almost hitting me in the eye. \u201cHold still, now. I want to get this right. How high a heel can you walk in comfortably, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour inch, five in a pinch. I get shoes?\u201d I felt his knuckles brush my nipples and glanced up to catch a gleam in his eyes. Valdez growled and I nudged him with my foot.</p><p>\u201cOf course you get shoes. What\u2019s your favorite brand? You\u2019ll also get an evening bag and jewelry for each outfit.\u201d He reached around me to pull the tape around my waist.</p><p>He was actually a nice-looking guy if you went for the grunge thing. He could use a haircut and shave, but the overall effect was nicely masculine. He also could have benefited from a gym membership. Of course his real appeal was the B positive thrumming through his veins. I slid my tongue over my fangs and ordered them to retreat. I\u2019d had a bottle of synthetic earlier and wasn\u2019t really hungry. But then, fresh . . .</p><p>\u201cAnything that looks hot and is perfect with the dress.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou guys have a real challenge. But I saw you studying my shoes in the closet. Get the right size and I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere, all done.\u201d Darren looked down at Valdez, who growled again when the man brushed his hand down my hip. \u201cI\u2019ll get you the best of everything, Glory. From your beautiful head down to your toes. Be sure to book a pedicure on the day of the event.\u201d He winked. \u201cGo for a red polish. Now, guess I\u2019ll have to leave you with Butch. Sorry about that. See you in the living room.\u201d He took off, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cAlone at last.\u201d Butch looked me over. \u201cPlease ignore that trash-talking idiot. Tell me what your dream dress would look like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be cheating?\u201d I held out my arms while Butch went to work getting a bust measurement.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Those idiots should have asked you the same thing.\u201d Butch was working on my waist now. I didn\u2019t dare look at the number. Some things you just don\u2019t want to know. \u201cAnd just between us, I\u2019m a stylist in my other life. Took care of Julia in her second trimester with the twins. Angelina too. By the time I dress you, no one will suspect a thing, sugar buns.\u201d</p><p>I looked down to where Valdez was struggling not to laugh out loud. As it was, he was turning into a wheezing, hacking, staggering dog that had Butch frowning at him.</p><p>\u201cIs the dog okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is what happens when he drinks out of the toilet.\u201d I grabbed his collar and pulled him toward the door. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay. He just needs some air. Maybe Ray will shove him out on the balcony.\u201d I pushed him into the living room and shut the door. \u201cThere. Now, where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to measure your thighs. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d drop those jeans. They\u2019re adding precious inches you can\u2019t afford, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not dropping my pants. And, no, I\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d I put my hands on my hips. \u201cI\u2019m not model thin like most of Ray\u2019s girlfriends, okay? But if you can come up with a design that can disguise my figure flaws, you\u2019ll be the winner. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Butch grinned and put a finger over his lips. \u201cCrystal, sugar buns. I know just what you need to wear to make you look fabulous.\u201d He quickly took a few more measurements, headed for the door and flung it open. \u201cWe\u2019d better join the others before I get accused of conspiring with the judge.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, all eyes were on us as we entered the room. There were a few more questions, then Ray pleaded a full schedule and got them out of there. Zia was the last to leave, air-kissing Ray and ignoring me as she thanked him for the promo spots.</p><p>\u201cThat went pretty well.\u201d Ray shut the door behind the last of them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, there wasn\u2019t an unkind word about my figure issues. I imagine those comments will be in the behind-the-scenes shots they film while they cut yards and yards of fabric for my dress. Boy, won\u2019t that be a budget buster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit putting yourself down.\u201d Ray frowned.</p> <p>I hugged him and kissed his cheek. \u201cThanks for taking care of the measurement thing. You\u2019re my hero. Always looking out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d He pulled me close and rested his chin on my head. \u201cValdez, quit growling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really in a hurry? Because I still want to go see that guy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got an hour to spare. Where do we meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a place in Malibu.\u201d I had no idea how far away that was or how long it took to get there.</p><p>Ray frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ll never make it, unless . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Glory? Ray wants you to shift with him and fly out there. It\u2019s the only way to fit it into his schedule. He\u2019s got rehearsal later.\u201d Valdez, who\u2019d obviously been mind reading, frowned. \u201cI guess I could do the same. Not what Blade would like, but, hell, I\u2019ve been shifting into other forms lately anyway. You\u2019re sure not going out there without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Valdez right, Ray? You want me to shift and fly out to Malibu with you? Are you sure we can find the place?\u201d I hate shifting. It\u2019s a phobia I have. The whole process is creepy to me. I like my human form. It\u2019s comfortable, fits me like a glove, even if it is a little oversize. The bat or bird thing? Yuck.</p><p>\u201cYou got an address?\u201d Ray held out his hand and I gave him Ian\u2019s card. \u201cYes, I know where this is. Pricy real estate. Right on the beach. I can find it. But we need to get out there now. If Valdez thinks he needs to go, so be it. Is there something I should know about this deal that you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>I blocked my thoughts. Of course there was. Just about everything. I smiled. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll love this. The MacDonalds and the Campbells are ancient enemies. They hate each other. That\u2019s why Ian needs to be sure I\u2019m with you, not Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll probably like this guy.\u201d Ray grinned and opened the door to the balcony. He looked at Nathan, who\u2019d come back just as the TV crew had left. \u201cYou\u2019ll cover for us? Keep the gang away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You do know how this freaks me out to watch you change, don\u2019t you, bro?\u201d Nathan looked at me. \u201cGlory, I thought you didn\u2019t like to do this. What does this guy have that motivates you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you later.\u201d I looked at my watch again and stepped onto the balcony. I steeled myself, feeling my nerves jumping as I tried to work up my courage. I really, really wanted to get skinny. Otherwise this was so not my thing.</p><p>\u201cBird or bat?\u201d Valdez was still right beside me, his presence always a comfort. \u201cStay close, Glory. We\u2019ll be right behind Ray. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d Voice shaky, but I was determined.</p><p>\u201cBat, let\u2019s move.\u201d Then Ray was a bat, just like that.</p><p>I pictured the same change in myself and felt it shudder through me, the floor dropping below me as I soared into the air. I suppose it should be a cool experience to fly over Los Angeles at night like that. The lights of the city were beautiful when I dared glance down. But I was totally focused on not losing Ray. Not that he would have allowed that. He and Valdez flanked me, obviously taking care not to let me fly off on a tangent. In what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes, we were near the ocean and I could see it dark with a phosphorescent froth below us. The houses that lined the beach were massive and well lit.</p><p>Ray started down toward one that was on a cliff with a wooden stair that zigzagged down to the beach below. He landed on a wooden deck, changing back into his human form almost as soon as his feet hit. Valdez was back to Labradoodle form as well. They stared at me as I concentrated. I was relieved when I could shake out my hair, back to my Glory self with only a slight stumble. Maybe I was getting the hang of this.</p><p>\u201cMan, what a rush.\u201d Ray was clearly jazzed by the whole flying-over-L.A. thing. \u201cBut if I hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time here, I sure could have gotten lost. Luckily I spotted some major highways and followed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove and you\u2019re dead, vampires.\u201d The voice that came out of the dark obviously meant business.</p><p>I didn\u2019t move an inch.</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cWho says so?\u201d Valdez jumped in front of me. \u201cDamn it, Caine. We should have circled first. Landed farther down the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d A blond surfer, either one of the men from the club or his clone, stepped out of the darkness. Three more just like him soon had us surrounded. This time they wore wet suits. Like they\u2019d actually been surfing instead of just body-guarding. Their hard stares made it clear they didn\u2019t welcome drop-in visitors who interrupted their playtime.</p><p>\u201cHate to admit it, but you\u2019re right, V.\u201d Ray moved up beside Valdez and snarled. \u201cI\u2019ve got the two on the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, gentlemen. My men are just doing their job. Of course you\u2019re welcome here, Mr. Caine.\u201d Ian strolled out onto the deck and the guards parted, though none of them smiled or relaxed. \u201cGlory, I\u2019m delighted you could make it. Sorry for the surly reception. My guests usually arrive at the front door.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t see any weapons. But then, vamps don\u2019t usually use them anyway. The vampire males I know pride themselves on their hand-to-hand and their fang action. I grabbed Ray\u2019s arm. He was too new at the vamp game to be particularly good at either.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, Ray\u2019s a busy man. We\u2019re on a tight schedule and flew in.\u201d I really didn\u2019t like the vibe here, but forced a smile. \u201cIsrael Caine, Ian MacDonald.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA pleasure.\u201d Ian held his hand out to Ray.</p><p>Ray just nodded. \u201cGlory\u2019s also my mentor and she\u2019s taught me it\u2019s not wise to touch a newly met vampire.\u201d He slung his arm around my shoulders. \u201cThere are so many dirty tricks you guys enjoy playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Ian laughed and glanced down at Valdez, who continued to snarl and looked like he wanted to rumble. \u201cGlory, would you ask your shifter to stand down? I assume he\u2019s your bodyguard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Valdez, chill. You\u2019ll have to excuse him, but it\u2019s the wet suits. We had a bad experience recently in an Austin lake and neither of us is crazy about the water.\u201d I put my hand on Valdez\u2019s head. He growled and nipped at one of the surfer dude\u2019s knees when the guy moved in too close.</p><p>\u201cI like to live by the ocean, but I promise I won\u2019t require you to get wet as part of my miracle cure.\u201d Ian waved his hand toward the open French door. \u201cPlease come inside. Let me tell you about my products. Show you what they can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCure?\u201d Ray squeezed my shoulder. \u201cAre you sick? Glory, what the hell is this guy selling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9e tell you why she brought you out here, Caine? I\u2019m into helping people. Gloriana\u2019s not sick unless you consider that she\u2019s sick of the body she\u2019s been stuck with for four hundred plus years. Am I right, my dear?\u201d Ian gave me a sympathetic look and I bit back an \u201cAmen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d I looked everywhere but at Ray. This was absolutely humiliating, but I was bound and determined to at least hear what Ian had to say. \u201cYou have no idea what it\u2019s like, Ray, to never be able to change one thing about your size.\u201d I finally faced him and gripped his arm. \u201cSeriously. I know you used to work out. Nathan spends hours in the gym. You guys probably made a conscious decision to get the bodies you wanted, then went for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. And it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d Ray covered my hand with his. \u201cBaby, I never thought . . . What a trip. Of course this would drive you crazy.\u201d He pulled me close and rubbed my back. \u201cNot that you\u2019re not great the way you are, but to never be able to change . . .\u201d He hugged me, careful not to use his vamp strength and break a rib. \u201cDarlin\u2019, that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d</p><p>I leaned against him until the urge to cry passed. Then I heard Ian clear his throat. Oh, yes, we were keeping the great man waiting. I stepped back.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ray, for understanding. I really do want to finally lose a few pounds and keep them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Something vampires have never been able to do, until now.\u201d Ian rubbed his hands together. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a revolutionary system that can melt the pounds away, even on an ancient vampire like Glory.\u201d Ian smiled, ignoring Valdez\u2019s chuff of disbelief.</p><p>I wanted to grab Ian and give him a soul kiss. Revolutionary. I\u2019ll say. Hope hit me right between the eyes and made the world go blurry. To finally, finally change the way I looked. This had to be too good to be true.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Revolutionary sounds dangerous.\u201d Ray gave me the once-over. He started at the top of my head.</p> <p>Swell. I was sure my blond hair had been blown into a fright wig by the change for my bat flight. Then he checked out my snug jeans in a size twelve (oh, how I wished for a six!). Hmm. Back up north again, he lingered on my double Ds which I\u2019d love to slip into a C cup. I could only imagine the joys of having to shop for new bras and to actually buy pretty, colorful ones. I grabbed Ray and squeezed his arm again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m immortal, remember? Unless this thing involves a stake, I should be able to handle it. And I want this, Ray. I\u2019ve wanted it for over four hundred years.\u201d Here came the water-works again. Stupid, but this was a big deal. The impossible dream. You know?</p><p>\u201cI get that. And what\u2019s important to you, Glory girl, is important to me. Never met a woman who didn\u2019t hate something about her body. Even supermodels.\u201d He pulled me close again and kissed me on the lips, a sweet kiss. \u201cIf this is what you want, babe, and this guy has some magic formula that will get you there, I say go for it. Just be careful. I don\u2019t want to lose you. That\u2019s the bottom line for me.\u201d</p><p>Ian beamed. He was probably seeing a blank check and celebrity endorsements in his future.</p><p>I hugged Ray again, a tear slipping down my cheek. If there was one main difference between Blade, an ancient vampire, and Ray, a modern man, it was that Ray really seemed to get women and actually paid attention to what we want. I love Jerry, but he\u2019s still stuck back in the day when he had to be in protective mode all the time. Jerry figures he knows what we should want and that our basic needs and wants never change. You know: food, shelter, like that.</p><p>Sorry, but I\u2019ve survived mostly on my own for centuries. I figure I\u2019ve moved way beyond the basics. I may be foolish, but now I want what Jerry would consider the superficial\u2014a flattering wardrobe, a car that starts when I need it and the occasional designer handbag. The best? To look cute in skinny jeans. Sue me, but this weight-loss thing was important, and Ray had just become one of my heroes. Again.</p><p>I leaned back. \u201cI\u2019m paying for this myself. I have credit cards. This is not going to be on you.\u201d I didn\u2019t need to look to know that Ian had sagged with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later. I want to hear MacDonald\u2019s pitch.\u201d Ray kept me close by his side and glanced down. \u201cValdez, you put a hole in my pants and I guarantee you\u2019ll get no steak for a week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlory\u2019s perfect. She doesn\u2019t need a diet.\u201d Valdez was obviously going to report this entire scene to Jerry as soon as he had a chance.</p><p>\u201cI see you have a loyal guard.\u201d Ian smiled as he led the way into a massive den that could have been featured in a sophisticated design magazine. \u201cBut if I read him right, he\u2019s obviously in Campbell\u2019s employ, not Caine\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I started to deny it, but my bigmouthed mutt beat me to the punch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you read me right. I\u2019m Campbell\u2019s man, MacDonald. As Glory\u2019s sire, he pays me to make sure she stays safe no matter how far south her love life goes.\u201d He gave Ray a doggy sneer. \u201cGlory\u2019s my number-one priority tonight and always. There\u2019d better not be anything in this stuff you\u2019re selling that can hurt her.\u201d Valdez stayed close to my side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be a fool to hurt a client. Then I\u2019d have to shut down a lucrative operation. Trust me, I help people. Sit and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Ian gestured to a pair of cream leather sofas and picked up a remote. He waited until Ray and I were settled side by side, Valdez near my feet, before he hit a button that turned on a flat screen hanging on the wall above a natural stone fireplace.</p><p>The screen lit up with a picture of an unhappy woman who stood on his deck, the dark ocean behind her. She was about twenty pounds overweight, especially in the hip area, a pear shape.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Sarah Wainwright. I was turned vampire in 1786 and stuck with this pudgy body. Thanks to Ian MacDonald\u2019s magic formulas, I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll finally lose the extra weight I\u2019ve carried around all these years.\u201d She frowned into the camera. \u201cAre you freakin\u2019 kidding me? No way.\u201d She showed fangs and threw up her hands. \u201cBack off. Touch me and die.\u201d She took a shuddering breath, her breasts heaving. \u201cOf course I want to do the program.\u201d She sniffed and finally nodded. \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll take care of it myself.\u201d She jerked off her black hoodie and threw it toward the camera.</p><p>I looked at Ian. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her she had to strip off or people would think she was wearing padding for her \u2018before\u2019 pictures. She\u2019d agreed to be on camera for a discount on the services. When I revealed this detail, obviously she didn\u2019t take it well.\u201d He smiled and shrugged. \u201cThey never do.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered as Sarah tugged down her elastic-waisted jeans after toeing off her clogs. I could so relate to her attitude. Surely I wouldn\u2019t have to do this. I had no interest in joining Ian\u2019s showcase of \u201csuccess stories.\u201d Not even for a discount.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to see this all the way through?\u201d One glimpse of the cellulite on Sarah\u2019s thighs was enough for me. And now she was unbuttoning her white shirt. Valdez and Ray couldn\u2019t look away. I gave Ray an elbow and nudged the V-man with my foot.</p><p>\u201cYou want to see how the program works, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ian raised an eyebrow when he saw Ray\u2019s grin. \u201cSarah\u2019s just one of many examples I could show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I don\u2019t want to be humiliated like this woman.\u201d I was relieved when she kept on her bra and panties.</p><p>\u201cRelax, baby. You look a hell of a lot better than that chick naked.\u201d Ray nodded toward the screen. \u201cSee? She\u2019s flat-chested and all ass. You\u2019re much more . . .\u201d He squeezed my waist. \u201cWell-rounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to agree with Caine. Put you up against that woman any day, Glory. But, whoa, check this out. Do you see what I see?\u201d Valdez sat down with a thump.</p><p>I was checking it out. The date stamp indicated a two-week time lapse. Sarah had obviously lost all her excess baggage and just where she needed to. While she still wasn\u2019t exactly top-heavy, she was in proportion and looked amazing. Her stomach was flat and her ass taut. The bikini fit her like a second skin. But obviously Sarah wasn\u2019t content to strut her stuff in a swim suit. While we watched, she peeled it off and did a three-sixty for the camera. No doubt about it. Ian\u2019s program, whatever it was, had handed her a miracle cure. This was the same woman, just a lot less of her. She smiled into the camera.</p><p>\u201cIan, I can never thank you enough for the gift you gave me. I have more confidence, more energy and, even better, my vamp skills are off the charts.\u201d She showed off her fangs. \u201cHoney, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in this special brew you\u2019ve cooked up, but I\u2019m recommending it to every overweight vampire I know.\u201d She looked down and then up through her lashes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A flushed Ian moved into camera range with a red silk robe. He wrapped Sarah in it and faced the camera.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sarah, for that moving testimonial. Obviously my program has made your dreams come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of them, Ian baby.\u201d Sarah dropped the robe again and threw herself on the diet guru. \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously, Sarah, my elixirs have given you a tremendous amount of energy.\u201d Ian signaled frantically and two of his surfers pulled Sarah off him.</p><p>\u201cLater, lover!\u201d Sarah shouted as she was carried out of camera range.</p><p>Ian picked up the robe and tossed it aside, then cleared his throat as he buttoned his shirt.</p><p>\u201cSarah lost an incredible twenty-two pounds in just fourteen nights on my super-slimming weight-loss program.\u201d Ian smiled into the camera. \u201cFollowing my simple plan and drinking my specially formulated, all-natural supplements, you too can finally achieve the ideal size you\u2019ve always wanted. Visit my Web site or call my weight-loss hotline for details.\u201d The URL and eight-hundred number scrolled across the bottom of the screen before Ian turned off the TV.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I gripped Ray\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Glory, does this look like something you\u2019d be interested in trying?\u201d</p><p>Valdez and Ray stared at me, probably surprised I didn\u2019t immediately shout, \u201cYes.\u201d Which kind of pissed me off. What? Did I need to trim down so badly? Oh, who was I kidding? I\u2019d done nothing but gripe about my weight since I\u2019d met Valdez five years ago. And Ray knew how I felt too. Both men were way too smart to say a word, though. I took a breath and looked at Ian.</p><p>For a moment I wanted to bolt. Even if it meant shifting back into bat form, I wanted to get out of there. Smooth-talking, handsome-as-sin Ian MacDonald made me shiver. Why? I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. Maybe it was the vacant-eyed surfer dudes scattered around the deck outside. Or the lavishly decorated den that, despite a roaring fire in the stone fireplace, still chilled me to the bone. Then there was the man himself with his video and obvious indifference to poor Sarah\u2019s humiliation when she\u2019d exposed her cottage cheese thighs.</p><p>Of course I couldn\u2019t forget that he was Jerry\u2019s ancient enemy. I had paid attention to the \u201cMacDonalds are demons from hell\u201d stories I\u2019d heard at Castle Campbell. But the Ian MacDonald waiting for my answer now was no kilt-wearing, broadsword-hacking demon. He had a Web site, cooked up magic formulas and had even managed to look cute when Sarah had embarrassed him with her gratitude.</p><p>I desperately wanted to be thin and had wanted that forever. That meant I was going to have to play Ian\u2019s game, his way. Too bad he had that last name. I\u2019d just have to keep my eyes open. Of course Valdez was already on the case. I glanced down. V was practically quivering with animosity. Oookay.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to cost me?\u201d I flushed, not liking how that had come out. \u201cI mean, obviously this elixir or whatever is a valuable commodity.\u201d</p> <p>Valdez snorted and Ray reached for my hand again.</p><p>\u201cI told you, babe. Let this be on me. Whatever makes you happy, makes me happy.\u201d Ray had the devoted fianc\u00e9 act down pat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see such a committed couple. So rare in the vampire world.\u201d Ian\u2019s smile seemed sincere, but I heard something in his voice . . .</p><p>I shot Ray a warning look. I\u2019d blocked my thoughts from the get-go and assumed Ray had done the same. As far as Ian knew, Ray and I were a devoted couple. And my insistence on paying seemed silly under the circumstances. I decided I could settle this with my \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d later.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you insist, love.\u201d I leaned against Ray and smiled at Ian. \u201cRay\u2019s very generous. While the video was impressive, I really don\u2019t want to waste his money. So tell me more. Exactly what\u2019s involved here, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re a practical woman. Admirable.\u201d Ian snapped his fingers and a slim woman in black running shorts and matching sports bra scurried into the room. She carried a tray loaded with bottles. It didn\u2019t take more than a few seconds for me to pick up on the fact that the lady was mortal. The bottles rattled as she set the tray on the wooden coffee table in front of us. Then she stepped back, watching Ian closely, her hands clasped behind her.</p><p>\u201cThis is Trina.\u201d Ian smiled at her and she visibly relaxed. \u201cTell me, dear one, did you do your fifteen-mile run as I instructed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d She smiled and pushed her dark hair behind one ear. \u201cI made it twenty, to please you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Ian reached out his hand and she hurried to take it. \u201cAnd when was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished less than thirty minutes ago, then showered and dried my hair.\u201d She pulled his hand to her stomach. \u201cHave I pleased you, Master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now this female vampire will drink from you. Make it a pleasant experience for her. Do whatever she wishes.\u201d Ian brushed his thumb across Trina\u2019s bare stomach when her mouth tightened and it looked like she might protest. \u201cThis will please me very much.\u201d He ran his thumb up to her breast. \u201cAnd later tonight I\u2019ll please you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I thought I saw rebellion in Trina\u2019s dark eyes, but she merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Master. Whatever you wish.\u201d She turned to me. \u201cYou want to drink from me here? Or do you wish to be private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait just a minute.\u201d I glanced at Ray. He was fighting a grin, like he could get into watching a little girl-on-girl action. I pinched his hard thigh. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m not into drinking from mortals, thank you very much. And she brought in bottles. I figured those contained your magic potion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of those bottles are supplements. I\u2019ll explain them later. They\u2019re clearly labeled. Others are refreshments for Mr. Caine to enjoy while he waits for us.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cMy program has several key components, Glory. One effective treatment is to drink from a mortal who has just exercised vigorously.\u201d Ian ran his hand down Trina\u2019s nonexistent hip.</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t just drink something from a bottle?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure I liked this, but, in a strange way, it made sense. Something to do with a revved-up metabolism, I guess.</p><p>\u201cNo, you must drink from the source and soon after that source\u201d\u2014he smiled as he stroked Trina\u2019s taut thigh\u2014\u201chas completed the exercise for the best effect.\u201d Ian stood and gestured for me to do the same. \u201cNow, Glory, I\u2019m going to weigh and measure you. After that, you\u2019ll drink from Trina. When you come back here tomorrow night, I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019ll be down at least two pounds. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Ian. I thought you said this program was revolutionary. Any vampire knows you can drink from a mortal for special effects.\u201d I turned to Ray. \u201cRemember, Ray? You can get high from a mortal who\u2019s just done drugs or is drunk. It\u2019s the same with a runner. The healing sleep wipes out any \u2018effects.\u2019 Always has.\u201d I stood and pulled Ray up with me, so disappointed I wanted to bawl like a baby. \u201cI knew this was too good to be true. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, wait. Hear me out.\u201d Ian was on his feet. He gestured at the bottles between us. \u201cSee those? They are the difference. My special formulas make it possible for the weight loss to stay off. Even after you sleep. I\u2019ve spent decades in the lab perfecting these.\u201d He waved a hand toward the dark TV screen. \u201cYou saw Sarah. That kind of loss didn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d</p><p>I slowly sat again. \u201cNo, I guess it couldn\u2019t have.\u201d I picked up one of the bottles. \u201cWhat are you, some kind of scientist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been many things in my over five hundred years. Even a medical doctor.\u201d Ian held out his hand. \u201cAre you going to trust me on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Glory. This whole operation reeks. You\u2019d be nuts to trust a MacDonald. When Blade hears about this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez, hush. Blade\u2019s old news. I\u2019m with Ray now.\u201d I pretended not to notice Ian\u2019s intent gaze. \u201cGive me a minute to wrap my brain around all this.\u201d</p><p>Ray put his arm around me. \u201cTake your time, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade?\u201d Ian sat across from us again.</p><p>\u201cJeremy Blade, Glory\u2019s former boyfriend. Valdez forgets who\u2019s buying his rib eyes these days.\u201d Ray gave V a warning look.</p><p>I hoped Ian bought that story. I tuned them out while I tried to think. Down two pounds in one night? Was it possible? But wait. Now he wanted to weigh me? No one, I mean no one, knew my weight. And he\u2019d write it down where anyone could come across it. Those snoopy bastards from the tabloids, for example. I\u2019d be like every other famous person with a weight issue, my number a headline on the front cover along with a picture of me with a really gross butt shot. Oh, God, could this possibly be worth it?</p><p>I wanted to fly the hell out of there. This was even worse than the measuring. But to actually lose two pounds after a day of healing sleep . . .</p><p>Valdez moved closer and bumped my knee. \u201cSeriously, Glo. Let\u2019s get the hell out of here. I\u2019m getting bad vibes. Blade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll hate it, but won\u2019t be able to stop me. Don\u2019t mention him again.\u201d I grabbed Valdez\u2019s collar when he looked like he wanted to start something, like maybe \u201caccidentally\u201d knock over that tray of bottles. Of course if he really lunged at anything, I had zero chance of stopping him. I\u2019m vamp strong, but he\u2019s in a category all by himself strengthwise.</p><p>And then there was Trina, who was checking out Ray and obviously wishing he was the one with the weight issue. Yeah, right. My \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d had a single-digit percentage of body fat.</p><p>\u201cWell, Glory, are you going to do this program or not? It\u2019s your call.\u201d Ray pulled out his wallet and extracted a black credit card that could have paid for a villa in the south of France and still not hit a limit. Ian played it cool, but I\u2019m sure he wanted to snatch it and run up a big tab before Ray could put it out of sight again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sighed and stood. My jeans were cutting into my midsection despite the blessing of a little spandex. I pulled down my T-shirt but could still feel the muffin top bulging above the waistband. I walked over to Trina and sniffed. B positive, a nice healthy one too. And she was fresh from a shower that had involved a hint of lavender. Ian and Ray were both on their feet, watching me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but Ray, baby, you stay here. Valdez, you come with me for the weigh-in, but, I swear to God, if you look at my weight, I\u2019ll post a picture on the Internet of a Chihuahua having a bad hair day and claim it\u2019s your true form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough talk, Glory, but I\u2019ll do what I have to if this a-hole threatens your safety.\u201d Valdez stayed between Ian and me. \u201cHear this, MacDonald. If any harm comes to Glory, you\u2019ll have every Campbell in Scotland on you like fleas on my ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the Campbells, but find that threat interesting. A sire isn\u2019t usually so involved with a vampire he\u2019s made and released, so to speak.\u201d Ian faced me. \u201cWho do you belong to, Glory? Caine here? Or a Campbell?\u201d</p><p>I felt my fangs fully extend and my face grow hot. \u201cI don\u2019t belong to anyone, Ian. A Campbell made me, but we parted ways long ago.\u201d I snarled at Valdez. \u201cThe shifter oversteps and will hear about this later.\u201d I looked back at Ray and managed a smile. \u201cMy love life is my concern. Since Ray is willing to pay . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more.\u201d Ian nodded and took Ray\u2019s credit card. \u201cI admire independent women. Clearly you\u2019re one of them.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the MacDonald vampire. \u201cI\u2019m independent but not stupid and I do have powerful friends. So does Ray. This had better be on the up-and-up. And I will let the shifter do his thing if this \u2018treatment\u2019 is just a con.\u201d</p><p>Ray and Valdez were involved in a stare-down. \u201cThe shifter may not live that long. You keep popping off like that, fur face, and I\u2019ll see you replaced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Valdez glanced at me. \u201cThat\u2019s not your call, Caine. Glory, care to straighten him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, V. Right now you\u2019re hanging on by a thread.\u201d I wanted to get on with this. \u201cIan? Are we clear? This thing totally safe and on the up-and-up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the tape, Glory. And I could show you dozens more of my success stories if it would make you feel better. Even introduce you to some of the vampires. But it would delay things. Maybe a week or more to get them here. If you wish to wait . . .\u201d Ian smiled and toyed with the credit card, acting like he could care less if we proceeded or not.</p><p>A week. The Grammys would be over and I\u2019d be on my way back to Texas. I really, really wanted to look good on the red carpet. The event would be televised. Millions would be watching, including Jerry\u2019s mum, who hates me and would be hoping I\u2019d fall flat on my face. She cheered when Ray and I announced our fake engagement. Is still hoping I\u2019ll marry Ray and leave her precious son alone.</p><p>How cool to lose enough weight to freak out those designers on that reality show. They\u2019d come for the fittings and their dresses would positively bag on me. They\u2019d argue about who\u2019d measured wrong. It would make for great TV and I\u2019d just stand there, looking skinny and perfectly innocent in my new size-six body. Would that be mean of me? Maybe I was tired of being good old Glory.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d I looked at Ray and he winked.</p> <p>\u201cFine. Follow me.\u201d Ian gestured at the coffee table. \u201cThere are several excellent bottles of mortal juice there, Mr. Caine, if you wish to indulge. As I said, they\u2019re clearly labeled for your enjoyment. I\u2019ll be back shortly. Glory and Trina will join us when they\u2019re done. This way, please, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I trailed Ian, my stomach doing a dip and roll that made me wonder if I could drink from Trina and keep it down. Valdez sulked by my side. We stepped into an office painted pale gray with a wall of windows overlooking the ocean. A chrome and glass desk held a computer and a setup that Ian made use of as he punched in numbers. Running Ray\u2019s card no doubt. His grin confirmed it. Well, that part was out of the way. I\u2019d be sure we got a receipt. I just hoped I\u2019d be able to pay the cost back before the turn of the next century.</p><p>Valdez stood, scowling, next to Trina, while Ian picked up a clipboard and led me to a doctor\u2019s scale in one corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your measurements too.\u201d</p><p>Valdez snorted. \u201cFour times in one night. That\u2019s some kind of record, Glory. Guess you\u2019ve experienced your own personal hell tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I made a face at the tape in Ian\u2019s hand. \u201cReality show. Designers are making dresses for me to wear on the red carpet. Tonight they taped the first segment.\u201d</p><p>Ian kept smiling as he reached around me to measure my waist. \u201cWon\u2019t they be surprised when they bring back those dresses and they\u2019re too big?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, totally stoked by the whole idea. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I thought. They\u2019ll be back in four days for a fitting. Think that\u2019s enough time for them to see a difference?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou stick strictly to my program, the fast track, and I guarantee it.\u201d Ian reached around me to measure my breasts. His eyes gleamed as he sent me a mental message that made me blink.</p><p>Whoa. So Ian was a little tired of bony babes in running shorts. I filed that away. I figured I could be on the miracle cure of the ages and still have plenty upstairs. I glanced at Trina and then remembered Sarah in the video. I didn\u2019t want to end up flat-chested. And running shoes sure aren\u2019t my idea of a fashion statement.</p><p>\u201cYou can stop the program when you reach your ideal weight and size. You know what that is?\u201d Ian led me to the scale.</p><p>I had forgotten to block my thoughts. So Mr. Nosy knew just what I\u2019d been thinking. I glanced at Trina and Valdez. They both were very interested in what Ian and I were up to.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve had centuries to think about it. I want to fit into size-six jeans. I want to have the top to match, but still have nice cleavage.\u201d I flushed. Maybe that was too much information. Ian\u2019s gaze had gone hot and it swept over me.</p><p>\u201cStep on the scale, Glory. Have you weighed before?\u201d</p><p>I kicked off my shoes. \u201cYes, and I know my number. So I\u2019ll know if this scale is accurate.\u201d I stopped short. \u201cDamn. Maybe I should take off my jeans. I bet they\u2019re adding at least three pounds.\u201d</p><p>Ian grinned. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>Valdez was beside me in a shot and growled at Ian. \u201cOver my dead body.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at him. \u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>Ian laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we agree that I\u2019ll subtract three from whatever shows up on the scale?\u201d</p><p>I could see Valdez wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cFine. Back to the door, V. I mean it.\u201d I watched until he was safely beside Trina again. \u201cI guess we can\u2019t skip this part.\u201d I was avoiding the moment of truth. I knew my weight was too much for my five-foot-five-inch height. I\u2019d studied the charts, read the articles, wailed about my fate for way too long.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d Ian smiled sympathetically. \u201cGet it over with. It will only get better. When you see the number get smaller, you\u2019ll feel fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. You promise no one else sees this? You did say you were a doctor with all that doctor-patient-confidentiality thing going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d Ian took my hand to help me step on the scale.</p><p>I whipped around. \u201cValdez, turn around. Face the door. I mean it. I don\u2019t want you even looking in this direction. Ian isn\u2019t going to hurt me. I\u2019ll yell if I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d Valdez gave Ian one more growl and then did turn around, his tail going up to shoot a furry finger at the MacDonald.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Trina. This is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Trina looked like she wanted to say more, but a hard look from her \u201cmaster\u201d got her skinny butt moving and she faced the door in short order.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d I stepped on the scale, wincing as Ian slid the metal weights up until he was satisfied. \u201cWait!\u201d I blew out air, like that might make a pound difference.</p><p>Ian laughed and wrote down the number I knew too well. \u201cRelax, Glory. You\u2019re overreacting. I\u2019ve worked with vampires who had a lot more to lose than you have. By this time next week, you\u2019ll be in a size six or I\u2019ll give Caine his money back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I flung myself off the scale and into Ian\u2019s arms. Can you blame me? I\u2019d just had a man promise me the moon. \u201cThat would be so incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, incredible.\u201d Valdez was right beside me again. \u201cLet her go, MacDonald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back to the door!\u201d I screeched, lunging to slide the weights back to zero. \u201cDamn it, V, I told you to stay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, for the record, she was holding me, not the other way around.\u201d Ian laid his clipboard facedown and smiled at me. \u201cNow, I\u2019d better get back to Caine with a receipt for this. Glory, drink from Trina as soon as possible. The effects of her run will be wearing off in a few minutes. You don\u2019t want that to happen, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d I followed Ian to the door. I still felt funny drinking from a mortal, but if this is what it would take, and she seemed willing enough, I\u2019d do it. I ignored Valdez\u2019s disapproving look. \u201cWhere . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me. Guess the dog comes too. He doesn\u2019t seem to want you out of his sight.\u201d Trina gave Valdez a disdainful look. \u201cWise of you, mutt. I have a black belt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Gucci?\u201d Valdez snarled and showed his impressive canines.</p><p>\u201cYou want to try me?\u201d Trina struck a pose.</p><p>\u201cTrina, get a clue. Valdez would be snacking on your foot before you got off kick one.\u201d I followed Trina into a bedroom. Oh, this was so not happening on a bed. \u201cV? Sit outside the door. She\u2019s just a mortal. If I need you, I\u2019ll yell. You\u2019ll hear me and knock down the door. Think what fun that will be. Then you can tear Trina apart with my blessing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll be waiting. Eagerly.\u201d Valdez plopped down on the Oriental rug in the hallway. \u201cAnd keep in mind that locks won\u2019t keep me out. I live to destroy\u2014anyone who hurts my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, see me tremble.\u201d Trina shook her hands in the air.</p><p>I sent Valdez a message that said I agreed that Trina was an idiot and that I\u2019d hurry, then slammed the door. There was a chair in the corner of the room next to a window with yet another breathtaking view of the ocean. No telling how many millions this house cost. Slimming down vampires obviously paid really well. The thought dampened my appetite. Then I saw Trina\u2019s open closet door. Size-zero jeans hung there. Zero. I\u2019d never even bothered to dream about such a thing.</p> <p>\u201cSit in the chair. Hand me your wrist.\u201d I pulled up a matching ottoman and sat on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Not going to do a little more? Most of Ian\u2019s female vamps like turning this into fun and games.\u201d Trina touched my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re prettier than some clients. And you managed to get a man like Israel Caine to propose to you. I\u2019m, um, intrigued.\u201d She slid her hand down to my shoulder. \u201cCome on, Glory. At least take me at the neck. It\u2019s so much more intimate.\u201d</p><p>I breathed in a jolt of good-quality B positive. Then I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be intimate with you, Trina. I save that for the men I love. This is a business transaction, nothing more. And I really hate taking advantage of you this way. I meant it when I said I don\u2019t normally drink from mortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appeal to you at all?\u201d Trina brushed against me, her nipples hard against my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that in the hundreds of years you\u2019ve been alive you\u2019ve never experimented ...\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the door, sure Valdez was getting an earful with his supersonic hearing. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201d I pulled her wrist to my lips and hit the vein. The instant the rich blood filled my mouth, I was all about the feeding. I heard Trina moan, apparently enjoying the sensation. She even tried to reach for me again, but I didn\u2019t give a damn.</p> <p>I was high on the taste and heat of the mortality surging into my body. It was so warm, made me feel so alive. It\u2019s the only time I really felt that way. And I\u2019d missed it. Denied myself the pleasure. And this time . . . Maybe Ian had something here. Because this experience . . . The energy was exhilarating, beyond anything I\u2019d ever felt before during feeding. This was wow! Only the realization that Trina\u2019s hand had crept onto my bra snapped me out of it.</p><p>I released her and reared back, plucking away that hand and jumping to my feet. My whole body quivered. Oh, God. I leaned over to make the room stop spinning. This feeling. Like I\u2019d run twenty miles, was still running. My heart pounded and my legs ached. What a great feeling.</p><p>I struggled to catch my breath, my hands on my knees as I glanced up and saw the ocean. One of Ian\u2019s surfers caught a wave and rode it in. My adrenaline rush had to be similar. I was soaring.</p><p>\u201cGlory.\u201d Trina stood behind me, her warm hand on my back. \u201cAre you okay? Do I need to get Ian?\u201d She rubbed my shoulders, even leaned on me for a moment, her breath hot as she kissed the back of my head. \u201cThat was incredible. Please come to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m fine. Give me a moment.\u201d I finally straightened and stepped away from her. \u201cThank you. For the donation. For a mortal, you seem awfully at ease with our wacko world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been into the paranormal. I just knew that things like vampires had to be real.\u201d Her eyes were shining, but her face was pale and she suddenly sat down on the foot of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to become one of you. If I please the master . . . You\u2019ll tell him, won\u2019t you? That I served you well?\u201d She put out a shaky hand.</p> <p>\u201cSure, you were fantastic. Best feeding ever.\u201d Oh, great. Now I had a serious case of the guilts. Had I taken too much? I stepped closer to her, touched her cheek to see if she was too cold, which would be a bad sign. She grabbed my hand and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI want to please you again, Glory.\u201d</p><p>Thank God, she was warm and I carefully extricated myself, relieved when she stood. I put up a hand when it looked like she was going to hug me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Ray\u2019s waiting. And Valdez, of course. Stay behind me. And, for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t touch me in front of either of them. They wouldn\u2019t take it well.\u201d</p><p>Trina giggled. \u201cNeither would Ian. Men. What do they know about pleasure? Next time, maybe . . . ?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head but that didn\u2019t seem to faze her. I headed for the door. When I opened it, Valdez gave me a narrow-eyed look, like he was inspecting me for signs of debauchery. I just strutted past him. Because, boy, did I feel amazing. And, would you believe, lighter somehow. Seriously, I thought my jeans were already looser. Probably my imagination, but I was so going to find a scale when we got back to the hotel.</p><p>Ray and Ian were drinking from bottles of his \u201cjuice\u201d when Trina and I got back to the living room. They jumped up when they saw us.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Glory? You look . . . jazzed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel that way.\u201d I turned to Ian. \u201cI don\u2019t know about weight loss, but the effects of feeding from her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a rush, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ian slung his arm around Trina. \u201cShe\u2019ll be here for you tomorrow. You must come every night around midnight. I\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s ready. There will be other things you\u2019ll have to do too. Not just this. I\u2019ll explain them tomorrow. For now, I have two bottles of other special products for you to take with you. Drink one before you sleep and one when you rise tomorrow. They\u2019re clearly marked. This is very important, Glory, if you want the effects of your feedings from Trina to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d Ray glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got rehearsal and I\u2019m not leaving you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I guess that means shifting again.\u201d I hated the thought but felt pumped enough that I figured I could do it easily.</p><p>\u201cNo need. I have a limo waiting to take you to the venue where Caine told me he\u2019s rehearsing, then it will take you on to the hotel, Glory. I hope that\u2019s satisfactory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d I smiled at Ian. Now I was really liking him, MacDonald or not. He\u2019d been nice about the weigh-in. And that feeding . . . Well, who knew? Shoot. Maybe I was high. I smiled at Ray too. Even Valdez got a head pat. Nothing could bring me down right now.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, Ian. It\u2019ll just be Valdez and me. Ray, you don\u2019t have to come again. I know you\u2019re busy.\u201d I cuddled up to Ray. Part of the loving-engaged-couple thing, of course.</p><p>Ray frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. Now, let\u2019s hit the road. Forget the Campbells, MacDonald. Take care of my girl or there will be hell to pay from me. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I find all this protectiveness toward your fianc\u00e9e quite admirable.\u201d Ian walked us to the stairs that led down to the driveway and the waiting limousine. \u201cAnd think about that other product, Caine. It\u2019s a vampire\u2019s dream come true.\u201d</p><p>We settled into the backseat of the limo, the glass up and shielding us from the driver before I asked the burning question.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ray, what\u2019s the other product Ian\u2019s trying to sell?\u201d Maybe my good feelings were wearing off, because now I was a little tired. Running twenty miles will do that to you, I guess.</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s got something that can allow me to go out in the sun.\u201d Ray stared into my eyes. \u201cI\u2019d see daylight again. You know what that would mean to me, Glory?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his arm on one side and Valdez\u2019s fur on the other. \u201cI know that if it doesn\u2019t work and you try it, sweetheart, you\u2019re toast.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trusting him. Why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Ray leaned back on the leather seat. \u201cI want this. Ian says he can make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Not even the Energy Vampires have a formula for surviving daylight yet.\u201d I remembered the head of the vampire cult, famous for their Vampire Viagra, telling me that. (Yeah, go figure. Even vamps enjoy a boost in their sex lives.) \u201cThe only way to test a drug like that is to send a vampire into the sun. Who\u2019d be crazy enough to try it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan says . . .\u201d Ray shook his head. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019re here. I\u2019ve got to go. We\u2019ll talk about this later at the hotel.\u201d He leaned across me to look at Valdez. \u201cTake care of my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201c Your lady. Yeah, right. Don\u2019t let the act go to your head, Caine. And don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d Valdez lifted his chin. \u201cBlade\u2019s at the hotel waiting for her right now. When he hears where you took her tonight, the shit\u2019s goin\u2019 to hit the fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it. Glory\u2019s going to do what she wants. Am I right, sweet thing?\u201d Ray brushed his thumb across my cheek to my lips.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d I held Ray\u2019s hand for a moment. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t do anything with Ian without discussing it with me first, Ray. Please?\u201d I knew how much he missed the sun. He\u2019d been a freak about his boat, his tropical island paradise, his beach. Even the fact that he\u2019d now live forever hadn\u2019t come close to making up for the loss of those hours he\u2019d spent in the sun. He was a \u201clive for the moment\u201d kind of guy. Forever didn\u2019t seem to matter that much to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Glory. You\u2019re still my vamp mentor, babe, but I don\u2019t dance to your tune.\u201d He leaned in and kissed my lips. \u201cStill, I realize I owe you my life. Such as it is. See you later.\u201d He opened the door as soon as the limo stopped. \u201cSay hi to Blade for me. The man doesn\u2019t pose a threat to me, Valdez. He\u2019s stuck in the past. Glory knows it and so do you. My lady\u2019s a \u2018now\u2019 kind of woman. When she gets her new look, she\u2019ll be ready for even more changes.\u201d He grinned, then slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cArrogant son of a bitch,\u201d Valdez muttered as the car pulled away from the curb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked back and saw Ray surrounded by female fans and a few photographers. He was laughing and signing autographs, the picture of virile hot guy in worn jeans and leather jacket over a white T-shirt. I\u2019d never seen Blade in that kind of outfit. Probably never would. Just like I\u2019d never see Ray in a kilt. Though he had great legs . . .</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have gone without his bodyguards.\u201d I frowned as he disappeared from sight. \u201cSome of his fans get aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only a few steps from the auditorium entrance and he is a freakin\u2019 vampire. But I guess he can\u2019t exactly show fang to his adoring public, now, can he?\u201d Valdez snorted. \u201cCall Brit and have her meet him there if you\u2019re so worried about him.\u201d</p> <p>Brittany was model gorgeous, had a killer body and the skills to match. Valdez had something going with the shifter who was one of Ray\u2019s paranormal bodyguards. Ray\u2019s mortal guards still hadn\u2019t figured out why Ray had added her to his security team, but they weren\u2019t complaining. She could twist any man around her well-manicured little finger, my V-man included.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d I hit speed dial and soon had Brit headed to Ray\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Caine. He can handle a few female fans gone wild.\u201d Valdez sat up when we got near the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about this sunlight thing. I want Brit on Ray\u2019s tail his every waking moment. Get her alone and tell her that. If he tries to strike a deal with Ian to use this new potion, I want to know about it so I can try to head Ray off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s okay for you to drink whatever swill MacDonald\u2019s cooked up, but not for your buddy Ray?\u201d Valdez nudged me with a paw. \u201cYou see the problem with your logic? This Scot\u2019s got a hell of a lot more reason to do something nasty to you than to a world-famous rock star, Glory. You were made by a Campbell. That puts you solidly in the enemy camp in his book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an ancient feud. Surely they\u2019ve moved past it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to Castle Campbell, heard the laird rant on the subject. These feuds never die. The one with the MacDonalds is particularly grim. Lots of murder and mayhem in the past. Google the two clans and see what you get. I think you\u2019ll find that Blade will have good reason to go nuts when he hears you\u2019ve put your life in Ian\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s overstating it, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019m just trying to lose a few pounds. That\u2019s all.\u201d I frowned at the cloth bag in my lap with my two bottles of supplements. \u201cRay\u2019s deal is much more serious. He\u2019d have to actually walk into the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019d have to stay awake to do that. Seems unlikely.\u201d Valdez showed his teeth. \u201cOnce Blade hears the man\u2019s got you drinking God knows what and biting mortals, MacDonald won\u2019t live long enough to give Caine a glimmer of light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave Jerry to me, V. I mean it. Not one word to him. I\u2019ll tell him about this when I\u2019m ready.\u201d As the car pulled up in front of the hotel, I decided Ray was right about one thing. Blade\u2019s reaction to this deal with Ian would be important. If Jerry started issuing orders to me again like he\u2019d done for centuries now . . . Well, it just wasn\u2019t going to work. And I was really tired of the same old arguments. You know?</p><p>With that depressing thought going round in my head, I walked into the hotel. We had to dodge only two paparazzi who snapped pictures of Valdez and me. I\u2019d forgotten V\u2019s leash, which earned us frowns from some of the hotel guests and probably a headline about me and leash laws. I leaned down and grabbed his collar as we approached the front desk and the clerk behind the counter.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a gym here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, Ms. St. Clair. It\u2019s open twenty-four hours for your convenience. You may use your room key card to enter.\u201d The woman knew exactly who I was. Any consort of Israel Caine\u2019s could have walked an unleashed herd of rabid hyenas into the lobby and she wouldn\u2019t have cared. \u201cWould you like for someone to show you where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a scale in there? I want to weigh myself.\u201d I smiled sheepishly and leaned in. \u201cI\u2019ve been dieting and I\u2019m dying to know if I\u2019ve lost any weight yet.\u201d</p><p>The clerk quickly hid her thrill at having something to sell to the tabloids. This was sure to hit newsstands soon. Which was fine by me. Better than the baby-trap stories.</p><p>\u201cOf course we have scales, a state-of-the-art gym and even personal trainers available if you want one.\u201d She snapped her fingers and a bellman appeared at my elbow. \u201cFritz, escort Ms. St. Clair and her dog down to the gym, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trainer necessary and I forgot my key card.\u201d And my purse. I travel light when I change into a bat. I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m hoping someone upstairs will let me in after I weigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>In less than a minute I had a new card and Fritz was leading us down a hall to the gym. Once I knew where to find the room with the scales, I quickly dismissed the bellman with a five-dollar bill I kept stashed in my pocket for emergencies.</p> <p>\u201cThis is crazy. You really need to weigh now? You just left Ian\u2019s place. What\u2019s this going to prove?\u201d Valdez slumped next to the door in the spot where I pointed. \u201cBlade\u2019s going to be looking for you. He\u2019ll be on the roof right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will just take a minute. Ian said I might have already lost a few pounds, and I feel lighter. I want to check it out.\u201d Jerry and I had set up this date before I\u2019d met with the reality show people. I\u2019d tried to estimate how my evening would go and picked a time, but I was cutting it close. Well, Jerry was used to me running late and this was important. I took a breath, closed the door with Valdez on the outside and looked around to make sure there weren\u2019t any security cameras recording this. Paranoid much? You bet. Then I stepped on the scale.</p><p>After adjusting the weights, I just stared. Subtracted the three for the jeans of course, then looked again. The scale didn\u2019t move. So this was it. My weight. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Two and a half pounds. I\u2019d lost two and a half pounds. Just like that. I leaped off the scale, slammed the weights back to zero and then happy-danced around the room. I flung open the door and hugged a startled Valdez.</p><p>\u201cI actually lost weight. And not a little like I might have done before when if I\u2019d snacked on a mortal who\u2019d taken a run, but two and a half pounds!\u201d I hugged him again, then reached for the waistband of my jeans. Could I get a finger inside there? Yes! \u201cLook! Can you believe it? This is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a trick. Maybe the girl at the counter here at the hotel works for MacDonald. They set this up.\u201d Valdez obviously wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got to see if it\u2019s still off in the evening when you wake up, remember?\u201d</p><p>I took a moment to think about that. Diabolical, but possible. Vampires are nothing if not devious. And Ian could be doing this to get a Campbell\u2019s woman to trust him for some reason. I didn\u2019t want to believe it. Or come down off this high.</p><p>\u201cThe supplements are supposed to keep the weight off while I sleep. But I\u2019ll keep an open mind. I\u2019ll get Nathan to send someone out to buy my own scale tomorrow to keep in the suite. Will that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should make you feel better. Now, let\u2019s head for the roof. I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut for a while, but if you don\u2019t tell Blade about MacDonald, I will.\u201d Valdez gave me his best stare.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. You\u2019re right about stuff hitting the fan. Jerry will hate this and won\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a big deal to me.\u201d Which was really a bummer. You\u2019d like to think the most important man in your life would develop a little insight after four hundred years. \u201cHe\u2019s going to freak when he hears I spent the evening with a MacDonald.\u201d I heard a giggle come out of my mouth. I was that excited. \u201cI tell you, V. If Ian\u2019s stuff works, there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m giving it up.\u201d</p><p>Valdez followed me into the elevator. \u201cThen we\u2019d better stop at the suite first. You could use a hairbrush and some lipstick before you see Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, pal.\u201d I rubbed his head. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. When talking doesn\u2019t work with Jerry, action usually does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to hear this.\u201d Valdez watched me punch the button for our floor and bumped against me. \u201cWomen.\u201d</p><p>I just smiled and headed for the suite. I was going to change clothes too. Put on a clingy sweater in Jerry\u2019s favorite blue. I know how to turn my man into an obliging puddle of lust. But getting him to realize he was going to tolerate my trafficking with a MacDonald ... Well, I didn\u2019t look forward to that argument. I definitely needed my war paint.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late. I was just about to push my way into that room you share with Caine, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry pulled me into his arms as soon as I stepped onto the terrace of the rooftop restaurant. \u201cI was getting worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I had that reality-show thing. Which took longer than I thought it would. Then we took a quick trip out to Malibu.\u201d I smiled and kissed Jerry\u2019s cheek. \u201cThe ocean is beautiful at night. We should go out there and have a romantic evening while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d He pulled me toward a table set up near the brick wall surrounding the flat roof. The restaurant had closed for the night, but Jerry had probably bribed someone to light candles on the tables nearby and leave a stereo on with romantic music playing softly in the background. Bouquets of bloodred roses, my favorite, were scattered around the terrace. Their delicious scent perfumed the air, but I still detected the AB negative that filled the crystal wineglasses on one table. That had to have been strictly BYOB. \u201cThis is wonderful. Very romantic.\u201d I smiled up at him as he held out a chair and I slipped into it, watching him as he gestured for Valdez to leave us alone. I got a significant look from my bodyguard before he disappeared into the open door to the restaurant. It closed softly behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI feel terribly underdressed. You look very handsome, Jeremiah.\u201d I leaned forward and took his hand as he sat across from me. I was telling the simple truth. He wore a soft sweater, probably cashmere, in a forest green that complemented his dark eyes and hair. It certainly hugged his broad shoulders nicely. He was much more strongly built than Ray, with a warrior\u2019s muscles. This warrior had been tested in battle before he\u2019d been turned. Gulp. I suddenly remembered that some of those battles he\u2019d told me about had been against Clan MacDonald.</p><p>\u201cFlorence has been shopping for me again. She insisted that Richard and I needed to update our wardrobes.\u201d Jerry shrugged and looked slightly embarrassed. \u201cIf it pleases you, then I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and leaned across the table to kiss him thoroughly. I ran my hands over the soft wool, exploring those hard shoulders. Mmm. How could I ever be tempted by anyone else? He tasted clean and delicious and all mine. I sighed and leaned back. Was I stalling? Probably. No, definitely.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop now.\u201d Jerry stood and walked around the table. \u201cCome here and do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we need to talk.\u201d I hated to say it. Hated even more to follow through on it.</p><p>\u201cTalk. Yes, I guess we should. Occasionally. It\u2019s what couples are supposed to do, Florence says. She\u2019s been watching some show on TV. She\u2019s got Richard promising to go to couples therapy if he doesn\u2019t \u2018open up\u2019 about his past.\u201d Jerry laughed. \u201cTrust me. Flo doesn\u2019t want to hear about that man\u2019s past. He\u2019s killed more wrong-headed vampires than anyone I know.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. I liked Richard. And my best friend loved him. I didn\u2019t want to picture him as a cold-blooded killer. \u201cHow does he decide who\u2019s \u2018wrong-headed\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him some night.\u201d Jerry pulled me up and into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m not getting involved in their love life. You wanted to talk. Let\u2019s stick to our own topics. What do you want to talk about? Why did you go to Malibu? Caine have business there?\u201d</p> <p>Uh-oh. Here it comes. I glanced toward the darkened restaurant, but Valdez was nowhere to be seen. Not that he\u2019d help me. He would just make matters worse. Chime in that he\u2019d warned me not to go out there. Blah, blah, blah.</p><p>\u201cNo, I had business out there. I went to see a man about a new product.\u201d I eased out of Jerry\u2019s arms and sat again. I took a sip of the synthetic, then set the glass down. Would this add more weight? Maybe I should only drink what Ian prescribed. I frowned and pushed it away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is the synthetic off? That\u2019s the brand you like, the type.\u201d Jerry picked up the glass and sniffed, then took a sip. \u201cSeems okay to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m on a diet.\u201d I waited for his reaction. I didn\u2019t have long to wait.</p><p>He laughed. Yep, you heard me. A hearty, full-out, \u201cisn\u2019t Glory a hoot\u201d laugh. Oh, it was a real knee-slapper. The idea that a vampire would go on a diet. Because if it wasn\u2019t a joke, it was pathetic, right? I just waited it out. Until Jerry realized I wasn\u2019t smiling, just staring at him and still not sipping the expensive brew he\u2019d poured for my enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cAll right. What\u2019s this, then? You seem serious. Haven\u2019t we been through this before?\u201d He took my hand. \u201cWhen you deny yourself nourishment, Gloriana, you become weak. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He lifted my hand to his lips and pressed a kiss to my palm. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to risk it for a few measly ounces. Which, as I remember, is all this practice ever bought you.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, I\u2019d tried the starvation bit before. The first time had been before meeting his parents. Well, you try heading for Castle Campbell and facing a laird and his lady when you\u2019re nothing but a commoner. Back in those days stuff like that had mattered. And in Lady Campbell\u2019s tiny brain, believe me, it still did. The fact that I\u2019d been an actress had also branded me a whore in her eyes. And then I\u2019d refused to marry Jerry. Oh, yeah, I keep my scarlet A handy when I\u2019m around Mag Campbell. I just paste it on my forehead to save her the trouble of screaming it in my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not starving myself, Jerry. This is different. I\u2019m on a special program. I fed from a mortal earlier. A runner. You wouldn\u2019t believe the effect!\u201d I squeezed his hand. \u201cAnd I just weighed. I\u2019ve already lost over two pounds!\u201d</p><p>Jerry pulled me up and looked me over. He even turned me around and checked out my backside. \u201cI can see that.\u201d He ran his hand down my rump. \u201cMuch as I love this curve, I know you fash yourself about it. So if this makes you happy, have at it.\u201d</p><p>I threw my arms around his neck and gave him a kiss guaranteed to melt his Prada belt buckle. But I carefully blocked my thoughts. The bad news was yet to come. I was going to have to spill the MacDonald beans before Valdez did. When I pulled back, we were both breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cA runner, eh. Seems a simple concept. Who thought of it?\u201d Jerry ran his hands down my back but kept me pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cA vampire I met at the club last night. Damian introduced us. That\u2019s who Ray and I met out at Malibu.\u201d I pushed back, deciding I needed some space for this story.</p><p>\u201cI thought I smelled another vampire.\u201d Jerry frowned and looked around the roof. \u201cGuess it was his scent on you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cTell me more. How is he going to keep this weight from disappearing after you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has that all figured out. But, Jerry!\u201d I grabbed his hand. \u201cDrinking from the runner was incredible. Not only did I lose weight, but I felt powerful. And high on something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEndorphins.\u201d Jerry picked up his glass from the table and drank. \u201cI\u2019ve read about it. It\u2019s the endorphins mortals generate when they exercise. This seems like something we could do on our own.\u201d He grinned and set the glass down again. \u201cYou and I could chase down night runners in the park in Austin. I\u2019d do it for the power and you\u2019d do it for the\u201d\u2014he snagged me around the waist and jerked me to him again\u2014\u201chealth benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to turn into a predator again. Like in the old days.\u201d I ran my hands up to his shoulders. \u201cAnd I\u2019d hate for you to lose weight. Seems that could happen too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d He leaned down and nibbled my earlobe, causing me to shiver. \u201cSo we scratch that bit of foreplay. I\u2019ll just keep you company if you need to chase down a donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeplay. Yes, all those endorphins were kind of a turn-on.\u201d I ran my fangs up his throat. Maybe if I gave Jerry a treat, he\u2019d take the news about who I was dealing with better. But that was a pretty cowardly approach. And just putting off the inevitable. I had to have plenty of time to calm him down and make sure he wasn\u2019t going to interfere with this before the sun rose. The treat could come after the news. As a parting gift.</p><p>I sighed and pushed back again. \u201cThere\u2019s something else you need to know about this weight-loss thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jerry took my hand and pulled me to the edge of the terrace. \u201cLook at the city lights, Gloriana. I brought you up here because I did think this was a romantic setting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I glanced at him. \u201cWorried I\u2019m with Ray too much?\u201d I slipped my arm around his waist. He was so solid, so much more mine than Ray could ever be. How could I forget that?</p><p>\u201cYou are with him too much. This phony engagement guarantees it.\u201d He looked out at the city.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to set up romantic evenings to keep me, Jerry. Ray talks a good game, but you and I have history.\u201d I leaned against him. \u201cI love you. Ray knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better. Because as soon as you\u2019re done playing his fianc\u00e9e, you\u2019d damn well better accept this, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry pulled a small box out of his pocket. A special blue one that I recognized instantly. Tiffany. Oh, God.</p><p>He popped it open and I gasped. I\u2019m a pretty good judge of diamonds, being in the antique business and all. He\u2019d managed to top Ray\u2019s offering by a good two carats. And, trust me, Ray\u2019s had been a very sizable ring. He\u2019d insisted I needed one to fool the paparazzi. I\u2019d always intended to give it back to him when we called off our charade.</p><p>\u201cJerry! It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself. You knew I was going to have to try it on. Before I could touch it, though, Jerry pulled the ring out of the box and slipped that sparkler on my third finger, left hand. It fit perfectly.</p><p>\u201cI know how you feel about marriage, Gloriana. But I\u2019m tired of these games. When we leave Los Angeles, you will be my woman or we\u2019re done.\u201d Jerry sounded serious, but his eyes were warm, his hands firm as he gripped mine.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an ultimatum.\u201d I didn\u2019t pull back, though. It wasn\u2019t the ring that kept me close. It was the fact that Jerry knew everything about me, I mean everything, and yet he still wanted to claim me. He didn\u2019t care that his mother thought I wasn\u2019t good enough for the heir to Castle Campbell. He didn\u2019t care that my vampire skills were inadequate to say the least. He sure didn\u2019t care that my butt was too big or that I spent way too much time on my hair and makeup and not nearly enough on balancing my checkbook.</p><p>Jerry loved me, warts and all. And forgave me time and again when I did stupid things or said stupid things. And there had been plenty of those in four hundred plus years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not forcing you to do something you don\u2019t want.\u201d Jerry put my hands on his shoulders and pulled me close. \u201cI know you, Glory. You like your independence, but you also need someone you can count on. Me. You\u2019ve always had me, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I flushed, trying desperately to ignore the way the moonlight flashed off the diamond in that gorgeous ring. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve always known you were there for me if I needed you. Your choice, Jerry. Maybe you should cut me loose and see how I do. Sink-or-swim time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d still have Caine, wouldn\u2019t you, Gloriana? That bastard would be happy to take my place.\u201d Jerry jerked me closer. \u201cNot going to happen. The time has passed to give you up. I can\u2019t do it, damn it. I\u2019ve tried. How many times? Dozens, even more. But I couldn\u2019t. So I\u2019d send you a bodyguard in the form of a dog. A Valdez. To make sure you were kept safe. Because the thought of a world without you was something I couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes seared me and seemed to see into my soul. And I could see into his. He was telling the truth, his truth. And I couldn\u2019t imagine how on earth I\u2019d deserved such devotion. It stole my breath and stopped my heart. I knew I wasn\u2019t worthy. That I was going to hurt him, had hurt him too many times.</p><p>\u201cJeremiah!\u201d Tears filled my eyes and I leaned my head against his chest. I could hear the slow pump of his heart. This was probably the longest speech I\u2019d ever gotten from him. And the most romantic. He was pulling out all the stops. Because he wanted a commitment from me. And I was about to ruin everything. I couldn\u2019t do it. No way was I telling him about MacDonald tonight. Valdez would just have to deal with the delay.</p><p>I felt Jerry\u2019s hand on my back, gently touching me. He was giving me time to think. Another unprecedented act. The man had obviously been talking to someone on how to proceed with our relationship. Flo? Richard? The former priest had managed to get my friend to the altar and she\u2019d sworn never to marry. Richard must have some tricks up his sleeve.</p> <p>Forget tricks. I had no doubt everything Jerry said came from his heart. My own was full. I was about to tell him how much this meant to me when there was a noise from the door into the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jerry jerked away from me and ran toward the sound. He pulled open the door. Valdez was there, snarling as he faced off with two paparazzi, armed with cameras.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? We heard Glory St. Clair was meeting another man here tonight. You the guy?\u201d</p><p>I did the only thing I could do. I jumped off the roof. Good thing I was still feeling the effects of Trina\u2019s juice, because I managed to shift into bat form in midair. Nice. I swooped over the roof and landed in the shadows to watch Jerry handle the two men. He had them by the shirts and not too gently. In plain language he let them know he was waiting for someone and he didn\u2019t know who in the hell this St. Clair woman was, but she wasn\u2019t his woman.</p><p>Valdez made himself useful by tearing a hole in the seat of one of the men\u2019s pants. That seemed to cool off the Glory hunt even though they were sure that was Glory\u2019s dog trying to eat them alive. Both the guys, after a quick look to make sure there was no woman in sight, decided to head out. Jerry\u2019s shoe up their backsides sped them along.</p> <p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Jerry turned around and spotted me as I left the shadows to soar above his head. \u201cWell, would you look at you? Shifting like an old pro. That runner\u2019s donation must have really pumped you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did, boss. She tell you\u2014\u201d Valdez yelped when I landed on his head and dug in my claws. \u201cOkay, I get the message. I\u2019m outta here again. Back to my guard post. You know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>I released him and settled on the concrete next to the table, concentrated for a moment and was my old Glory self again. Jerry was right. Trina\u2019s donation had given me new confidence and the shifting had been easier than I could have imagined. The magic was wearing off, though, and I could feel the coming dawn in my bones. I wondered if I had time to run down and weigh again. Silly, but I was terrified that I felt the weight creeping back on.</p><p>I ran a hand through my hair, then surreptitiously stuck a finger in the waistband of my jeans. Yay! They still felt just the teeniest bit loose. But Jerry stood beside me again. I still wore his ring, but couldn\u2019t take it with me back to Ray\u2019s suite. The \u201cengagement with Ray\u201d charade had to go on until after the Grammy awards show. That was the deal I\u2019d made with Ray. And it would give me some time to think. As Jerry had said, I\u2019d avoided the commitment to him for all these years. And now I was lying to him by omission.</p><p>Well, I would tell him about MacDonald. But not now. Not when my heart was full and I wanted to hold him close and tell him how much his words earlier had meant to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, big guy. You really took care of those photographers.\u201d I looked up at him.</p> <p>\u201cI hate those creeps. They hound you. Then they use pictures that I swear they\u2019ve altered on a computer. And the things they say . . .\u201d Jerry pulled me into his arms. \u201cI should have killed both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I would have stopped you. According to the tabloids I\u2019m fat, a nobody and not good enough for Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying bastards.\u201d He pushed his hand into my hair and held my head until my lips were mere inches from his own. \u201cBut the worst for me is when they say you are carrying his child.\u201d He growled, his fangs glinting in the moonlight. \u201cI would have given anything to have a child from you, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Jerry.\u201d Stupid tears again. I never had a child, and after I was turned, never could have one. Jerry\u2019s only child had been sired by a true bitch. He loves his daughter, but he couldn\u2019t have said anything that would have meant more to me. I closed the distance between our mouths and kissed him, tasting him and letting his fangs scrape across my tongue. It didn\u2019t hurt, just added a sweet taste of what was to come.</p><p>Our mating was slow at first as Jerry pulled me down to a stack of cushions he\u2019d obviously pulled from inside the restaurant. I sighed as he settled beside me and lifted my sweater, then pulled it up and off of me. The night air was cool but not cold and the stars were bright in the sky above us. I reached for his sweater and slid it off of him, eager to see that chest I loved so much. He was perfect in his imperfections. Maybe that was what he thought about me. At least that was what I hoped as he opened the clasp of my bra and tossed it aside, then went to work on my jeans.</p><p>We tasted and touched each other until we were naked and he was inside me. Then he stopped and gazed into my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said, Gloriana. The time for these games is over. You must decide, lass, once and for all.\u201d</p><p>I reached up with a shaking hand to trace the contours of his face. Yes, our bodies were connected, but no more than our souls were. I could deny it a thousand times. And try to bury my feelings with a thousand other men. Yet I always came back to this one.</p> <p>\u201cLove me, Jeremiah. Take me and let me take you. I promise, I will\u2014\u201d I pulled his mouth to mine, suddenly terrified of saying the words that would bind me to him. Why? Mortals did it all the time. And thought nothing of casting off their bonds in divorce court. Immortals took their matings more seriously. I knew that. If Jerry and I made this commitment, I had a feeling he really would expect it to be the forever thing. I ran my hands down his back and opened my body to him, feeling the hard length of him surging inside me. I guess there was something wrong with me that forever scared me so much. That if I gave myself to Jerry in that way, I\u2019d lose part of myself.</p><p>He lifted his head and frowned before he rolled so that I was on top of him. \u201cI can feel your fears. Come, now, am I such an ogre that I would keep you from what you love? Steal your freedom?\u201d He lifted me off of him until we lay side by side with the stars above us. \u201cI guess Florence is right. We should talk more. I don\u2019t tell you enough of what I\u2019m thinking. And you don\u2019t tell me why you run from me every dozen years or so.\u201d</p><p>I turned on my side and put my hand on his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth, Jerry. I never expected you to be a chatterbox. But I know how you are. Possessive and deeply loyal. That scares me. What if my character isn\u2019t made of such, oh, such fine qualities? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, lass.\u201d Jerry pulled me on top of him again. \u201cYou\u2019ve never disappointed me. And you make me sound hard and unyielding. I hope . . .\u201d He closed his eyes and frowned. \u201cNo, I must be honest. I am possessive. What\u2019s mine, I hold. Always have. It\u2019s what the Campbells do. I learned it at my father\u2019s knee. And fought in many a battle to prove no one can take what belongs to the Clan without regretting it.\u201d He ran his hand down my back to the curve of my backside.</p><p>\u201cBattles. Yes, you still bear the scars, from those you fought before you were turned.\u201d I kissed a particularly jagged one on his left shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat one a cowardly MacDonald gave me. It was an ambush. They\u2019d stolen cattle from us.\u201d Jerry smiled. \u201cThey came to regret it.\u201d</p><p>I quickly blocked my thoughts. \u201cSurely all those old feuds are ancient history now. Times have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things never do. My father called me just last week. The MacDonald has been trying to claim some land of ours. Using an ancient tax roll. Thieving bastard\u2019s still at it. Too bad they were made vampire centuries ago. I\u2019d like to see that clan die out.\u201d Jerry shook his head. \u201cBut I\u2019ll not let you shift the topic, lass. We were talking of our relationship.\u201d He grinned. \u201cGod help me, I can\u2019t believe I said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I.\u201d I laughed and rubbed against him. Lying naked on top of him, I had no doubt that he could be easily distracted. \u201cCan we save that for another night? I love you, Jeremiah. I love what you said to me tonight. That you care so deeply. Let me celebrate that. This moment. We\u2019ll look to the future later. I promise.\u201d I reached between us and touched him where he pressed hard against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d But his growl of hunger and his hand stroking my breast proved that my distraction had worked.</p><p>I moved down his body, kissing and tasting until he jerked me up to push into me again. So deep, he touched me just where I needed to feel him. The rhythm was right, the pace perfect. I couldn\u2019t give Trina\u2019s blood credit for my soaring orgasm. That was all Jerry\u2019s doing as he stroked me and brought me to fulfillment, just as I pushed him there. Time and time again I rose to meet him, finding the pinnacle of pleasure almost unbearable until I cried out to the night that I loved him.</p><p>He murmured the Gaelic words I\u2019d learned meant the same, the words from his heart in the language of his birth. He swore he\u2019d never said them to another woman the way he\u2019d said them to me. And in that moment, lying sated under the stars, held close in his strong arms, I believed him. And believed I could never be so content with another man.</p><p>If only we could have stayed there, with Valdez keeping the world out.

He tossed it on the closet floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I just didn\u2019t want to get into it tonight. Jerry had arranged a romantic evening on the roof. I wasn\u2019t about to spoil it.\u201d I finished the note. \u201cWhere should I put this so I\u2019ll be sure Nate sees it tomorrow? I want a scale brought up to the suite and put in a private place so I can weigh myself every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I wouldn\u2019t trust MacDonald\u2019s scale either.\u201d Ray headed for the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower. Put it on top of the TV remote. Nate starts every day with CNN and the stock market report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I did weigh on the scale in the hotel gym when I got back and it agreed with Ian\u2019s scale. Two and a half pounds in one night, Ray!\u201d I laughed. \u201cBut then I got paranoid and wondered if maybe Ian and the desk clerk could have worked together.\u201d I felt a flush heat my cheeks. \u201cStupid, but there you go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I see what you mean.\u201d Ray patted me on the shoulder. \u201cYou have a right to be suspicious. If Blade and MacDonald are old enemies, anything goes. You could be a pawn in a bigger game than you know, Glory. I say we\u2019re smart to be paranoid. That why you sent Brittany after me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should always have a paranormal bodyguard with you, Ray. I\u2019ve told you that before.\u201d I got up and kicked off my high heels. My feet were killing me. \u201cAnother vamp gets a whiff of you in L.A. and a turf war could start. We have no idea who\u2019s in charge here. I know the Austin scene pretty well, but we should probably ask Damian if there\u2019s someone we should be checking in with. Vamps are territorial. And they don\u2019t like newcomers making waves. We need to assure the powers that be that we\u2019re well behaved and find out the secret handshake around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Sounds like organized crime or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d I limped toward the door to the living room. \u201cTrust me, Ian\u2019s got permission to run his operation in Malibu from someone higher up. And if he goes after Blade, he\u2019d better be careful or he\u2019ll have the big, bad vamps in L.A. after him in a big, bad way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Ray watched me from the doorway. With his low-riding jeans, and barefoot, he was too sexy to ignore, but I made the effort. Valdez and Brittany were out on the balcony having a quiet conversation so we were alone for a change. \u201cYou looked really excited after drinking from Trina, Glory. Flushed, totally turned on. Must have been some experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. I\u2019ve never had a feeding like that. So I really wasn\u2019t surprised when it actually worked like Ian said it would.\u201d I looked down at the note. \u201cThis is silly. A waste of money. The hotel scales should be okay.\u201d</p> <p>Ray walked over and put the note on top of the remote. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a good idea. We\u2019ll get the scale. For your peace of mind and to be sure we\u2019re getting our money\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that. I\u2019m paying. No discussion. I want to see the bill.\u201d I followed Ray into the bedroom.</p><p>Ray turned and smiled. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, Glory girl. It\u2019s outrageous. I can afford it and you can\u2019t. You\u2019ve saved my life more than once. Call it payback and that\u2019s that.\u201d He stepped closer and put his finger on my chin. \u201cGet that mulish look off your pretty face. I\u2019m not arguing. Dawn\u2019s coming. Put on a sexy nightgown and drink Ian\u2019s potion so we can go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Ray slipped past me, his chest brushing my arm. I did want to argue. But if the treatment was as expensive as he said, I probably couldn\u2019t afford it. I put my hand on his bare back.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ray. This means a lot. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever repay you.\u201d</p><p>He turned and smiled. \u201cJust be happy. If this deal with Ian works out, then maybe his daylight drug will too. That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping. Now, where\u2019s your tonic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bag on the nightstand.\u201d I ignored Ray\u2019s daylight comment. I wasn\u2019t about to encourage that fantasy. I picked up the bag and pulled out the two bottles. One said drink before sleeping. The entire contents? Apparently. I twisted off the top and sniffed, then wrinkled my nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it smell like? Not blood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, some kind of herbs. Or fruit. I don\u2019t know. Take a whiff.\u201d I held the bottle out to Ray.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Papaya with a hint of cinnamon maybe. Weird. I didn\u2019t think vamps like us could drink anything but blood.\u201d Ray took a sip. \u201cTasty. Too bad it\u2019s for weight loss. I could get into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand it over.\u201d I grabbed the bottle and took a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d I waited to see if it agreed with me. Seriously, made vamps can\u2019t eat or drink anything except real or synthetic blood as far as I know. If we do hit food . . . ouch! I know, I\u2019ve had a painful run-in with a bag of Cheetos. Delicious snacks, but not a great after-party, if you know what I mean.</p><p>So far my stomach didn\u2019t seem to mind the new concoction. So I kept sipping until I\u2019d finished off the bottle. Okay, I was feeling fine. Maybe even better than fine. It was like I\u2019d had another jolt from Trina\u2019s wrist. I waved Ray off to the shower and grabbed a nightgown from a drawer. Not sexy, no way. It was a pretty floral but my usual floor-length style and didn\u2019t allow Ray even a glimpse of my body. I settled on my side of the bed and closed my eyes. I felt the bed sag when Ray climbed in on his side.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just waiting for dawn. Stomach\u2019s fine, though I\u2019m pretty revved up. Like after I drank from Trina. Ian\u2019s a genius, Ray, if this works. In my experience nothing outlives the healing sleep except for an alcoholic binge.\u201d I rolled over and stared at him. As usual, he\u2019d come to bed in nothing but silk boxers. Tonight\u2019s were baby blue, like his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d Ray winced and closed his eyes. \u201cMy one and only backslide with booze after turning vampire cured me of that addiction.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d sure like to be able to enjoy a glass of my favorite Jack with the boys in the band now and then. I wonder if Ian\u2019s got a wonder drug for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask him.\u201d I put my hand on his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot safer dream than going out in the sun. Forget that one, Ray. It\u2019s suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Ray\u2019s sapphire eyes swept over me, and I fiddled with the sheet. Nobody could do intense like Ray could. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think you could lose weight, but it\u2019s happening, Glory. Ian may just be proving to both of us that anything\u2019s possible.\u201d He leaned over and kissed me until I gently shoved him away.</p><p>\u201cNot anything, Ray.\u201d I smiled and let him interpret that any way he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cYou guys set for the night?\u201d Valdez was frowning from the doorway. \u201cBrittany\u2019s going to keep me company for a while in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Try not to wake Nathan, though, V.\u201d I yawned and put my hand on Ray\u2019s chest. \u201c\u2019Night, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch where you put that hand, Glory girl,\u201d Ray growled.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d I slid back to my own side, not sure what I\u2019d done. I was a little loopy, to tell the truth. I felt dawn kick me in the teeth and I was out.</p><p>Monsters chased me through dark streets until I was cornered. Their giant teeth tore at my clothes, ripping them away from my body. No, not monsters. Men, with deliciously long fangs that teased every inch of my naked flesh. I writhed beneath them, begging them to take me. But they just played with me, spreading my legs, yet never entering me. There were three\u2014no, four\u2014of them. Blade came out of the darkness and hurled himself at the men, slashing at them with his broadsword. But he couldn\u2019t fight them all and he disappeared in a shower of red.</p><p>\u201cNo! Come back for me. Don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory! Wake up, Glory. What the hell?\u201d</p><p>I felt hands on my back and struggled, fighting to keep from being taken. \u201cI won\u2019t. You can\u2019t make me!\u201d I pushed and was free. Eyes wide, I sat up and looked around for which way to run.</p><p>I was in bed, in the hotel. And Ray was across the room, rubbing the back of his head because I must have thrown him there, where he\u2019d landed against a dresser. Valdez was showing all his teeth and looked like he was about to tear into Ray.</p><p>\u201cNo, stop! I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I looked down and realized I was naked. I pulled up the sheet. \u201cValdez, don\u2019t hurt Ray. He didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you explain what I just heard?\u201d Valdez planted himself firmly between Ray and me, his teeth still showing and scary as hell. \u201cYou were screaming for help, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I was having a nightmare.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYes, I guess that was it. For the first time since I was turned vampire, I was having a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Glory. You scared the hell out of me.\u201d Ray stood, staying out of Valdez\u2019s reach. \u201cValdez, you heard her. She\u2019s okay. I was trying to wake her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s she naked, I\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it. When I woke up, she was like that. Screaming and crawling all over the bed. I guess she tore her gown off during the dream.\u201d Ray didn\u2019t smile. \u201cI don\u2019t dream. I didn\u2019t think vamps ever dreamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t. Never. Didn\u2019t you hear me? This is the first dream, bad or good, I\u2019ve had in four hundred years!\u201d I was shaking. I wanted to throw up, and vamps rarely do that either. We don\u2019t exactly fill our stomachs, you know. I pulled up the sheet and wiped my face. I\u2019d been crying in my sleep and sweating too. The sheet was damp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt must have been Ian\u2019s brew. The herbs must\u2019ve caused it.\u201d Ray walked into the bathroom and came out with a wet washcloth and a towel. \u201cWash your face. You look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks. I feel like hell too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drank MacDonald\u2019s shit last night and it did this to you?\u201d Valdez paced around the bed. \u201cThat settles it. You\u2019re not going back out there tonight. It\u2019s not worth it. We\u2019re telling Blade about this and we\u2019ll let him take care of MacDonald.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, bud, but you don\u2019t issue the orders around here.\u201d I tried to smile to take the sting out of that, but couldn\u2019t manage it. \u201cI mean, I am going back out there. I am going to do this weight-loss thing. Now that I know what effect that particular potion has, I\u2019ll ask Ian if I can try another one.\u201d I saw the second bottle on the nightstand. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to drink this one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. Let\u2019s smell it and see if it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d Ray opened it and sniffed. \u201cNo, smells completely different. This one is more like lemonade.\u201d He took a sip. \u201cTart but tasty. The man does know how to flavor his stuff. Are you sure you want this? That last brew really did a number on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Valdez stared at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to, V. Ian said following the program is essential and I want to lose the weight.\u201d I held out my hand. \u201cBesides, Ray paid a fortune for this deal. The least I can do is give it a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold it. Forget the money.\u201d Ray gave me a searching look. \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Maybe this isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Valdez nodded. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s settled. Thanks, Caine, for backing me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it. I don\u2019t care if the whole band and Nathan back you up, V. Now, give me the bottle, Ray.\u201d I held out my hand. Ray shrugged but passed it over. I ignored Valdez\u2019s muttered cursing and took a swallow, then made a face. \u201cNot as good as the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Valdez watched me closely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d And I was. \u201cRelax, V, Ray. So I had some bad dreams. That\u2019s not life threatening. I can deal with that kind of side effect. And maybe Ian can give me something else that won\u2019t affect me that way. I\u2019ll ask him when we go out there later.\u201d I looked down at myself covered only in a white sheet. \u201cNow, would you guys leave and let me get dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. I want to watch, Glory, while you finish the drink and then see if you\u2019re okay.\u201d Valdez jumped up on the foot of the bed. \u201cCaine, get dressed. You\u2019ve got two reporters in the living room waiting to interview you for Rolling Stone. Nate set it up. He\u2019s out there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I forgot all about that.\u201d Ray pulled a pair of jeans out of the closet. \u201cYou sure you feel okay, babe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I put my hand over my stomach. Okay, so there\u2019d been a gurgle, but nothing major. \u201cGo, knock their socks off. Downplay our engagement since it\u2019s temporary. Stick to your music if you can. Plug your new album. You know they\u2019re going to love it. Nate was going to have a piano brought up. Play a couple of the new tunes for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Ray pulled on a vintage Jim Morrison T-shirt I\u2019d bought him for Hannakuh and stopped to kiss my cheek, ignoring Valdez\u2019s growl. \u201cThanks, Glory. Take care of yourself. V, maybe you should take Brittany with you when you go to MacDonald\u2019s later. I can do all right without a paranormal guard tonight since I\u2019ll be staying in the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d Valdez swung back to look at me closely. \u201cYou\u2019re making a face. Stomach pains? I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a twinge. Nothing like the time with the Cheetos. Calm down. I\u2019m going to be fine. Go face the door when Ray leaves so I can grab some clothes and get a shower.\u201d I smiled at Ray. \u201cThanks, Ray. Maybe we will take Brittany. I want Ian to know we\u2019re not pushovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You need me, call my cell. Nothing is more important to me than you are, Glory.\u201d Ray stepped into the living room and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cHe does seem to care about you. I give him credit for that.\u201d Valdez ambled to the door and faced it.</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. Nice of you to admit it.\u201d I wrapped the sheet around me and grabbed some clothes before streaking to the bathroom. My stomach was in an uproar and I was afraid I was going to throw up. I heard the piano from the next room before I turned on the shower. Good. The more noise the better. Because I was about to toss my cookies or, more accurately, Ian\u2019s potion, and I didn\u2019t want Valdez to know and worry about it.</p><p>I leaned over the toilet and heaved. Oh, God. I hoped this didn\u2019t mean I was going to stop losing weight. I sank down on the bathroom floor and waited for the nausea to pass.</p> <p>\u201cI heard that, Glory. You going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I leaned against the tiled wall and took shallow breaths. Steam was filling the bathroom and I closed my eyes when I thought I was going to pass out. Sure I was going to be okay. If I didn\u2019t die first. I eyed the wooden handle of Ray\u2019s hairbrush. Maybe I\u2019d just fall on the pointy end and put myself out of this misery.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the scale?\u201d I practically attacked Nathan when I finally decided I\u2019d live after all. The reporters had left and Ray had headed down to a conference room in the hotel to another interview. He\u2019d taken his mortal bodyguards with him.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I compared it to the ones in the gym. They weigh the same.\u201d He gestured toward the powder room next to the suite entry. \u201cIt\u2019s in there. You said you didn\u2019t want an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019re brilliant.\u201d I grabbed Nate and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cBut then, Harvard doesn\u2019t take dummies, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without a rich daddy. Lucky for me, Pop\u2019s loaded.\u201d Nate grinned. \u201cNow you going to tell me what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I ran into the powder room, slammed and locked the door. I was barefoot and had on the same outfit that I\u2019d had on the night before, except for the color of the T-shirt\u2014purely for weighing purposes, of course. I stepped on the scale. Hallelujah! Still down two and a half pounds. So the elixirs did work to counteract the healing sleep. Ian was a genius.</p><p>Well, sort of a genius. Surely he could make something that didn\u2019t make me so sick. I was still queasy, but determined to head back to Ian\u2019s in time to get there at midnight. I opened the bathroom door, almost tripping over Valdez.</p><p>\u201cYour cell phone rang a moment ago.\u201d Nathan handed me my phone. \u201cI answered it. The man left a message. A limo will pick you up in front of the hotel at eleven. What\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back out to Malibu. Same place Ray and I went last night.\u201d I looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Brittany? Ray said we could take her with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be back in a minute. She wanted to shower and change.\u201d Nathan looked at Valdez. \u201cI hope both shifters got some sleep last night. It\u2019s not a good idea for them to be on duty together. How can they be alert if they\u2019re on twenty-four seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014we slept. I told her to go to her room.\u201d Valdez grinned. \u201cBut we got to talking and she fell asleep on the couch. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be in top form. Glory will be safe enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you guarantee that?\u201d Nathan frowned. \u201cOh, what the hell do I know? I\u2019m a mere mortal in this paranormal zoo. You guys blow my mind. And Ray won\u2019t tell me anything. Flies off the balcony like it\u2019s no big deal and never tells me where he\u2019s going or who he\u2019s going to see. I\u2019ll bet Los Angeles is full of vampires who\u2019d like a piece of Israel Caine. You guys better be careful.\u201d He slumped on the couch. \u201cNow the stock market\u2019s so insane I\u2019ve lost my faith in the mortal world too.\u201d</p><p>I sat next to him. \u201cRelax, Nate. We\u2019re careful. I\u2019ll send Brittany down to be with Ray.\u201d My stomach gurgled and I put a hand over it. \u201cV and I can handle Malibu on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be on our own.\u201d Valdez trotted over to the door. \u201cReinforcements are arriving right now. Answer the door, Glory.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, there was a knock. I looked through the peephole and saw Flo and Richard there. I flung open the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsrael called us. Said you were fraternizing with a potentially badass vampire and might need some backup. Of course I knew who he was talking about. You went to see MacDonald, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Flo had dressed in black leather for the occasion. I recognized the look as her \u201cI\u2019m going to kick some vampire butt\u201d outfit. Tight leather pants and a form-fitting vest over a red satin blouse made her look taller than her five feet one. The colors set off her black hair and dark, flashing eyes perfectly. The pants were tucked into thigh-high boots with silver chain embellishments on the sides. The stiletto heels would make good weapons in an emergency. Which I hoped we didn\u2019t have.</p><p>Richard followed her inside. He was much more conservative in black jeans and a black cashmere pullover. But then, he fairly radiated lethal male power anyway. His pale eyes looked scary if you didn\u2019t know he adored his wife and would die for his friends. I was deeply grateful he counted me as one of them.</p><p>\u201cWow. This is a surprise. Ray didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d I hugged each of them in turn. \u201cThanks for coming. Sure I went to see him. I signed up for his weight-loss program.\u201d</p><p>Flo frowned. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not sorry. I thought Ian MacDonald gave off a strange vibe when we met him. Handsome, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I know what you mean. But I\u2019m still determined to go out there again even if he does scare me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some of the stuff he gave her made her sick. She had bad dreams too.\u201d Valdez bumped Flo and got an ear rub. He loves my ex-roomie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that.\u201d Richard looked grim. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about dreams?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never dream.\u201d Flo gave Valdez a final pat, then moved to my side. \u201cWhat were they like? Sexy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParts were, but mostly violent, terrifying. And, yes, I did get sick. Ian had two potions. One to drink before I slept and one for when I woke tonight.\u201d I grabbed Flo\u2019s hand. \u201cBut, Flo, I lost two and a half pounds after one session! And they stayed off after a day of healing sleep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are kidding me!\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes widened. She looked me up and down and turned me around. \u201cI can see the difference. That is so worth it, Glory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know! So you can see why I have to go out there again tonight. No matter what.\u201d I heard Valdez and Richard growl.</p><p>Nathan put some distance between himself and the other two men. \u201cI think that\u2019s my cue to get the hell out of here. I\u2019ll go down to Brittany\u2019s room and tell her to stick with Ray tonight. And I\u2019ll do the same. He\u2019s got some important interviews lined up. Publicity for his new album.\u201d He stopped next to the door. \u201cBut, Glory, you call him if you need even more reinforcements. I know he and Brittany would want to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Nate.\u201d I smiled gratefully. It was nice to have so many loyal friends.</p><p>Flo shook my arm. \u201cTell me more about this Ian\u2019s plan. What else did you do to lose so much weight so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drank from a mortal runner.\u201d I made a face. \u201cYou know how I am about taking advantage . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I\u2019m sure the mortal was honored to serve you.\u201d Florence figures anyone who isn\u2019t a vampire wishes he was one. A mortal is lucky to be a donor. Yeah, she\u2019s got something of a superiority complex, but I love her anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that\u2019s the way she saw it. Anyway, I\u2019m to be there at midnight to drink from her again, right after she\u2019s done another run. That\u2019s when the feeding is most effective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you wouldn\u2019t have to depend on MacDonald for that.\u201d Richard shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cSo why go out there again? Especially if he scares you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the effects of drinking won\u2019t last through a healing sleep. Not without the supplements Ian provides.\u201d I walked into the bedroom and brought out the two bottles. I still felt weak, which was weird. I mean, vamps are never weak. And just looking at the empties made my stomach roll again. \u201cHere. Smell what was in these.\u201d</p><p>Richard moved closer and sniffed each of them. \u201cNothing unusual, but vamps don\u2019t ingest foreign substances at all. I certainly wouldn\u2019t take either of them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Ian if there\u2019s a different supplement I can take.\u201d I pointed to the one I\u2019d just finished. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep that one down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it can\u2019t have helped you, cara.\u201d Flo patted my shoulder. \u201cDo we fly out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ian\u2019s sending a limo.\u201d I looked at my watch. \u201cWe should go down now. I\u2019d better put on Valdez\u2019s leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, can\u2019t wait.\u201d Valdez sat patiently while I clipped it on his collar.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re going to wear, Glory? You know the paparazzi will be out front waiting to take your picture. You have something cuter, no? This is too plain.\u201d Flo looked me over critically as she followed me into the bedroom where I was going to put on my shoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to wear clothes that weigh the same as the first night. For comparison.\u201d I looked in my closet. I did have some different jeans that would work. And a purple V-neck sweater that probably compared to a T-shirt. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll change, but not into leather. That stuff probably weighs a ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but is cute, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn you? You bet. When I\u2019m a size six, I\u2019ll get some pants like that. Only red. I love red leather.\u201d I headed into the bathroom to slip into the clothes and to add a bit more blush. Couldn\u2019t use the mirror, no reflection. But I felt pale. All that throwing up. And I wasn\u2019t sure I wasn\u2019t going to do it again. I took a few shallow breaths until the nausea passed, then came out to sit on the side of the bed to slip on my heels.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d Flo sat next to me. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing this weight to please Israel, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not. He\u2019s sweet about my size, even though the tabloids are positively gruesome to me. You know the headlines: \u2018Baby on Board? Caine Sings the Blues.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastardos! I hope they have wives with elephant butts.\u201d Flo put her arm around me and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing the weight for me, Flo. Because I\u2019ve always wanted to and couldn\u2019t. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve heard you talk about it. Like me and my height. I am so short, people don\u2019t take me seriously. I am a, how you say, shrimp.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut we are women who can take care of ourselves, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we can. And I\u2019m going to do this. Even if I have to suffer a little bit.\u201d I bit back a moan when my stomach cramped. \u201cThanks for coming with me. It means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Now, let\u2019s head out. I want to see this Malibu. Is the Pacific Ocean beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. Especially if you like the water.\u201d I walked behind her into the living room and grabbed my purse. \u201cIan\u2019s home is gorgeous. He has a fantastic view from every window. That\u2019s as close as I want to get to any ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Pacific is beautiful.\u201d Richard handed Flo her tiny purse. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve never seen it before, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. Guess I\u2019m just an East Coast, Mediterranean type of woman, eh, Ricardo?\u201d She kissed his cheek as he opened the door into the hall. \u201cDo we have a plan, gentlemen?\u201d She looked at Valdez, who trotted in front of me.</p><p>\u201cSure. We watch Ian like a hawk. One wrong move from the MacDonald and we take him apart. That\u2019s my plan.\u201d Valdez looked back at me when I grabbed his tail. \u201cOuch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool it, tough guy. I\u2019ll decide what a wrong move is. In your state of mind, Ian could scratch his chin and you\u2019d take it as an offensive move.\u201d</p><p>Valdez chuckled and looked at Richard. \u201cIt is. That\u2019s the old Prague maneuver. Am I right, Rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, seen it done a thousand times. Let it go and you\u2019re staring at the business end of a stake before you know it.\u201d</p><p>I punched the elevator call button. \u201cRight. Keep amusing yourselves. But this is my deal. Screw it up and I\u2019ll never forgive you. Either of you. Florence, keep your man in line.\u201d</p><p>Flo pressed herself against Richard. \u201cRicardo, stay calm, let Glory enjoy Ian\u2019s magic. When she is a size six, you can tear him apart. S\u00ec, Glory?\u201d She grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t put it like that.\u201d The elevator arrived and Ray\u2019s former bedmate happened to be inside. Well, if that wasn\u2019t a kick in my size-twelve pants. I smiled and nodded and sent Flo a mental message. It had her narrowing her eyes and sending her own message that had the mortal female sweating and getting off at the first opportunity.</p><p>\u201cPuttana!\u201d Flo hissed after her when we were alone in the elevator again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Richard had been humming under his breath, obviously not included in our mental messaging. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard this name MacDonald before but can\u2019t place it. I\u2019ll have to ask Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, don\u2019t do that. He\u2019s got a thing about the MacDonalds. Ever since they stole some of his cattle about five hundred years ago. Ancient history, and I want to enjoy this trip.\u201d I laughed while my stomach took a serious dive and I jabbed at the button for the lobby. \u201cTrust me. Ian\u2019s not interested in cattle. So don\u2019t kill him, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises. That scratching-the-chin thing is no joke. Especially if he\u2019s got his own security crew.\u201d Richard looked down at Valdez. \u201cWe need a signal. I say it\u2019s a foot jiggle. Left foot. Left front for you, V. That clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Then we strike.\u201d Valdez looked up at me. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get in our way if we do, Glory. It will be life or death or we wouldn\u2019t start the war.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed as the elevator doors opened on the lobby. My stomach was rolling again and I had the feeling that everything was spiraling out of control. A camera flashed as we neared the waiting stretch limo and I heard a shouted question.</p><p>\u201cHey, Glory, when\u2019s the baby due?\u201d</p><p>I kept my head down, but Valdez growled and apparently Flo shot the finger at the guy because there were more flashes and I could hear her shouting what sounded like dire threats in Italian. I grabbed Richard\u2019s arm so he wouldn\u2019t start something right there in front of the hotel. Yep, things were clearly going to hell in a handbasket. But I was going to lose this weight or die trying.</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cYou brought your friends with you, Glory.\u201d Ian smiled and bowed over Flo\u2019s hand. \u201cBut not Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s really tied up with the Grammy promotional stuff, Ian.\u201d I smiled and swallowed the urge to heave all over Ian\u2019s leather loafers. \u201cAnd would you believe Florence has never seen the Pacific Ocean? I knew you wouldn\u2019t mind if they rode out here with us. You remember Richard Mainwaring, Florence\u2019s husband. You met at the club.\u201d</p><p>The men nodded, obviously taking each other\u2019s measure again away from the excitement and noise of the vampire club. I shivered from the chill in the air. Or was it because I felt clammy and about to faint? I grabbed hold of Valdez\u2019s fur to steady myself.</p><p>\u201cGlory? What the hell?\u201d Valdez bumped me over to the leather couch and I fell onto it. \u201cMacDonald, do something. I think she\u2019s about to pass out.\u201d</p><p>I heard them all talking. Flo babbling in excited Italian, Richard\u2019s calm voice in the same language and Ian\u2019s cool hands on my face as he lifted my lids and looked into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGlory, how do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike shit.\u201d I tried to sit up, but couldn\u2019t manage it. \u201cThat stuff you gave me to drink when I woke up\u201d\u2014I shuddered\u2014\u201cmade me sick.\u201d I closed my eyes but the world kept spinning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrina! Get in here!\u201d Ian or somebody arranged me so I was lying back on the cool leather. Then I smelled Trina\u2019s warm wrist at my lips. My fangs came into play and that was all she wrote. I drank thirstily, as if I hadn\u2019t had a feeding in weeks. Finally, someone pulled her off me, or I\u2019m pretty sure I would have drained her dry.</p><p>\u201cGee, that was intense.\u201d Trina sounded gleeful. \u201cMaster, did you see how I endured? I must have pleased you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now leave us. I\u2019ll reward you later.\u201d Ian actually sounded concerned, but not about Trina. She was merely a donor. He sat beside me again, rubbing my hands. \u201cGlory, how do you feel now? Open your eyes.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to. Not yet. I was savoring the rush again. Trina must have just completed a run and her adrenaline pulsed through me. I wanted to fly around the room or maybe jump somebody\u2019s bones. I inhaled Ian\u2019s scent and thought about what a good-looking man he was. And a friggin\u2019 genius. Hmm. If I didn\u2019t have an audience, I could open my legs and . . . Was I nuts? I finally sat up, pushing my hair out of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGlory! How do you feel?\u201d Flo shoved Ian off the couch and sat beside me. \u201cMio Dio, you scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel great, Flo, seriously. Did you see her? Trina? She\u2019s the runner I told you about. I am so pumped.\u201d I grinned and slipped past Flo so I could jump up and stretch. Richard and Valdez watched me, waiting for me to collapse again.</p><p>\u201cHey, relax, guys. I\u2019m fine. Just like last night, the feeding was fantastic.\u201d I turned to Ian. \u201cBut, sorry, those supplements have got to go. I can\u2019t handle them. Especially the one I drink when I wake up. Couldn\u2019t keep it down. It made me puke my guts up.\u201d</p><p>Ian frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d He picked up a bottle from the coffee table. \u201cWhat about the first one you drank? Before you slept?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGave me hideous nightmares.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWell, some of them were hideous. Parts were sexy.\u201d I winked at Flo. \u201cTo dream at all was so completely bizarre, but cool now that I think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Vampires don\u2019t dream. Not during the death sleep.\u201d Ian kept frowning. \u201cGlory, you\u2019re having a very unusual reaction to my supplements. This simply doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Richard stepped in. \u201cOh, come on, MacDonald. I don\u2019t believe that for a minute. Did you hear what she said? Gloriana\u2019s reaction sounds like she was poisoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019ve treated dozens of vampires with these formulas. None of them have complained of these symptoms.\u201d Ian shook his head. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t experiment on Glory, not after Mr. Caine paid for the deluxe package. She\u2019s taking what all my top-drawer clients take when they want to lose weight. My reputation depends on getting excellent results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you get some of those other special clients out here and let us interview them? I want to talk to vampires who have been through this. Check out your reputation.\u201d Richard glanced at me. \u201cDid you bother to do that, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. But Ray and I saw a video. A success story.\u201d I gestured at the TV screen. \u201cYou should see the results Ian gets. And I didn\u2019t want to wait. I want to look good for the red carpet.\u201d I ignored Valdez\u2019s muttering. Nice to know he liked me the way I was, but I\u2019d started this and I wanted to finish it.</p> <p>\u201cYou know how vampires are. It\u2019s not like we publish a directory, Mainwaring. We fly under the radar. Change location, name, habits, constantly. As far as I know, and I told Glory this, none of the vampires have stayed close enough for her to meet them. But I could give you a few phone numbers that might still be good.\u201d Ian smiled, obviously convinced Richard would drop this if he was charming enough. I knew better.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that prove?\u201d Flo stayed close to my side. \u201cAnyone can get on a phone and pretend to be a satisfied client. Am I right, amante?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Florence.\u201d Richard looked approvingly at his wife. \u201cGive me a copy of some of these videos. And I want names and addresses of your \u2018successes.\u2019 I\u2019ll check them out personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Give me a few days\u2014\u201d Ian was suddenly jerked up by his custom-made Egyptian cotton shirt.</p><p>\u201cNow, MacDonald. Or we take Gloriana out of here and report you to the vampire council of Los Angeles. You\u2019re obviously running a scam here. Unless you can prove us wrong.\u201d Richard released Ian but it was clear the war had started.</p><p>\u201cRichard, Ian. I\u2019m okay now. Seriously. I just want to know what I can use besides this particular wake-up drink. I can deal with the nightmares if I have to.\u201d I pushed between the two men. Valdez practically knocked me over, staying glued to my left hip.</p><p>\u201cRichard, I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do, but this is important to me. Back off.\u201d I sent Flo a mental message and she grabbed her husband\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cRicardo, you can\u2019t \u2018take\u2019 Glory anywhere.\u201d Flo looked me over. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like this sickness either, girlfriend. You\u2019re pale, not flushed like you should be after feeding. At least let Ricardo investigate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, knock yourself out. But I\u2019m going ahead with this.\u201d I sat on the couch again, still a little woozy, though I wasn\u2019t about to admit it. \u201cWhat else have you got, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you feel all right now, Glory?\u201d Ian decided to ignore Richard for the moment and studied me.</p><p>\u201cYes, fine. Stomach\u2019s completely settled.\u201d I jumped up again and plastered on a smile. So what if the room tilted?</p><p>\u201cThen come weigh in.\u201d He gestured toward his office. \u201cI\u2019ve got something else you can try. And I\u2019ll get copies of those records you want, Mainwaring.\u201d</p><p>When the whole gang acted like they were going to follow me into the office, I balked. \u201cHold it. It\u2019s a weigh-in. I don\u2019t need an escort.\u201d I put my hand on Flo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFlo, you get it, don\u2019t you? No one sees my weight.\u201d I felt a bump against my leg. Clearly I wasn\u2019t going in alone, not without World War III, and I didn\u2019t have the energy for that right now. \u201cI\u2019ll let Valdez come, but even he looks away when I get on the scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in the room, mia amica. I\u2019ll look away too.\u201d She stared hard at Ian. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going in there without me, not when you still feel funny from what this man gave you. Ricardo can wait out here.\u201d She glanced out at the deck, where there were more surfer bodyguards than before, this time half a dozen. \u201cHumor us, Glory. You scared us when you got so sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, come on.\u201d So we trailed Ian into the office.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the Pacific, Flo.\u201d Flo and I spent a few moments admiring the view from the windows while Ian rifled through files, pulled out a DVD and made copies of some papers.</p><p>His smile was strained as he picked up his clipboard and walked to the scale. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be pleased, Glory. You\u2019ve been with Trina twice now and you did take the supplements. We should see some good results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. I threw up most of the second one. I don\u2019t see how it could have helped me.\u201d I sent Flo and Valdez mental messages and they both reluctantly faced the door.</p><p>Ian helped me step on the scale and I watched breathlessly as he slid the weights across the metal bar.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it did. You absorbed some of it into your bloodstream because look!\u201d Ian wrote down the final number.</p><p>I squealed. Which brought Flo and Valdez running. I slammed back the weights, then grabbed both of them for a group hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost five pounds!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMio Dio! I never heard of such a thing for a vampire.\u201d Flo wiped a tear from her eye. \u201cBut you scared me, Glory. I thought this man . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check this out back at the hotel.\u201d Valdez was obviously Mr. Skeptic. \u201cBut if you\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy. Now, let\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d I turned to Ian. \u201cWhat else can I do to make sure the weight stays off? Barfing up my toenails doesn\u2019t seem like the way to go here. Surely there are other options.\u201d</p><p>Ian frowned when Valdez bumped against him. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few suggestions. Would you give me some space, shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Valdez stayed put.</p><p>\u201cLook, work with me here.\u201d I gave Valdez a nudge. \u201cBack to the door. Ian didn\u2019t bring any of his bodyguards in here, did he? That\u2019s got to mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means he\u2019s not scared of two women and a dog.\u201d Valdez growled. \u201cBig mistake, MacDonald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me, whatever you are. And I can get an army in here with a thought if I need to.\u201d Ian put out his hands and walked around me. \u201cI have no desire to hurt you, Glory, no matter what your friends think. But maybe you need a refund. Some things are simply not worth the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ian.\u201d I gave Valdez a \u201cback off\u201d look. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can work this out.\u201d</p><p>Flo looked from Ian to me. \u201cYour jeans are baggy in the butt, mia amica! Feel!\u201d She grabbed a handful of fabric.</p><p>I checked it out and, sure enough, she\u2019d managed to get some material into her fist. I swayed and reached out for a handhold. I was dizzy again, but this time from shock.</p><p>\u201cGlory!\u201d Valdez let me grab him. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I just can\u2019t believe it!\u201d I smiled and sniffled. \u201cIan, please, please, don\u2019t kick me out of the program. Just tell me what I can do besides drink that other potion. Or, if I have to, I\u2019ll deal with it. Even if I spend every evening hugging the toilet.\u201d</p><p>Ian patted my shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s try some other things first. Have you ever exercised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Now you\u2019re talking nonsense. A vampire doesn\u2019t exercise.\u201d Flo exchanged glances with Valdez. \u201cWhy, Glory can already run and jump better than any mortal ever dreamed of doing. And lift a small car if she wants to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d Valdez snorted. \u201cOkay, maybe one of those little electric Smart cars but not a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet or you both can take this discussion outside in the hall. Are we clear?\u201d I stared at them till I got two nods. Finally. I was desperate to hear an alternative. I\u2019d lied when I\u2019d offered to hug the toilet every night. Not going to happen.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rev your own metabolism. Exercise helps. Not just running, but lifting weights.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cAnd working out with a trainer on the areas where you want to get slim. Toning.\u201d</p> <p>I felt my stomach roll and it wasn\u2019t the potion this time. Exercise. I\u2019d always enjoyed the idea that while mere mortals toiled in gyms, I didn\u2019t have to. Sure I was stuck, but, hey, I was stuck! So there was absolutely no point in ever lifting a weight or stepping on a treadmill. And I\u2019d seen those poor women sweating and panting. That equipment they used looked like it was meant to extract information from a reluctant informer.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You want me to work out? With a trainer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have them at the hotel.\u201d Valdez was being helpful for a change. He probably figured a little suffering in the gym was much safer than drinking unknown elixirs from a MacDonald.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a try, Glory. Do it when you get back.\u201d Flo grabbed my arm and practically dragged me to the door. I let her because I was ready to go. \u201cRichard is waiting and getting very impatient. You have the things he wanted, MacDonald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ian followed us to the door. \u201cBut look what\u2019s happened to Glory here. Five pounds in two nights. Sorry, Florence, but you\u2019ve got plenty of proof right in front of you.\u201d</p> <p>I kept my mouth shut. Yes, my jeans were loose. But I still couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d stay that way. I took a bottle of the bedtime supplement from Ian and promised to drink it before I went to sleep. Promised too to hook up with a trainer when we got back to the hotel and put in at least an hour of exercise before lights-out.</p><p>Richard studied the papers Ian handed him. \u201cThese men and women all seem to live pretty far away. No one is closer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware. But call them. Check. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be satisfied that I\u2019m not scamming anyone.\u201d Ian smiled at me. \u201cJust helping vampire dreams come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreams.\u201d I cradled the bottle against me. \u201cI\u2019d be thrilled to have dreams if they were pleasant ones. It would make me feel mortal again. Not like I\u2019m dead to the world during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a clue, Glory. A vampire is dead during daylight. That\u2019s why I\u2019m around then. This dream stuff doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019ve watched you lie there all day.\u201d Valdez looked at Flo and then Richard. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t breathe, don\u2019t move, don\u2019t freakin\u2019 live. The miracle is the way you come to life as soon as the sun slips below the horizon.\u201d</p><p>Ian sighed. \u201cA pity too. That\u2019s why I had to do something about it. So much wasted time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Richard\u2019s gaze sharpened.</p><p>\u201cA daylight drug, of course.\u201d Ian smiled at me. \u201cI told Mr. Caine all about it. He\u2019s anxious to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my undead body.\u201d I got in Ian\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare try one of your weirdo supplements on Ray, Ian.\u201d I had felt poisoned, but at least I\u2019d been safely inside at night.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Glory, you were a believer a minute ago.\u201d Ian\u2019s attitude could only be called patronizing.</p><p>I was ready to smack him, but Richard got there first. He stepped between us.</p><p>\u201cDoes the Los Angeles Council know you\u2019re experimenting with this?\u201d Richard\u2019s voice was hard.</p><p>\u201cExperimenting? What makes you think it\u2019s not the real deal?\u201d Ian didn\u2019t look a bit intimidated. He had guts. I sure wouldn\u2019t want to face off against Richard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had too much experience with daylight claims over the years.\u201d Richard didn\u2019t bother to mask his contempt. \u201cThose vampires duped into buying into those claims paid with their immortality, MacDonald. Why should we believe you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook.\u201d Ian picked up the remote and hit a button. The TV over the fireplace came to life and there he was on the big screen, standing under a cabana on the beach in front of his house. In broad daylight. The sun reflected off the water and Ian was wearing sunglasses.</p><p>Flo and I gasped and I fell onto the couch. No way. No vampire that I\u2019d ever heard of had managed to stay out during the day. As Valdez had said, we couldn\u2019t even keep our eyes open.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, vampire friends and colleagues.\u201d Ian on the television spoke. \u201cYes, you\u2019re seeing me out in broad daylight. I\u2019m actually going to have to invest in some sunscreen.\u201d He laughed and held out his arms. He had on a blue and yellow Hawaiian-print short-sleeve shirt and looked like a sunburned tourist on an island vacation. \u201cCan you believe it? After years of research, trial and a few regrettable errors . . .\u201d He bowed his head as if for a moment of silent prayer.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done it. Created the miracle you\u2019ve all been waiting for. With my special formula you too can experience the joys of watching the sun shine.\u201d He laughed again and turned to gaze out at the ocean sparkling in the sunlight. One of his surfers caught a wave and rode it in. \u201cBy God, I\u2019ve missed this. But no more. Want to join me? Go to my Web site for details on how you too can be alive during the day again.\u201d He waved to the camera and the screen went dark.</p><p>Flo and I sighed and looked at each other.</p><p>Valdez and Richard looked at each other too, but cynicism was their expression of the evening.</p><p>\u201cNice use of Photoshop, MacDonald. Do it yourself or hire it done?\u201d Richard pulled Flo to his side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not faked, Mainwaring. I can get you testimonials about it too.\u201d Ian just smiled. \u201cOr you can wait and ask your friend Caine after he tries it. Notice I didn\u2019t let the sun\u2019s rays hit me. They can still damage a vampire with fatal consequences. I\u2019ll warn Caine about that.\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and grabbed his arm. \u201cI told you, Ian, leave Ray alone. He\u2019s a new vampire. My new vampire. I don\u2019t want him involved with something so dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell a man what to do, Glory. And Caine\u2019s got the money to pay. I told you, it\u2019s not experimental. It works. He\u2019ll go for it. All he needs is a chance to think about it.\u201d Ian winced when I dug my nails into his arm.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to blow my chance to lose weight, but this was important. \u201cAt least promise you won\u2019t go around me on this. I have to be here when you make the deal with Ray. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that you\u2019ll try to talk him out of it.\u201d Ian patted my hand. \u201cGood luck. He\u2019s really keen on the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, Glory.\u201d Valdez paced around us. \u201cYou\u2019ve told him what you think. Enough already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right about one thing, my friend.\u201d Flo looked up at Richard. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell a man what to do. You can only let him know how you feel and hope he respects that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Florence is right.\u201d Richard glanced outside. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all later. Now I\u2019m going to follow up on some things.\u201d He stuck the papers inside his waistband, covered them with his sweater and stepped out onto the deck. The surfers there came to immediate attention. Richard didn\u2019t spare them a glance, just shifted into bird form and flew off.</p><p>\u201cWell, there he goes.\u201d Flo smiled proudly. \u201cHe\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.\u201d She turned to Ian. \u201cSo if you have any secrets, MacDonald, be prepared to see them dragged out and kicked around.\u201d</p><p>I followed Flo down to the limo, still clutching my bottle of supplement. At least Ian hadn\u2019t asked for it back. But I\u2019d rather forget the whole weight-loss thing than stand by and let Ray fry in a botched quest for sunshine.</p><p>That deal had to be bogus. And if it wasn\u2019t? No use for me to daydream about it. It would cost the earth and be available only to the elite, very rich vampires. That left me out. It was one thing to let Ray pay for weight loss. I was going to look good on his arm for the Grammys. The tabloids would have a field day when I showed up skinnier in my designer dress. The thought made me smile as we settled in the backseat, Valdez beside us.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling, Glory? I don\u2019t trust this Ian MacDonald. I couldn\u2019t read his mind.\u201d Flo grabbed the bottle and unscrewed the cap. She sniffed. \u201cStuff smells good, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he blocks his thoughts.\u201d I snatched the potion back and carefully replaced the top. \u201cYou and Richard always do too. Does that make you villains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just be careful around him.\u201d Flo shook her head. \u201cI wonder . . . His weight-loss thing is working for you. Could Ian really have something that keeps a vampire awake during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I do know the weight-loss thing isn\u2019t going like he promised. And fooling around with the sun can be fatal.\u201d I shuddered, imagining Ray taking a chance like that.</p><p>\u201cRichard obviously doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible.\u201d Flo sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s move on. Tell me about your reality show. You met the designers?\u201d</p><p>I filled her in and we spent the rest of the ride back to the hotel talking dresses and speculating about what they would look like. By the time we pulled up to the curb, Valdez had almost nodded off.</p><p>\u201cIf your dress is beautiful, maybe we can get the winning designer to make the bridesmaid dresses for my wedding.\u201d Flo frowned when Valdez groaned.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was settled. I love the dresses you picked.\u201d And had spent many nights suffering through Flo\u2019s bridezilla act as she\u2019d planned her March wedding. I\u2019d hoped this was a done deal. She and Richard had already gone through a ceremony, but Flo wanted a \u201creal\u201d wedding\u2014translation: an enormous, expensive vampire blowout. Her brother Damian was hosting and had agreed that he would make sure the event made a royal wedding look like it had been done on a shoestring. As Flo\u2019s best friend and maid of honor, it was my job just to be supportive no matter how crazy she became. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. If this winner can do better, it\u2019s something to think about. I want my wedding to be perfect, no?\u201d Flo examined her nails, frowning at a chip in her red polish. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to my hotel. I\u2019ve booked a mani-pedi for two o\u2019clock. Fantastico, eh? Twenty-four-hour services here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d I hugged her. \u201cThanks for going with me, Flo. I hope I can get a trainer this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll hunt up someone. They\u2019re used to musicians and funny hours.\u201d Flo looked me up and down. \u201cYou feel okay? No more sickness?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Totally juiced up after Trina\u2019s donation.\u201d I tapped on the window and told the driver to take Flo to her hotel. \u201cI know you drink from mortals all the time. I shouldn\u2019t say this, but chase down a runner sometime. It\u2019s a real rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Glory, now you\u2019re talking like a true vampire.\u201d Flo nodded approvingly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. I talk tough, but I\u2019m usually quite civilized. I only feed when I need to, and I\u2019ll pick a nice, strong, very hunky male runner.\u201d She poked Valdez in the ribs when he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m married, but I still like to look, signore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d I climbed out of the limo, then Valdez hopped out, safely on his leash. Flashes let us know we were documented coming back. I wanted to show them my baggy pants, but decided it was too soon. Much better to wait for the red carpet for the big reveal. We headed for the front desk again, and the same clerk who was on duty.</p><p>\u201cYou said you had trainers available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. St. Clair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it possible to get one now? I want to work out.\u201d I leaned forward again and lowered my voice. \u201cTo speed up the weight-loss process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. Let me check to see who\u2019s available.\u201d She picked up the phone and made a call. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. One of our best trainers will meet you in the gym in five minutes. You\u2019ll need to change into workout clothes, of course. Would you like me to call back and make it ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, is the shopping arcade open? I didn\u2019t bring anything like that with me.\u201d Or own anything like that. Oh, I had some running shoes at home, designer ones that went with a cute outfit, but no serious workout clothes.</p><p>\u201cAll our shops are available twenty-four hours a day. What you\u2019re looking for is down the hall to the left. Have a nice night.\u201d We were hardly a step away when she was on the phone.</p><p>My supersharp hearing picked up on the fact that she was offering to split the take if the clerk in the shop would tell her what size I bought. It was almost enough to make me change my mind. But then I thought about the five pounds I\u2019d already lost. I had to keep it off and keep going. Damn.</p><p>I dragged into the shop and found a smiling clerk eager to assist me. Yeah, right. I grabbed the cheapest running shoes, though they were still outrageous to a woman who liked the clearance rack at a discount store. Then I tried on shorts. Size large was too loose! I almost leaped over the clothes rack and hugged the clerk. That would have been an interesting factoid for the tabloids. The medium was tight and rode up between my cheeks, but no way was I buying the large now that I\u2019d squeezed my butt into a medium.</p> <p>I happily piled my medium shorts and large (not extra large!) top on the counter. I selected a pair of socks that, gulp, cost more than the purple purse I\u2019d bought at an after-Christmas sale.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a sports bra, Ms. St. Clair? If you\u2019re doing vigorous exercise, you really need one. You don\u2019t want to break down the breast tissue. It can cause sagging later in life.\u201d The clerk was happily clipping off tags.</p><p>Valdez choked back a laugh. Later in life? I was only four hundred and change. But I humored her, grabbing my choices, then going back into the fitting room and shoving my breasts into a binding thing that really should come with a warning label. Sorry, but the only thing breaking down my breast tissue was this horribly tight spandex band pressing my boobs flat. I\u2019d decided to go ahead and get dressed in the whole outfit since I was running late. When I came out, Valdez rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cVery cute, Ms. St. Clair. I\u2019m sure Mr. Caine will love it.\u201d The clerk sighed. \u201cHe is so amazing. I have every CD he ever made.\u201d She pushed a sales slip to me. \u201cJust sign here. It will all be charged to your room.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the total and it was my turn to choke. I\u2019d better look cute. I\u2019d better look like a model for Miss Fitness America for that price. I didn\u2019t bother pulling out my own credit card. But I was going to have to settle up with Ray sometime. This wasn\u2019t fair to him, even if he was rolling in dough.</p><p>\u201cThanks for your help. I\u2019ll get someone to bring down an autographed advanced copy of Ray\u2019s new CD for you.\u201d I smiled, wishing I could ask for a discount. But that would be weird coming from Ray\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. And would be reported to the tabloids. I couldn\u2019t start rumors that Ray was in financial trouble.</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh! That is so nice of you.\u201d The woman had the grace to flush guiltily. Not that she wouldn\u2019t still leak my sizes to the press. But, hey, a medium and a large. I was rocking and rolling.</p><p>Valdez and I headed to the gym. As soon as we were alone, V stopped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You look funny.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be noticing stuff like that. But I\u2019ve got on a sports bra. It smashes me flat and hurts like hell.\u201d I pulled at my shorts. \u201cBut as long as you\u2019re looking, check it out\u2014my shorts are a medium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have gone with the large,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I pulled open the gym door. \u201cHello? Anyone here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. St. Clair, Bill Black, at your service.\u201d The bronzed god flipped a switch, then stepped off a machine.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi. Call me Glory.\u201d I let go of Valdez\u2019s leash and pointed to a corner. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you want to work out. Have you been doing any regular exercise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I laughed nervously. Bill was looking me over from head to toe, walking around me like he was trying to decide what part he should start on. I barely resisted the urge to tug down those creeping shorts.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll start slowly. Stretches first.\u201d He handed me a long lavender rubber band. \u201cPut one end under your right foot and pull with your right hand. Straight out from your body. You won\u2019t be able to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d pulled too hard and snapped the stupid thing. Bill\u2019s eyes were saucers.</p><p>\u201cOh, gosh, must be defective.\u201d And I must be an idiot. I couldn\u2019t use my vamp strength here. The point was to tone. How could I tone and not wreck the gym?</p><p>He picked up the rubber band and examined it. \u201cFirst time that\u2019s ever happened. Well, reach up with both hands first. To the ceiling. Then bend over and see if you can touch your toes.\u201d</p><p>Sure. How about my knees? The bra was strangling me. I felt a warm hand on my back.</p><p>\u201cA little farther now. You\u2019re not very flexible, are you?\u201d</p><p>I bit back a comment about how none of the men in my life had ever made that complaint. No way was I going to flirt with this guy. Even though he smelled like a very nice and healthy A positive. We were at my shins now and Bill apparently figured this was as low as I could go.</p><p>\u201cNow arch your back, like a cat doing a stretch. Roll your shoulders and then reach for the ceiling again.\u201d He stepped back and watched me through a series of what he called warm-ups.</p><p>Okay, I was warm. When were we going to work on my problem areas?</p><p>\u201cUh, Bill, I really want to reduce my hips and butt and trim my waist and tummy. How about we work on those first?\u201d I got the look again. At least he hadn\u2019t whipped out a tape measure or tried to put me on the scale. I\u2019d whammy him into submission before I let that happen.</p><p>\u201cAll right. You\u2019re the boss.\u201d He smiled. \u201cCome over here to this machine. Sit here and put your feet in these stirrups.\u201d He adjusted my legs and I was soon in position like an astronaut ready for blastoff. \u201cNow see if you can lift your legs. You should feel the burn on the back of your upper thighs.\u201d</p><p>I lifted. Nothing. Hell, I could no more not have vamp strength than I could be an astronaut.</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re stronger than you look, Glory. Kudos.\u201d Bill smiled and punched in a button. \u201cAdding weight. Try that.\u201d</p><p>Same thing. Poor Bill kept adding and I kept lifting. He started sweating, like maybe he was going to hyperventilate. Uh-oh. I knew that look. My vamp reality had just hit his mortal reality. Believe me, they don\u2019t mix well. I looked into his eyes and put him to sleep.</p><p>\u201cHe was about to freak out, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Valdez trotted over to see what the machine said. \u201cYou were lifting about two hundred pounds with your legs, Glo. Way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid, though. I can\u2019t tone squat. How do you tighten muscles when you can\u2019t use them?\u201d I extricated myself from the machine. I hadn\u2019t even broken a sweat. Poor Bill was wringing wet. \u201cHow do I get this machine back to a reasonable weight for a woman who never exercises?\u201d</p><p>Valdez told me what to do, then I suggested to Bill that he\u2019d watched me struggle to do ten leg lifts. When I\u2019d started whining, he\u2019d called a halt. As soon as Valdez was back in the corner, I snapped Bill out of it.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Bill, I really couldn\u2019t do another one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is your first night. Now lie down on this mat and we\u2019ll work on your core.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a core?\u201d I looked down at my smashed boobs and tummy. Valdez was snorting again but I ignored him.</p><p>\u201cYes, those are the muscles that support your whole body. Strengthen those and you\u2019ll improve your posture, whittle your waist and flatten your stomach. Core strength is very important.\u201d Bill said this like he was delivering the commandments from the mountaintop.</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever.\u201d I lay back and Bill put his hand on my stomach. It was still sore from all that throwing up earlier. I hoped whatever we did wouldn\u2019t aggravate it. \u201cWhat now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow you crunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. Really. Not even my favorite Cheetos.\u201d I bat-ted my eyelashes. \u201cI\u2019m doing a liquid diet, Bill.\u201d I saw him frown. \u201cUnder a doctor\u2019s supervision, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He nodded, then smiled, showing perfect white teeth. \u201cA crunch is an exercise, Glory. Let me show you.\u201d He got on the floor next to me, knees bent, chin tucked as he barely lifted his head and chest toward his really flat stomach.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I can do that.\u201d Which I could. But it was harder and more painful than it looked. Which proved that vamp strength wasn\u2019t everything. We went through several other torturous floor exercises designed to tone my butt, thighs and stomach. I only had to whammy Bill two more times. First when I accidentally tossed the hand weights across the room and Valdez laughed out loud. Then when I popped another set of rubber bands. I had to hide those in the trash.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done enough floor work for the first session. Maybe you can do a few more reps next time.\u201d Finally Bill gestured to a treadmill. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you jog for a while? You have jogged, haven\u2019t you? You\u2019ve got the right shoes for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d I lied, giving Valdez a look when he barked. Hey, I\u2019d been in a few sprints lately, running for my life. Those had to count, right?</p><p>\u201cThis will burn calories and speed your metabolism.\u201d Bill helped me climb on the machine, then started fiddling with the settings. \u201cStart walking, then we\u2019ll gradually increase the speed and the incline if you can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Surely I couldn\u2019t mess this up. I had vamp speed when I turned it on, but I could walk like a mortal. So I did, then I jogged. I was pathetically glad that I had on that vise of a sports bra. I didn\u2019t jiggle and, to my surprise, I actually broke a sweat.</p> <p>Bill was beaming by the time he decided I\u2019d had enough. \u201cTime for cooldown.\u201d He handed me a bottle of water and waited for me to drink. \u201cYou must stay hydrated, Glory. This is very important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Stay here and let me weigh first, Bill. I want to see how I\u2019m doing. No peeking.\u201d I carried the water bottle into the small room with the scales and shut the door. I fished an empty out of the trash and hid the full one inside, then stepped on board. Different clothes. Shoes, not barefoot. Skimpy shorts and tank, not jeans. All in all, maybe about the same. And . . . down five pounds. I leaned against the cool metal of the scale and just breathed. I hated working out. It seemed like a colossal waste of time. But if it kept this weight off . . .</p><p>I jumped off the scale, threw the weights back to zero and emerged waving my empty water bottle. \u201cStill losing. I am so pumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame time tomorrow? Or do you want to schedule something during the day?\u201d Bill had pulled out a BlackBerry.</p><p>\u201cSame time. Days are with Ray\u2014Israel Caine.\u201d I grinned. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t too hard on you, Bill. My weird schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019m coaching a rock star. She\u2019s also a night owl.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cIn fact, I expect her any minute. Maybe you know her.\u201d He spoke the name and my smile froze.</p> <p>Ray\u2019s friend with benefits. Had they hooked up again while I\u2019d been out at Ian\u2019s? I wanted to hang around and sniff the skinny bitch for signs of Ray\u2019s DNA. Which made me a jealous hag. I had no right. I had Jerry, who might be calling me right now. I\u2019d turned off my cell when we\u2019d been at the beach. I had to get a grip. And I also had to figure out when I was going to tell Jerry about my dealings with Ian. Crap.</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s really a pretty small world in rock-star land.\u201d I picked up Valdez\u2019s leash and the bag with my clothes along with my purse. \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t tell her we worked out.\u201d I looked down at myself. \u201cI know I\u2019m not in shape like she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did fine. Especially for someone who isn\u2019t used to a regular routine.\u201d Bill flashed his white, white smile. \u201cSee you tomorrow. Don\u2019t worry. You can count on my discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I glanced down at my purse. Did I tip him? Pay him? No, I guess this was another item that would be billed to Ray\u2019s room. Oh, well, I\u2019d keep telling myself that Ray wanted to do this for me. He\u2019d said so himself.</p><p>Valdez and I got on the elevator and rode it up to the suite. No sign of Ray or Nathan. I did have a message from Jerry, though. He wanted to meet. I couldn\u2019t avoid it any longer. I was going to have to tell him about my MacDonald connection. I called him back and we made plans to leave the hotel again. Valdez and I would do the disguise thing and exit via the Dumpster. Why not? I had a feeling my life was about to turn to garbage anyway.</p><p>Eight</p><p>I jumped in the shower and did my best to make myself irresistible. Not that it would do much good. Once Jerry heard the name MacDonald, how I looked wouldn\u2019t matter. Valdez did his doggie-disguise thing, this time as a standard poodle just because it amused him to mix it up. We ventured outside via the back door. My own disguise was little more than a silk scarf over my hair and sunglasses again.</p><p>Jerry met us on the other side of the Dumpster. \u201cValdez, you\u2019re not very threatening in that look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, boss, but I\u2019ve got all my skills with me. Don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Valdez leaped over a puddle of melted chocolate ice cream. It looked like a kid\u2019s party had been held in the hotel and the cleanup had been pretty sloppy. There were several cupcakes on the ground near the Dumpster and I saw Valdez look at them longingly. But he kept close beside me. We were both wired. We knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, Jerry? A club? Your hotel?\u201d Which would be better? A public place where he\u2019d have to control his rage or privacy where I could try to distract him by doing all the things I\u2019d learned he liked after so many years together?</p><p>\u201cHow about a drive? We can take the convertible and drive along the Pacific Coast Highway. You said the coast was beautiful. We\u2019ll leave Valdez here.\u201d He gave Valdez a wave. \u201cI can handle Gloriana\u2019s security on my own. Enjoy the night off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, boss, but maybe I should tag along. Glory\u2014\u201d Valdez snapped his mouth shut at a look from Jerry.</p><p>\u201cJerry, he\u2019s only doing his job. Quit looking at him like that.\u201d I smiled at V and sent him a mental message. I would be okay. Jerry would never hurt me. And I was surely better off without an audience anyway. \u201cGet some sleep, Rafe. You\u2019ve been on duty way too many nights without a lot of rest during the day. I know the suite\u2019s busy with Nathan in and out and the rest of the band looking for Ray at all hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. It\u2019s hell keeping everyone away from your bedroom. Nate\u2019s not a problem, but the band is. Those guys usually come by in the late afternoon ready to start the party or wanting to jam.\u201d Valdez shrugged one furry gray shoulder. \u201cYeah, I could use some sleep. Maybe I\u2019ll find a real bed and stretch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that. Shift, enjoy a shower, do whatever you want. I\u2019ll bring her back right before dawn. Until then, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Jerry put his hand at my waist and steered me toward the street.</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of you, Jerry.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cRafe needs some real time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d Jerry pulled me closer, then stopped. \u201cHey, you have been losing weight!\u201d He held me away from him.</p><p>I\u2019d put on a black miniskirt and cardigan sweater, but I\u2019d worn a red satin camisole under it and tucked it in. Tucking in is not a Glory thing. But the waistband on the skirt had actually been a little loose and I hadn\u2019t been able to resist. Now Jerry slipped the cardigan off my shoulders and looked me over, even turned me around.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. Sexy and shrinking right before my eyes. I can\u2019t believe that vampire managed to do this for you.\u201d Jerry toyed with the cami strap, his eyes dark and making promises.</p><p>\u201cShe worked at it too, boss. You wouldn\u2019t believe it, but Glory exercised.\u201d Valdez still lingered in the alley.</p><p>\u201cExercised.\u201d Jerry grinned. \u201cI\u2019d like to have seen that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019s not exactly Olympic material.\u201d Valdez coughed and backed up a few steps. \u201cOh, yeah, leaving now. No, I\u2019m gone. See you much, much later, Glory. Good luck.\u201d He turned tail and disappeared into the open back door of the hotel.</p><p>\u201cLuck? Why do you need luck, Gloriana?\u201d Jerry replaced the sweater on my shoulders and took my hand to lead me to his car. He helped me into the passenger seat with as much care as if I\u2019d been a princess. Jerry always made me feel special.</p><p>\u201cNo reason. It was just a saying.\u201d I watched Jerry settle behind the wheel. \u201cYou sure you know how to get where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a portable GPS. This car is vintage, so I stopped and bought one. The salesman helped me program the thing to take us on a scenic drive. We\u2019ll end up at a place where we can have privacy and a beautiful view of the Pacific.\u201d He turned to me and smiled. \u201cHow does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d I relaxed as he started the car. Might as well. The drive would give me time to figure out exactly what I could say to keep Jerry from heading straight out to Ian\u2019s with a broadsword. Because, knowing my beloved, he\u2019d packed one. The perks of chartering your own jet when you\u2019re traveling cross-country. I tied my scarf tight so the wind wouldn\u2019t whip my hair around my head as Jerry followed the voice on the GPS to the Pacific Coast Highway.</p><p>By the time he turned into a driveway that wandered up a hill, my nerves were shot. No amount of beautiful scenery could take my mind off the showdown to come. And if I kept stalling, Jerry was bound to find out from someone else. I felt sure Richard would tell him tomorrow night. Especially if he discovered that Jerry and Ian had a feud going.</p><p>Had I told Flo not to mention that to Richard? Damn. Surely she wouldn\u2019t . . . Who was I kidding? She\u2019d fill Richard in on all the gory details if she thought it would help with his investigation. And he\u2019d be on the Internet checking MacDonald out anyway even if Flo didn\u2019t say anything. What better reason would Ian have to poison me than that I\u2019d been made by a Campbell vampire? Gee, now I was worried. No, Ian was a businessman. I was fine. Had lost five pounds. Not poisoned at all. Oh, hell. We were here. Wherever here was. Time for truth or consequences. Gulp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jerry pulled the car to a stop. We were on a cliff overlooking the ocean. The house behind us must have been built to fit perfectly on the spot.

We can go inside and look around.\u201d Jerry got out of the car. \u201cWhat do you think? Is it romantic enough for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d I walked over to the edge of a slate terrace and peered down to a beach far below. Steps had been carved into the side of the cliff. The waves drifted into a narrow beach and the wind had died down to a gentle breeze. I took off my scarf and brushed my hair back from my face. Then I felt Jerry\u2019s hand slide down my back.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a heated pool. Want to go skinny dipping?\u201d His voice was husky as he slid my sweater off my shoulders again.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask? Seems like you already know the answer.\u201d I reached back and unzipped my skirt, then stepped out of it. My black thong was looser than it used to be and I took a moment to savor the feeling. Then I turned and reached for Jerry\u2019s sweater, a yellow silk that had the look of Rodeo Drive. Flo had certainly had a ball with his credit card.</p><p>\u201cI love this sweater on you. It looks great with your dark hair and eyes. But it has to come off.\u201d I threw it over to land on a chaise near the pool.</p><p>\u201cJust like this bra. Red is definitely your color. And I like the way it pushes up your breasts and matches that silk thing you have on.\u201d Jerry leaned down to lick a path along the edge of the cami. \u201cBut they both have to come off right now.\u201d He made quick work of them.</p> <p>I undid his belt and slid down his zipper. \u201cHmm. Are you sure you have time for a swim?\u201d I held his hard length in my hand. \u201cSeems you\u2019re ready to do a little something more.\u201d I shoved down his jeans.</p><p>\u201cA little something?\u201d Jerry grinned, tossed away my thong and swung me up into his arms.</p><p>I let my heels drop to the ground. \u201cOkay, a big something. Don\u2019t get any of these clothes wet. I do have to go back to the hotel tonight. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jerry managed to kick off his pants.</p><p>\u201cThe weight-loss thing. I have to drink something special before I sleep.\u201d I made a face. \u201cSorry if that broke the mood.\u201d</p><p>Jerry ran his hand along my bottom. \u201cNothing could break this mood, sweetheart.\u201d He kissed me, slow and deep, then walked into the pool down some shallow steps until the water hit him midchest.</p> <p>\u201cThe temperature\u2019s perfect.\u201d I slid against him to stand on my feet. I\u2019m not a fan of water, especially lakes with creepy-crawly things in them. But here, in Jerry\u2019s arms, I felt safe.</p><p>\u201cYou make me hot, woman. I\u2019m surprised the water\u2019s not boiling around us.\u201d He pulled my legs around his waist. I felt his hardness bump my stomach as he kissed me deeply, our tongues tangling together. Then he slid my legs over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me drown!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d He held one hand under my head and began to kiss a path up my inner thighs. My mind went blank and any pitiful swimming skills I had escaped me. Forget that trainer\u2019s core. Jerry had found my real one. Like the core of a volcano, mine was deep inside me with a building pressure threatening to explode as he used his mouth on me. I felt the boiling, roiling, almost insanely explosive power shudder through me. My shudders made the water around us into wavelets but I just gripped Jerry\u2019s arms and reached for what I needed so desperately\u2014release.</p><p>\u201cJerry, please. Come inside me. I . . .\u201d I reached for him but he shook his head, refusing to stop his delicious torture. What was he waiting for? Tremors shook me. A California earthquake? No, this was the beginnings of my own impossibly delicious violent upheaval. Finally he let me slide down his body to rest my cheek on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d I panted harder than after that trek to nowhere on the treadmill. One of my wildly scattered thoughts was that I\u2019d read somewhere that sex burned calories and revved metabolism. Maybe I should weigh again before dawn.</p><p>\u201cYour pleasure.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI know you well enough to realize I pleased you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased I\u2019m limp. Wow.\u201d Thank God we were in the water because I couldn\u2019t have stood if my life depended on it.</p> <p>\u201cA day of vampire sleep should cure you, lass.\u201d He kissed my cheek. \u201cReady to see the inside of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I reached between us. \u201cI have one more item on my agenda, Mr. Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you have an agenda, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d I guided him inside me, gasping as he penetrated my sensitive flesh. \u201cOh, God, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d I kissed his mouth shut. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire. I have superpowers, lover. Now, you know what to do. Do it. Until I scream and make waves and you can\u2019t hold back anymore and have to give me all you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tall order.\u201d Jerry grinned and walked me over until I sat on the second step.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re up to it.\u201d I sighed and leaned back as he began to move. Pressure built inside me almost instantly. He gripped my buttocks and drove into me, his fangs glinting in the dim light. I offered my throat and he took me there, drinking for a moment, then pulling back, a strange look on his face. I didn\u2019t question him, just kissed him and held on to him as he pushed into me one last time, shuddering with his release. I screamed as pleasure rippled through me again, hoping there were no neighbors to report murder being committed on our hilltop.</p><p>We leaned against each other for a long moment. I knew the time for talking was overdue. I smoothed my hand up his back, then tugged on his wet hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He leaned back and looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drink from me like you usually do. What was wrong?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t taste the same. And, trust me, my love, I\u2019d know your taste blindfolded in a room with a hundred other vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that. Just like I\u2019d know yours.\u201d My stomach lurched and I swallowed. I was not going to be sick again. No way. I just couldn\u2019t be. I gently pushed him away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess it\u2019s those supplements I\u2019ve been drinking to lose weight. Now, let\u2019s go inside. I\u2019d like to see the inside of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s weird, though. Never thought I\u2019d turn down a chance to drink from you. I\u2019ll be glad when this diet of yours is over and you\u2019re back to the Glory I know and love.\u201d He gave me a searching look, then pulled himself out of the pool. He walked over to a cabana and grabbed two white terry robes.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look away. Jerry naked is art. Perfect male from dark wet hair, worn longish this week since apparently Flo had convinced him to skip a haircut, down to his muscular legs that looked so great in a kilt. And in between . . . I sighed. My warrior was back at poolside, reaching out a hand to pull me out and to wrap me in my own robe. I shivered as I stood next to him and tied the terry closed.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d He picked up our clothes and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cNot really. It\u2019s a beautiful night.\u201d I stared at the ocean, then up at the stars. The moon was just a sliver this time of the month. But our vamp vision served us well along with the glow from the security lights at the edge of the terrace.</p><p>What was the deal with my strange taste? I must taste truly awful for Jerry to refuse to drink from me. It was usually our favorite finish to lovemaking. I hadn\u2019t tried to feed from him because of the stupid diet. And I\u2019d missed the closeness of the act. Damn. I shook off the worry and grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on. This house looks fabulous from the outside.\u201d I walked with him toward the door. Forget the taste issue. That was nothing compared to the Ian issue. I felt disloyal working with a MacDonald. If Jerry laid down the law and forbid me to see Ian again, though . . . Well, I guess I\u2019d leap over that Grand Canyon when I came to it.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I have the key here.\u201d He pulled out a key ring and went to work on the back door. Then he punched in a code on a pad inside. \u201cSecurity code. Chip gave it to me. He\u2019s pretty trusting. Guess he\u2019s aware that another vampire would be a fool to cross a member of the ruling council here in L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire named Chip. And he\u2019s on the Council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Damian and I had drinks with some of the members last night. Some pretty powerful characters. They run a tight ship. I admire that. You don\u2019t want to cause trouble out here or you\u2019re staked.\u201d</p><p>I shivered. \u201cThat\u2019s drastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. And it\u2019s why the Energy Vampires didn\u2019t set up shop here. They figured Austin was an easier territory to infiltrate.\u201d Jerry flipped a switch and we saw a beautiful sunken living room. The pale turquoise walls were hung with oil paintings of California landscapes. There was a natural stone fireplace similar to Ian\u2019s and a brown leather sectional couch that made you want to sink into it and enjoy the fire that came to life when Jerry flipped another switch.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d I approached the fire and held out my hands. I didn\u2019t want to talk about the Energy Vampires. We\u2019d had run-ins with the bad guys in Austin and barely escaped with our lives. \u201cI like this place. Beautiful art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChip is a collector. Those paintings are worth a fortune. They don\u2019t necessarily come with the house. What do you think? Should I buy one? As a souvenir of our time here?\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cWhich one is your favorite?\u201d</p><p>What a question. Leave it to Jerry to go big. No little plastic \u201cI heart L.A.\u201d key chain. I should pick out a favorite painting, one that would probably set Jerry back six figures, and he\u2019d have it to remember our time in California. Oh, hell. Would he want to remember anything when he heard about Ian? I had to tell him. No way was I letting this go any further. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSit down, Jerry. We have to talk.\u201d I sat on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cAgain? We already talked this week. Florence said that was probably enough for a couple who\u2019d been together as long as we have.\u201d Jerry faked a put-upon expression and sat close beside me. Maybe it was good that we wore our robes and nothing else. When he got ready to kill me, I could whip out a bare boob and distract him.</p><p>\u201cForget Flo and her TV talk show advice.\u201d I scooted over so I could face him. \u201cThis is serious. It\u2019s about who I went to see in Malibu.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe diet guy. What about him?\u201d Jerry moved his legs and his robe parted. He grinned when he saw me looking.</p><p>\u201cQuit playing, Jerry. I mean it.\u201d I reached over and covered him. He was too quick for me and slapped his hand over mine, holding it down where he wanted it.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. You\u2019re cute when you\u2019re serious.\u201d He had a twinkle in his eyes that I rarely got to see. Jerry teasing was a wonderful sight. He was clearly happy. With me.</p><p>And I was about to kill the joy. I gave in and increased the pressure of my fingers for a moment and leaned in to kiss his smile.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jerry. Remember that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re scaring me, Gloriana. What the hell have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man I\u2019ve been seeing. The man who has helped me lose an incredible five pounds.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it. I had to stand and drop my robe. \u201cLook. My butt is shrinking. It is, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that, though it was fine the way it was. Now, finish, lass, before I go mad.\u201d But he did reach out and stroke his hand along the curve of my ass, as if testing the size of it. I sighed, then picked up my robe again.</p><p>He snatched it away with a grin. \u201cNo need to go crazy. Unless this is life or death, you can tell your tale as well naked as dressed. And\u201d\u2014he pulled me between his knees\u2014\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll accept whatever \u2018news\u2019 this is much more happily with this view in front of me.\u201d He leaned forward and licked one of my nipples.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Jerry, if only it were that simple.\u201d I pushed my fingers into his hair and held his head to my breast.</p><p>That got his attention. He looked up. \u201cGlory?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, here goes.\u201d I stepped back out of teeth-gnashing range. \u201cThe diet guru is Ian MacDonald.\u201d</p><p>Here it came. Gaelic. A string of what was surely profanity accompanied by Jerry jumping up and grabbing the only thing in the room that could stand in for a weapon. He brandished a silver candlestick, his face red, his eyes on fire. Finally, he took a calming breath, slammed the silver down on the tiled counter and faced me. I\u2019d slipped on the robe again, figuring rightly that, naked or dressed, there was no way I could sex my way out of this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had truck with Ian MacDonald. Are you mad, woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s been, uh, nice to me.\u201d I stayed standing. I wasn\u2019t about to let Jerry look down on me.</p><p>\u201cAnd does he know you\u2019re my woman?\u201d Jerry growled this, his fangs down, his eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019m with Ray. Just like the tabloids say. He seems to believe me.\u201d I reached out a shaking hand but thought better of touching him. \u201cHe knows you made me. But Ray went to Malibu with me. We played the devoted couple in front of Ian.\u201d</p><p>Jerry\u2019s mouth tightened. He hated the idea of my \u201cdevoted couple\u201d act with Ray. He\u2019d seen it for himself. Not good for his pride. And the reason he\u2019d trotted out the giant ring the night before. I always wore Ray\u2019s ring in public those nights. It absolutely killed Jerry.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think MacDonald bought your act.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Ray paid for my treatment. He and Ray even talked about some other things, stuff Ray might try. Your name never came up.\u201d I had probably just said too much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool, Gloriana! He\u2019s using you to get to me.\u201d Jerry stalked to the window and looked out. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he had you followed after you left there. I told you I smelled another vampire on the roof last night. If one of his spies saw us together, he knows you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that!\u201d I stomped my bare foot. \u201cI am not yours. Or Ray\u2019s or any man\u2019s.\u201d I knew I was getting off the subject but he\u2019d just hit one of my hot buttons. \u201cDamn it, Jerry, your attitude is not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself, Gloriana. You\u2019re spouting twenty-first-century women\u2019s lib idiocy and ignoring the fact that you\u2019ve probably set me, yourself and even Caine up to be staked.\u201d Jerry threw off his robe and climbed into his clothes. \u201cGet dressed. We need to get back to the hotel. I need backup and so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, you\u2019re overreacting. Ian\u2019s done nothing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he? Why the hell do you taste funny?\u201d Jerry stopped to stare a hole in me. \u201cTell me more about his weight-loss thing. How does it work? You look pale. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire. I\u2019m always pale.\u201d I held on to the back of the couch, suddenly nauseated again. Damn.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games with me, my girl.\u201d He strode over and put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI want the truth. What\u2019s he doing to you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. No way was I going to tell him anything else about the supplements and my reactions to them. That would just reinforce his opinion that I was on a suicide mission. I didn\u2019t believe it. Or maybe I didn\u2019t want to believe it. I just pulled on my clothes and walked in stony silence out to the car.</p><p>Jerry grabbed my arm as I was about to climb in. \u201cTalk to me, Gloriana. I\u2019m worried about you. This is dangerous. Don\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I see is that you\u2019re all about an ancient feud. Do you even know Ian MacDonald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. We\u2019ve fought many times. He hates me; I hate him. His family and mine are sworn enemies. He\u2019d like nothing better than to cause me pain.\u201d Jerry ran his hand through his hair. \u201cAnd hurting you would do that. More than you could ever know.\u201d</p><p>I felt my anger soften a little. \u201cI believe that, Jerry. But believe this. I\u2019m doing this diet thing. Can you try to be rational? Not make it all about you?\u201d I opened the car door. \u201cLet\u2019s go back. It\u2019s too close to dawn for either of us to think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. And I\u2019m not the one being irrational.\u201d Jerry waited until I was settled, then slammed the car door. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that you\u2019re too damned concerned about how you\u2019ll look on Israel Caine\u2019s arm at the Grammys to think about anything else. So you\u2019ll risk whatever it takes to lose a few measly pounds. Well, I hope it\u2019s worth it, Gloriana, because, trust me, Ian MacDonald will make sure you pay well for your moment in the spotlight. I just hope it\u2019s not with your life.\u201d</p><p>I took a shaky breath and decided I couldn\u2019t respond to that or I\u2019d burst into tears. Was I that shallow? That vain? And what was the freakin\u2019 deal about my tasting funny? We rode the miles back to the hotel in tense silence. By the time we got to the rear entrance, I wanted Jerry to say something, at least promise he wouldn\u2019t go after Ian until . . . Until what? After the Grammys so I could look good? Maybe I was that shallow and vain.</p><p>He helped me out of the car and walked me to the back door. It was just thirty minutes until the sun would come up and I was dragging. I\u2019m sure Jerry was too, but you\u2019d never know it to look at his firm step and squared shoulders. He was clearly so livid he was about to morph into a bat and screech, which, according to him, was a great way to blow off steam. I\u2019ve never tried it myself or been tempted to.</p><p>\u201cWait, Gloriana.\u201d He stopped me at the back door with a hand on my arm.</p><p>I looked around, relieved that no paparazzi had staked out this area. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you sooner, Jerry. I knew you\u2019d hate this, but I\u2019m not feuding with the MacDonalds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t go out there again.\u201d His hands were on my shoulders now, his eyes boring into mine.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t promise that. There are just a few more days until I never have to see Ian again. Give me that, Jerry.\u201d I looked away because there was so much I wasn\u2019t telling him. And he\u2019d absolutely kill Valdez when he found out how those supplements had done a number on me.</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019ve taken Valdez with you to these meetings with MacDonald.\u201d His words hit me like ice chips.</p><p>Uh-oh. Was Jerry somehow reading my mind through my block? No, not possible. He just knew me too well. Obviously Rafe was already in deep guano.</p><p>\u201cI swore him to secrecy. Sorry, Jer, but if he can\u2019t be loyal to me first, I won\u2019t have him around, period.\u201d I jerked back, taking Jerry by surprise. \u201cYou want me to go it alone? Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardheaded, impossible woman!\u201d Jerry ran his hand through his hair, his go-to move when he was exasperated. If a vampire could age, he\u2019d be bald by now. \u201cKeep Valdez. I should send you more guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ray has another paranormal guard and I had Flo and Richard with me tonight. I had backup out the yin-yang. Not that I needed it. Ian acted the perfect gentleman.\u201d I reached out to touch Jerry\u2019s cheek. His beard was rough, typical for this late at night. I moved closer. \u201cI love that you\u2019re so concerned for me. Love that you want to see me safe. I\u2019m not stupid, Jerry. I\u2019m being very careful. Richard\u2019s investigating Ian. Talk to him tomorrow night. Maybe you can help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can. I can help him send the worm to dust.\u201d Jerry jerked me to him and kissed me breathless. \u201cGod help me, I don\u2019t want to lose you, Gloriana. Why you persist in stepping into the lion\u2019s mouth, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He looked like he wanted to shake me. Instead he just shook his head. \u201cHave a care.\u201d With that he turned on his heel and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I sighed and headed into the hotel. The ride up in the elevator was long enough for me to snap to the fact that all Jerry had promised was to stake Ian. Great. I stepped into the suite, greeted by Valdez back in his usual Labradoodle form. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d he take it? You did tell him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d He followed me to the bedroom door. \u201cYour hair\u2019s wet. Did he throw you into the ocean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him. My hair\u2019s wet from a nice swim before I told him.\u201d I kicked off my high heels. \u201cLet\u2019s just say he didn\u2019t take it well. And the only reason you still have a job is because I threatened to go solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p> <p>I threw open the bedroom door. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ray?\u201d I turned when I heard the hall door open.</p><p>\u201cHere I am. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get away before sunrise.\u201d He grinned and began unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cMan, I\u2019m beat.\u201d He stopped and studied me. \u201cWhoa, what\u2019s wrong, sweet thing?\u201d</p><p>I kept my mouth shut. Where to start? Ray reeked of sex. Okay, so he\u2019d been getting some of his own. Not my business. I picked up the bottle of supplement I had to drink before bedtime and twisted off the cap.</p><p>\u201cI told Jerry about Ian. He was pissed to say the least. Now I\u2019m afraid to drink this, which will probably give me nightmares. So I\u2019m not in a good mood. How was your night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so great either.\u201d Ray sat on the side of the bed and watched me put down the supplement. \u201cI admit you got me to thinking about the rush when I saw how you looked after you drank from Trina. So I arranged to hook up with DeeDee after she had a workout.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice.\u201d I felt my lip curl and fought to suppress it. \u201cDid you feel it? Was it the endorphin high you were looking for?\u201d There. That actually sounded like casual interest as I took off my cardigan and hung it up.</p><p>\u201cThe feeding part was great. But then I realized something.\u201d Ray yawned and stretched, then dropped his shirt on the bed beside him.</p><p>\u201cOh, care to share your breakthrough?\u201d I was not jealous. Seriously. How could I be? I\u2019d just had my own hookup with a man I loved. Still, I really didn\u2019t want to hear this as I leaned over to set my shoes on the closet floor.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Ray stood and walked over to stand behind me. \u201cLook at you. Ian\u2019s stuff really works. How much weight have you lost?\u201d</p><p>I straightened and turned around, a flush heating my cheeks. \u201cFive pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn!\u201d Ray hugged me around the waist. \u201cI can feel it! Now, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. This is so worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, yeah, Ray had paid what was probably more than the price of his luxury SUV for me to go down a dress size. I put some enthusiasm into hugging him back.</p><p>\u201cRay, I\u2019ll never be able to thank you properly for paying for this. I\u2019m thrilled. No matter what Jerry says, Ian\u2019s a genius. Obviously his treatment is working!\u201d I extricated myself and yawned. \u201cI need to get into my nightgown. It\u2019s almost dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Ray nodded to Valdez. \u201cLeave us, fur face. I need to tell Glory something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t answer to you, Caine.\u201d Valdez stayed in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. See you tomorrow night.\u201d I waved him out and shut the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Ray?\u201d I hoped this wasn\u2019t about that daylight drug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for throwing DeeDee in your face. I don\u2019t have feelings for her. I hope you know that.\u201d Ray approached me again and toyed with the strap on my camisole.</p><p>\u201cWho or what you do on your own time is your business, Ray. I wouldn\u2019t dream of interfering.\u201d I gently removed his finger from under the strap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I realized tonight that what I did with her was meaningless. The only buzz I got was from her mortal juice.\u201d Ray\u2019s hand was back, this time at my waist. \u201cMan, look at you. This skirt is loose.\u201d He pulled my camisole out of the waistband.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me sex with a mortal doesn\u2019t do it for you anymore?\u201d I should have already disappeared into the bathroom, but I was kind of interested in this conversation. I\u2019d had mortal lovers in the past, but it had been a long time ago. Frankly, I preferred vampire men myself. Especially when we could do the whole fang-banging thing too. It\u2019s like an extra orgasm. And I\u2019d missed it tonight. Sigh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s right. Of course I haven\u2019t had sex with a vampire. Yet.\u201d Ray leaned in and smelled my neck where my vein throbbed. \u201cMmm. I\u2019d love to compare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet you would. But it won\u2019t be with me. At least not tonight. The clock\u2019s ticking and it would have to be the quickest of quickies even if I was willing, which I\u2019m not.\u201d I grinned and pushed him back. \u201cBut do me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ray toed off his loafers and kicked them into the closet.</p><p>I held out my wrist. \u201cJerry said my blood tastes funny. Take a bite and see if he\u2019s right. I think maybe Ian\u2019s junk is doing more than making me lose weight. Richard mentioned poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Glory!\u201d Ray pulled my wrist to his mouth. Before I could say another word, he\u2019d taken my vein. After only a moment, he pulled out and headed to the bathroom. I heard him spit into the sink and water running.</p><p>\u201cWhat did it taste like?\u201d I followed him and put my hand on his bare back while he rinsed out his mouth. He shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI hate to tell you this, but Richard may be right.\u201d Ray turned to look at me, frown lines between his bright blue eyes. \u201cBaby, if what\u2019s in your veins isn\u2019t poisoned, it\u2019s doing a hell of an imitation.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a minute, Ray.\u201d I\u2019d dragged on my nightgown and was lying on my side of the bed. Ray settled next to me and stared at me worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding you, Glory. You tasted toxic. You said Blade wouldn\u2019t even drink from you.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled my eyes and I swiped at them. \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, honey, don\u2019t cry.\u201d Ray pulled me into his arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about this when we wake up. You\u2019re not going to drink another supplement then, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cWhich means I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll keep off the weight I\u2019ve lost.\u201d I wanted to wail. Had I suffered for nothing? My stomach ached from throwing up and from those damned crunches. And my legs! All that jogging and then wearing high heels for hours had taken a toll. At least when I woke up, I\u2019d be good to go. I felt the dawn coming and gladly closed my eyes.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t confessed to Ray, though, that while he\u2019d been in the bathroom brushing his teeth, I\u2019d downed the nighttime supplement Ian had given me. Maybe it had been a stupid move, but it hadn\u2019t made me sick, just helped keep the weight off. And it allowed me to dream.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019d have good dreams this time. When I was a little girl, I\u2019d dreamed of knights and castles and a fairy-tale life. Jerry had made some of those dreams come true. Too bad he\u2019d brought along wicked witches in the form of his mother and Mara, mother of his child and the woman who now wanted him for her second husband.</p><p>Mara danced around me. She had me tied to a stake in the public square. Mag, Jerry\u2019s mum, piled sticks around my feet.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll burn for the witch ye are, ye whore.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and looked around. \u201cWhich am I, old woman, a witch or a whore?\u201d I knew Jerry would ride in soon on his white horse and save me. He always did.</p><p>Mara carried a torch and set the branches alight. \u201cThere. Now you\u2019ll be all toasty. That\u2019s what you get for consorting with a MacDonald. Even I never sank so low. That\u2019s why Jeremiah loves me now. See the ring he gave me?\u201d She waved a huge diamond in my face and screamed with laughter. Then she came at me with scissors, hacking away until I was bald. I could hear the sizzle as my blond curls fell into the flames.</p><p>\u201cThat should please ye, whore. Bet you lost a good pound with that haircut.\u201d Mag cackled and tossed another branch on the fire.</p><p>\u201cHere they come, the MacDonalds and the Campbells! Hide!\u201d Women screamed and ran when men in kilts rode into the square from opposite sides.</p><p>I heard the clash of swords and the squeal of wounded horses as the men fought. Wasn\u2019t anyone going to untie me? The flames were getting hotter and I could smell my feet burning. Ow. I hurt so bad.</p><p>\u201cJerry! Where are you?\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cLeave her. She\u2019s a traitor to the clan.\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice, hard and cold. He rode past, his plaid flapping in the wind, and never bothered to look my way as I called his name over and over.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine now. I\u2019ll save you, Glory.\u201d Ray stopped his horse and jumped down, but his bucket was empty. He cursed and threw a white toweling robe on the blaze, then black satin jockey shorts. Stupid. The fire roared and got hotter.</p><p>He knelt in the dirt and picked up a guitar. \u201cI\u2019ll sing to you, Glory. I wrote a new song in your memory. It\u2019s called \u2018Gone, Glory, Gone.\u2019 I\u2019m going to put it on my new CD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me out of here! Ray, shut up and do something!\u201d I staggered, suddenly free. Run. I had to run, but my feet hurt. I bumped into something hard and almost fell.</p><p>\u201cGlory! What the hell?\u201d Valdez grabbed me and pulled me into his arms. I pressed my face against his chest and held on.</p><p>\u201cFeet hurt. Hot.\u201d I muttered it against him, feeling him move as he carried me away from the heat.</p><p>\u201cI know. You got too damned near . . . Never mind. I\u2019ve got you now.\u201d He laid me down gently.</p><p>Ah. Bed. I sighed and relaxed. Then I opened my eyes. He stood over me. The man Valdez, not the dog. Sunlight behind him made me blink. My vision blurred, then I realized this wasn\u2019t a dream anymore.</p><p>Valdez snatched up a pillow and held it in front of him. Oh, yeah. He\u2019d told me he was usually naked when he shifted into his dog-body form for long periods of time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake and it\u2019s daytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit, Sherlock. You made it halfway across the living room before I realized what the hell I was seeing. You were sleepwalking.\u201d Valdez lost the lopsided grin and dimples that always surprised me. Well, I\u2019d actually only seen them once before. He had dimples on his cute butt too, but I wasn\u2019t supposed to remember that. \u201cYou had a near miss. I caught you just a few inches from stepping into sunlight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening.\u201d I rubbed my eyes and tried to focus. Impossible. I hadn\u2019t seen daylight in forever. Instead of being thrilled, I was suddenly terrified.</p><p>\u201cAfraid it is.\u201d He stepped closer and frowned down at me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I had another one of those nightmares.\u201d I tried to sit up, but my muscles screamed. \u201cOh, God, my stomach\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore nausea?\u201d He sat on the side of the bed, careful to keep that pillow in position. I wasn\u2019t so freaked-out that I didn\u2019t notice his great build. Bodyguard requirement. Along with his superpowers. The handsome face, dark hair and dark eyes were just perks. No wonder Brittany was all over him.</p><p>\u201cNot nausea. Guess I didn\u2019t get enough healing vamp sleep to actually heal. I think I\u2019m sore from my training session with Bill the pill.\u201d I yawned, exhausted. \u201cHow long before sunset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour. Are your feet okay? You said something about them being hot.\u201d</p><p>We both looked down at my bare feet. That was when I realized my long gown had ridden up to thigh high. Oops. I jerked it down.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just sore from too much jogging and cute shoes.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m lucky you were there to catch me before I got to the balcony. If I\u2019d actually gotten in the sun . . .\u201d I shuddered. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I have my trusty bodyguard.\u201d I smiled at Rafe. \u201cYou\u2019ll love this. I dreamed Mara and Mag burned me at the stake.\u201d I managed a chuckle. \u201cGo figure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like a typical mortal nightmare. You and those two always manage to have heated words when you cross paths.\u201d Rafe grinned when I groaned, then he got serious again. \u201cAnd your trusty bodyguard was asleep at the wheel to let you get as close as you did to that sunlight. I\u2019m sorry, Glory. I\u2019m going to be on high alert from now on. You look like hell, and that\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on his. \u201cThanks, Rafe. I\u2019m okay, just tired and feeling every muscle in my body for a change. Guess this is what four hundred plus feels like.\u201d</p><p>Rafe shook his head. \u201cDoubt it. That would be much, much worse, I imagine. Now, close your eyes. Maybe you can catch some more z\u2019s. You obviously need them.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Ray. He really was dead to the world. No movement at all. Pale. I laid my hand on his chest. Cool to the touch and no discernable heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cYou know Caine\u2019s going to freak when he realizes you saw daylight, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell him, Rafe.\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to rush right out to Ian\u2019s place and buy a chance at it.\u201d I groaned because I\u2019d felt that sudden movement in every abused muscle.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should let him.\u201d Rafe looked down to where I held on to him. \u201cMacDonald\u2019s diet thing is working on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But obviously there are side effects.\u201d I glanced at the open bedroom door. I could see the sunlight hitting the carpet in the suite\u2019s living room. \u201cBesides, I have trust issues with Ian MacDonald. Blade tasted my blood last night and said there was something off about it. So I had Ray taste it too.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cRafe, Ray thinks Ian is poisoning me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does it. The man is dead.\u201d Valdez jumped up, pillow forgotten.</p><p>My jaw dropped, then I forced myself to shut my eyes. I cleared my throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this when Ray and I get up at sunset. Guess you ought to shift back now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Glory. I\u2019m decent.\u201d</p><p>More than decent. Oops. Didn\u2019t say that out loud, did I? No, thank God. I stole a peek. Yeah, his pillow was back in place.</p><p>\u201cYou did save my butt today, pal. I would have fried if I\u2019d made it to the balcony.\u201d My throat suddenly clogged.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. That\u2019s why I changed, Glory.\u201d He reached out and touched my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming to harm on my watch, lady. And that\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p> <p>I cleared my throat. \u201cI know that. I\u2019ve always known that. \u2018Thank you\u2019 seems pretty lame, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Thanks, Rafe.\u201d I sniffed, feeling weepy again. Like I had with Ray, the night before. I was blaming it on the diet stuff.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He smiled, his dimples brief punctuation marks that vanished too soon. \u201cI\u2019ll say it again: You never should have gotten so close to the balcony. I\u2019ve gone soft or I\u2019d have stopped you at the bedroom door.\u201d</p><p>I swept my eyes over him. Soft? Maybe the thick black hair that fell to his shoulders, but nothing else on this powerful man could ever be called soft. Tears filled my eyes. He\u2019d risk everything for me without a second thought. I didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cI never should have started this. I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Valdez firmed his lips. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. MacDonald\u2019s slick. He\u2019s obviously been running this con a long time. Just look at his video, Web site and fancy digs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I sighed. \u201cTired. Sleep now.\u201d I closed my eyes. \u201cHey, V.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes again and got a flash of his perfect dimpled buns. Sweet. I smiled. \u201cIt was nice to talk to you like this. Outside of my head for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was. See you later.\u201d He smiled and disappeared into the living room.</p><p>I snuggled next to Ray and realized that, aches and pains aside, I was incredibly lucky. I was literally surrounded by hot guys determined to protect me. No way did I deserve it, but I sure wasn\u2019t going to turn any of them away.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Glory, it\u2019s time to figure out our next move.\u201d Ray pulled me down on the couch beside him.</p><p>I held back a scream when my sore thighs hit the seat. Valdez, safely back in Labradoodle guise, sat on the rug in front of us.</p><p>\u201cThe limo will be here to pick me up in about an hour. Ian will expect me to come out there to drink from Trina again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going.\u201d Valdez glanced at the balcony.</p><p>\u201cV\u2019s right. You want a runner, we can head out and find you one in a park or get someone coming out of a gym. If Ian\u2019s stuff is poisonous . . .\u201d Ray picked up my hand. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchy. I didn\u2019t sleep well so I didn\u2019t heal.\u201d I tried to get comfortable but it wasn\u2019t happening. I\u2019d already discovered that breathing hurt so forget that. And my feet! I was still barefoot, unable to deal with my high heels yet.</p><p>\u201cOne more night, guys. Then tomorrow I have my fitting for Designed to Kill and get to see my red-carpet dresses.\u201d I turned to Ray. \u201cI have to finish what I started, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine\u2019s right. Forget it, Glory.\u201d Valdez moved closer. \u201cThose supplements . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I won\u2019t drink any more of the one that made me sick.\u201d I staggered to my feet and limped to the bathroom. Inside, with the door safely shut, I weighed again. Still down five pounds. All right. If I lost another two to three pounds tonight and then exercised, that should put me down to a size eight. I could be very happy in an eight. And if I drank my bedtime elixir, I could hold on to that size for another day, hopefully two. Long enough to make it to the red carpet. Maybe.</p><p>I threw open the bathroom door. \u201cCome on, guys. No way is Ian poisoning me. Why do it gradually? And he\u2019s a businessman who wants your business, Ray. Hurting me would be stupid. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am thinking about it.\u201d Ray jumped up and put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cHow do you explain your blood\u2019s weird flavor? And now you\u2019re creeping around like you can hardly walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m sore from exercising. That\u2019s all. Happens to mortals all the time. So they say anyway. I hear them gripe about it in my shop all the time. Which reminds me. Lacy\u2019s having trouble with the new help we hired after Christmas. And we had a shoplifting incident that\u2019s costing me big bucks. I was on the phone with her for almost an hour.\u201d I tried to get away from Ray without making a big deal out of it. No go.</p><p>\u201cChanging the subject? Not working. Lacy\u2019s handling the shop fine. Right?\u201d Ray stared me down.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I do need to go back to Austin right after the Grammys.\u201d I realized I wasn\u2019t as eager to do that as I should be. It had been an adventure being out here as a rock star\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. I\u2019d be just plain Glory again in Texas. Well, plain Glory the vampire shop owner. I kept my hands on Ray\u2019s chest. Would he go back there with me? He seemed much more at home here and I knew it.</p><p>\u201cAbout your blood, Glory. It was off last night.\u201d Ray glanced at Valdez. \u201cTasted toxic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that feud. Bet MacDonald knows she\u2019s still attached to a Campbell. Surprised he\u2019s being so subtle about it, though.\u201d Valdez paced the living room. \u201cIt\u2019ll get Blade out there to him for a face-to-face. Maybe that\u2019s his plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no plan. I probably still had that other supplement in my system. The one that made me throw up.\u201d I held out my wrist. \u201cTry again, Ray. Right now. See if it\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if it\u2019s not, you\u2019re done with this diet crap. No arguments.\u201d Ray pulled my wrist to his mouth and inhaled. \u201cSmells good.\u201d He slid his hand down to my waist, then nuzzled my jugular. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll try it here. Closer to the big pump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Caine.\u201d Valdez pushed his nose between us.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone, V. I need to know the answer.\u201d I shoved my fingers into Ray\u2019s hair and felt his breath on my neck. \u201cGo for it, Ray. But just a taste. Don\u2019t try to turn this into something, um\u2014\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish the thought because Ray had gone in and was taking what he wanted. At least this time he didn\u2019t jerk away and run to the sink. He eased out and licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet as always, glorious woman.\u201d He kissed the spots where his fangs had been and sealed them closed. \u201cGuess you\u2019ve recovered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d I put some space between us. \u201cSo why not go out to Ian\u2019s and get another round from Trina? And the bedtime supplement must be okay or I\u2019d still taste weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rationalizing, Glory. What did Blade tell you about MacDonald?\u201d Valdez stood between me and the door to the hall. I had a feeling I\u2019d have to go through him to leave.</p><p>\u201cOf course, like you, Jerry thinks this is all a plot by Ian to get to him.\u201d I looked down at my now-loose black jeans. \u201cMaybe, just maybe, I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s hiney what Ian\u2019s motive is as long as I\u2019m skinny by Grammy time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaine, the Campbells and the MacDonalds have been feuding for centuries. Ian would think nothing of using a woman as a pawn in an effort to take down the enemy. Business comes second to a clan blood feud.\u201d Valdez obviously considered himself an expert on Scottish clan relations and warcraft.</p><p>\u201cThat settles it, then. You\u2019re not going out there, Glory.\u201d Ray frowned when his cell phone rang. He picked it up from the coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019s Nate. Hell, I\u2019m late for a meeting.\u201d He answered the phone and walked out to the balcony. I heard him tell Nate he\u2019d meet him downstairs in ten minutes before he shut the phone.</p><p>\u201cGot to go.\u201d Ray looked great in a black silk shirt and black jeans. \u201cAre we clear on your plans for the evening, Glory?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ray. I\u2019ll be fine. I have another appointment later with Kill Bill the trainer. No date with Jerry that I know of. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s speaking to me.\u201d I followed Ray to the door. \u201cGood luck with your meeting. This is about the TV special, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it would be a great opportunity.\u201d Ray kissed my cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Blade. Much as I\u2019d like to see you free of the Scot, I figure he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably with Richard, planning an attack on MacDonald.\u201d Valdez grinned like he wanted to be in on that session.</p><p>Ray looked me over. \u201cI\u2019m well aware that you haven\u2019t promised not to go to Ian\u2019s, Ms. Thing.\u201d</p><p>I flushed. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Ray opened his cell and hit speed dial. \u201cMacDonald? Israel Caine. Glory and I are swamped with this Grammy prep. Is there any way you can bring your program to us at the hotel tonight?\u201d He listened and nodded. \u201cYeah, super. She\u2019ll be waiting. We\u2019ve got a scale here. Thanks.\u201d He snapped the phone shut and looked at Valdez. \u201cIf you really think Ian\u2019s a danger, you\u2019ll need backup. I\u2019ll send Brittany to you. Think the two of you can handle Ian and Trina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to.\u201d Valdez was obviously not happy that I was continuing with the program, but it wasn\u2019t his call.</p><p>\u201cRay, thanks!\u201d I threw my arms around his neck and started to kiss him on the cheek. Of course he turned his head so that smacker landed on his lips. He put his hand on the back of my head and made it a pretty good one. I wasn\u2019t going to push him away. I\u2019m still a fangirl. Any woman who kissed Israel Caine would be, whether he was a rock star or not. Then we both staggered from a Valdez headbutt.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, but aren\u2019t you running late for an important meeting, Caine?\u201d Valdez didn\u2019t look sorry.</p><p>Ray grinned and slid his hands down my back. \u201cNo meeting\u2019s as important as this lady. Be careful, Glory. Want me to call Blade and get him over here for you?\u201d</p><p>I blinked. Ray had just managed to surprise me. \u201cThanks, Ray. But I really don\u2019t want to spend an evening watching Scottish warriors face off.\u201d I walked with him out to the hall and hugged him one more time. \u201cI know that took a lot. For you to offer to call Jerry. It means more than you know.\u201d</p><p>Ray smiled. \u201cPurely selfish on my part. I had a fifty-fifty chance the MacDonald would win and I\u2019d have Blade out of your life forever.\u201d He shrugged when his cell rang again. \u201cAll right, Nate, I\u2019m coming. Glory, call me when Ian leaves. I want to know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d I watched him head for the elevator. When it opened, Brittany stepped out. Reinforcements. Good. Would two shape-shifters be enough? I\u2019d heard enough warnings about Ian to be nervous. So I called Flo and asked her to come too. She said Richard was still hunting down Ian\u2019s \u201csuccess stories\u201d and she was interested in checking out the shops in my hotel lobby so she\u2019d be right over. Now I felt better. If Ian thought he could use me as a pawn in his feud against the Campbells, he\u2019d have to go against me and my personal army first.</p><p>I limped back into the room and found Brittany and Valdez with their heads together.</p><p>\u201cCaine handled that pretty well.\u201d Valdez said it grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cYou mean handled me. I called Flo. She\u2019s coming too. She doesn\u2019t think Richard\u2019s found any of Ian\u2019s former clients yet. Not that I\u2019m surprised. Vamps move around a lot and stay off the grid.\u201d Since I wasn\u2019t going out, I might as well put on my workout clothes. I grabbed them, freshly laundered while I slept, headed for the bathroom and shut the door.</p> <p>\u201cBet Ian brings those surfer a-holes with him too. Can\u2019t wait to throw some of them off the balcony.\u201d Valdez called through the door.</p><p>I crammed myself into the sports bra and tight shorts, then pulled on the tank top. I headed back out to sit on the bed to pull on my socks and shoes.</p><p>\u201cOf course he will. I never go out to his house without my bodyguard. And toss as many as you like. They\u2019re vamps. They\u2019ll just turn into bats and fly right back in here, anxious to rip out your throat.\u201d I looked at him and at Brittany, standing in the bedroom doorway. \u201cSeriously, guys, don\u2019t start trouble. Just finish it if they start something first. If I can go through with the weight-loss thing, I\u2019m going to. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Brittany frowned when there was a knock on the door. \u201cThat can\u2019t be him already. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck it out. Don\u2019t let anyone in you don\u2019t know.\u201d Valdez was right behind her.</p><p>I groaned as I stood and followed them. I\u2019d heard the clich\u00e9, \u201cNo pain, no gain.\u201d Guess this was what it felt like. How did mortals stand working out if this was the result?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Barry, Ray\u2019s publicist, and a group of people, two of them in snazzy workout clothes.\u201d Brittany grinned at me. \u201cSort of like yours, Glory. Should I let them in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I knew Barry was always looking for PR opportunities. I had a sinking feeling I knew what was coming. I tugged down my shorts, which were getting way too personal, and pasted on a smile.</p><p>\u201cGlory, baby, look at you. It\u2019s true, then, you\u2019ve been working out!\u201d Barry rushed inside to give me air-kisses. \u201cLet me introduce you to these people.\u201d He tossed me some names, which I immediately forgot, and offered bottles of water from the fridge at the bar all around.</p><p>I sank gratefully into a club chair while I waited for his pitch. And there had to be one.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our spring \u2018Step into the Future\u2019 line you\u2019ve got on, Ms. St. Clair. How do you like it?\u201d One of the tanned and toned women spoke first. \u201cDoes it move the way you hoped?\u201d</p><p>Does it move? I wish. Then I could lie back and let it do those torturous crunches. I merely nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable.\u201d I leaned in, nodding toward where Barry was in deep conversation with the only other man in the group. \u201cBut this sports bra. Argh. It\u2019s a killer. Surely there\u2019s a way to keep me from bouncing around without mashing me flat.\u201d</p><p>The woman waved her hand. \u201cJanet, take a note. You\u2019re absolutely right, Glory. May I call you Glory?\u201d I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s on our priority list. Naturally well-endowed women work out too, and they need support without pain, am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I watched Janet scribble frantically. I had a feeling a new ad campaign had just been born, complete with tag line. \u201cSupport without pain. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Barry didn\u2019t have time to fill you in on why we\u2019re here.\u201d Fake smile, fake smile.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Barry was suddenly at my side. \u201cGlory, Fitzwell Fitness Wear would like to have you become a spokesperson. Do some ads for them. They\u2019d follow you on your journey to hit the gym and lose a few inches where you need to.\u201d Barry smiled all around. \u201cNot that Ray has a problem with her figure just the way it is, you understand, people. He\u2019s crazy about Glory. Would kill me if he thought I was criticizing her. Which I\u2019m not.\u201d Barry turned red and grabbed a bottle of water.</p><p>I gave Barry a look that made him twist the top off and down half the contents. \u201cBarry\u2019s right. Ray\u2019s always been very complimentary of my curves. This fitness kick I\u2019m on is just for the Grammys. Since it\u2019s going to be on TV all over the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Glory, I get it. But one of the tabloids printed an item about how you were hanging out at the hotel gym, dieting and stuff. And that you\u2019d bought these new clothes in the lobby shop here in the hotel.\u201d Barry flushed and exchanged glances with the two women who wore outfits similar to mine. Of course theirs were obviously size small and their running shoes top of the line.</p><p>\u201cThose tabloids. They bribe store clerks to spy on me.\u201d I made a face. \u201cDisgusting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>All the mortals murmured sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cNo privacy when you\u2019re with a rock star.\u201d Barry put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cBut we might as well see if we could get a little publicity out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Barry. I totally get it.\u201d I stood, even though my muscles seized and I wanted to bend over and cry into my knee caps. \u201cAnd I appreciate the offer and the opportunity.\u201d I smiled as everyone else stood. \u201cBut I just can\u2019t consider doing it. This is a temporary thing. Just until the Grammys. I\u2019ve got less than a week and then I\u2019m back to Texas and my sluggish existence. Honestly? I hate exercising.\u201d I looked down. \u201cLove the clothes, though. Very cute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d get a free wardrobe, of course. We could take some photos here and then follow up later in Austin. Maybe you didn\u2019t have the right trainer. We could send you a member of our staff.\u201d The head honcho, the only woman in a business suit, really didn\u2019t want to let this go. \u201cAnd someone to work with Mr. Caine too, if he\u2019s interested. Barry thought he might be willing to be included in some of the ads.\u201d Ah, now I knew why.</p><p>\u201cBarry, may I speak to you in the bedroom?\u201d I grabbed his arm and hustled him out of the living room.</p><p>The publicist looked down like he was surprised at my strength when I closed the bedroom door. \u201cGee, Glory, you have been working out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little, but I\u2019m not doing a commercial. Get rid of these people. Did you run this by Ray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, didn\u2019t have time.\u201d He tried to pull away, but finally gave up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this gig? It\u2019s a reputable company. They\u2019ll pay you big bucks. You, not Ray. You could use the money, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue about that. But I also knew that, once back in Austin, I\u2019d be right back to my old size. So the slimming Glory campaign would be a bust. Unless . . .</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019d be interested in just featuring a normal-size woman working out? One who never gets any smaller? Because I know I\u2019m not going to stick with this program after we leave L.A., Barry.\u201d Oops. Or stick with Ray either, come to think about it. Well, there went the big bucks. There was no help for it. I was pulling the plug.</p><p>\u201cThey want a success story, Glory. Can\u2019t you trim down? For yourself, if not for Ray. It\u2019s the healthy thing to do.\u201d Barry smiled at me and used his free hand to pat me on the shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cI am healthy at my regular size, Barry. Sizes are just arbitrary numbers society has put on labels inside clothes to make most of us feel bad. I\u2019m sorry I ever started this diet-and-exercise thing. My body hurts, I\u2019m nauseated half the time and I can\u2019t sleep. For sure it stops when I say it does.\u201d I fought back my fangs. This was definitely one of my hot-button issues. Barry was just the messenger, but sometimes the messenger deserved to take the heat.</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d He winced and I realized I still held his arm.</p><p>I let him go and gave him some space. \u201cSorry, but screw their so-called success stories. I\u2019m not doing it. And I\u2019m staying in here until those people are gone. Get rid of them.\u201d I glared at him, opened the bedroom door and waited for him to scoot through it, then shut and locked it.</p><p>\u201cWell, you told him.\u201d Valdez had watched all this from the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes, and now I feel bad. He was only doing his job.\u201d I peeked out of the bedroom door and saw Barry just disappearing into the hall. \u201cBrittany, get Barry back in here, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Glory.\u201d Brittany jerked open the door and returned with the alarmed publicist held in what resembled a head-lock. We might have to whammy Barry. He\u2019d obviously never dealt with such tough women before.</p> <p>\u201cLet him go, Brit.\u201d I led him to the couch. \u201cBarry, I\u2019m sorry. I know you were just trying to help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, Glory. You want me to get them back in here?\u201d Barry pulled out his cell. \u201cI could still make this happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that. But let me explain the real reason I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d I settled beside him, barely stifling a groan.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Barry put the cell away. \u201cYou look serious. Not sick, are you? You\u2019ve been moving funny. Like you\u2019re in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but that\u2019s from working out. I think I did too much last night. Those trainers.\u201d I made a face.</p><p>Barry shook his head. \u201cI know what you mean. I call mine Attila. She\u2019s a real bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d I laughed. \u201cBut here\u2019s the scoop.\u201d I quit smiling. \u201cRay and I\u2019ll probably go our separate ways after the Grammys. He may not be coming back to Austin at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! I thought\u2014\u201d Barry looked genuinely shocked. \u201cWell, I thought maybe he\u2019d found the real deal this time.\u201d He hugged me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory. You want me to punch him out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you assuming he\u2019s dumping me?\u201d I pushed back and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m getting back with an old boyfriend.\u201d I felt tears near the surface. Was this a lie or wishful thinking? I had no idea. Or maybe I was getting way ahead of myself. Saying it out loud was twisting my gut almost as badly as Ian\u2019s potion had. Could I really just walk away from Ray? He\u2019d become so important to me, I couldn\u2019t imagine never seeing him again.</p><p>I realized Barry was literally on the edge of his seat waiting for details. Well, I\u2019d started this. I might as well finish it. I could always change my mind later. Or not.</p><p>\u201cYou remember the pictures of Ray fighting Jeremy Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember. That was a headline for days in all the tabloids. Star Snoops ran the picture in color on the cover. Surely you aren\u2019t choosing him over Ray.\u201d Barry grabbed my hand. \u201cIf he\u2019s threatened you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jerry would never lay a hand on me or any woman. He loves me. Has for years.\u201d Centuries actually, but who\u2019s counting?</p><p>\u201cAnd violent. I saw what he did to Ray, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ray got his licks in too. Men will be men.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cIt was nothing more than a pissing contest. They\u2019re both territorial. Not a quality I appreciate in either of them. But I\u2019m telling you this so you can be ready. Maybe you can do some damage control when Ray and I break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I can do that. And I see why you don\u2019t want a bunch of commitments as Ray\u2019s fianc\u00e9e if the wedding\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Barry stood and paced the carpet. \u201cWell, hell. I had even more irons in the fire for you, Glory. You were a publicist\u2019s dream whether you know it or not. You\u2019re genuine. Relatable. I see a lot of Ray\u2019s fan mail and his approval rating went up among several key demographics since you two hooked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo glad I could help.\u201d I got up and walked Barry to the door. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to stay together and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d Barry smiled sadly. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything hasty, Glory. Ray loves you. Oh, he may act like a dog now and then\u2014it\u2019s that rock-star thing. Cut the boy some slack. He was single for a lot of years. It\u2019ll take a while for you to domesticate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. It\u2019s not Ray. It\u2019s me and the other guy. We have a lot of history that I can\u2019t just ignore. And this isn\u2019t to go public yet. I mean it, Barry. We\u2019ve got the reality show and the Grammys to deal with first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. My lips are sealed.\u201d Barry tapped his nose. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying this anyway. My bullshit meter\u2019s buzzing.\u201d Barry looked down when his cell vibrated. \u201cAnd now so\u2019s my phone. Got to be those Fitzwell people. I know just who to steer them to. DeeDee\u2019s in the hotel. She\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That\u2019s genius. She\u2019s the epitome of fitness.\u201d</p><p>Barry leaned down and kissed my cheek. \u201cHang in there with Ray, Glory. I\u2019ve known him for years. He\u2019s a stand-up guy. And, honestly, he\u2019s never been as caught up in the rock-star hype as a lot of these yahoos are.\u201d Barry\u2019s phone buzzed again. \u201cOkay, got to take this. Later, lady.\u201d</p><p>I watched him head out. He was talking on his cell before the hall door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cI liked what I was hearing from you.\u201d Valdez bumped against me gently. \u201cBlade\u2019s the one. About time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, V.\u201d I felt like hell. So what if I\u2019d made a mature decision. Putting it right out there for Barry so he could handle the inevitable fallout when Ray and I parted ways. Funny how maturity sucked.</p><p>Ten</p><p>\u201cOkay, they\u2019re coming.\u201d Valdez faced the door, Brittany right beside him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go on with this, Glory?\u201d Flo carefully put away the shoes she\u2019d been showing me that she\u2019d bought in the boutique downstairs.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019ve just got a few days until the red carpet.\u201d I sneezed and shrieked at the same time. Oh, God, that hurt. \u201cI didn\u2019t go through all this to stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sneezed. Vampires don\u2019t sneeze. Why?\u201d Flo stared at me as if I\u2019d sprouted a third eye.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Your perfume is tickling my nose. And when I sneeze . . .\u201d I grabbed her arm. Another one was coming and, oh, help. I sneezed again.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you screaming when you sneeze?\u201d Flo handed me a tissue from a box on the desk next to the wall.</p><p>\u201cMy stomach is killing me. I told you I did those crunches. That demon\u2019s spawn of a trainer made me do them.\u201d I blew my nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well and didn\u2019t heal.\u201d</p><p>Flo narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou block your thoughts. What do you mean you didn\u2019t sleep well? The sun comes up, we die. We just call it sleep.\u201d</p><p>The knock on the door interrupted an interrogation I knew I\u2019d have caved under. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted Flo, and therefore Richard, to know I\u2019d seen daylight. Vampires are funny creatures. Either one of them might have a secret craving for the sun and do something stupid about it if they knew. They\u2019d seen Ian\u2019s video and seemed to scoff at it, but when they heard that I\u2019d actually almost walked into daylight . . . Well, I didn\u2019t want to test either one of them. I was pretty sure stepping into the sun would have sent me up in flames.</p><p>I peeked through the spy hole and saw Ian, Trina and a pair of Ian\u2019s usual guards there. I threw open the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in. I was just telling Flo how I was feeling.\u201d</p><p>Ian took my hand and looked into my eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well. What is it, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy healing sleep didn\u2019t do the job. I\u2019m sore from my training session last night.\u201d I smiled at Flo. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m suddenly allergic to my friend\u2019s perfume. I\u2019ve been sneezing, which kills my stomach.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trina linked her arm through mine and smiled. \u201cThat pain\u2019ll go away once you\u2019re used to regular exercise, Glory.

I\u2019ve got a session scheduled with the trainer for after you guys leave.\u201d I winced. \u201cNot that I\u2019m looking forward to it. Sorry, Trina. That may be true for mortals, but vamps live in a different universe. I shouldn\u2019t be hurting at all tonight. This is freaking me out, Ian.\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cFix this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour reactions to my regimen continue to puzzle me, Glory, but I\u2019ve been working on the problem.\u201d He patted my hand and greeted Flo, who barely nodded. She\u2019d obviously decided he was the enemy.</p><p>\u201cWork fast.\u201d I pulled away from him, not willing to go all chummy, especially with Flo giving him the evil eye. \u201cOh, yeah, this is Brittany, Ian, another of my bodyguards. Seems only fair since you\u2019ve brought two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ian barely spared her a glance. Bodyguards were like furniture to him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get used to exercise, Glory. Especially if you can\u2019t find a supplement that agrees with you. I\u2019ve brought a different one for you to try when you wake up tomorrow night. It shouldn\u2019t make you sick and could even help you lose an extra pound or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for that.\u201d I could hear Flo muttering something in Italian. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Flo, just sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting mortal, Glory my friend, sneezing and moaning about your stomach.\u201d Flo nodded dismissively at Trina. \u201cWe are vampire, mia amica. We give pain; we don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. This isn\u2019t how the program is supposed to work.\u201d Ian opened a black leather attach\u00e9 case and pulled out two bottles. \u201cSo I\u2019ve also made adjustments in the formula for your usual bedtime drink. I\u2019m hoping those nightmares will go away. Then you should heal properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try it.\u201d I ignored Valdez\u2019s warning growl. \u201cI guess now I just have to feed from Trina and we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d Ian put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cI know you\u2019re anxious to speed along the process, so we\u2019re going to make tonight\u2019s treatment do double duty.\u201d He looked down because Valdez was all but sitting on his foot. The two surfers with Ian had moved in too. I felt like I was in a hunky man cave. Brittany kept hanging back, keeping an eye on the action.</p><p>\u201cBack off, V. We\u2019re just talking here.\u201d I nudged him with my running shoe. \u201cSeriously, I want to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you do. Because I think you\u2019ll lose at least five more pounds tonight if we do this my way.\u201d Ian grinned when Flo and I gasped.</p><p>\u201cThat would be incredible.\u201d I sneezed again when Flo came up behind me.</p> <p>\u201cYou might get into that six before the Grammys after all, mia amica!\u201d Flo patted my back when I sneezed once more and I grabbed my stomach. \u201cEnough of this. I go wash off my perfume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t bother, Florence. Glory\u2019s leaving.\u201d Ian held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Valdez growled for good measure.</p><p>\u201cThe whole point was to stay in tonight, Ian. I have lots to do to get ready for the Grammys.\u201d I put my hand on Valdez\u2019s head to discourage him from starting something.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how it works, Glory.\u201d Trina pulled off her coat and I saw she had shorts and a tank underneath. I\u2019d already noticed the running shoes on her feet. \u201cYou and I are going to run the twenty miles together. Then you come back here and take my blood. We\u2019ll both be revved so it\u2019ll really do you some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrina\u2019s right. We\u2019ve done this before with great results. I know a twenty-mile sprint should be no big deal for you, Glory. A vampire can run all night if she wants to.\u201d Ian nodded toward Flo and smiled. \u201cThough it\u2019s easier in the right shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would fly before I would ruin my shoes, signore. A vamp would have to be stupido to stay on the ground.\u201d Flo flounced to a chair and sat, then seemed to remember that her best friend had spent centuries being afraid to shift and fly anywhere.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Glory. I didn\u2019t mean . . . Amica, if you like to run, then run, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Flo, but my feet are on fire and I feel like someone has ripped my intestines out through my belly button. This is a bad idea.\u201d I couldn\u2019t freakin\u2019 believe this. Twenty miles? And all it would take is one Glory sighting and I\u2019d have a caravan of tabloid reporters on my tail waiting for me to fall on my face. Which was a distinct possibility right now.</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory, surely you don\u2019t hurt that much. Let\u2019s start over. I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t heal during your death sleep.\u201d Ian led me to the couch. \u201cSit. Let me examine you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift her shirt and die, signore.\u201d Flo was up again, had grabbed a pencil from the desk and had it aimed at Ian\u2019s heart.</p><p>His two bodyguards picked her up and plucked the pencil out of her hands before I could do more than wince. She screamed Italian invectives, but the men were obviously stronger than she was. Brittany piled on and one of them had to release Flo to deal with her. A lamp turned over and glass broke.</p><p>\u201cMake them let her go, Ian. Flo, he\u2019s not going to lift my shirt, are you, Ian? He\u2019s just going to look into my eyes. Simple stuff. And he\u2019s a doctor, remember?\u201d</p><p>Valdez snarled, torn between loyalty to me and staying close by my side, and watching Flo being manhandled without going to her defense. Clearly Brittany was holding her own with the other guard.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Florence. Glory\u2019s right. I just want to get to the bottom of this problem she has.\u201d Ian lifted my wrist and took my pulse. \u201cSet the woman down. If she comes at me again, you can stop her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrattaglie. Worthless pieces of shit. Apes!\u201d Flo straightened her green silk blouse and checked her brown suede skirt for damage. \u201cI kill them if they touch one hair on my head or on Glory\u2019s head, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>Brittany threw a few choice words at the man she\u2019d managed to almost strip of his shirt. Then she tossed her hair and took her position next to the balcony doors again.</p><p>\u201cFlo, honey, let Ian see if he can help me.\u201d I rolled my neck as he felt behind my ears, then he lifted my lids to look into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou look sleep deprived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s those nightmares. I had another one last night. I hope your new formula stops those.\u201d I sighed and looked down at Valdez. I sent him another silent message of thanks. I didn\u2019t doubt he\u2019d saved my life when I almost walked into the sun.</p><p>\u201cI have something that will make you feel better.\u201d Ian pulled a syringe out of his black bag.</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell.\u201d Valdez headbutted Ian\u2019s hand and the syringe went flying across the room. Brittany picked it up and put it out of sight. \u201cShe can do twenty miles without that, can\u2019t you, Glory? I\u2019ll be right there with you, Brittany too. What about you, Flo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn these boots?\u201d Flo looked down at her new Ralph Lauren leather high-heeled boots. I knew she\u2019d never worn them before. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d She and Valdez exchanged looks. \u201cFor my best friend? Of course.\u201d She frowned at Ian. \u201cI do heal in my sleep. I get a blister? Poof, is gone the next evening when I wake.\u201d</p><p>I got to my feet. Apparently I had to prove to everyone that I was Wonder Woman. And I did want to lose more weight. If this would take off five pounds in one night, then I would do twenty miles on my knees if I had to. Even if the paparazzi were snapping pictures of the ordeal.</p><p>\u201cOh, Glory, you\u2019re just the bravest woman I know.\u201d Trina was all over me. Next thing I knew she was crumpled against the wall.</p><p>\u201cFlo! What was that about?\u201d I limped over to check on Trina\u2019s condition. She just grinned up at me and blew me a kiss.</p><p>\u201cShe had her hand on your ass. Puttana!\u201d Flo got in Trina\u2019s face. \u201cMy friend doesn\u2019t go that way. If she did, it wouldn\u2019t be with a skinny bitch like you, you understand me? It would be with someone she loves.\u201d Flo grabbed me and kissed me on the lips. \u201cSo hands off!\u201d</p><p>I leaned on Valdez as Trina got up and shot the finger at Flo. Well, that had been a cute little scene. And I didn\u2019t dare wipe off my mouth, though I had a feeling I was sporting Tahitian Sunrise on my lips now. Fine. Everyone kept saying I looked pale anyway.</p><p>\u201cI have just one question. How are we going to get out of the hotel without being caught by the paparazzi?\u201d I looked around. There were four women, three men and a dog in our party. We\u2019d have as much luck sneaking out as a marching band playing \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a park down the street where you can start the run. Shift out of here. Trina can meet you there.\u201d Ian smiled and looked down at his Italian loafers. \u201cLike Florence, I\u2019m not dressed for a twenty-mile run and have no desire to join you. I\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201d</p><p>Well, that didn\u2019t exactly work for me. The idea that Ian would be left alone in our suite while we were all outside? No, not going to happen. Of course, a vampire can get in where he\u2019s not supposed to be without breaking a sweat anyway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Ian.\u201d I leaned against the door and looked at Flo, who was walking gingerly around the living room in her high-heeled boots. \u201cFlo, honey, why don\u2019t you stay here too? Maybe you can ask Ian about his program and some of his former clients. Richard would like more information, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d Flo\u2019s look of relief was almost comical. Then I sneezed again, doubling over to scream into my T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cGlory, are you sure you don\u2019t need me?\u201d Flo patted my back while I struggled to stand upright again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Trina, you just run out the front door. No one\u2019s going to follow you. Let\u2019s shift out of here.\u201d I limped toward the balcony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCool. I get to see you vamps shape-shift. I love that.\u201d Trina clapped her hands. \u201cGo for it, Glory. What do you like to turn into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d The way I felt, I wondered if I even could shift. Brittany threw open the French doors.</p><p>\u201cMia amica, are you sure you want to do this?\u201d Flo rubbed what must be her lipstick from the corner of my mouth and gave Trina a superior look. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m okay. And I\u2019ll feel great after I feed from Trina. That really charges my battery.\u201d I enjoyed the cool breeze on my face and already felt marginally better. \u201cI\u2019m just down from not getting the rest I\u2019m used to. It\u2019s a weird feeling. But it\u2019s got to be temporary. And tomorrow night is my fitting.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI called Zia and told her to warn the designers that I\u2019d been losing weight. She laughed it off. Probably figured I\u2019d only lost a pound or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait till they see you, girlfriend. So skinny. They\u2019ll be blown away.\u201d Flo grinned. \u201cThis Zia, she is smart. Reality shows, they like the drama. Your designers will be going crazy trying to make the dresses fit.\u201d</p><p>I held on to the balcony railing, working up the courage to shift. \u201cGuess this is worth it.\u201d The street was far below us and there was a beautiful sky above. A clear night, cool breeze and the lights of L.A. made me actually feel like flying for a change. It had to be better than standing on these aching feet. I leaned against Flo when she put her arm around me. \u201cOf course it is. Totally.\u201d</p><p>Flo frowned. \u201cI hope so.\u201d She hugged me. \u201cBe careful. Brittany, Valdez, take care of her. Don\u2019t let her out of your sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Valdez bumped my hip.</p> <p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re two on two.\u201d Brittany checked out Ian\u2019s bodyguards. \u201cNo, make that two on zip. These guys are lame-ass losers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? You want to go another round?\u201d Surfer number one got in Brittany\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSettle, children.\u201d Ian stood beside me, looking me over again. \u201cYou think you can shift, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope so. Just never has been my favorite thing to do. You guys go ahead. Valdez and I will be last.\u201d I saw Brittany and Ian\u2019s guards change and fly out following Ian\u2019s directions.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this. Grab your sunglasses and a scarf and I\u2019ll do my Doberman thing. We\u2019ll go out the back.\u201d Valdez nudged me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can do this.\u201d I closed my eyes, pictured a bat and flew out into the night sky. Valdez stayed by my side. I looked down and soon saw the park Ian had described. I actually felt better as the bat. Not so much stomach to ache. Too bad I couldn\u2019t fly around here forever. I saw Trina jog out of the hotel entrance and down the street. I dive-bombed her just for the hell of it, enjoying her shrieks as I snatched at her hair. See? I\u2019m not always sweet, easygoing Glory.</p> <p>When Trina arrived at the park and the waiting guards, I landed on the ground next to her and concentrated on shifting back. For a moment, I stalled. Yep, there was a real scary hesitation. Maybe because I knew my stomach pain was waiting for me. That and my aching feet. But I finally got a grip on my reluctance and did the necessary.</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are. Hey, you attacked me.\u201d Trina laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat was so cool.\u201d Obviously nothing fazed Trina. \u201cAnd when you shifted . . . Man, you were just a blur and then off into the sky. Amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, glad I could entertain you. Now, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! You\u2019re hurting. So you need to stretch.\u201d Trina got serious. She led me through a bunch of exercises that did work the kinks out of my knotted leg and thigh muscles.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start slow and then you can put on some speed if you feel like it. I know you vamps\u2014you can run really fast if you want to. I hope you won\u2019t just leave me in your dust, though. I hate it when vamps do that. It makes me feel so inadequate.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t wait till Ian makes me a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I sat on a bench and patted the seat beside me. \u201cSit down for a minute, Trina. I want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really should go. We\u2019re already warmed up.\u201d She jogged in a small circle.</p> <p>\u201cWe can get warm again. Sit.\u201d I pulled her down. \u201cNow, listen. About becoming a vampire . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s so fantastic. Ian says you\u2019re over four hundred years old and look at you! You could pass for under twenty-one anywhere. I bet you\u2019re carded all the time in clubs.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cGet a grip, Trina. They don\u2019t card anyone in a vampire club and I wouldn\u2019t bother going to a mortal one because I can\u2019t drink alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chocolate martinis? No lemon drops?\u201d Trina smiled. \u201cI may be a bit of a fitness freak, but I do like my cocktails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget cocktails. Alcohol and vampires don\u2019t mix.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cListen carefully now, Trina. Yes, I\u2019ve lived that long and, no, I\u2019ve never aged. I\u2019ve never had children either. That part of you dies along with the rest of you when you\u2019re turned vampire. Ian explain that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Trina got a thoughtful look. \u201cBut I probably wouldn\u2019t be a good mother anyway. I can\u2019t even keep a plant alive. And if I had kids first, then turned vampire, I\u2019d either have to make them vampire too someday or watch them grow old and die. That would be a bummer, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Valdez snorted. Bummer. A word you\u2019d use if your favorite TV program was preempted by a news break. Trina didn\u2019t have a clue how permanent this decision was.</p><p>Brittany was watching Ian\u2019s men, who were obviously too bored to pay attention to a conversation they\u2019d probably heard a thousand times. How many of these mortals had Ian used? And how many had actually made it to immortality? A quick romp through Thing One\u2019s mind alarmed me. These mortals were disposable. Trina wasn\u2019t about to get to the exalted level of vampire. When she started slowing down on the track or became too whiny for Ian\u2019s taste, she\u2019d be discarded, passed around among the guards at playtime, and they didn\u2019t care if she accidentally got drained dry.</p><p>Unfortunately, this was a common mind-set among old-school vamps. Damn. And here I thought Ian had evolved along with his love of technology.</p><p>No way could I yell, \u201cRun!\u201d right here in front of the guards. But, before I was done with this program, I was going to have to figure out how to get her away from Ian. I was afraid the good old whammy wasn\u2019t going to be enough. If Trina was a true vamp groupie, she\u2019d just go home to an apartment painted black with the usual shrine to all things vampire and begin her obsession all over again. And Ian would know where to find her too.</p><p>\u201cTrina, don\u2019t you like to eat?\u201d I trotted out what I missed most about being mortal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vegan. Not much joy in eating anymore. I can\u2019t bring myself to eat anything with a face. And now I\u2019ve read that even plants have feelings. Doesn\u2019t leave much that doesn\u2019t make me feel guilty.\u201d Trina got up again. \u201cYou won\u2019t talk me out of this, Glory. I\u2019m determined.\u201d She started moving in that stupid circle again. \u201cCome on. Get up. We need to get started. You\u2019re going to run like the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not even in breeze mode tonight, so let\u2019s just do what we need to, so I can get down to my ideal weight.\u201d I knew a dead end when I hit one. I groaned as I got up and started off after her. She\u2019d picked a trail through the trees that was well lit. We were followed by our two men, one woman and a dog, a real pack.</p><p>She might be a dim bulb, but I had to admire Trina\u2019s stamina. She was in great shape for a mortal. She kept a steady pace and basically ran a marathon with me beside her. I never heard her complain. No, she just listened to me whine when we hit an artificial hill that some demon of design had decided would challenge the runners in this park. And we ran the five-mile course a total of four times. So I saw that hill four times. I hated it. Finally we were both panting and starting what Trina called cooldown. She\u2019d obviously studied at the same school of torture that Bill the trainer had.</p><p>\u201cStretches and slow walking to finish this off, Glory. Then we can go back to the hotel.\u201d Trina was glowing with the effects of our run. She obviously loved this stuff. A real twisted sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea, Glory.\u201d Valdez was panting some himself, and he smelled like a wet fur rug.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I leaned over and held on to my quivering knees.</p><p>\u201cWe jog right into the lobby of the hotel. The paparazzi will love it. You out for a run surrounded by bodyguards. Maybe you even stop and give them a quote. Something to make them look forward to your appearance on the red carpet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad idea, V.\u201d Especially since I wasn\u2019t sure I had the energy to shift again. I straightened slowly. Thank God my stomach didn\u2019t hurt as badly as it had when we\u2019d begun. Maybe because my feet had taken over first place in the pain game. Loved my new running shoes. They were cushiony, advertised as walking on pillows of air. Well, after twenty miles my pillows had gone flat and each step felt like the Devil himself was using a pitchfork on my soles.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take my picture. How do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ve been working out.\u201d Trina brushed my hair out of my eyes. \u201cHere.\u201d She pulled a hand towel off the belt holding her fanny pack at her waist. \u201cWipe off your face and get rid of the rest of the lipstick your friend planted on you.\u201d She grinned. \u201cNow I have hope, sweetie. A little something goin\u2019 on there? Even I have to admit Flo\u2019s hot. Think she\u2019ll ever want to do Ian\u2019s program? Not that she needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother denying anything. Whatever kept Trina off of me worked right now. I carefully blotted my face with the towel. \u201cYou got a hairbrush in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Here. Or do you want me to do it for you?\u201d She playfully held it up.</p><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d I grabbed it and got to work. \u201cVamps always have to work without a mirror, you know. Another reason not to go there. You can\u2019t imagine what a horrible challenge it is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t talking me out of this, Glory.\u201d Trina used the same towel on her face, inhaling my sweat in a way that made me want to hurl.</p><p>When I was satisfied that I\u2019d done all I could do to make myself camera worthy, I handed the things back to Trina and we headed out. No leash for Valdez, but that was no big deal. As we got near the entrance to the hotel, I could see the usual limos and waiting taxis in line. Then the flashes started.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Glory St. Clair! Glory, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>I stopped, my band of brothers and sisters right behind me. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out. I\u2019m determined to look good for the red carpet. Be sure to look for me at the Grammys, fellas. And watch for me on the reality show Designed to Kill.\u201d I named the network and the air times. \u201cBig surprises coming and Israel Caine will be on there with me!\u201d I nodded and we all moved out, as coordinated as a high school drill team.</p><p>Inside, I headed for the elevators but Trina stopped me. \u201cNope, let\u2019s go for broke. We take the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe suite\u2019s on the twenty-third floor!\u201d I wailed. Yep, wailed. What can I say? This was like the last straw. But Trina just smiled and pointed to her neck, then waved her wrist under my nose. Oh, yeah, the best was yet to come. I was going to lose big. And if we climbed those stairs . . .</p><p>So we climbed. Twenty-two freakin\u2019 flights. By ten I was ready to ride Valdez but realized that was cruelty to animals. Oh, yeah, right. He isn\u2019t an animal, not of the four-legged variety anyway. See? I wasn\u2019t even thinking straight at that point. I was crawling by the time we made it to the door of the suite. I handed my key card to Brittany and she let us in.</p><p>Flo and Ian were playing cards. Cards! I wanted to smack both of them.</p> <p>\u201cFeed me,\u201d I croaked. At least I\u2019d quit sneezing. No energy for it.</p><p>\u201cShower first. You\u2019ll feel better and it\u2019ll work just as well.\u201d Ian was absolutely chirpy.</p><p>\u201cValdez, toss him off the balcony.\u201d I staggered toward my bathroom, but stopped and turned. \u201cFlo, is Nathan here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re the only ones home.\u201d Flo gathered up some bills. Obviously they\u2019d played for money.</p><p>\u201cTrina, you can shower in the other bathroom. Put on one of the shirts in the closet there. Nathan won\u2019t notice. He has fifteen identical white button-downs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Glory. I\u2019ll be sweet and clean for your feeding.\u201d Trina smirked at Flo. \u201cGlory loves to take from me. It\u2019s very . . . erotic.\u201d She danced off toward the other bedroom accompanied by Flo\u2019s Italian curses. Danced. Like she hadn\u2019t just run twenty miles and walked up those flights of stairs.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right, Glory?\u201d Flo hurried to my side. \u201cYuck, you\u2019re sweating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was rough but I survived.\u201d I sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m disgusting. Finish your card game. See if you can win back the fee for my weight-loss program.\u201d</p><p>Ian moved into the doorway. \u201cNot going to happen. I never bet that much.\u201d He touched my cheek. \u201cHurry up with that shower, Glory. You\u2019re very weak, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you hear a thump, Flo, come pick me up and wrap me in a towel. No one else sees my butt. Got it, pal?\u201d I knew I sounded loopy, but couldn\u2019t seem to stop myself.</p><p>\u201cGo, Glory. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Flo pushed me toward the bathroom. \u201cCall if you need me.\u201d</p><p>I shut myself inside the bathroom and stripped off my stinky clothes. Before I could think too much, I turned on the water and stepped into the shower. The hot water revived me enough to shampoo my hair and wash my body, but I got out quickly and pulled on one of the comfy robes the hotel provided.</p><p>I stopped with my hand on the bathroom door, reminded of the robes Jerry and I had worn at Chip\u2019s house. What was Jerry doing tonight? God, if he dropped by and found Ian . . . I picked my cell phone up out of the charger. No calls. That was either good news or bad. Good that Jerry hadn\u2019t left a message that he was on his way over. Bad that Jerry still wasn\u2019t speaking to me. One thing was clear. I needed to get MacDonald out of here as soon as possible.</p><p>I grabbed a towel and wrapped my wet hair in it, then headed to the bedroom but only made it as far as the bed. Exhaustion hit me right between the eyes. So . . . tired. A knock on the door interrupted the first sleep I\u2019d had in what seemed like forever.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I opened one eye.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Glory. I\u2019m here for you,\u201d Trina sang as she opened the door. She wore one of Nathan\u2019s shirts and her shorts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do the feeding now. Ian says the effects of our run are fading fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, come here and give me your wrist.\u201d I pushed myself up and shoved a pillow behind me.</p><p>Trina frowned as she was quickly stepped inside, Brittany on one side of her and Flo on the other. Obviously this wasn\u2019t going to be the fun and games the mortal had imagined.</p><p>\u201cSit on the side of the bed. Do not touch Glory.\u201d Flo pushed Trina down and then came around to sit on my other side.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m a willing donor. I don\u2019t deserve to be treated this way.\u201d Trina looked from Flo to Brittany. \u201cGlory, tell them. You and I get along fine. We don\u2019t need them around while we do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Trina. I\u2019m fine with them here. Now, please your master and me, and be quiet. I need this.\u201d I took her wrist and inhaled the delicious scent of mortal blood thrumming under her warm skin. Then my fangs were in and I took her life force. I immediately knew this was something special. My heart raced and my toes curled. Not only curled, but my aching feet actually quit aching. Wow.</p><p>I drank greedily until Flo\u2019s hand squeezed my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEnough, Glory. I don\u2019t like this mortal, but you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out and licked the punctures closed. Trina\u2019s eyes were shut and her face was deathly pale. What had I done?</p><p>\u201cTrina?\u201d I touched her cheek and her eyes popped open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Glory.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI love it when you do that. Lose your mind. It\u2019s so . . . orgasmic. Is it like that for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut! I do not have to listen to this.\u201d Flo jumped up and grabbed one of Trina\u2019s arms, then pushed her at Brittany. \u201cRemove her.\u201d Flo turned her back on Trina\u2019s squeal of outrage as Brittany picked her up and hauled her to the door.</p><p>\u201cGlory, don\u2019t let them treat me this way!\u201d</p><p>Brittany clapped a hand over Trina\u2019s mouth and shut the door with her foot before I could answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what this person does for you, Glory. Is better to take from a stranger than to have to deal with all this garbage. I should have let you drain her dry. We toss her skinny ass off the balcony. Eh?\u201d Flo frowned when we heard one last Trina screech from the other side of the closed door.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Flo. You sound\u201d\u2014I bit back the word, but I was thinking jealous\u2014\u201clike you never had a mortal pet before. Didn\u2019t you once live with a group of vampires who kept mortals with them like that? I\u2019ve heard your stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it never ends well.\u201d Flo sighed and settled back on the bed beside me. \u201cThey either want to be vampires or someone drinks too much and they end up dead. I\u2019m over all that. It\u2019s better to hang out only with vampires. No complications like that podista.\u201d She waved toward the living room and Trina.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. \u201cSpeaking of complications. Here\u2019s one. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s Ian. Come in.\u201d I sat up straighter, making sure my robe was closed up to my neck.</p><p>\u201cGlory, how are you feeling now?\u201d He glanced at Flo, then came closer.</p><p>\u201cBetter. The feeding from Trina was fantastic. But the workout was brutal. She even made me climb the stairs!\u201d I felt Flo\u2019s hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cShe goes too far, Ian. You should fire her scrawny butt.\u201d Flo winced when I glared at her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just doing her job, Flo.\u201d I turned back to Ian. I knew he didn\u2019t \u201cfire\u201d mortals; he terminated them. \u201cDon\u2019t fire her. She\u2019s great. Couldn\u2019t have done all that work without her encouragement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet dressed and let\u2019s do your weigh-in, then. I know you\u2019re anxious to see the results.\u201d Ian and Flo exchanged looks. \u201cAs for Trina, I\u2019ve sent her home. She won\u2019t be causing any more scenes. She needs to learn her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeigh in. I can\u2019t believe I almost forgot that part.\u201d I hopped out of bed. \u201cI\u2019ll get dressed, but, Ian, I mean it. Trina\u2019s just enthusiastic about her job. I can deal with it. Don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want Ian to think it was time to get rid of Trina altogether.</p><p>\u201cI apologize if I gave you the impression I was going to get rid of Trina.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe needs to learn restraint, but if you\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d Ian gestured for Flo to precede him. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more forgiving than I would be, Glory. I just hope this is worth it for you.\u201d Flo slid past Ian. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was already a size I like when I was turned, signore. This program of yours is very complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut are you totally satisfied with all aspects of the vampire life, my dear?\u201d Ian closed the bedroom door but I could still hear his smooth voice. \u201cI have other products you might be interested in, Florence. Products very easy to use but with great potential for enhancing your pleasure. Let me tell you about some of them.\u201d</p><p>I really didn\u2019t like the idea of Flo succumbing to one of Ian\u2019s sales pitches. Did she crave sunlight? Was her current favorite lipstick color a clue? Tahitian Sunrise, not Sunset. And what other products did he offer? Flo\u2019s always really been into sex. If Ian had something comparable to the Vampire Viagra that the Energy Vampires sold, she\u2019d be all over it.</p><p>Well, I couldn\u2019t worry about that now. Besides, Flo had a strong husband to rein her in if necessary. Yeah, right. Richard would have as much luck reining in a herd of rampaging were-hyenas during a full moon. Trust me, those guys will not be herded. I was smiling as I checked out my closet and decided to put on exactly the same outfit that I\u2019d worn when I\u2019d first gone out to Ian\u2019s. It would be perfect for a weight comparison. I didn\u2019t bother with shoes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I stepped into the living room, Flo was going over a slick brochure. When she saw me, she quickly tucked it into her purse. Hmm. So she was thinking about getting into some of Ian\u2019s goodies. I wish I honestly believed they were 100 percent safe. But the roller-coaster ride his supplements had taken me on didn\u2019t exactly inspire a testimonial, and Flo knew that. Her decision. Still, I\u2019d have felt better if she\u2019d tossed the brochure into the trash can.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d I gestured toward the powder room where Nathan had set up my scale. It was going to be a tight squeeze to get both Ian and me in there. No way was Valdez going to fit too. He wasn\u2019t going to like that.</p><p>Ian picked up his clipboard. \u201cIt\u2019s also time to measure you again.\u201d He looked in the bathroom. \u201cAfter I weigh you, we can do that in the bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Actually, I couldn\u2019t wait to see how many inches I\u2019d lost. My jeans now bagged in the seat, and the T-shirt was loose. Hell, even my bra cup didn\u2019t have overflow anymore. I was on cloud nine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not closing that bathroom door.\u201d Valdez stood in the doorway. \u201cNo one will be able to see your freakin\u2019 weight, Glory. I\u2019ll stand guard out here, back to the scale. Will that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Do what you have to, just don\u2019t look.\u201d I turned to Ian. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d I stepped on the scale. I watched breathlessly as Ian adjusted the weights. It took so long I finally closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you can look now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I jumped off the scale and straight into his arms. I planted a kiss on his lips that sent Valdez into a growling fit. Tough. I was grateful.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Glory.\u201d Ian set me down between him and my bodyguard. Brittany was now there too in case V needed backup.</p><p>I reached back and slipped the weights to zero, then wiped at my eyes. \u201cI lost eight more pounds!\u201d I leaned down and hugged Valdez next. \u201cCan you believe it? That\u2019s a total of\u2014\u201d My mind went blank.</p><p>\u201cThirteen pounds.\u201d Ian wrote on his chart. \u201cI think it\u2019s time you went shopping, Glory, for smaller sizes. Good thing Florence is here. She says she\u2019s an expert shopper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, he\u2019s right. Your pants are falling off of you. Your butt\u2019s gone.\u201d Brittany hugged me next. \u201cFlo, quit reading that stuff and come see. Glory\u2019s shrinking right before our eyes!\u201d</p><p>I heard a squeal, then I was enveloped in a hug that made my lungs hurt. Trina\u2019s feeding had helped me a lot, but didn\u2019t have the power a healing sleep would have. I still felt my stomach muscles, and every step reminded me I had painful issues with my feet.</p><p>Ian smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve been an excellent client, Glory. Despite a few glitches, your weight loss has been truly remarkable. I should have asked you to do a video diary for me.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cNo thanks, Ian. From what I saw of Sarah\u2019s, those things are, uh, a little too revealing.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cToo late for that now anyway. But look, I have a little gift for you. And you too, Florence.\u201d He walked over and pulled what seemed to be two thin white laptops out of his bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d I took one and Flo the other.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like computers, Ian. Since Richard has learned to work with them, that\u2019s all he wants to do. Google, Google, Google.\u201d Flo made a face. \u201cI hate this Google man.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t too excited about a computer either. I used one for my business. \u201cFlo, Google\u2019s not a man; he\u2019s a search engine.\u201d</p><p>Flo gave me a blank look.</p><p>Ian grinned. \u201cJust push the button and open it, Glory. You\u2019ll see, Florence. You\u2019ll love this.\u201d</p><p>I pushed a button and the thing popped open. It looked like a regular laptop but without the keyboard. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTurn it on here.\u201d Ian pushed a red button. \u201cHold it up like this. Now look into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow!\u201d It was like looking into a mirror. I showed it to Flo. \u201cCheck it out, Flo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. Che bella, eh, Glory? Why didn\u2019t you tell me I have lipstick on my teeth?\u201d She began scrubbing with her finger. \u201cYou made one of these for me?\u201d She held it up and smiled. \u201cI love it! How you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically a webcam with a high-resolution color monitor.\u201d Ian popped the other one open and handed it to me since clearly Flo wasn\u2019t letting go of the one she had. She\u2019d pulled out her makeup bag and went to work on her eyeliner.</p><p>I smiled at my video and it smiled back. Cool. This was a serious breakthrough and I was temporarily mesmerized. I\u2019d already realized Ian was brilliant, but he\u2019d just moved up to idol status in my book. I tore myself away from myself and carefully closed the thing.</p><p>\u201cThis is an amazing gift. I don\u2019t get it, Ian. First all this personal attention and now this. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Glory. Mr. Caine paid for first-class service. That\u2019s what you\u2019re getting. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be used to it.\u201d Ian just kept smiling.</p><p>\u201cSure I am.\u201d Yeah, right. \u201cBut this\u201d\u2014I hugged my new toy\u2014\u201cis way more than service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you, Glory. And I figure your success is going to bring me more business when your vampire friends see you on TV at the Grammys. Consider this a thank-you gift.\u201d He nodded toward Flo, who\u2019d moved on to renewing her lipstick. \u201cMy products are expensive and I cater to an affluent clientele. It\u2019s clear that\u2019s the kind of company you keep. Just spread the word that you were satisfied with my program and I\u2019ll be more than repaid for that bit of nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call this nonsense?\u201d Flo finally shut her \u201cmirror\u201d gently. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastico! I must have at least two more. No, make that three. Can I order them in colors?\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes glowed as she pulled out a credit card. \u201cPlease, signore, tell me you will sell me more.\u201d</p><p>Ian winked at me as if to say his marketing ploy was paying off already, then began to answer Flo\u2019s questions. After taking her order and measuring me (inches gone everywhere\u2014wow!), he and his minions finally left and I went to put my \u201cmirror\u201d in a safe place. I also sighed with relief we\u2019d made it through without Jerry showing up. Where was he, though? Plotting Ian\u2019s takedown? And was he staying away because he was too busy or still furious with me for consorting with his enemy?</p><p>I sat on the side of the bed and stuffed my poor feet into high heels, biting back a scream. I couldn\u2019t let Jerry kill Ian. Not after the MacDonald genius had helped me lose an incredible thirteen pounds! Too bad that once I got off Ian\u2019s stuff, those pounds would be right back where they thought they belonged.</p><p>Damn. Three days until the red carpet and the Grammys. I opened Ian\u2019s \u201cmirror\u201d and tried to see as much of myself as I could. God, I loved this new body. What if I wanted to keep it permanently? Yeah, right.</p><p>I looked at the bottles of supplements Ian had left for me. They scared the hell out of me. Exercise, dangerous nightmares, sleepwalking and who knew what effects from this new brew he\u2019d given me to try. Could I abuse my body like that forever? And how much would a maintenance program cost me? I was an independent working girl who planned to break up with one rich man and had probably already burned her bridge with another one.</p><p>Oh, and if that Campbell guy managed to kill the MacDonald one? Then the vamp magic for weight loss would die with him. Now, there was a reason to end a feud if I ever heard one. I needed to call Jerry and do something to rebuild that bridge. But what? This was one problem that I was afraid even my sexiest moves couldn\u2019t fix.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cI canceled my workout session with Bill. I decided I don\u2019t need it after that run with Trina.\u201d I headed for the elevators with Flo.</p><p>\u201cSo right, girlfriend. It was never a good idea. What\u2019s that kind of thing going to get you?\u201d She punched the down button. \u201cPain, you said. Ian\u2019s program is working. That\u2019s all you need.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much weight you lost so fast. We celebrate. Buy you something pretty. My treat.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened and we both jumped back. Jerry and Richard stood there and neither of them wore happy faces.</p><p>\u201cAmante!\u201d Flo moved first, pulling Richard out of the elevator car and into the hallway. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got your message. What the hell are you doing tackling Ian MacDonald on your own?\u201d He looked up and down the hall like he was checking for lurking MacDonald guards to take down.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t on our own, eh, Valdez, Brittany?\u201d Flo waved her hand at my two guards. \u201cAnd, as you can see, we\u2019re perfectly fine. Glory had her treatment and we\u2019re on our way to shop. Look at her. Isn\u2019t she tiny?\u201d</p><p>Richard did look but didn\u2019t seem overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cForget shopping. We need to talk.\u201d Jerry took my arm and pulled me toward the suite.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that my line?\u201d I jerked free. \u201cNo need to get physical. Why don\u2019t we start over? You say, \u2018Hi, Glory. How are you?\u2019 I answer, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll live. But, gee, Jerry, last time we saw each other you practically called me an idiot. Then you didn\u2019t bother to call, just showed up here and started throwing your muscle around. What\u2019s the deal?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry if you don\u2019t like my approach, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry glanced at Richard, who\u2019d obviously sent him a mental warning that this approach wasn\u2019t too swift either.</p><p>I just stood there, tapping my aching toe and waiting for him to get a clue.</p><p>Flo studied her nails. \u201cIs this going to take long? Glory needs to try on some things for her new little size.\u201d She grinned at me. \u201cMajor fun, eh, mia amica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot more fun than standing here in the hall.\u201d I glanced at Valdez and Brittany, then back at Jerry. \u201cDo I have to ask you again? Guess so. What\u2019s the deal, Jerry?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, okay, look.\u201d He gently put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you. We have information on MacDonald that you should know. May we come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you asked like a gentleman, sure. This had better be good, though. I\u2019ve had a rough night.\u201d I used my key card and we all trooped back inside. Obviously shopping was out for now. And I really wanted to see what size I could fit into now. One look at Jerry\u2019s firm jaw and serious face, and I knew his information wasn\u2019t going to make me happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat was rough about it?\u201d Jerry was close beside me. \u201cDid that bastard hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, just made me exercise my butt off, literally.\u201d I turned around and showed him. \u201cTotally worth it.\u201d I wanted to scream when he barely glanced at what I\u2019d sweated so hard for. \u201cFine, so you don\u2019t care. Just sit. Tell us what you found out.\u201d</p><p>I collapsed in a chair on the opposite side of the room from Jerry. I didn\u2019t like his attitude. Maybe because I was afraid he was going to tell me something that would bring me down from my high. Can you blame me? Hey, I was feeling skinny and pumped from Trina\u2019s donation. It had been the best one yet, because we\u2019d both done all that exercise. For a moment I toyed with the idea of getting my own mortal pet. If I could endure a run and stair climb with one every night, I could at least keep off a few pounds . . .</p><p>I realized everyone was staring at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, guess I spaced. I\u2019m still pretty jazzed. I\u2019ve lost a total of thirteen pounds. Damn it, this time really look at me!\u201d I stood and turned around, showing off the way my jeans bagged and almost slid off my hips. I even lifted my T-shirt so he could see my rib cage. Yep, my ribs were almost showing.</p> <p>\u201cEnough, Glory. Richard, look away.\u201d Flo waved at me to lower my shirt.</p><p>\u201cRelax, darling. I know Glory is just a friend. This really is a remarkable loss in such a short time.\u201d Richard frowned. \u201cBut you know it can\u2019t last. Just like quick losses don\u2019t last for mortals. It\u2019s not safe either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that!\u201d I stomped my foot. Ouch.</p><p>\u201cWhether you want to hear it or not, it\u2019s true.\u201d Jerry leaned forward. \u201cSit down and listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit because my feet hurt. Not because you ordered me to.\u201d I sat. The guys sounded achingly like me talking to Trina earlier. She hadn\u2019t wanted to hear bad news either. Shit.</p><p>\u201cI found some of Ian\u2019s success stories. Men and women who were on his supplements and did his program.\u201d Richard pulled a small notebook out of his shirt pocket. \u201cDid Caine ever tell you what he paid for you to do this, Glory?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he just put it on a credit card.\u201d I heard Jerry and Valdez make a noise. \u201cI offered to reimburse him! But he wouldn\u2019t allow it. Valdez, you were there. You heard it all. Ray said he just wanted me to be happy.\u201d I arched my brow at Jerry, like maybe this was more than he\u2019d ever done. Which was a lie and mean-spirited but felt good anyway. \u201cBesides, we\u2019ll be on TV worldwide at the Grammys. It\u2019s publicity. Ray can probably take the cost off his income tax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be interesting for his accountant to deal with.\u201d Richard shook his head. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s ridiculously expensive. I know you couldn\u2019t afford it on your own, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs successful enough to support you and pay overhead with maybe a little left over.\u201d Richard smiled. \u201cYou forget. I helped you with your taxes for the shop last quarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I\u2019ve always worked for a living and never had much of a cushion. The fact that my ancient car had recently died meant that had to be my next big financial investment.</p><p>\u201cGet to the point, amante.\u201d Flo pulled out Ian\u2019s brochure. \u201cThe man\u2019s a genius. You should see some of the things he advertises. I\u2019m interested in trying some of them myself. Obviously he\u2019s not just, how you say it, blowing smoke. Look at our girlfriend Glory here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand that to me.\u201d Richard grabbed it. \u201cHe gave this to you, my heart?\u201d Unspoken was a \u201cHow dare he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cAnd I can get another if I need it.\u201d She snatched it back. \u201cNow, tell us what you have on him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Richard gave his wife a \u201cwe\u2019ll deal with this later\u201d look. \u201cHis program costs a fortune. Then once clients are hooked, they have to buy his supplements or the weight comes right back on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected that. Just like a mortal weight-loss program.\u201d I got up and walked over to the couch. \u201cLet me see the brochure, Flo. Does it say how much the supplements cost?\u201d I quickly found the price list and gasped. No way could I handle it on my own. I used all my willpower to keep from ripping the paper to shreds.</p><p>\u201cWas he telling the truth when he said I was the only one who had the weird reactions to the supplements?\u201d I tossed the brochure back to Flo.</p><p>\u201cYes, none of them had a problem with them. Just the price. So now 90 percent of them, except for a few of the very rich, are back to their starting weight.\u201d Richard looked me over. \u201cIan\u2019s got some bitter enemies out there, Glory. He isn\u2019t exactly up front about the cost of the maintenance program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t be. But it\u2019s pretty much the same way for mortals, isn\u2019t it? If you go on a special program, then go off, you usually gain what you\u2019ve lost right back, sometimes even more. At least vamps can\u2019t do that.\u201d I was defending him. I could see Jerry struggling to keep his mouth shut. But to hear me back a MacDonald had to make him insane.</p><p>\u201cFine. So you\u2019re okay with the fact that you\u2019ve been sucked into this, will look good for one event, then it\u2019s the old Glory, right back where you started.\u201d Richard turned the page in his notebook.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not okay. I\u2019m just realistic. So far all this drama adds up to exactly zilch as far as I\u2019m concerned. Time to go shopping, Flo.\u201d I turned to Jerry. \u201cUnless Jerry\u2019s got something else. Surely you don\u2019t expect me to join in your feud because of my disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m worried about you. And Richard asked me to come. So I came. Hear him out.\u201d Jerry crossed one leg over his knee and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cWe saw that video about Ian\u2019s sunlight drug. I tried to follow up on that too. To see if any vampires have tried it and lived to tell the tale.\u201d</p><p>Jerry and Flo leaned forward. Uh-oh. A lot of interest there. Well, why not? Maybe Ian could make it happen. But I doubted Jerry would ever be able to bring himself to trust a MacDonald\u2019s daylight drug even if a thousand vampires showed Jer their sunburns.</p><p>I glanced at Valdez. \u201cDid you find any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I took that to the Los Angeles Council. They were very interested in Ian\u2019s claims. They\u2019ll be calling on him to check it out.\u201d Richard narrowed his gaze on me. \u201cTell me about your nightmares, Gloriana. You\u2019re not sleeping when you should. That tells me you might actually wake up during daylight hours.\u201d</p><p>I waved my hand and kept the giant block to my thoughts firmly in place. \u201cDreams, Richard. It\u2019s kind of cool, even when they\u2019re scary.\u201d I smiled at Jerry. \u201cI dreamed your mother and Mara were burning me at the stake for being a witch. And you couldn\u2019t have cared less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019ll always care what happens to you, Gloriana, even when you\u2019re wrongheaded.\u201d Jerry looked at Valdez. \u201cDoes she move when she dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in her bedroom, Blade. I stay out here, guarding the door.\u201d Valdez had effectively avoided the answer without telling an out-and-out lie.</p><p>\u201cIan said she was sleep deprived.\u201d Flo spoke up. \u201cAnd during what he calls the \u2018death sleep,\u2019 she didn\u2019t heal like she was supposed to. What does that mean, Ricardo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t like it.\u201d Richard frowned, pulled out a pen and wrote in his notebook. \u201cHow do you feel now, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel great. I fed from a mortal who ran twenty miles with me and then we both climbed twenty-two flights of stairs. I\u2019ve lost all this weight and I\u2019m skinny for the first time in my life. Why wouldn\u2019t I feel great? Now, can we forget the third degree? Flo and I are going shopping.\u201d I jumped up. If Jerry wasn\u2019t going to apologize or do something to show me he accepted my decisions, then I was out of here. Instead he just kept frowning at me, like he thought my baggy pants and loose T-shirt were evidence of my disloyalty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you, girlfriend. We\u2019ll be downstairs in the lobby shops, Ricardo. You can come with us or wait here or go do your investigating.\u201d Flo stopped in front of Richard, who\u2019d jumped to his feet along with Jerry. She kissed his cheek. \u201cSeriously, amante. We just spent the evening with Ian and his thugs and no one got hurt. Valdez and Brittany? Can you back me up on that?\u201d Clearly Flo had decided to forget the incident with the pencil.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the man. Just a gut feeling. And his bodyguards are stupid, but no one tried anything we couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d Valdez dropped his leash at my feet, obviously figuring if Flo was all right with the pencil incident, then he wasn\u2019t going to mention it either. \u201cI\u2019m watching her with MacDonald, boss. Brit\u2019s got you on speed dial if we run into a situation where we need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call me immediately then.\u201d Jerry stepped closer and looked down at me. \u201cYour face is thinner, Gloriana. You look tired. Let me taste your blood again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But Ray checked it when we woke up and it was okay.\u201d I held out my wrist. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jerry\u2019s eyes darkened, then he pressed his lips to my skin. Finally, he took a taste, the pressure lasting only a moment. He pulled back and licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, you\u2019re fine. Better than.\u201d He leaned down as if he couldn\u2019t help himself and kissed me, then pulled me to him and held me tight as he delved deep and laid claim to my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I melted against him. I couldn\u2019t help myself either. This was Jerry, my Jerry, and I felt my usual response to his taste and his touch. Richard cleared his throat and we broke apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d Jerry turned and followed Richard out the door.</p><p>I looked at Flo. \u201cWell. I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s still mad at me or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s still mad, but he\u2019ll get over it. Go fix your lipstick, then let\u2019s go shopping. I think you can fit into a six, girlfriend. See if you don\u2019t.\u201d Flo pulled out her own lipstick. \u201cRichard\u2019s mad at me too. I have to work hard to bring him around because I want to buy something from Ian. The man\u2019s a magician, no? Look at you. And in just a few days.\u201d</p><p>By the time we\u2019d hit the boutique in the lobby and I\u2019d managed to squeeze into a size six (with spandex), I was calling Ian a freaking Houdini. I refused Flo\u2019s generous offer and made the clerk take my credit card instead of charging it to the room, coming up with a story about a surprise for Ray. Of course I figured my purchase was going to be leaked to the tabloids, but I\u2019d love to see \u201cGlory Wears Size Six\u201d hit newsstands.</p><p>I told Flo good-bye, then headed upstairs. My cell phone rang just as I was hanging up my new pair of skinny jeans. Caller ID said it was Jerry. I took a breath and answered.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I\u2019m outside on your balcony. Will you let me in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I closed the phone and headed out to see for myself. Brittany and Valdez were there. They\u2019d just turned on the TV and hit the minibar for some snacks, but obviously they\u2019d seen Jerry and were both waiting for their orders.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come in?\u201d I opened the French door.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come somewhere with me?\u201d Jerry signaled to Valdez. \u201cWe can leave the shifters here. I\u2019ll have you back before sunrise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, you want to go or not?\u201d Brittany was strictly on Ray\u2019s payroll. She didn\u2019t take orders from Jerry, just me or Ray.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll be fine. You two enjoy an evening off.\u201d I glanced at the clock. \u201cActually we\u2019ve only got about two hours. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d I looked up at Jerry. \u201cI have to be. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Another of MacDonald\u2019s supplements.\u201d His mouth firmed.</p> <p>\u201cNot just that. I have the reality show people coming right after sundown. I\u2019ve got to be up and ready to go as soon as I can.\u201d I smiled and touched his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why I did this. They\u2019re making my dress for the red carpet, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d He turned his head and kissed my fingertips. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you. Let\u2019s go. Feel like shifting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m still pumped from my feeding earlier. You should have seen me, Jerry. I was a real jock!\u201d I laughed and held my arms out to the cool night air. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust follow me.\u201d He shifted into a beautiful black bird, waited for me to do the bird thing and then took off.</p><p>We flew out and over smaller buildings and the park where Trina and I had run. We flew over streets with cars racing along under us. Finally we were in the hills above Los Angeles. Another empty house? Jerry\u2019s connections with the vampire council were paying off.</p><p>He landed on the balcony of the second floor, then swiftly changed back into his tall male form. I landed beside him and managed my own change with a speed that impressed us both.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting pretty good at that.\u201d He laughed and hugged me.</p><p>\u201cI guess the more I do it, the more confidence I get.\u201d I turned and looked out at the lights of Los Angeles. \u201cOh, this is beautiful. Where are we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother of Chip\u2019s investments. We\u2019re in the Hollywood Hills. This one comes fully furnished. We\u2019re in the master bedroom.\u201d Jerry stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cRight. Why do we always end up in bed together?\u201d I heard the bitterness in my voice. Well, it was true. Was that all we had? Sex?</p><p>\u201cSo we won\u2019t this time.\u201d He held out his hands like he wouldn\u2019t dare touch me.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. It\u2019s like we have to make a big deal out of just talking to each other. And when we do, it\u2019s a disaster. Like last night.\u201d I kept at least five feet between us. He looked too good to me and I couldn\u2019t blame it on Ian\u2019s supplement either. Jerry always looked good to me, damn it.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYes, last night was pretty much a bad scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He moved closer and smiled like he knew he could have me again with just a touch. \u201cBecause sex between us is always good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? We\u2019re right back where we started.\u201d I walked around the king-size bed and kicked off my shoes because my feet hurt, no other reason. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Go sit in that chair. Over there. Well away from the bed.\u201d Jerry pointed to a pretty sitting area in front of a fireplace. It had another one of those automatic switches that he flipped and we had a beautiful fire going in moments. He sat in a chair across from me. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what you\u2019ve been going through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the weight-loss thing.\u201d I was sorry I hadn\u2019t had time to put on my new skinny jeans, but I did have on one of my new clingy sweaters, size medium, thank you very much. The deep rose vee showed off the edge of the C-cup bra I\u2019d bought in hot pink with black lace trim. I absolutely loved it. Why had I turned down sex? I wanted Jerry to see this bra. All of it. Obviously I was certifiable. And, again, much as I\u2019d like to, I couldn\u2019t blame my lust on Ian\u2019s program. Having Jerry near me always messed with my thought processes.</p><p>\u201cTell me how MacDonald\u2019s deal works. What the supplements have been doing to you.\u201d</p><p>So I told him. About the nausea. And the dreams. Not about the sleepwalking or the sunlight, of course. The fact that my healing sleep wasn\u2019t working seemed to worry him the most.</p><p>\u201cAnd you say he\u2019s given you a new drug to drink when you wake up in the evening. You don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll react to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And now I was worried. What if I got sick and then had to be on camera? This was a big deal. I\u2019d get my first glimpse of what the designers had made for me and there\u2019d be that fitting. At least a makeup artist would be on set if I looked like hell after hugging the toilet. Only three more days till the Grammys. I couldn\u2019t quit now but . . .</p><p>\u201cGlory, is this really worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I knew Jerry hated my one-word answers, but he might as well get used to it. Hey, it was what he usually gave me.</p><p>\u201cI know I can\u2019t stop you, but I\u2019m going to warn you about something.\u201d He got up, squatted in front of me and took my hands. \u201cI told my father that the MacDonald heir is here. Da is on his way to help me take him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I jumped up. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. An ambush? That\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s cowardly. Not the Campbell way at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to the MacDonalds there are no rules.\u201d Jerry grabbed my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you. These men are the cowards. They\u2019ll lie and cheat and steal to get what they want. Ian knows you\u2019re a Campbell woman. Make no mistake about that. When Richard found out that no other vampire on MacDonald\u2019s weight-loss program got sick, I knew. This is his plan, Gloriana. He\u2019s hurting you to get to me. He\u2019s been trying to draw me out and it\u2019s working. But I\u2019ll not face him alone. I\u2019ll have the clan behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, stop! Don\u2019t do this. Call the laird back and tell him it was a mistake.\u201d I pulled my cell phone from my pocket. \u201cCome on. I can\u2019t let you screw this up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, for you.\u201d Jerry turned his back on me. \u201cI should let him poison you, wait until you go to your big-deal event with your rock star and have your picture made for all the world to see. Then after you\u2019re dead and I\u2019m mad with grief, then it\u2019s okay for me to take my men and drive MacDonald into the sea. Is that the way it should be?\u201d He spun and grabbed me, his hands biting into my shoulders. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! Are you listening to yourself, Jerry? Since when does poison work on vampires? Besides, you tasted my blood earlier. You said it was fine. I\u2019m not poisoned, am I?\u201d I offered my neck. \u201cDrink from me again. Take me to bed and let me show you how much energy I have tonight. I\u2019m feeling, hell, alive! More alive than I\u2019ve felt since the night you turned me. Ian\u2019s magic works, Jerry. Whether he\u2019s your ancient enemy or not doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does matter to me, Gloriana. I can\u2019t be with a woman who doesn\u2019t understand that.\u201d Jerry released me and stepped back. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d finally have enough of you. But mayhap it\u2019s come to pass.\u201d</p><p>My heart fluttered, then seemed to stop. Was I crazy? What had I just done? I reached for him but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to cozen me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I was, but I\u2019m not totally stupid. \u201cListen, Jerry. I get the feud thing. I do. I remember the stories your father told when I visited Castle Campbell. The MacDonalds did terrible things to members of your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d Jerry nodded, his lips firm.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure the MacDonalds tell stories about the Campbells as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d I could see logic wasn\u2019t going to work here. \u201cThis is the twenty-first century. Broadswords and cudgels are out; brains and computers are in. Can\u2019t you think of a way to take out Ian that\u2019s more subtle than a direct attack?\u201d One that hopefully would take more than three days to plan. \u201cYou\u2019d lose fewer men that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re making sense.\u201d Jerry actually stood still while I ran my hand up his arm. He wore a white silk shirt with full sleeves and a spread collar, a pirate\u2019s shirt. He\u2019d tucked it into black jeans and left it unbuttoned just enough to make me want to finish the job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUse strategy, Jerry, not just brute strength. Ian\u2019s brilliant. You\u2019ve got to give the man that much.\u201d I slid my hand inside the front of his shirt to tease his chest. \u201cHe\u2019s got all his inventions. He gave me a computer that works like a mirror. It\u2019s fantastic. Flo went nuts when he gave her one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s smart, too damned smart. He\u2019s fooled a lot of people with his tricks.\u201d Jerry looked down when he realized I\u2019d released his buttons and pulled his shirt out of his pants.</p><p>\u201cIncluding me, Jerry. Obviously. But I\u2019m willing to go along with him because it suits my purposes. I\u2019ve used him. So I\u2019ll look good for that big-deal event. That\u2019s all. And the rock star picked up the tab. So I\u2019ve used him too. Naughty Glory.\u201d I pursed my lips into a pout. \u201cBut seems to me you like it when I\u2019m naughty.\u201d Ah, he\u2019d lost his frown, was softening toward me. I glanced down. Well, not all of him was going soft.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana. You think I don\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d I took Jerry\u2019s hand and pulled it to the edge of my sweater. \u201cJust look at the new bra I had to buy, Jerry. So pretty. They don\u2019t make this in my old bigger size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are bad. You\u2019re trying to distract me with sex.\u201d He did push down my sweater, though, and looked his fill at the plunging bra. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I changed my mind. Is it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately. I can\u2019t remember why I was mad at you. I was planning to leave you here to find your way back by yourself. Or maybe send Valdez for you right before sunrise.\u201d He leaned down and pushed the bra down with his nose to trace my nipple with his fangs.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be\u201d\u2014I gasped as he sucked it into the heat of his mouth\u2014\u201cmean.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his eyes gleaming. \u201cI felt at the time that you might deserve it. Loyalty to the clan is very important to a Campbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Campbell, Jerry.\u201d I rubbed my breasts against his bare chest to take the sting out of that reminder.</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d He opened the bra and dropped it and the sweater on the floor. \u201cAh, they are smaller, but still very fine indeed, woman.\u201d</p><p>I unzipped his pants and wrapped my hands around his shaft. \u201cLarger and always very fine indeed.\u201d I dropped to my knees and kissed every inch of him while he groaned my name and pushed his fingers into my hair. I took him into my mouth while I stroked his sacs. Finally I ran my fangs the length of him, resisting the urge to drink from the vein throbbing where his thighs met his trunk. I wanted that vein more than anything, but remembered that I had to keep this weight off. Damn. Were these sacrifices worth it?</p><p>He jerked me to my feet and swung me into his arms. He carried me to the rug in front of the fire, where he gently laid me down and peeled off my jeans.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t let you do this to me, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I doing it to you? I thought you were doing it to me.\u201d I reached for him. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad idea. Totally doesn\u2019t solve the problem between us. But we have no willpower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He kissed me and ran his hands over my body. \u201cAre you sure you feel all right? I wouldn\u2019t cause you pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fine except for an ache\u201d\u2014I took his hand and pressed it between my legs\u2014\u201chere. Ease me, Jeremiah Campbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d He slid his fingers inside me, stroking me until my hips rose to meet his hand. Then he moved down to taste me, his lips and tongue working their magic as he found the place that always sent me over the edge too quickly. But I could go over the edge more than once, as he proved to me. He did drink from me there, settling in with his fangs and sending me mental messages of his love. He loved my taste, loved my ass, loved my, um, well, you get the idea. He\u2019s a guy.</p><p>Finally, he rolled me on top and lifted me to settle on him. I rode him and held his shoulders, his hands on my hips as we found our rhythm. He grinned and then stopped, just when I thought it was over for both of us.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d He stood while we were still connected, my legs linked around his waist to keep us together, and sat in the leather chair in front of the fire.</p><p>\u201cI want to check out these new, smaller breasts. Sorry, Glory, but I miss the larger ones. They had more bounce, more\u201d\u2014he cupped them in his palms\u2014\u201cheft.\u201d</p> <p>I feigned indignation and grabbed his ears to give them a twist. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re describing a new broadsword, you awful man.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI love my broadsword. If it were a woman, I\u2019d\u2014\u201d I kissed his mouth and began to move again. This position put a new pressure inside me and I quite liked it.</p><p>\u201cAh, Jerry.\u201d I leaned back, my hands on his shoulders again as I tried to keep it going. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop but I\u2014I . . .\u201d Spasms shook me as the climax built and he grabbed my butt to hold me tight against him.</p><p>\u201cGod, Gloriana!\u201d</p><p>I came apart then, calling his name.</p><p>We arrived back on the balcony with only minutes to spare before dawn. The suite was dark but I knew Valdez waited for me. I kissed Jerry good-bye, admonishing him to hurry back to his own hotel, then let myself in.</p><p>\u201cI see you made up.\u201d It was Ray who spoke from the dark, not Valdez.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Valdez?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Brittany will be back in a few. I sent them down to have a decent breakfast. They can\u2019t operate full strength on just junk from the minibar.\u201d Ray stood and walked over to lock the French doors. \u201cYou smell like sex. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Ray. That\u2019s how Jerry and I make up.\u201d I slid past him and headed for the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Ray stopped me. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing DeeDee again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour decision. Don\u2019t deprive yourself on my account.\u201d I realized that had come off pretty cold. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sorry if you were disappointed in your deal with her. Mortal sex is pretty tame compared to the vampire kind.\u201d I smiled and knew Ray could see it in the dark. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to find you a vamp girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped I\u2019d found one.\u201d He moved closer. \u201cDon\u2019t write me off yet, Glory. I can be patient. I\u2019m even surprising myself where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDawn\u2019s coming. I\u2019ve got to drink Ian\u2019s stuff before I hit the sheets.\u201d</p><p>Ray followed me into the bedroom. \u201cBrittany says you\u2019ve lost thirteen pounds. Let me look at you.\u201d</p><p>I faced him when he turned on the bedroom light.</p><p>\u201cWow! Look at you. Sexy-peekaboo-bra thing going on there. No wonder you and Blade . . .\u201d Ray shrugged. \u201cLet me see your butt.\u201d</p><p>I turned around, gasping when I felt his hands cup my bottom. \u201cHey! Watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching it. You look fantastic.\u201d He turned me around and hugged me. \u201cYou\u2019re one hot mama. I can\u2019t wait to show you off on the red carpet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Ray, I don\u2019t know how to thank you. Richard said this was really, really expensive. And you never paused one second when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Glory girl. I\u2019d do anything for you. Got it?\u201d Ray jerked off his shirt, stepped out of his jeans, then climbed into bed. As usual he was totally unconcerned that he wore only his underwear. \u201cNow, drink your stuff and put on your gown. I feel daylight coming and you don\u2019t have a minute to spare.\u201d</p><p>I did what he said, but, for once, I didn\u2019t feel the sun in my bones. At all. Weird. I drank Ian\u2019s potion, brushed my teeth, even cleaned my face and tried some of the free hotel samples in the basket next to the sink. Finally I slipped on the gown I\u2019d left hanging on a hook on the back of the bathroom door.</p><p>I heard the hall door open and close, then the TV go on. So that meant Valdez and Brittany were back from breakfast. There was a small window in the bathroom and I realized I could see light around the edges of the heavy curtains. Weird. Streetlights this high up?</p><p>I walked back into the bedroom and saw Ray dead to the world. Not moving. The death sleep, as Ian called it. And I was wide-awake. I went back to the window and lifted the curtain. The sun was coming up. I dropped the curtain and jumped back.</p><p>Holy shit. I was awake and it was daylight. What did this mean?</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cValdez, come here!\u201d I opened the door to the living room a crack. Of course Brittany heard me too. She was on her feet in a flash.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d She glanced at the morning light streaming in from the open curtains at the French doors.</p><p>\u201cClose the drapes!\u201d Valdez jumped off the couch. \u201cHurry. Glory, get back in the bedroom.\u201d He ran to my side. \u201cYou\u2019re wide-awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit, Sherlock.\u201d I managed a smile. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you said to me yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now I\u2019m wondering what the hell is going on.\u201d He glanced at the bed. Of course Ray hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d I sat on the edge of the bed, my side, and looked at Ray again. \u201cI should be out. Dead. Instead I\u2019m talking to you. Still alive. Unless this is a dream.\u201d I held out my arm. \u201cPinch me. Hard. But not hard enough to leave a bruise in case I don\u2019t heal again. I\u2019ve got that fitting tomorrow. I mean tonight. Guess my arms will show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie back. You\u2019re babbling.\u201d Valdez gave me a gentle headbutt. \u201cI can\u2019t pinch you, Glory. Paws, not fingers, right now. I put on jeans before I shifted this time, though. In case I have to carry you back to bed later.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cFigured it was better for our relationship to go for a little modesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d I was finally feeling the sun. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me later if we really had this conversation. Right?\u201d My eyelids started to droop.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He pushed his head under my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re still warm, not cool like you should be. I don\u2019t like this one damned bit. I wonder what would have happened if you\u2019d stepped into the sun out there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Might have fried.\u201d I yawned. \u201cTired. Hope . . . don\u2019t dream.\u201d</p><p>I was running. Down a beach. The water was a beautiful turquoise, but the sand felt hard under my feet, and hot. Ouch! I had to keep running, though. Couldn\u2019t rest because they were chasing me. The Campbells. They wore plaid and carried broadswords, old-fashioned cudgels and laptops. The laird screamed a battle cry, then threw a BlackBerry at me. It hit me between my shoulder blades. I staggered but didn\u2019t go down. Had to keep running.</p><p>\u201cTraitor!\u201d Mag suddenly appeared in front of me. She wore a beautiful gold dress and started posing for pictures. The paparazzi loved her and the flashes blinded me for a moment. Beside her, Mara, her breasts hanging out of a low-cut red dress, smirked at me. Mara\u2019s dress looked just like mine except hers was a size zero, mine a six. I\u2019d never get that skinny.</p> <p>Mag pointed at me. \u201cGet away from here, bitch! Forget the red carpet. Israel Caine will take Mara to the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBall? It\u2019s not a ball, old woman. You\u2019ve been reading too many fairy tales. It\u2019s the Grammys. Ray\u2019s going to win an award. He\u2019s up for best vocal by a duo.\u201d I dodged a printer, then caught a broadsword that missed me by inches. I used it to slash a G in the front of Mara\u2019s dress.</p><p>\u201cMy beautiful dress. You ruined it. You jealous commoner! No handsome man would ever want to be seen with you on his arm.\u201d Mara sobbed and Mag patted her back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, you know. You could weigh ninety-eight pounds and you wouldn\u2019t be thin enough for the tabloids, you chunky monkey.\u201d Mag screeched and ran, dragging Mara with her, when Ian MacDonald and his surfers scrambled out of the sand dunes and surrounded me. They faced off against the Campbells.</p><p>\u201cSend out the Campbell heir.\u201d Ian held me against him. \u201cWe have his woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHah! That\u2019s not my woman. My woman has curves! That one is all sticks and stones.\u201d Jerry tossed a monitor at my face and it burned my cheek. \u201cKeep her, MacDonald. Both of you can walk into the sun. It\u2019s what you deserve. Come on, Da. They\u2019re not worth the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, wait!\u201d I sat up. I held my hand to my throbbing cheek where I\u2019d been hit.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Glory, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t get to you soon enough.\u201d Valdez frowned down at me. \u201cI never thought you\u2019d get up again so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I got up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. And I wasn\u2019t there for you. Brittany was on her way out the door and threatening to tell Ray you stayed awake past sunrise. I followed her into the hall, trying to talk her out of spilling the beans because I knew you wouldn\u2019t want him to know.\u201d Rafe sat next to me on the bed. \u201cJust after I shut the door, I heard you scream. You\u2019d walked into the living room and a ray of sunlight hit you. It burned your skin.\u201d He pulled my hand from my face. \u201cShit. Guess it\u2019s true what they say about vampires. I don\u2019t care what MacDonald claims\u2014you guys can\u2019t handle the sun. That video was bogus.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. If I\u2019d made it all the way to the balcony . . .</p> <p>\u201cHow does it look?\u201d I gingerly touched my face. There was a raised blister more than an inch long and it hurt like hell. \u201cIt feels horrible. Bring me Ian\u2019s invention. I have to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll heal, won\u2019t it?\u201d He reluctantly got up and brought me the webcam. He did have on jeans, old worn ones that hugged his butt. No shirt or shoes, but I guess the fewer clothes the better when you\u2019re stuck in a dog body for hours on end.</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell hope so.\u201d I grabbed the \u201cmirror\u201d but Rafe put his hand over mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look yet. Let it heal first. You\u2019ve got to try to sleep again. I won\u2019t leave you for a minute this time. I\u2019ll stay right here on the floor next to the bed. You\u2019ll have to step on me to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair to you, Rafe.\u201d I teared up. This must be bad. \u201cI\u2019m looking anyway. I have to know.\u201d I turned on the device and peeked. Hideous. I had an ugly red streak down the left side of my face. Obviously the drapes had been open just an inch or two, but that had been enough to sear me. I probed the blistered skin carefully with a fingertip. How could I be seen on TV like this?</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d He stood and walked into the bathroom, returning with a tube from the basket of freebies there.</p><p>\u201cLike hell. I hope the TV show\u2019s makeup artist is genius enough to cover this if I don\u2019t heal in my sleep.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough.\u201d I hit the off button and shut the webcam. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAloe. I figure if you\u2019re reacting like a mortal these days, might as well try a mortal treatment. Smear some on and see if that takes the sting out.\u201d He held it out to me.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. Will you do it for me?\u201d I tried to think about the implications of what had just happened. I was staying awake during the day. Rafe thought Ian\u2019s video had been a fake, but MacDonald had warned us that direct rays of sunlight were dangerous. We could only watch the day from safely inside somewhere. Or, like Ian, from under a cabana.</p><p>Ray would love that. And now he\u2019d get the scoop. Rafe was charming, but Brittany was bound to tell the man who signed her paychecks about my early-morning adventure. Well, why not? As long as Ray had guards to keep him from sleepwalking into a fiery death, he may as well try the daylight drug. But would it work like it should? My diet drug had proved to be unpredictable as hell.</p><p>Now I was mad. I didn\u2019t sign up for this. I was just supposed to lose some weight. Why was this other stuff happening?</p><p>Maybe I should encourage Jerry and the Campbells to wipe Ian MacDonald and his weird supplements off the face of the earth. If Valdez hadn\u2019t been here . . .</p><p>I shuddered again and closed my eyes. Rafe\u2019s fingers touched my skin as he gently rubbed the ointment on my face. I sighed and relaxed against my pillow.</p><p>\u201cDoes that help?\u201d His deep voice reminded me that he was still in human form. He sounded slightly different, more growly, when he took on his dog persona.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks.\u201d I opened my eyes and saw his concern. Funny how his warm brown eyes could be looking at me from the face of a dog or bat or whatever, yet I always saw the same intense loyalty and caring there. I reached for his hand and squeezed his strong fingers.</p><p>\u201cListen, Rafe, don\u2019t let this come between you and Brittany. She\u2019s just doing her job. I know where her loyalty has to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she knows who I\u2019m loyal to. Always.\u201d Rafe set the ointment on the bedside table. \u201cBrit and I have different priorities. Our relationship amounts to nothing but some fun and games when we have the time, which is rarely.\u201d He shrugged, muscles rippling across his broad shoulders. \u201cI let that relationship get in the way of my job and it almost cost you your life, Glory. Maybe you\u2019d be better off with another bodyguard, someone who\u2019s more focused, more professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d I sat up and slipped my hand from his. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through too much together. Besides, I don\u2019t see how you can take any blame here. You had no idea I was going to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You got up before. I knew that and should have been ready.\u201d He got up and paced restlessly around the room, shoving his hands into his pockets. Oops, shouldn\u2019t have done that. Those jeans were barely hanging on. I forced myself to concentrate on what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cInstead I took advantage of Brit\u2019s night off. Invited her to hang out. If she hadn\u2019t been here with me, she wouldn\u2019t have seen you sleepwalking. Now you\u2019ll have to deal with Caine wanting to try MacDonald\u2019s daylight drug. Clearly I need to focus on what\u2019s important now. Brittany\u2019s a distraction I can\u2019t afford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fair. You deserve a life too, you know.\u201d And I\u2019m sure Brittany had been happy to hang out with this man who prowled around the room while I held my breath, hoping gravity would do a number on those worn jeans. Can you blame me?</p><p>He had the same handsome good looks of the Latin pop star who\u2019d stopped by the suite one night. Put a guitar in Rafe\u2019s hands and he could take over the South American market.</p><p>I was pretty sure that when both guards knew their vampires truly slept like the undead, they shifted into whatever form they liked for their mutual satisfaction. The very thought made me sigh. I realized Rafe had stopped pacing and stared at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepy yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I want you to quit beating yourself up over what happened tonight. You have a tough job, Rafe. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be glad when your contract is up and you can move on to something else.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to thank you enough for the five years you\u2019ve given me. I hope you know our friendship goes way beyond this bodyguard thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s been fun. And scary and, well, not dull anyway.\u201d He grinned, his dimples showing as he stopped by my side of the bed again. \u201cWith you I\u2019ve always felt like the straight man in one of those stoner films. Can\u2019t wait to see what crazy thing you\u2019ll get us into next, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, now. Surely I haven\u2019t been that bad.\u201d I hit his hard thigh.</p><p>\u201cNot always. Lately you\u2019ve been taking charge of your own life. Using your powers. Not letting guys like Blade or that boyfriend you had in Vegas take advantage of your good nature. High time, I\u2019d say.\u201d He stared at me, not smiling. \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Guess I\u2019m finally figuring out who I am.\u201d I\u2019d wasted a lot of years pretending I was a mortal who happened to have fangs and a liquid diet when I had the potential to be so much more. And a lot of years clinging to some old Glory ways that included dependency issues. Still had some of those. Which was why Jerry thought he needed to provide guys like Rafe for my protection. Lucky for me if today was an example.</p><p>Rafe stretched. \u201cYou need to sleep. And I wasn\u2019t kidding about being right here on the floor. It\u2019s no hardship for me. I\u2019m used to it. I may even sleep myself knowing you can\u2019t get loose and do yourself any more harm.\u201d He walked over to the door and turned the lock. \u201cI\u2019m locking you in. I\u2019ll hear you if you somehow get off the foot of the bed or over Caine on the other side and try to make a break for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow, you must really think I want to roam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want, Glory St. Clair. And that\u2019s a fact.\u201d His smile was a little off center, then\u2014boom!\u2014he turned back into Valdez the dog.</p><p>I pulled up the covers and snuggled down, desperate to sleep, to heal. Tomorrow night was going to be big for me. But I lay there for a long while listening to my bodyguard breathing on the floor beside me. The throbbing in my cheek reminded me why I needed him there. He did make me feel completely safe. I just wondered why Valdez had never shown up in my dreams. What did that mean?</p> <p>I woke with a jolt and took stock. No aches, no pains. Hey, I actually felt like the old Glory. Refreshed. Full of energy. A quick look in the webcam assured me that my face had healed. Yes! I ran to weigh in and had kept the weight off. Even better.</p><p>I shampooed my hair again and blew it dry this time. I knew the stylist for the show would do more with it, but at least it would be ready for her to work with. I sniffed the new concoction Ian had left and decided not to chance it. Maybe after the crew from the show left.</p><p>Ray headed out soon after he got up. More rehearsals and an appearance on a talk show. It had been tough getting even one gig, when some of Ray\u2019s competition were doing them nonstop. Most of the shows taped during the day and Nathan had been getting flack from Barry over that problem. I\u2019d had to listen to Ray\u2019s complaints while he got ready. I didn\u2019t mention the daylight drug. We were both in a hurry. That was my excuse anyway.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here, Glory.\u201d Barry\u2019s assistant, Bethany, rushed in, bringing the hairstylist and makeup artist with her. \u201cThirty minutes, people. This is so exciting. Glory, wait till you see the designs! You\u2019ll freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a good way or bad, Beth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll never tell.\u201d She giggled and rushed back out to the living room, slamming the bedroom door behind her.</p><p>I turned myself over to the two professionals, making excuses why I didn\u2019t want to look in the mirror when they were done. By the time I walked out to the living room, my stomach was knotted, but this time it was nerves and not from exercise.</p><p>My cell rang just as I was ready for the first fitting.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d I made a face at the exasperated producer who kept pointing to his watch.</p><p>\u201cGlory, are you coming out here tonight or do you need for me to come to you again? Ian can\u2019t make it, but I can bring the supplements with me.\u201d Trina sounded her usual happy self. \u201cI hope your friend Flo won\u2019t be there. She doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m in the middle of something.\u201d I looked at the producer. \u201cWhat time will we be finished here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, Ms. St. Clair.\u201d He looked significantly at my phone. \u201cDepends on how many interruptions we have to endure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here and make it late. Do your run first. I can\u2019t go with you. Too much happening here. Make it about four thirty. Got to go.\u201d I hung up and realized I could actually afford to lose a few more pounds before the big night. Sweet. I heard the producer clear his throat. \u201cI\u2019m turning off my cell now.\u201d I smiled. \u201cSo sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour thirty. Do you ever sleep?\u201d The makeup artist brushed some powder on my chin and forehead. \u201cGuess so. You\u2019re glowing.\u201d She smiled. \u201cGlory\u2019s good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, people, let\u2019s roll.\u201d</p><p>Zia swept in and looked me over. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you, Glory? Those are skinny jeans.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and felt my cheeks go warm. \u201cI\u2019ve been dieting, Zia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said. But you\u2019ve lost so much so fast.\u201d Zia put her hand on my elbow and turned me around. \u201cWhat\u2019s your secret?\u201d</p><p>By the time I\u2019d made a full circle, I realized they\u2019d started filming. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really hard. And I\u2019ve had a doctor\u2019s supervision.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, of course. There are many wonderful doctors in L.A., aren\u2019t there, Glory?\u201d Zia would\u2019ve raised her eyebrows but she\u2019d obviously been freshly Botoxed. \u201cI\u2019m sure our audience would love for you to name names. He\u2019s obviously very . . . skilled.\u201d She was smirking.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was a diet, Zia, no surgery involved. Isn\u2019t it time for me to see my dresses?\u201d I looked longingly toward the hall where I knew they\u2019d stashed the three designers.</p><p>\u201cCut. She\u2019s right. Let\u2019s set up for those shots.\u201d The director began issuing orders to rearrange the living room.</p><p>The plan was for me to look over each designer\u2019s offering, then try it on in the bedroom. I would emerge and there would be a fitting along with my overall impressions. It was decided that I would sit in a club chair in front of the balcony doors. Someone rolled in an empty rack to hang the dress and accessories on and naturally they brought in the dreaded mirror.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask a favor?\u201d I gestured for a producer to come over.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Glory? Do you need a water?\u201d The producer snapped his fingers and three assistants scurried to his side.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like the mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The producer looked puzzled. \u201cIsn\u2019t it big enough?\u201d He frowned at the group and they all groaned. \u201cWhere did you get this piece of crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that. It\u2019s fine, but it seems so clich\u00e9, don\u2019t you see? I\u2019d rather just look at the dress on the rack, try it on and feel it on me, then look into the camera and say what I think. Tomorrow night maybe we can bring Ray in to help with the final decision. I could do a kind of runway turn for him.\u201d I prayed Ray would do it. He\u2019d been hungry for media exposure. Maybe this would help make up for those lost opportunities on the talk show circuit.</p><p>Zia was suddenly interested in me again.</p><p>\u201cIsrael Caine would help make the decision?\u201d Her eyes lit up. \u201cDo whatever she says, Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLose the mirror. Hurry.\u201d The producer looked around to assure himself that everything was in place. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanie! You\u2019re up!\u201d an assistant yelled.</p><p>Melanie came rushing in with a garment bag and a large tote. She hung up the bag, then started unloading a pair of shoes, an evening bag and jewelry. Finally, she unzipped the bag and pulled out the dress.</p><p>I sat back and stared. Okay. For starters it was blue. I love blue. Good choice. Low cut. Another smart decision. Some kind of sheer printed material filled in the space between the breasts and formed the long sleeves. Strange, but I could deal with it. Then there were the gold beaded and embroidered shoulder pads, perfect for a linebacker who liked bling on his uniform. Melanie had obviously been inspired by the recent Super Bowl.</p><p>She\u2019d cinched in the waist with a wide belt with the buckle in the shape of a star. Okay, Ray is a star. Nice message but the belt was too big, of course. Gold stars marched down the front of the skirt to the hem. I figured this was designed to make me look taller and slimmer. I was going to try it on, obviously. But I wasn\u2019t sure about it. At all.</p><p>I smiled and commented on what I liked. Then Melanie carried it to the bedroom. An assistant helped me into it. It was too big everywhere. Yay! But that meant that my boobs were pretty well exposed and I had to go out for the cameras. Melanie started wringing her hands and muttering when I emerged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Melanie, but I\u2019ve been dieting. Obviously you\u2019re going to have to take it in a few inches.\u201d I hid a smile, not a bit sorry, as I held the front together enough for modesty.</p><p>The crew grinned when they realized they were going to have to bleep some of Melanie\u2019s comments.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you lost so much weight in four days. What kind of shit have you been smokin\u2019, lady?\u201d She flushed when she remembered I was the judge. \u201cUh, I mean, you look great. Wish I could lose that fast.\u201d She whipped out a pin cushion and started pinning. \u201cNo problem, I can fix this.\u201d More muttering. \u201cWhat do you think about the shoulder pads? I took a risk there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re, uh, different.\u201d I reached up and felt them. They crunched. What had she stuffed them with? Foam peanuts?</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cYou hate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I think they probably make my waist look smaller. And Ray will appreciate the star motif.\u201d I winced when she jabbed me with a pin under one arm. \u201cUh, I\u2019ll be letting him help me decide the winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow, Israel Caine. Maybe I need more stars.\u201d Jab, jab. Melanie wiped her eyes. \u201cDoes he like football? This was kind of an homage to the game.\u201d She pointed to the shoulders in case I didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>\u201cLoves it. Never misses a game on TV. He and the band are addicted.\u201d I smiled into the camera, then realized how that could be taken out of context and show up on a tabloid cover. \u201cTo football. Sports of all kinds, but they love football. We had a great Super Bowl party back in Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, bigger shoulders and your waist will look freakin\u2019 tiny by comparison.\u201d Melanie held out the shoulders and squinted at me. \u201cBut might be too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the designer.\u201d I had visions of having to turn sideways to get through doors. \u201cThanks, Melanie. Guess I\u2019d better get out of this and see what Butch has come up with now. Good luck.\u201d I picked up the skirt.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Melanie darted around in front of me. \u201cWhen the sleeves and bodice are tight, you\u2019ll see what I was trying to do with the sheer printed fabric.\u201d She sighed. \u201cOh well, just wait till tomorrow night. It\u2019ll be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d I walked carefully to the bedroom, pins stabbing me every step of the way. I did love the silver sandals that had a designer label and fit like a dream. The earrings and necklace were great too. I should have mentioned those things. Oh, well, I\u2019d do better for designer number two on the accessories. I got back into my clothes, my wonderful size-six skinny jeans, and headed back to the club chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Butch came in next. He was practically skipping, he was so excited, and I suspected he was on something other than just adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cGlory, oh, stand up, lady. Look at you. What have you done?\u201d He turned me around so the camera could get a good shot. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dieting, you bad girl. I\u2019ll have to take in this fabulous dress.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop grinning. \u201cAfraid so. But this is a big event for me, Butch, so I\u2019ve been working hard to get in shape.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can see that, girlfriend. So I won\u2019t mind taking a tuck here and there one little bit.\u201d He whipped the cover off his dress, then let me look my fill while he pulled out shoes, bag and accessories.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I was almost speechless. Butch had chosen black for me, my favorite color when I\u2019m trying to look skinny. Now that I was a six, I\u2019d look positively waiflike in it. Hmm. Not a bad thought. This black dress was made of a sheer chiffon over nude lace that plunged front and back. The thin straps were rhinestone. Too bad the whole thing looked like a naughty nightie for a circus elephant. My new, slim body would be lost in the yards and yards of fabric.</p><p>\u201cBlack is good. I have a lot of black in my wardrobe.\u201d I turned. Uh-oh. My lack of enthusiasm had crushed his spirit. \u201cLet me try it on. I want to feel how it moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Glory. Give it a chance. I believe it will make you feel like the beautiful woman you are.\u201d He carried the dress to the bedroom where he had a brief discussion with the assistant because apparently it was hard to tell the front from the back of his creation. I did like the way the dress felt. The fabric floated away from my body and rhinestone tassels dangled from the deep vee at the neckline and moved when I walked.</p><p>\u201cLove the shoes.\u201d I stepped outside and walked over to the windows. They were rhinestone sandals. \u201cAnd the bag.\u201d A vintage silver clutch that I would have liked to sell in my shop.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s huge on you.\u201d He sniffled and wiped his eyes, then pulled out some jewelry. \u201cI hope you like what I arranged for you to have from a famous Hollywood jeweler to go with the dress.\u201d Butch put a fabulous sapphire and diamond drop around my neck and matching sapphire earrings in my ears.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow!\u201d I felt like a princess. I really, really wished for Ian\u2019s \u201cmirror.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll definitely keep all this in mind. But, you\u2019re right\u2014it\u2019s too big, Butch.\u201d I held the blousy fabric away from my body. \u201cUh, everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take it in.\u201d He started rooting around in his bag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Butch. I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s new. Something I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He turned around, a giant pair of scissors in his hand, and aimed them straight at my heart.</p><p>A blur of fur flew through the air and knocked him on his butt. The scissors landed on the carpet a few feet away.</p> <p>\u201cHelp!\u201d Butch screamed when Valdez sat on his chest, growling and snapping an inch from his nose.</p><p>I held my breath, afraid my bodyguard was going to start asking questions. I grabbed the scissors.</p><p>\u201cButch, are you okay?\u201d Stupid question. The designer sobbed and had covered his face with both hands. \u201cValdez, no!\u201d</p><p>No one else in the room moved. Well, except for Zia, who\u2019d hopped on the couch and had pushed three assistants in front of her like a human fence. She held two of them by their hair.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I have a cat, Glory.\u201d She wobbled and almost went over the back of the couch.</p><p>I ignored her and her poor assistants\u2019 screeches of pain and pulled on Valdez\u2019s collar, but he wasn\u2019t ready to move. \u201cAnimal instinct, Butch. Valdez must have thought you were threatening me with these scissors. What were you going to do with them?\u201d</p><p>Butch finally peeked between two fingers. \u201cCan\u2019t . . . breathe.\u201d</p><p>Of course no one else had the nerve to get near Valdez, not when he barked and snapped again, this time drawing blood when his teeth grazed Butch\u2019s fingers. I felt my fangs swell and had to fight the feeling. So not the time for that. Too bad Butch had a tasty type. Down, Glory.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Butch wailed from behind his hands. \u201cHe\u2019s going to eat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone call 911!\u201d Zia clearly was antidog. \u201cOr animal control.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to give her a look that should have melted the lacquer off her manicured nails but had to admit my guy was overreacting. Please. Butch as vampire slayer? I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Zia. I\u2019m handling this. Seriously, do not call anyone. Or this show will not go on.\u201d I swept the room with an icy stare and heard several cell phones snap shut. \u201cThank you.\u201d I turned back to my problem child. I\u2019d already sent him a mental message to back off, which he\u2019d ignored. Apparently he wanted his TV moment.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Valdez, get off of him!\u201d I gave his collar a serious jerk.</p><p>\u201cOoo!\u201d The crowd was impressed when V stepped back. Of course he just had to put his foot down where it would inflict maximum pain and Butch shrieked, rolling to his side and into the fetal position as soon as he was free.</p><p>\u201cButch, the scissors?\u201d I finally noticed the red light that meant the camera was on. Of course this was too good to miss.</p><p>\u201cC-c-culottes.\u201d Butch whimpered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shoved Valdez behind me and knelt beside the designer.</p><p>\u201cI thought if I cut the skirt and t-t-turned it into culottes it would be f-f-fresh.\u201d Sob. \u201cAnd added a belt.\u201d More sobbing.</p><p>\u201cCulottes! Brilliant. Yes, I could go for those.\u201d I patted his shoulder and eventually got him up and on his feet. Camera still rolling. But someone would have to do some serious editing or this would end up a two-hour special instead of the usual hour show. It took two assistants to get Butch out to the hallway. Especially when he finally calmed down enough to ask for his scissors back. That request sent Valdez into another barking frenzy.</p><p>I passed them to a woman, obviously one of Zia\u2019s victims, whose ponytail looked a lot worse for wear. \u201cTell Butch to leave them at home when he comes back.\u201d I glanced at Valdez, who\u2019d managed to keep one of Butch\u2019s shoes and was ripping the sole off of it. \u201cPlease tell Butch to send me a bill for a new pair of shoes.\u201d I grimaced for the ever-present camera. \u201cValdez is usually so well behaved. I\u2019m thinking it must be something he ate.\u201d I frowned at V. \u201cWe\u2019ve been spoiling him. Ordering from room service. He needs a more restricted diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking a muzzle.\u201d Zia eased behind the couch when Valdez growled. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get a move on people. Where\u2019s the next victim\u2014er, I mean designer?\u201d</p><p>Darren strode in with his garment bag and a small suitcase. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of scared to come in here. Butch is out there crying and carrying on about how the dog ate his shoe and nearly took his arm off.\u201d He stopped dead when he saw me and frowned. \u201cWhoa, Glory. Didn\u2019t anyone tell you you\u2019re not allowed to change during the production of this show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grinned because he looked so serious. \u201cAnd, relax. Unless you plan to attack me, Valdez won\u2019t bother you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned back. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not that stupid. I know who\u2019s doing the judging. You\u2019re looking great, by the way. But you just blew my design all to hell. I\u2019m going to be up all night fixing this thing because the fit is very important.\u201d He sighed and hung up his bag. \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>I really wanted to like it because I liked Darren. But he\u2019d picked red. Now, I love red. But it had two strikes against it. First, I\u2019d had that nightmare and Mara and I\u2019d both been in red dresses. Second, and the real reason not to pick red, it\u2019s a red carpet. Hello? I do not want to disappear into the carpet. Or worse, be just a shade off. You know? You have to be contrasting or complementing the carpet, not part of the stupid thing.</p><p>The dress was beautiful. Red silk, again cut low because Ray had made a big deal about showing off my assets. The shimmer and shine almost made up for the color choice. And the way the dress would hug my new smaller curves would be a thing of beauty. Too bad I simply couldn\u2019t see myself in that dress. I said nice things, though. Loved the shoes and bag he\u2019d picked. And laughed when I found out that Butch wasn\u2019t the only one with the genuine jewels from a Hollywood jeweler. It was a deal with all the designers that they were on loan for the event.</p><p>Finally, we were done and the designers hurried back to their studio to do the alterations. The film crew was packing up when the curtains parted and a production assistant screamed.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that and where did he come from?\u201d The producer picked up a light stand like he was prepared to defend me from a cat burglar. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the dog attacking him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, folks. This is a friend of ours. We have adjoining balconies.\u201d I walked over and smiled at a glowering Jerry. Valdez was right beside me as he\u2019d been most of the night.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paid to think, Daphne. Just finish packing and let\u2019s get out of here. We\u2019re already over budget with all this night shooting. No more overtime this month. Got it?\u201d The producer shooed the group to the door. \u201cThanks, Ms. St. Clair. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow night for the big finish. Be sure Mr. Caine is here. Eight o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I crossed my fingers. I\u2019d have to make sure that happened. I hadn\u2019t even checked Ray\u2019s schedule yet. Finally the last of them left and I shut the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jerry, that was a dramatic entrance. You scared that poor girl to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cell phone was off.\u201d Jerry looked around. I had a feeling that any stray mortal would be sorry.</p><p>\u201cHad no choice. We were filming.\u201d I sighed and sat again, then kicked off my shoes.</p><p>\u201cStill hurting?\u201d He squatted down and picked up my foot. \u201cNeed a foot rub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t turn one down. But I actually healed last night. I\u2019m okay.\u201d I smiled when he massaged the ball of my foot. \u201cMmm, that\u2019s wonderful. Do the other one too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s those damned high heels.\u201d He switched feet.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they\u2019re sexy, aren\u2019t they?\u201d I wiggled my toes.</p><p>\u201cYes, but so are your bare feet.\u201d He dropped my foot and stood. \u201cAre you seeing MacDonald tonight?\u201d</p> <p>So much for the niceties. \u201cNo, just his mortal. She should be here in\u201d\u2014I glanced at my watch\u2014\u201cabout half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still drinking MacDonald\u2019s swill?\u201d Jerry paced around the piano, then walked over to pull open the drapes.</p><p>\u201cI drank the bedtime stuff, but not the new one he gave me for when I wake up. I was thinking of drinking it now.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and looked at me. \u201cDon\u2019t. Brittany gave Flo that syringe that Ian tried to use on you last night. Richard\u2019s having it analyzed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine, Jerry.\u201d I slipped on my shoes and stood.</p> <p>\u201cYou are? Why? Because everything he\u2019s given you has made you feel so fine?\u201d Jerry frowned at me. \u201cRichard took it to the Council here. They have excellent facilities on call and they\u2019re very interested now in MacDonald\u2019s operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because he\u2019s a MacDonald ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have killed you, Glory. You have no idea what the syringe might have held.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to yourself, Jerry? If Ian wanted me dead, I\u2019d be dead. Valdez knocked it out of his hand but, FYI, I wasn\u2019t going to let him give me a shot anyway.\u201d I sat down and stared at my bodyguard. \u201cAppreciated the gesture, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have killed him when I had the chance. All these reactions you\u2019ve been having to his shit, it\u2019s only going one way, Glory. Maybe MacDonald wants your death to look like an accident. You\u2019re heading for suicide by sunlight, lady. You know it and I know it.\u201d Valdez looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean?\u201d Jerry sat beside me.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to know the answer to that.\u201d Ray stood inside the hall door. \u201cBrittany told me you\u2019ve been waking up during the day. How is that happening, Glory?\u201d</p><p>I looked from Jerry to Ray and back again. Obviously I was going to have to tell them both about my sleepwalking or whatever you wanted to call it. One of them was going to start his \u201cKill Ian\u201d campaign and the other would rush out there and pay Ian a fortune for a chance at his own suicide by sunlight.</p><p>Oh, God, if ever there was a lose-lose situation, this was it.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with the bedtime supplement I take, I guess.\u201d I looked everywhere but at the men in my life. I was tired and my feet still ached. Jerry and Ray had opened bottles of synthetic blood. I\u2019d turned it down. Trina was coming. The fact that she\u2019d been my only source for the last few days made me feel rotten. I normally didn\u2019t drink from mortals, even willing ones. And I still had the problem of saving her from Ian. Treating mortals as disposable commodities didn\u2019t necessarily make Ian any worse than most vampires, though. Unfortunately.</p><p>\u201cGlory, are you going to talk or do you want me to just go on out there and see what MacDonald\u2019s selling?\u201d Ray was practically jumping out of his skin. Of course he was desperate to see the sun again. He\u2019d only been a vampire for a few months. Jerry and I had had centuries to get used to life after dark.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you, Caine.\u201d Jerry sounded like he was talking to an unruly schoolboy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t follow your orders, Blade.\u201d Ray pulled me up to stand beside him. \u201cAnd neither does Glory.\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cLook at her. Ian\u2019s formula works. She\u2019s lost the weight she wanted in record time. I\u2019d say he delivers on his promises.\u201d</p> <p>Jerry gave Ray a condescending look. \u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a lot of difference between losing weight and walking into daylight. Valdez, tell us what Glory did yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Valdez risked his job by looking at me before he answered.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, V, tell him. Tell him all the stuff I did when I was supposed to be dead to the world.\u201d I held Ray\u2019s hand because Jerry looked as approachable as a thorny hedge.</p><p>\u201cYou know she was having those nightmares. They led to sleepwalking. The first night I caught her as she was heading into the living room, eyes closed, obviously out of it. I shifted and carried her back to bed. She didn\u2019t wake up until her head hit the pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shifted.\u201d Jerry frowned.</p><p>\u201cHow else was he going to carry me, Jerry?\u201d This pissed me off. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got over this dog fetish you\u2019ve had for centuries. If you don\u2019t trust me around hot guys, then tough.\u201d I smiled at Valdez. \u201cYes, my friend, you\u2019re hot. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know that, the way Brittany hangs around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get back to this sleepwalking?\u201d Jerry looked like he wanted to smash the bottle he\u2019d just drained over someone\u2019s head\u2014there were several likely candidates, me included. Instead he set it on the bar, demonstrating admirable self-control.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want to hear about yesterday. When Brittany saw you wide-awake after sunrise.\u201d Ray dropped my hand.</p><p>\u201cI can tell this part. I was awake, you know.\u201d I cleared my throat, wishing I could drink something. No, couldn\u2019t do it, calories. So I faced the men, Jerry looking disapproving and Ray, eager, like I was about to launch into the tale of the century.</p><p>\u201cI watched you lie down, Ray, then I headed into the bathroom to brush my teeth. I took my time until I noticed some light coming in around the curtains in the bathroom. I checked and saw you conked out per usual.\u201d I glanced at Valdez. \u201cRafe\u2019s right. When we\u2019re asleep during the day, we\u2019re as good as dead. First time I\u2019ve seen that. Guess I never stuck around to watch you sleep before you made me vampire, Jerry.\u201d I shook my head. Stupid of me, to make the decision to become vamp without full disclosure. Hindsight. Not worth anything, was it?</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t let you. We\u2019re too vulnerable then. And in those days I still slept in a coffin behind a locked door in a hidden room in the basement of our town house or a cave in the country. I didn\u2019t want to scare you away.\u201d He frowned when Ray made a noise. \u201cYou have something to say, Caine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but not right now. I want to hear about Glory\u2019s experience.\u201d Ray sat on the opposite end of the couch from Jerry and leaned forward, his eyes on me. \u201cSo then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realized I was wide-awake and the sun had already come up. That\u2019s when I signaled to Valdez in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jerry frowned at my bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cTo talk it over, I guess. Who else am I going to call? You?\u201d I toed off my shoes again, stalked over to the club chair on the opposite side of the room and sat. \u201cAll my other friends are vampires. They\u2019d be dead that time of day. Rafe wasn\u2019t. Of course neither was Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShape-shifters. Lucky bastards.\u201d Ray frowned at Valdez. \u201cGlory, I\u2019m thinking whatever Ian\u2019s giving you at bedtime must be like what he\u2019s developed to get vampires out during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all that happened, though.\u201d Valdez settled next to my chair. Like we\u2019d drawn up sides. \u201cShe eventually got drowsy and fell asleep. I waited a minute to be sure she was out, then went to talk to Brittany.\u201d He nodded toward Ray. \u201cI knew Glory didn\u2019t want Caine to know about this daylight thing and tried to talk Brit out of telling him about it until we knew more. I was coming in from the hall when I heard Glory scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ray and Blade were both on their feet.</p><p>\u201cCalm down. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m okay. Crisis averted. See?\u201d I leaned back and crossed my legs, refusing to let them upset me.</p><p>\u201cWhat crisis?\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t sit down. Ray paced the carpet again, kicking my high heels out of the way.</p><p>\u201cHey! Watch the shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. So what happened, Glory?\u201d Ray finally stopped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell it.\u201d Valdez moved away from me. Like he wasn\u2019t going to use me for protection. \u201cShe apparently had another nightmare right away and walked back into the living room. We\u2019d shut the drapes when she stuck her head out the first time, but there was a sliver of sunlight. She stepped into it and burned her cheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Jerry slammed a fist into the palm of his other hand. I had a feeling he was imagining Ian\u2019s face there.</p><p>Ray came up and put his hand under my chin to inspect my cheek. \u201cLooks fine now. Makeup or did you heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI healed. Though Rafe put some mortal cream on my face too, as a precaution.\u201d I frowned at Ray. \u201cListen to me, Ray. I was burned by the sun. Do you see what this means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You can be awake, but you can\u2019t go out in it. He told me that when I went out to his place last night.\u201d Ray pulled me to my feet. \u201cDid you see the video he has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went out there without backup?\u201d I wanted to scream. He\u2019d left both paranormal guards with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m here, right?\u201d He sneered at Jerry. \u201cBlade\u2019s the one who\u2019s demonized MacDonald. The guy\u2019s not stupid; he\u2019s into this to make some cash. Killing off clients, especially someone high profile like me, would mean the end of his business.\u201d Ray smiled at me. \u201cI told Nate where I was going. In case something did happen out there. But I didn\u2019t tell you, because I know you don\u2019t approve of this daylight deal. Imagine, Glory. I saw Ian on the beach in front of his house.\u201d Ray\u2019s eyes lit up and he hugged me. \u201cI tell you, if I could do that, I could deal with this vampire thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real, Caine. You\u2019re going to have to deal with this vampire thing anyway.\u201d Jerry stalked over to the window and stared out at the night sky. \u201cSeeing daylight is a foolish dream. You think all of us haven\u2019t had it at one time or another? I lost a good friend who tried for it. The Energy Vampires have been working on it for years and failed. It\u2019s a fairy tale that\u2019s cost more than one vampire his fortune and his life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is the twenty-first century, Blade. You don\u2019t sleep in a coffin or a cave anymore. So maybe it\u2019s possible that MacDonald could have found a cure for the daylight problem.\u201d Ray let me go and actually had the stones to walk over to Jerry, close enough to get a face full of fist. \u201cYou\u2019re prejudiced against him because of his name, but that doesn\u2019t mean Ian isn\u2019t some kind of genius who could have figured this thing out.\u201d</p><p>Jerry smiled at Ray. That smile chilled me to my toes. \u201cFine. Rush out there and try MacDonald\u2019s daylight drug. The sooner the better. Good luck to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I ran over to step between the two men. I knew an almost death threat when I heard one. \u201cRay, this daylight experiment will have to wait. We\u2019ve already got more on our plate now than we can deal with. I\u2019m afraid I committed you to something without asking about your schedule first. I need you to be here tomorrow night for the taping of the finale of Designed to Kill. It\u2019ll be great media exposure for you. So can you please, please, please help me pick a winning gown for the red carpet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course he can. He\u2019s well qualified to judge a fashion show.\u201d Jerry stuck his hands in his pockets. To look at him, you\u2019d think he could judge one too. Tonight he wore designer jeans that had been scrubbed and bleached to a fine, worn look. Obviously more of Flo\u2019s shopping handiwork because Jerry didn\u2019t have a clue about style. He was more about comfort and tradition. Not that he ever looked shabby.</p><p>Tonight even his T-shirt was trendy. It stretched over his broad shoulders, showing them off in fine form. He could have fit in with a rock band himself if I didn\u2019t know he had the musical ability of a lump of coal. The thought made me smile. Until I saw Ray\u2019s face flush and his muscles tense like he was about to lunge.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Jerry. I know you\u2019re trying to pick a fight and I won\u2019t have it.\u201d I turned to Ray. \u201cWhat do you say, Ray? This will be great publicity. You can imagine how excited Zia was when I pitched the idea. Please tell me you can fit it into your schedule.\u201d I took his arm. \u201cYou know I value your opinion on what looks good on me.\u201d I sent Jerry a mental message to please cut me a break here. \u201cYou too, Jerry, but this is part of the Grammy thing. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d</p><p>Jerry glowered, obviously not ready to concede anything.</p><p>\u201cSure, Glory, whatever makes you happy.\u201d Ray slid his arm around my waist. \u201cWe also need to remind the public that we\u2019re engaged. After the taping, you have to come with me to a couple of parties. The big-deal pre-Grammy blow-outs. One of them is thrown by my record label. It\u2019s a command performance.\u201d He shot Jerry a superior smirk. \u201cThe tabloids have noticed we haven\u2019t been seen together lately. Time to show them we\u2019re still hot and heavy before the awards show. That we can\u2019t keep our hands off of each other.\u201d He ran his hand down to pat my bottom.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know who growled louder, Blade or Valdez. I eased Ray\u2019s hand back up to my waist. \u201cThanks, Ray. They had a mirror set up. Couldn\u2019t do that, could I? I had to distract the production crew so I offered you as a way to help make the decision.\u201d I looked at Jerry for signs he understood what I was up against here. Not a glimmer. He\u2019d slipped on a mask of indifference. What? This time when Ray pulled me closer and nuzzled my neck, I didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on me, babe. Besides, I want to show off you and your new body. You look hot. I\u2019m having a dress sent up from the boutique downstairs for the party tomorrow night. It\u2019ll work for the show too. The clerk there said you tried it on, but didn\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d I\u2019d tried on a ridiculously expensive cocktail dress for the hell of it, egged on by Flo. It was emerald green silk, short and flirty, with the kind of V-neck I loved and a belt to show off my new waistline.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an investment, darlin\u2019. It\u2019ll look great on the tabloid covers. When you wear it, they won\u2019t be able to say you\u2019re springing the baby trap.\u201d He kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo one reads that trash.\u201d Jerry strolled over to the couch and sat again. \u201cSeems a waste of time to pretend to be lovers when Glory is dumping your sorry ass the day after the Grammys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she? You sure of that?\u201d Ray picked up my left hand where I still wore his ring, the diamond flashing in the light.</p> <p>\u201cMillions do read the tabloids, Jerry, and it hurts me when I see those mean headlines.\u201d I smiled at Ray. \u201cAnd, Ray, you know our plans.\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door was a welcome interruption. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be Trina.\u201d</p><p>Valdez loped to the door. \u201cSmells like her. Check through the peephole.\u201d</p><p>I looked, then let her in. She was dressed in her usual running outfit.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Glory, don\u2019t you want to at least do the stairs?\u201d She was panting. \u201cI did them, but I can do a few more if you want to change. I bet it gives you another five pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Jerry shut the hall door behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re quite thin enough, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>Ray stepped close to my other side. \u201cAre you kidding me? If all she has to do is a few flights of stairs, why wouldn\u2019t she? Her big night\u2019s coming up. When is she going to be on TV all over the world again?\u201d He looked down at my butt, then up at my face. \u201cFive more pounds and you\u2019ll have the tabloids printing that mean Israel Caine has been starving you.\u201d He grinned and winked. \u201cAnd your cheekbones! Baby, you\u2019re looking more like a supermodel every night.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I have to admit that would be a dream come true. \u201cI\u2019m doing it. Sit down, Trina. Ray, would you get her a bottle of water from the minibar? I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d I headed for the bedroom to change.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, you\u2019re mad. You do realize this weight will come back when you\u2019re off whatever MacDonald\u2019s been giving you, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jerry followed me into the bedroom and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cThanks for reminding me.\u201d I turned on him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m haunted by that very thought? Hell, Jerry, for the first time in my life I feel thin! Like I have control over my body.\u201d I grabbed my shorts and T-shirt from the dresser. \u201cWhat do you know about it? You\u2019ve got all the muscles you\u2019ll ever need. And you don\u2019t have an ounce of fat on you. But I\u2019m not like that.\u201d I jerked off my sweater and threw it on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault, you know. I really didn\u2019t have a clue what I was getting into when I agreed to let you turn me. I\u2019d have lost the weight first if I\u2019d known.\u201d I unhooked my bra, ignoring Jerry\u2019s growl. Interest or indignation at the way my words had jabbed him? At the moment I didn\u2019t care. I picked the sports bra out of the drawer and slipped it over my breasts. Thank God it was looser now, only mildly viselike.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re having regrets. But it\u2019s way too late for them. Besides, you know I\u2019ve always thought your figure was perfect.\u201d Jerry moved close to run his thumb over one abused nipple. \u201cNow, what the hell is that thing you\u2019re binding yourself with?\u201d He tried to slip it up to look at my breasts again. \u201cIt\u2019s too tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. I\u2019m going to exercise. It\u2019s a sports bra, keeps me from jiggling.\u201d I swatted away his hand and peeled off my skinny jeans. They were still tight and five fewer pounds would make them slide on easily. Oh, yeah.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you jiggle.\u201d He sat on the side of the bed and watched me step into my shorts.</p><p>I\u2019d just sat beside him to put on my socks and running shoes when his cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cYes? What did you find out? Really? All right, I\u2019ll see what I can do. Thank you.\u201d He slapped the phone shut.</p><p>\u201cWas that Richard?\u201d I tied the first shoe.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell? Did he get the test results on the stuff in the syringe?\u201d I stopped, scared to hear what he\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was some kind of vitamin compound. Virtually harmless. Fact is, I don\u2019t know what the hell it would do for a vampire.\u201d Jerry frowned.</p><p>\u201cSee? I knew it!\u201d I pulled on the other shoe and tied it. \u201cIan\u2019s a genius. He works with chemicals. Maybe vitamins would help us and we just don\u2019t know it. Your hatred for him is irrational, Jerry. It\u2019s based on an ancient feud that should have been settled a long time ago.\u201d I realized that had probably not been the smart thing to say.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I don\u2019t appreciate that.\u201d Jerry followed me when I got up and walked to the door. \u201cOur quarrel with the MacDonalds is based on wrongs they have done us that you know nothing about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything in the last century or two?\u201d I held up my hand when I could tell he was probably going to start trotting out cattle-stealing misdemeanors. \u201cNo, forget I asked. Just tell me if you have one shred of proof that this MacDonald is the villain you claim?\u201d I waited before I turned the knob. Ray and Valdez could probably hear through the door. Only mortal Trina would be unaware of our conversation.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But I want you to give me your bedtime supplement. The one that\u2019s causing your nightmares and sleep problems. Richard can have that analyzed as well.\u201d Jerry put his hands on either side of my head when I leaned against the door. \u201cI\u2019m convinced you could have died today, Gloriana, if I hadn\u2019t provided you with a daytime bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, knowing what he said was true. I put my hands on his chest and felt the heartbeat that had been with me for so long. Slow but steady.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right, Jerry. No, I know you\u2019re right. But I can\u2019t give you all of the supplement. Let me pour a small sample into an empty water bottle.\u201d I touched his frown. \u201cI need to take it, Jer. Or I won\u2019t lose that last bit of weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it to hell, Gloriana. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what you mean is I am ridiculous. I get that. You don\u2019t get me. Too bad. This is important to me. I\u2019m doing it. Take it or leave it. Small sample. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd if you try to walk into the sun again?\u201d He grabbed my hand and scraped my palm with one fang.

Let him do his job.\u201d I felt the slide of his tongue again and fought the heat that pulsed deep inside me. Sorry, but I found it erotic as hell.</p><p>\u201cRight. Shifting into human form. Carrying you to bed. You and Rafael are getting quite chummy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have no choice. He\u2019s stuck with me.

Trina\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll feed from her.\u201d Jerry followed me into the living room. \u201cShe\u2019s become your pet, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust temporarily. She\u2019s very generous.\u201d I smiled at her. She held one of Ray\u2019s new CDs and apparently he\u2019d signed it for her. \u201cWhen this is over, it\u2019s back to synthetics for me. You know that\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you do anymore, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry turned to Trina. \u201cYou have Glory\u2019s supplement for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s right here.\u201d She looked at me, then, at my nod, handed him the bottle.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take just this much.\u201d Jerry poured about an inch into an empty water bottle and screwed on the cap. \u201cIs that satisfactory, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Thanks, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d With a nod, he walked out to the balcony, jammed the bottle into his jeans pocket, then shifted into bird form. He flew off without a sound.</p><p>\u201cWow. You really are popular, Glory.\u201d Trina giggled. \u201cThanks for the CD, Mr. Caine. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d She managed to cram it into her fanny pack. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Glory. It\u2019s awfully late. You don\u2019t want to get caught by the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Trina.\u201d Ray approached her and took her arm. \u201cHave you seen Ian outside during daylight hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes were wide. \u201cNo way. He\u2019s a vampire. Creature of the night and all that. Why would he be out during the day? Seems like he\u2019d go up in smoke or something.\u201d She giggled again. \u201cBut what do I know? You guys tell me. What would happen if you went out in the sun?\u201d She looked from Ray to me.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure. Stories are that we turn to ashes. That\u2019s all that\u2019s ever found of a staked vampire after his body is left out in the sun.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThis is not a topic I want to get into. Ray, will you be here when I get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Glory. Too close to dawn for me to go anywhere else.\u201d He yawned. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower. Have fun, ladies.\u201d</p><p>I opened the hall door and Trina, Valdez and I headed to the elevators.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my second wind now. But let\u2019s just do fifteen or so. Why don\u2019t we get off at four and jog up the rest of the stairs?\u201d Trina started stretching and made me do the same.</p><p>When we got off the elevator, the corridor was empty. We did a few more of Trina\u2019s warm-up exercises, then headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Trina opened the door into the stairwell and Valdez bounded through. Then she slammed it with him on the stair side and pushed a dead bolt home while she and I were still in the hallway. Before I knew what she planned, I was staring at the pointy end of a short wooden stake, my back against the door.</p><p>\u201cTrina? What the hell?\u201d I heard a crash as Valdez hit the door and it vibrated between my shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cYou manage to come through that door, dog, and you\u2019ll make this stake go right through Glory\u2019s heart!\u201d Trina hissed at the door, then concentrated on me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I tried to grab her hand but that only got me a warning jab with the stake. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to be a vampire, you bitch. You tried to talk me out of it last night.\u201d She aimed it at my heart and I felt the sting as it pricked my skin through two layers of fabric.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, Trina. You have no idea what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d I tried to catch her gaze so I could whammy her. Do some vamp mind control on her. No luck. She\u2019d obviously spent enough time around Ian to know better than to look at me directly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dream. And tonight I heard Ian tell his guards that he was never going to make it come true. He\u2019s already picking out a new mortal to serve him.\u201d Tears welled up but Trina ignored them. \u201cI thought that meant he was going to finally make me a vampire but the guards laughed and said that they\u2019d finally get to have me for their playmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he meant as a new vampire.\u201d I saw the elevator open down the hall and a man step out.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. The guard made it very clear that I\u2019d be passed around, then drained and tossed in the ocean or wherever they put the trash.\u201d She shuddered and the stake sank deeper. \u201cMortals don\u2019t count for much with them. That\u2019s why I wanted to be a vampire.\u201d Her eyes were wild as she snarled in a good vamp imitation. \u201cYou told him, didn\u2019t you? That I wasn\u2019t worthy. This is all your fault. Die!\u201d She raised her hand to take a good whack at me when she was grabbed from behind.</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen.\u201d Rafe stripped the stake from her hand and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cGlory, what do you want me to do with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold her still. I\u2019m going to whammy her.\u201d I grabbed her chin and looked deep into her eyes. \u201cTrina, you\u2019re not going to remember this night except that you and I ran up the stairs and you fed me as usual. Nod if you understand me.\u201d I waited until I got that nod.</p><p>\u201cNow, listen carefully. You\u2019re not ever going back to Ian\u2019s again because you\u2019re afraid of vampires now. They have sharp teeth and they hurt when they bite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt?\u201d She shuddered in Rafe\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYes. But forget that because those people were just pretending to be vampires. The fangs were fake and they just wanted to scare you.\u201d I obviously wasn\u2019t going to get my nightly feeding now. I\u2019d just outsmarted myself. \u201cIt\u2019s all over. You don\u2019t know any real vampires. They\u2019re just make-believe creatures in comics and storybooks. You don\u2019t want to have anything to do with those scary characters anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary. Want to go home.\u201d Tears ran down her cheeks and she sniffled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You just came here to get a free copy of Israel Caine\u2019s new CD. You were lucky and he signed it for you. Now you can go home and take down all those vampire posters and put them in the trash. Good night, Trina.\u201d I nodded and Rafe released her.</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d She turned and walked away toward the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, Glory. I failed you again.\u201d Rafe shook his head, his dark hair falling over his face.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth could you know she was going to pull a stunt like that?\u201d I threw the dead bolt and jerked on the stairwell door. \u201cI\u2019m going to run up these damned stairs if it kills me, which it might. And your punishment is that you have to do it too.\u201d I looked down. \u201cBarefoot. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d He grinned, those damned cute dimples showing. \u201cI should do it in dog form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. I won\u2019t have the strength to open the door when we get to the top. It\u2019s on you.\u201d I started off then, determined, since I wasn\u2019t going to have Trina waiting.</p><p>When we got to the twenty-third floor, I was huffing and puffing and Rafe did hold open the door and slide the key card for me when we got to the suite. It was close to dawn and I could hear the shower running. I pulled open the bag with my bottles of supplements inside. The bedtime bottle was empty. It didn\u2019t take a genius to know who had drained it.</p><p>I stomped into the bathroom and threw open the glass shower door. \u201cDamn you for a thief, Israel Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory! So glad you could join me.\u201d Ray grinned and rinsed the last of the shampoo out of his hair. Of course he had no shame when it came to his naked body or his thievery.</p><p>I slammed my fist into his flat midsection. \u201cBastard. Idiot. Why did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOof. Why do you think?\u201d He turned off the water and stepped out of the shower, wrapping a towel around his middle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe, with the Grammys coming up and your big duet, you\u2019d take a chance like this. What if you walk into the sun and get burned? Did you think about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou healed. So will I.\u201d He picked up another towel and dried his hair. Then he opened my webcam and got busy with a comb. \u201cThat Ian MacDonald is brilliant. I\u2019m ordering several of these. Do they come in colors? I\u2019d like black and silver for a bathroom I\u2019ve got on the island.\u201d</p><p>I slammed it shut. \u201cThat\u2019s my mirror, you damned stupid son of a bitch. Ooo.\u201d I stomped my foot and words failed me. Then I found some more. \u201cDid you even think about the fact that now I won\u2019t lose any more weight? How selfish can you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously pretty selfish.\u201d Rafe stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Ray jumped in front of me. \u201cGlory?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, just about ready to signal Rafe to take Ray down. What a pleasure to watch my bodyguard beat the living crap out of my \u201cfianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Valdez in human form, Ray. He just saved my life for about the zillionth time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ray looked him up and down. \u201cI see why Blade doesn\u2019t want you like this, dog breath. Shift back or at least put on a shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from you, Caine. You need me in here, Glory?\u201d Rafe leaned against the doorjamb, relaxed but obviously alert to whatever needed doing.</p><p>\u201cNot now, but genius here took my supplement so he may be doing some strolling during the daylight hours. Whether you want to stop him from frying or not is on you.\u201d I smiled and stepped around Ray to head into the bedroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait a minute. What do you mean he saved your life? What happened?\u201d Ray followed me, not concerned that he was about to lose his towel.</p><p>\u201cTrina brought a stake in her fanny pack. She decided I\u2019d turned Ian against her.\u201d I rubbed the back of my neck, more tired than I\u2019d ever felt. \u201cRafe got there in time to keep her from doing more than talk tough and poke me a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize you\u2019re bleeding?\u201d Ray stepped close and touched my T-shirt.</p> <p>I looked down and saw that he was right. Trina had stabbed a hole through my shirt and sports bra. I\u2019d bled enough to stain them both. I pulled the fabric away from my breast and looked under it.</p><p>\u201cWant me to check it for you?\u201d Ray tried to put his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d I used my arm to fend him off. \u201cIt\u2019s already stopped bleeding. Just stay out of my way, Ray. I\u2019m still furious with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to put a hurt on him, Glory?\u201d Rafe grinned from the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ve been itching to do that for more than a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, shifter, you\u2019re just an employee. I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Ray was suddenly up against the wall with an arm across his throat.</p> <p>\u201cExactly, my man. You don\u2019t think. Respect the lady. And her wishes.\u201d Valdez glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019ve got Trina\u2019s stake in my pocket, Glory. Say the word and your problem\u2019s solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, I know you\u2019re jacked up on adrenaline, but, for God\u2019s sake, calm down.\u201d I put my hand on his bare shoulder. For the first time I was seeing savage Rafael Valdez, the man who, yes, would die for me, but who would also happily jump into the fray against a dozen men if necessary for the pure joy of killing bad guys. Obviously he\u2019d decided Ray was one.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done this time and again, Glory. Taken advantage of your forgiving nature. And you let him get away with it.\u201d Rafe increased the pressure and I heard some cartilage snap.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Rafe, he\u2019s got to sing at the Grammys night after next. Don\u2019t you dare hurt him!\u201d I punched his back. \u201cYou\u2019re way out of line. Ray\u2019s been generous, kind. Let him go. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, right. He\u2019s the big rock star. Of course you\u2019ll cut him all kinds of slack. Caine\u2019s right. I just work here.\u201d Rafe suddenly stepped back and walked to the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ll be out here at my post, doing my job. Don\u2019t worry. I know my place.\u201d He slammed the door.</p><p>Ray coughed and rubbed his throat but didn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>I stared at the door. Well, that had been enlightening. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say Rafe had been jealous of Ray. No, impossible. He\u2019d just been fed up with Ray\u2019s sometimes selfish, me-first attitude. I saw the empty supplement bottle on the dresser. I\u2019d been just as fed up. Now I was worried. What if Ray did the sleepwalking thing? I wasn\u2019t sure Rafe would even bother to stop him if Ray headed for the sun. Damn.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Hell, I did care about Ray. And he\u2019d been quiet too long.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d His voice was raspy.</p><p>\u201cYou just need to sleep it off.\u201d I hoped. What if that supplement kept him from healing? I blocked that thought.</p><p>\u201cThat damned bodyguard has got to go.\u201d He pulled open a drawer and dropped his towel to pull on his shorts. Business as usual.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Rafe and I will both be out of your way once we\u2019re back in Austin.\u201d I didn\u2019t wait to see how Ray reacted to that. I just headed for the door. I stopped, my hand on the knob, and looked back. Ray was rubbing his throat again.</p><p>\u201cYou took a stupid risk drinking Ian\u2019s stuff tonight, Ray. I hope it doesn\u2019t mess you up.\u201d I sighed. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to weigh in and then see what I can do to make sure Valdez saves you if you take a walk in your sleep and head toward the balcony.\u201d I held up a hand when Ray started to say something. \u201cDon\u2019t want to hear it. You\u2019re a damned thief. Go to bed. Or hell. Or wherever.\u201d I stomped out of the room.</p><p>As I headed to the powder room I ignored Valdez, who\u2019d shifted back to dog form. Okay, down three more pounds. But what would the healing sleep do? Without my supplement the weight would probably come right back on. Damn.</p> <p>Tough talk or not, I was sick with fear for Ray. What if he didn\u2019t heal and couldn\u2019t sing? Or got out on the balcony and fried? I walked back through the living room and saw Valdez sitting at the open drapes, staring out at the sky that was just beginning to lighten.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let Ray get hurt, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He looked over his shoulder at me.</p><p>\u201cI think that if I order you to protect him, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>I walked over and jerked the drapes closed until there wasn\u2019t a speck of sky showing. \u201cYes. Do your job. Protect the vampires. Including Ray. For me, Rafe. I need him tomorrow night at the TV show. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever you say, Glory.\u201d He walked over and leaped up on the couch. \u201cI hear and obey.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and went to jump in the shower, still ignoring Ray, who was lying in bed staring at me. Of course he\u2019d heard what I said to Rafe. But he knew better than to smile about it.</p><p>I felt like crap for all kinds of reasons. The coming dawn, for one thing. That should be reassuring since it was familiar. But now it just scared me.</p><p>Rafe was disappointed in me. Somehow that had jumped into number-one position on the dread list, and I couldn\u2019t shrug it off. After I crawled into bed beside Ray, I turned my back on him. Whatever happened after the sun came up was out of my hands now. I had no idea what I\u2019d wake up to.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cSo how did it go?\u201d I\u2019d put off asking the question as long as I could stand it. Ray and I had been giving each other the silent treatment since we\u2019d gotten up with the sunset. Like a stupid game of chicken. Of course you knew I was going to crack first. Now time was running out. I put the finishing touches on my hair and makeup, even though I figured the stylists for the show would do their thing too. They\u2019d be at the door any minute. \u201cDid you see the sun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your bodyguard. I don\u2019t remember what the hell happened and he\u2019s not talking. To me, anyway.\u201d Ray pulled on a black silk shirt and sat on the bed to slip on leather l oafers.</p><p>\u201cAt least you healed. Voice sounds fine.\u201d I closed my \u201cmirror\u201d and stood. \u201cLove the dress, Ray. Thanks.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to admit it felt a little snug. I\u2019d weighed in. The three pounds hadn\u2019t stayed off and I\u2019d gained one. I\u2019d been afraid to try any of Ian\u2019s wake-up supplements in case they upset my stomach, but it had been tempting.</p><p>\u201cYou look great. Would you get the shifter in here and ask him what the hell happened last night? Before the show people arrive?\u201d Ray got up and threw open the bedroom door. \u201cOf course he acts like I\u2019m invisible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez, would you come in here? Please?\u201d I sat down to buckle my silver sandals.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDid Ray get up during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Valdez sat and just looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWell? How about a few details? I don\u2019t remember a freakin\u2019 thing.\u201d Ray stepped into Valdez\u2019s space, which earned him a pretty serious snarl.</p><p>\u201cRay, get back here. I\u2019ll ask the questions. V, did Ray say anything? Did he wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t wake up. He did say something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out, V. Tell us what happened. All of it.\u201d This was getting ridiculous and Ray was losing his cool fast. I knew the TV folks were going to be here any second. I didn\u2019t need for them to arrive in the middle of a brawl that would be impossible to explain.</p><p>\u201cWell, I heard Mr. Macho here crying in his sleep. Calling for his mommy or somebody. Then he staggers out of the bedroom, eyes closed. Guess that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t remember. Had his John-son in his hand. Begging somebody not to cut it off.\u201d Valdez nodded. \u201cGot issues there, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you fur-faced freak, you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Ray glanced at me.</p><p>I knew his history and there\u2019d been a bad scene once when some thugs had threatened him with castration. He\u2019d obviously been reliving it. Valdez knew about it too and I was deeply ashamed of him for throwing it in Ray\u2019s face. I sent V a mental message but he ignored me, too intent on hitting Ray below the belt, literally.</p><p>\u201cDid he get near the doors to the balcony? Did you have to pick him up and take him back to bed?\u201d I put my hand on Ray\u2019s arm. I knew this was hard for him.</p><p>\u201cNo. He did some more carrying on, then he just fell down about halfway across the living room.\u201d Valdez shrugged. \u201cI dragged him back to bed, gave him a good headbutt and he managed to crawl in under the covers. Went dead after that and not another peep out of him.\u201d He snorted. \u201cGood thing. There\u2019s only so much of that I can stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool it, V.\u201d I hugged Ray. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. At least you didn\u2019t have to remember your dream. I did remember mine.\u201d I leaned back and studied him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Glory. Your shifter\u2019s an asshole, but he\u2019s just telling it like he saw it, I guess.\u201d He frowned at Valdez. \u201cHe did get me out of the living room. If some of the guys from the band had come by and opened the drapes . . . Shit, I don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Maybe not such an asshole after all.\u201d Valdez cocked his head. \u201cThey\u2019re here. Out in the hall.\u201d We all heard a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cLet \u2019em in, Glory.\u201d Ray rubbed his face. \u201cThe good news is I got up. But I\u2019m thinking it probably takes several doses of that stuff to build it up in your system before you stay awake during the day. You didn\u2019t wake right away, did you?\u201d He followed me to the door.</p><p>\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t want to either. The whole daylight thing scares the hell out of me.\u201d I stopped and faced Ray. \u201cSmart vampires don\u2019t mess around with the sun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m stupid, but I want it. And I bet Ian\u2019s got this figured out. Your daylight gig was an accident. The real daylight drug is bound to be much stronger than what you took.\u201d Ray\u2019s eyes were shining with hope. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Glory? Forget the nightmares. Except as a clue that Ian\u2019s getting us back to being mortal again.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped like a rock. \u201cOh, Ray, that is so not happening. Ever.\u201d I laid my hand on his arm. There was another impatient knock on the door and I checked the peephole. Yep, the TV crew stood out there, anxious to get inside. I hesitated, knowing this was our last chance for a private word for hours.</p><p>\u201cRay, please think about this long and hard before you act on it. And, remember, you said you\u2019d tell me before you bought into the daylight deal with Ian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid I?\u201d Ray smiled and grabbed the doorknob. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Ms. Independent. But I do owe you an apology. I never should have taken your diet stuff. Not fair to you.\u201d He glanced at Valdez. \u201cI deserved a nightmare and an ass whipping.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cNow, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond to that, he opened the door and ushered in the crew, kissing Zia on the cheek and waving to the designers, who were relegated to the hall again.</p><p>The next hour went by in a blur as the crew set up the living room and we decided how this would go. Ray got makeup and I got a touch-up. Nathan popped in for a few minutes to change shirts and to meet Zia. There was some chemistry there and I had a feeling the two would be seeing each other again. They exchanged numbers, then Nathan left and filming started.</p><p>Zia did her usual intro. She played up Ray\u2019s involvement and made a big deal out of his Grammy nomination again. It was obvious that I was just a necessary evil.</p><p>Finally, an assistant brought Melanie in and sat her in the middle of the couch. I headed into the bedroom to change into her dress and accessories with the help of an a ssistant.</p> <p>This time the dress fit perfectly and the horrible shoulders had been reduced to a manageable level. I actually liked the dress and wished I could have seen the thing in a full-length mirror. Made me wonder if a giant flat screen turned on its side and a webcam . . . Now I was thinking like Ian the inventor. Oh, well, the life of a vampire.</p><p>I walked out and saw Ray and Zia flanking Melanie. I did a turn in front of them, enjoying the way the blue skirt flared when I moved. The sheer fabric on the sleeves was now tight enough to show a blue, red and yellow dragon design, between my breasts too.</p><p>\u201cMelanie, I just noticed what you were trying to do with the sheer fabric.\u201d I looked up and grinned. \u201cIt looks like I have tattoos!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Glory. What do you think?\u201d Melanie was all smiles.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear from Israel Caine first, Melanie.\u201d Zia turned to Ray. \u201cHow do you like it, Ray?\u201d</p><p>Ray stood and walked around me. \u201cIt\u2019s got a cool, edgy vibe. Love the tattoo thing going on.\u201d He winked at Melanie. \u201cGlory\u2019s always wished she could get a tat, haven\u2019t you, baby?\u201d We\u2019d discussed my cover story. He smiled into the camera. \u201cShe\u2019s allergic to the dyes or she would.\u201d He traced a heart over the curve of my breast exposed by the plunging neckline. \u201cShe\u2019d put my name right here, wouldn\u2019t you, Glory?\u201d</p> <p>I gave him a slow smile, well aware of the camera, then heard Valdez rumbling behind me. Tough. I\u2019d warned him to be on his best behavior. Of course, I\u2019d had ample proof that he was an unpredictable man under all that cute Labradoodle fur. So I grabbed Ray\u2019s hand and pulled it to my lips for a playful nip.</p><p>\u201cSure would, love. Don\u2019t you like the blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatches your eyes, baby.\u201d Ray put his hands on my waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with this belt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStars, Ray. Melanie was thinking of you when she made this belt.\u201d I frowned at Valdez when I heard a gagging noise.</p><p>\u201cPiling it on a little thick, aren\u2019t you, Mel?\u201d Ray laughed. \u201cI like it, but we\u2019ve got two more dresses to see. Let\u2019s move on. Good job, honey.\u201d He turned his famous smile on Melanie and I heard the clank as her pierced tongue fell out of her mouth and hit her pierced lip, another victim of Israel Caine\u2019s charm.</p><p>\u201cOut you go, then, Melanie. Send in Darren next and Glory will change into his dress. You\u2019ll find out the winning design tomorrow night when you see what Glory is wearing when she appears on Israel Caine\u2019s arm at the Grammy awards show.\u201d Zia smiled as Ray settled on the couch again.</p><p>I really was fascinated by those sleeves. Tattoos! How cool was that? But I hurried back to the dressing room. I knew time was an issue. Ray had a schedule for us to follow that included stopping at several parties. I pulled off the dress and took the red one that was handed through the door. This time it fit perfectly so maybe it was just as well that I hadn\u2019t lost the three pounds the night before. I slipped on the shoes, which I loved, and the jewelry and walked out. I really felt like a princess in this one.</p><p>\u201cWow, Glory. That one is amazing.\u201d Ray jumped up and walked around me. \u201cReally shows off your new body.\u201d He traced the low-cut bodice, then looked at Darren, who was sitting on the edge of his seat. \u201cYou were obviously listening to me on this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Mr. Caine. You were right. Glory\u2019s got the goods. She should show them off.\u201d Darren coughed when Ray flicked him with a look that should have drawn blood. Obviously Designer Boy had overstepped.</p><p>\u201cThis jewelry for sale?\u201d Ray toyed with the diamond earrings in my ears. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect on you, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Ray. I can put you in touch with the jeweler after the show.\u201d Zia smiled. \u201cNow, Glory, why don\u2019t you tell me why you\u2019re frowning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I love the dress, the accessories and the way it fits, Darren. But I\u2019m worried about the color. It\u2019s red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that was your favorite color.\u201d Darren jumped to his feet. He sat quickly when Valdez growled. Everyone in the room froze at that sound. They all remembered the Butch debacle.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. But how is it going to look against a red carpet, Darren? What if it\u2019s the wrong shade of red? Or I just kind of disappear into the carpet? Do you see my concern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood points, Glory.\u201d Zia was thrilled at the controversy. \u201cWell, Darren, what do you have to say to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory.\u201d Tears filled his eyes, and he wiped them with his sleeve. \u201cI guess I blew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d Ray stopped looking down my front long enough to join the conversation. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, Glory? This year is all about saving the environment and global warming. The carpet isn\u2019t going to be red. It\u2019s going to be green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I turned on him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think to share that little bit of information with me until now?\u201d</p><p>Zia had the same reaction. Her comments would have to be censored. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t someone notify us? I have a green dress for the stupid event. Now I\u2019m back to square one. Of all the bleep, bleeping foul-ups.\u201d She took a shaky breath. \u201cOkay, people, let\u2019s rewind.\u201d She smiled at Ray. \u201cThat\u2019s good drama. We\u2019ll just edit a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I like the dress, Darren, and it\u2019s definitely still under consideration.\u201d I gave him a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Zia clapped her hands. \u201cNow it\u2019s Butch\u2019s turn. Ray, is the dog yours or Glory\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Ray frowned in Valdez\u2019s direction. \u201cOh, he\u2019s 100 percent Glory\u2019s animal. Why?\u201d</p><p>Zia frowned. \u201cHe attacked one of the designers during the last shoot. It was, well, traumatic. Glory, that\u2019s not going to happen again, is it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d already noticed that the entire crew had given Valdez a wide berth since arriving. That had just made him grin and wag his tail. Yeah, Mr. Innocent. \u201cIt had better not. Butch won\u2019t be carrying scissors this time, will he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no sharp objects at all. Guess the dog thought Butch was going to hurt Glory. Can you imagine? With such a huge prize at stake?\u201d Zia laughed and touched Ray\u2019s hand, then she stood and straightened her purple knit micro-mini dress. Two inches shorter and it wouldn\u2019t have covered her butt at all. Trust me, Ray was noticing.</p><p>\u201cWill someone assure Butch that the dog isn\u2019t going to attack him?\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cGlory, let\u2019s play it safe. Could you please put your dog in the bedroom for this part of the shoot? Butch has been under a doctor\u2019s care since that little dustup with your pooch last night. I think it would help if we didn\u2019t have to worry about a repeat.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Valdez. He\u2019d added a lolling tongue and a dumb look to his repertoire. He wasn\u2019t fooling me. If Butch or anyone on the crew\u2014no, make that anyone in the room\u2014even looked at me cross-eyed, he\u2019d go for the jugular and not care who got it on film. I couldn\u2019t blame him. After what Trina had pulled, he was right to be cautious. Unfortunately, he\u2019d be really happy if Ray gave him an excuse to go ballistic.</p><p>\u201cSure, Zia. Valdez can stay in the bedroom, but I have to leave the door ajar. He needs to know he\u2019s in on the action. Otherwise he\u2019ll just bark nonstop and spoil everything. He can get pretty noisy. You don\u2019t want to take that chance, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Zia winced as she settled on the couch again and crossed her long legs. \u201cHoney, have you considered obedience school? Or even, dare I say it, kenneling the creature when you travel?\u201d</p><p>Valdez obviously decided to prove he didn\u2019t need to be shuttled off to some pet hotel or school for naughty dogs. He ran up to her, all wagging tail and lolling tongue. In an instant, the model jumped up on the coffee table, screaming at her assistants to \u201cdo something.\u201d One picked up a throw pillow, then screeched when Valdez knocked it out of her hands with his wagging tail. That sent the others scurrying into a huddle behind the cameraman. Zia was on her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cZia, please. He\u2019s just trying to be friendly.\u201d I grabbed his collar to be on the safe side. \u201cHe\u2019s not growling, is he?\u201d He also wasn\u2019t sitting. Instead he gazed at Zia adoringly before he \u201caccidentally\u201d bumped the table, sending her toppling over the edge.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She landed on the one assistant who\u2019d been brave enough to venture out of the pack and come to her aid. That poor guy had obviously not expected to play cushion for her and they both fell on the floor in a tangle of arms and legs. I swear the air turned blue from Zia\u2019s curses. The camera caught it all, of course. There\u2019d have to be a lot of bleeping.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry. Really. He\u2019s going straight into the bedroom. See?\u201d I tugged on V\u2019s collar and pulled him out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cBark and you\u2019re dead, mister.\u201d I glanced at the assistant assigned to help me with the wardrobe changes. Time for a mental message to my bodyguard. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that table bump was deliberate? When I change clothes you\u2019d damn well better turn your back. You\u2019re not checking out my underwear.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and looked at me with such innocence I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. When Zia had landed on that producer she\u2019d shown the room her leopard print thong and her awesome butt. I stood and brushed my skirt, then walked carefully to the living room where order was being restored. Hair and makeup artists were hard at work on Zia, and Ray lounged on the couch trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cDestroy that footage. If I see it on the Internet, I\u2019ll have the jobs of everyone in this room. Do you hear me, people?\u201d Zia\u2019s face was red behind a cloud of powder and hair spray.</p><p>I\u2019m sure the guests on the thirtieth floor had heard her. I kept my distance. \u201cUh, Zia, should I go change now?\u201d My answer was a wave that I took as a yes.</p><p>I made sure Valdez faced the wall, then removed the dress that was my favorite so far and took the black chiffon that was thrust through the door. I looked it over. Butch had made it into culottes and added a belt. At least the tentlike creation no longer provided stadium seating. Now it just offered a cozy booth for two.</p> <p>When I walked out this time, Butch sat on the sofa between Ray and Zia. He jumped when he saw me, clearly edgy and afraid my wild dog would come rampaging out with me. Zia had developed a tic, casting nervous glances at the bedroom door too. Swell, now I was an irresponsible pet owner. I decided to ease their minds and went back and shut the bedroom door. Valdez could hear through it and break it down if he thought I needed him. These people had been through enough. The tension in the room eased immediately.</p><p>Zia smiled. \u201cWell, Glory, what do you think of the changes Butch incorporated into his design? He obviously had to do the most drastic alterations after your reaction last time.\u201d Zia was totally composed again, though I noticed she\u2019d broken one heel and someone had used clear tape to keep it in place.</p><p>\u201cYes, he really listened to my concerns. This is 1000 percent better.\u201d I held out the flowing black pants. This was the kind of dress I would have killed for in a size twelve. It would have disguised my hips and made my waist look small by comparison.</p><p>\u201cThe black looks great on you, Glory. It shows off your pale skin. Love the low-cut front and back.\u201d Ray stood and walked around me. \u201cNot sure about pants for such a big night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the pants. They\u2019re called culottes, Ray.\u201d I smiled at Butch. \u201cI feel free in them. Like I don\u2019t have to be scared my skirt will blow up and show the world my underwear.\u201d Which, by the way, was a plain beige thong since I needed to do laundry. I\u2019m sure Valdez would have been very disappointed if he\u2019d managed to sneak a peek.</p><p>\u201cI kept the dress loose too, Glory, and the belt adjustable.\u201d Butch flushed. \u201cI know it won\u2019t happen, of course, but, if you did gain some weight, you could still wear this dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love that!\u201d I looked at Zia. \u201cHe did a really good job of accessorizing too. The shoes and jewelry are perfect with this gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Butch, seems like you might have pulled off a miracle here. You were the underdog coming into tonight, but looks like you made the right changes to get back into the race. Of course we\u2019ll all have to wait to see what Glory is wearing at tomorrow night\u2019s Grammy awards show to see which one she picks as her winner.\u201d</p><p>Zia stood and faced the camera. \u201cAnd of course our regular judges will decide, after that and after seeing the footage from these events, just who will go home and who the final two designers will be on Designed to Kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wrap. Good job, people.\u201d The director signaled and the crew started packing up their gear.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Mr. Caine, Glory.\u201d Butch shook our hands. \u201cThat dog\u2019s not around, is he?\u201d Just then we heard a bark from behind the door. \u201cI\u2019m out of here!\u201d He ran toward the hall.</p><p>Zia smiled and air-kissed Ray. \u201cMe too! We\u2019ll have a camera crew at the, ha-ha, green carpet to see your pick, Glory. I\u2019ll conduct just a brief interview with both of you right on the spot. You\u2019ve got to be there early, you know.\u201d</p><p>Ray and I looked at each other. The whole Grammy thing was one big logistical nightmare, starting with the fact that it was on the West Coast. At least in February sunset was still relatively early, but we\u2019d be rushing to get there before Ray had to perform. Luckily his duet was slated to be late in the program and the award presented after that.</p><p>Ray just smiled and nodded. \u201cCheck with Nathan. I believe you have his number. Coordinate the time with him because I can\u2019t be late for my performance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, of course not. I\u2019ll call Nathan in the morning.\u201d Zia finally remembered I was standing there.</p><p>\u201cOh, Glory, you get all three dresses, of course. They\u2019re yours now. Shoes and bags too. The vendors get rolling credits at the end of the segments, so they donated the accessories, except for the jewels, of course. Any hints for me on which dress you\u2019ll pick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ray and I\u2019ll talk it over. And I\u2019d like to get my best friend\u2019s opinion if I have time.\u201d I shut up when I realized Zia wasn\u2019t listening. Free stuff\u2014I couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>She waved a hand and an assistant came out of the bedroom, Valdez racing out ahead of her. \u201cDid you leave everything in Ms. St. Clair\u2019s closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything except these.\u201d The woman handed me three velvet bags. \u201cThose are the jewels for each gown. They\u2019re marked so you\u2019ll know which one goes with which dress. Of course one of these bags is empty because you\u2019re wearing one set.\u201d She looked down at Valdez. \u201cThe dog was fine, just stayed by the door once you shut it.\u201d She glanced at Zia. \u201cDon\u2019t know why he did those things out here. But then, animals sense\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, Rita, help the others pack.\u201d Zia waved her away. \u201cRay, Glory, a courier from the jeweler will be at your hotel first thing the morning after the Grammys to pick up those bags. You know the jewelry is just on loan. Insured, of course. But we don\u2019t want to have to deal with any problems, now, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine, Zia. But tell him we\u2019ll leave them in the safe downstairs. I\u2019ll have instructions for the front desk. If I decide to buy anything, I\u2019ll be in touch with the jeweler personally later.\u201d Ray walked Zia to the door. She was limping because her heel wouldn\u2019t stay on. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sleeping in. Big night for me, win or lose. There are some after-parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I bet it\u2019s a win.\u201d Zia gasped when Valdez followed Ray to the door and gave her a toothy grin. \u201cBye, now.\u201d She ran out of the suite, finally jerking off her shoes when they slowed her down. The last of the TV crew with their equipment was right behind her.</p><p>\u201cGlad that\u2019s over.\u201d I carried the jewelry into the bedroom. I\u2019d have to hurry and change so we could leave. Valdez was going to have to stay here and I knew he wasn\u2019t going to like it. Too bad. No way was I taking a dog to a party. And I wasn\u2019t going to let him shift into human form either. Ray and I should be able to get along without extra protection. This whole paranoia thing was getting ridiculous. As far as I could see, no one in Los Angeles was out to get me. Not since Trina was safely whammied and taken care of.</p><p>When I stepped out of the bathroom in my green dress again, Valdez was waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to know your plans, Glory, you should block your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going with us, V.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. There are already rumors that Ray\u2019s got something going on with his hot female bodyguard. So now we can add to the story that we\u2019re a threesome. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Do you blame me? Even wearing a six, I felt like a bloating munchkin next to the tall beautiful Brit. For a moment I toyed with the idea of wearing a pair of the real diamond earrings. They were fabulous. But in the end, I chickened out and stuck with my fake diamond studs. The real jewels went into the safe in the closet.</p><p>\u201cYou think Caine can protect you?\u201d Valdez wasn\u2019t giving up.</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d I picked up my evening bag and my cell from its charger. I glanced at it. No missed calls. So Jerry hadn\u2019t bothered to check on me. I sighed, then stuck the phone inside my purse and headed for the living room. \u201cYou\u2019re being paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten Trina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been handled and is no longer a threat.\u201d I saw Ray on the phone and walked over to stare at the night sky. \u201cForget it, V. We\u2019ll have Ray\u2019s mortal bodyguards with us in case any of his fans get overly enthusiastic or the paparazzi bug us. That\u2019ll be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Limo\u2019s downstairs. The guys are waiting in the lobby. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Ray pulled on a charcoal gray Armani jacket over his silk shirt. He looked every bit the world-class rocker who made women melt and slip him their room keys. Don\u2019t laugh. There was a pile of them on the minibar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is on you, Caine. Take care of our girl.\u201d Valdez followed us to the door.</p><p>\u201cOur girl?\u201d Ray put his hand on my waist. \u201cGlory\u2019s a woman, more than capable of taking care of herself. Now you\u2019ve got a night off, man. Spend it finding your own woman.\u201d He pushed me out into the hall and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cWas that necessary?\u201d I looked back.</p> <p>\u201cI thought so. You can\u2019t keep dragging him everywhere you go, Glory. I can take care of you tonight if there\u2019s anything that needs doing.\u201d He punched the button for the elevator. \u201cHave I told you how incredible you look? The tabloids are going to go nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ray. But, sweetheart, I\u2019m the vintage vamp here. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d I kissed his open mouth, then stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the lobby.</p><p>\u201cJust when I think you can\u2019t get any sexier . . .\u201d Ray pushed me against the back wall as the elevator doors slid shut. \u201cSo you\u2019re the alpha in this pack?\u201d</p><p>I grinned up at him. \u201cIs two a pack?\u201d I ran my hands up his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t wrinkle my dress, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d He leaned in and kissed a path along my jaw to a spot behind my ear, making me shiver.</p> <p>\u201cProbably.\u201d I sighed when he moved down to press his open mouth against the pulse in my neck. The elevator shuddered to a stop.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re interrupting something, DeeDee.\u201d</p><p>Ray didn\u2019t lift his head, just moved closer. I could see DeeDee, her expression never changing from neutral, like she\u2019d caught two strangers making out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for the next elevator.\u201d She shoved her date back and hit the button so the doors closed again.</p><p>I pushed Ray off of me. \u201cChicken. Couldn\u2019t you have at least said hi to your bed buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was busy. DeeDee knows the score.\u201d Ray shrugged, pulled down his jacket, then reached out to straighten my neckline that he\u2019d managed to slip aside until it showed a trace of nipple. The elevator doors opened at the lobby.</p> <p>\u201cHere we go. Showtime.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMy life\u2019s in your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Believe me, I know that.\u201d I threw back my shoulders, on high alert. Between the two of us, I was the strong one here, the experienced vampire. Ray was a newbie, just coming into his skills. And his mortals would be useless if we ran across any paranormal threat. I actually felt a rush, though the odds of encountering a paranormal hit squad were slim to none. Okay, okay, that was a relief. I\u2019m not an idiot.</p><p>We headed out of the main lobby entrance. Other celebrities were also taking off for a night out and the paparazzi were in a feeding frenzy. But they noticed me on Ray\u2019s arm and my new look.</p><p>\u201cThis way, Glory. What diet are you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did your lipo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lose the baby?\u201d</p><p>The lipo question made me wonder if there had been a mole in the production staff of the TV show. The baby question was so crude and disgusting I sent the idiot a mental message that made him go pale and back away. After that, I refused to say a word as we hurried into the limo. Ray and I settled back, the two guards facing us as we drove to the first party.</p><p>Ray grabbed my hand. \u201cDamned paparazzi. I\u2019m sorry about that, Glory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComes with the territory, I guess. Not your fault.\u201d I smiled at him, then leaned in to whisper in his ear. \u201cI scared that one photographer. He\u2019s going somewhere so he can look and see if he\u2019s still got something between his legs.\u201d</p><p>Ray laughed. \u201cBaby, I like the way you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just wish I had the power to make stuff like that really happen.\u201d I eased my hand out of his and adjusted the silk wrap that matched my dress. \u201cTell me about this party we\u2019re going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy record label\u2019s throwing this bash. I already had Nate spread the word that I\u2019m on the wagon.\u201d Ray frowned and sat back. \u201cOf course the execs were happy to hear that. Didn\u2019t know I had such an obvious problem.\u201d</p><p>I covered his hand where it rested on my thigh. \u201cJust the insiders knew. Your fans didn\u2019t have a clue unless they believed some of the meaner tabloid stories.\u201d Ray had been on the brink of going into rehab for alcoholism when he\u2019d been made vampire. It had been tough for him to realize his drinking days were over when he\u2019d awakened to a liquid diet that wasn\u2019t his favorite Jack Daniel\u2019s. Bummer for him. Then to find out he couldn\u2019t see daylight again either . . . When you don\u2019t choose to become vampire, like I did, it can be a pretty depressing reality.</p><p>\u201cWell, the upside is I\u2019ve made the powers that be at the label very happy with my new sober work ethic. They really like my new tunes on the upcoming album. Now all I have to do is get them used to my crazy new work schedule. Of course I\u2019ve always been pretty much a night owl. Never really appreciated the daylight before. But now . . . Hell, next time it\u2019ll be different.\u201d Ray turned his hand over and squeezed my fingers. \u201cI\u2019m not bugging you about this anymore. Or arguing about it tonight either. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a bit sexy.\u201d He nodded toward the mortals who were both plugged into iPods to give us privacy. I didn\u2019t doubt they could still hear us, though.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about this later.\u201d The limo was slowing and I could see another crowd gathered around a canopy in front of a restaurant. Our car was in a slow-moving line, until it was our turn and the guards jumped out first.</p><p>\u201cIsrael Caine!\u201d Female screams made it clear that Ray still had plenty of female fans as a throng pushed against velvet ropes, and policemen kept the crowds back. Ray stopped and signed a few autographs, then waved at the crowd and escorted me inside. We left the bodyguards by the door and headed into the darkened restaurant that had apparently been totally taken over for the party. M.A.S. Records logos were everywhere, the bloodred letters on black background unmistakable, along with O.B.G. Sounds, the rock division that was Ray\u2019s label. One of the Grammy-nominated hits was loud and proud, played by a DJ. Scantily clad waitresses in tight white O.B.G. T-shirts, cut off to show their tiny waists, circulated, taking drink orders. Ray and I took our token glasses of sparkling water and pretended to sip.</p><p>We saw famous faces everywhere and Ray knew everyone. I was in fangirl heaven and had a hard time pretending to be cool. I wished Flo could have met the hunky country star we\u2019d both drooled over in a video one night. Or the older man whose music we\u2019d both had fun dancing to back in the sixties. I just hung on to Ray\u2019s arm and kept smiling. Then I caught a whiff of something I\u2019d never expected to smell here. Vampire.</p><p>I looked around. No, not just one vampire, but several. Holy crap. I didn\u2019t feel menace, but that didn\u2019t mean Ray and I couldn\u2019t end up with our throats ripped out. We didn\u2019t know any of the Los Angeles vampires. I did have names I could throw around. Jerry, Richard and Damian had talked to the Council. Maybe they\u2019d mentioned us. Let it be known we were in town and meant no harm. I gave Ray an elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby? Let me introduce you to Celine.\u201d Ray pulled me forward. \u201cGlory\u2019s a big fan. Has all of your CDs. We meant to make your show before you left Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s right. I just love you.\u201d I babbled and almost spilled water all over the famous singer. But I couldn\u2019t concentrate. I had to get Ray alone. I finally sent him a mental message.</p><p>\u201cRay, there are vampires here. Several. Sniff the air. See if you can pick them out.\u201d</p><p>Ray\u2019s eyes widened and he leaned in to kiss Celine\u2019s cheek. \u201cGreat to see you again. E-mail me your concert schedule and maybe we can connect.\u201d We watched her disappear into the crowd. \u201cWell, she\u2019s not one.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to giggle hysterically. \u201cI never thought she was.\u201d I felt a presence behind me and knew the vampires had found us.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, please. There\u2019s someone who wants to meet you, Mr. Caine, Ms. St. Clair.\u201d</p><p>Ray and I turned and there stood a pair of vampires who could have been just your ordinary record executives. Hey, I challenge you to pick them out of a crowd in any boardroom. Thousand-dollar suits. Silk ties. White shirts and expensive haircuts. One even sported horn-rimmed glasses \u00e0 la Clark Kent. The pair was completely nonthreatening if you weren\u2019t into mind reading. Unfortunately, Ray and I were able to get the mental message loud and clear. This wasn\u2019t an invitation we could turn down.</p><p>We were going to meet a big bad vampire whether we wanted to or not. Oh, yeah, and I was supposed to protect Ray. Uh-huh.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>We followed the two vamps to the bar area of the restaurant where a blond man held court in a corner booth. It was obvious that bodyguards controlled who could and couldn\u2019t gain access to this section of the room. Our host had a beautiful woman on each side of him. He whispered in their ears and they quickly slid out of the booth and hurried off.</p><p>\u201cPlease, join me.\u201d He smiled and gestured, and two goblets of what smelled like a new and very excellent synthetic blood were set on the dark wood table on either side of him. \u201cSo glad to finally meet you, Caine. And the beautiful Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>Ray nodded and I was proud of him. Even though this was probably the man who held his recording contract, he wasn\u2019t about to shake hands with any vampire. We just stood there.</p><p>\u201cSit. Both of you.\u201d Now there was steel in his voice and the record execs were joined by two more muscular types.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I smiled and slid in on one side of him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know your name. Ray?\u201d I looked at him where he still stood, obviously reluctant to just cave to a command. \u201cSit, baby, let\u2019s get to know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cChip Rollins. I own M.A.S. Records. Caine should know that.\u201d He smiled when Ray finally dropped into the booth on the other side.</p><p>\u201cSure, I know who runs the show at M.A.S. Nice to finally meet you. Didn\u2019t know you were\u201d\u2014Ray glanced around\u2014\u201cvampire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not. Just like I didn\u2019t know until recently that one of my stars had joined the club. I call us Masters of the Night.\u201d Chip showed a hint of fang in his smile this time. \u201cHas a nice ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch nicer than freak or bloodsucker. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been called that a time or two. I know I have.\u201d I smiled, picked up my glass and inhaled. \u201cMmm. This is something special, Mr. Rollins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Chip. Only the best. That\u2019s my motto in all things.\u201d He glanced at Ray, who was obviously not a happy camper at being strong-armed away from the party. \u201cMy recording artists included, Ray. I won\u2019t talk business tonight, but we will talk soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Looking forward to it.\u201d Ray picked up his goblet and took a swallow. \u201cThis is good stuff. A club? Yeah, Glory said there might be a secret handshake.\u201d Ray smiled. \u201cI draw the line at matching T-shirts.\u201d</p> <p>Chip laughed. \u201cSo do I.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cYou should teach your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to mask his thoughts better. Ray, I\u2019m not insulted when you think I sound like a character from a comic book. Who do you think wrote those things back in the day?\u201d He nodded toward the suit in the glasses, who took a bow. \u201cI told Eric next time to make us the heroes. Vampires as superheroes. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than bloodsucking fiends, I guess.\u201d Ray smiled and let his fangs show.</p><p>I sent Ray a mental message to remember who signed his checks. His attitude was surly despite the smile. Guess he didn\u2019t like being surrounded by another vamp\u2019s bodyguards. Neither did I. Now I regretted refusing to bring Brittany along. She was worth two of these guys. I looked them over again. Well, maybe not. Now, Valdez . . . Forget it. We were on our own. And Chip wasn\u2019t about to harm one of his moneymakers anyway. I smiled too, minus the fangs. I knew Ray had just offered an insult to our host. Obviously we needed more lessons in vampire etiquette.</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s initiation into the club is a recent thing, Chip.\u201d I toyed with my glass but didn\u2019t drink. Damn this diet. But my dress was cutting into my middle already.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that. I do my homework, Gloriana. I believe that\u2019s your favorite, um, flavor. AB negative? You should try it.\u201d Chip touched my hand and I shivered. \u201cOr are you still dieting?\u201d</p> <p>I set the glass down without tasting it. \u201cYou know a lot about me, Chip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. No vampire enters my territory without being vetted.\u201d He turned to Ray. \u201cI must say I was surprised you and Gloriana went out to see MacDonald so soon after arriving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize we had to get permission. Oh, got to piss. Do I have to raise my hand?\u201d Ray looked like he was spoiling for a fight.</p><p>One of Chip\u2019s men put his hand on Ray\u2019s shoulder and Ray winced.</p><p>Chip laughed. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d He leaned forward and I could see Ray doing his best not to show the slightest reaction to the implied threat as Chip invaded his space.</p><p>Sorry, but we could all feel Ray\u2019s fear. New vampire. Not a chance he could mask his feelings that well. I gave in and sipped the synthetic. God, it tasted great and gave me a jolt of courage I needed.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me, Ray. I get that you want to see daylight. Hell, we all do.\u201d Chip looked down at his own hand, a nice tan that had to have come from a spray. In fact, Chip could have fit right in with Ian\u2019s surfer dudes. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating MacDonald\u2019s claims. The Council here is on top of the situation. You\u2019d be wise to wait for our findings. You don\u2019t want to go off half-cocked, do you? And wind up toasted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you care what I do?\u201d Ray wasn\u2019t going to back down. Dumbass.</p><p>I wanted to reach out to him. Do something. But Chip was between us and in Ray\u2019s face. And it was clear the man was giving Ray a chance to learn a lesson. I just hoped to hell Ray paid attention. I tried to send Ray a mental message but he wasn\u2019t receiving, totally focused on the man in front of him. Which was the first smart thing Ray\u2019d done since we\u2019d entered the bar.</p><p>\u201cI care, Ray, because I own you. Ask your buddy Nathan Burke. He made you a sweet deal. A long-term deal. With more money than you can ever spend. Or at least it was until you became immortal. Don\u2019t throw that chance away.\u201d Chip picked up his glass and took a healthy swallow. \u201cForget this. Bring me the redhead. I\u2019m going upstairs with her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and one of his muscle men \u201chelped\u201d Ray out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cNobody owns me, Chip. I can buy my way out of your damned contract. There are other record companies.\u201d Ray held out his hand and I slid from the other side of the booth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, Ray. Who else is going to understand your special needs? Your weird recording and appearance schedule, for instance. When you can only go out after dark. And did I complain when you couldn\u2019t do all those promos on the talk shows?\u201d Chip laughed and leaned back. \u201cHell, no. Because we\u2019re brothers in this fraternity. I also understand that in a few years you\u2019re going to have a little problem, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What? My voice will be golden forever.\u201d Ray picked up his goblet of synthetic, took a swallow, then slammed the glass on the table. I moved close to him and grabbed his hand. He had a wild look in his eyes and I worried he\u2019d try something we\u2019d both regret.</p> <p>\u201cRight. Sure, the voice will sing as sweet, but, Ray, you won\u2019t age. How long can you stay in the public eye and not have that noticed? Hair plugs and face-lifts can explain away only so much.\u201d Chip chuckled. \u201cSo you\u2019ll have to disappear. And maybe reemerge after a few decades with a new look and start a new career as somebody else. You may not get to sing in public at all the next go-round.\u201d He turned to the man in the glasses and said something in a foreign language. I had no idea which one.</p><p>\u201cAsk Eric here. We started out together centuries ago in the Balkans. We\u2019ve been everything from Dutch to Russians to whatever. Doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs.\u201d He and Eric laughed. \u201cOkay, the Indian thing was too much of a stretch to try. The last twenty years it\u2019s been L.A. and the music biz. That\u2019s got about another twenty years of shelf life, then it\u2019s on to something else and I\u2019m a new person. Chip is no more.\u201d Chip smiled at me. \u201cSmart vampires live forever. The others . . . ? Gloriana can tell you, we reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. Am I right, lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay knows that, Chip.\u201d I made myself smile too, though I didn\u2019t like Chip\u2019s attitude.</p><p>\u201cSure. Next life I\u2019ll grow a beard and run charters down in the islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight charters?\u201d Chip didn\u2019t bother to hide his amusement.</p><p>I saw the truth hit Ray hard. Just one more nail in his vampire coffin. He\u2019d had one after another since that night he\u2019d been turned. His grip tightened until I had to bump him with my hip to remind him to ease up. He dropped my hand and leaned both fists on the table.</p><p>Chip\u2019s bodyguards quickly moved in but Chip held up a hand and they stopped just short of jerking Ray up and slamming him against a wall or tearing him apart. Violence fairly shimmered in the air and I wanted to run the hell out of there. I laid my hand on Ray\u2019s back and sent him frantic mental messages of caution.</p><p>\u201cThanks for laying it all out there, Chip. Makes it easier for me to make a decision about my future.\u201d Ray smiled tightly.</p><p>Chip drained his glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve been given a fantastic opportunity, Ray. I hope you have the balls to see this gig through.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cGloriana, you\u2019re his mentor. I think it\u2019s time you showed Ray some of the wonders of being vampire. And, lady, if you don\u2019t know what they are, I feel for you. I really do.\u201d He gestured and I knew we were free to go.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ray. Don\u2019t we have another party to hit?\u201d I grabbed his arm when I was afraid Ray was about to take a parting shot.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Glory. Now that I\u2019ve got Chip here one-on-one and we\u2019re frat brothers, so to speak, I have a question for him.\u201d Ray gestured at the banner on the wall behind the booth. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the initials? What does M.A.S. and O.B.G. stand for? No one knows or will tell, anyway. Drives Nate and me crazy. Now that I\u2019m one of your Masters of the Night,\u201d Ray said mockingly, \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll let me in on the secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay! Chip doesn\u2019t have to tell you that.\u201d Especially since Ray hadn\u2019t exactly been Chip\u2019s buddy for the last few minutes.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Gloriana. My vampire friends know and enjoy the irony. M.A.S. stands for Music At Stake, Ray.\u201d Chip nodded and one of his men pulled a small and lethal-looking stake out of his jacket pocket. \u201cWe\u2019re always vulnerable, aren\u2019t we?\u201d He laughed. \u201cPut it away, Danny. You\u2019re making our guests nervous.\u201d</p><p>Ray didn\u2019t acknowledge the truth of that, just shrugged. \u201cOkay, so what about O.B.G. Sounds? That\u2019s my label.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The one I use for my rockers.\u201d Chip winked at me. \u201cI spent the sixties in England. Did some producing with Paul and the Fab Four before it was time to head to L.A. So O.B.G. is for Only Bloody Great Sounds. You\u2019re damned lucky I thought you were worth keeping under contract, Israel Caine. The way you were headed, the vampire deal and going on the wagon saved your career, my man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, got it.\u201d Ray nodded, clearly finally ready to get out of there.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t put down the Masters of the Night thing. If you stick around L.A., you\u2019ll find there are some serious perks that go along with membership.\u201d Chip leaned back, his smile full of fang. \u201cDoes your buddy Nate know you\u2019re vampire?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOf course he does. Rookies. Be careful who you let in on our secret, Ray. That\u2019s a lesson I learned the hard way a long time ago. Now, run along, enjoy the party and think about what I said. You have an amazing talent, man. And an opportunity to live forever. Don\u2019t blow it.\u201d He turned when the beautiful redhead approached his table. \u201cAh, dinner is served.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two hours later we were back at the hotel. Neither of us had been much in a party mood after the confrontation with Chip. We\u2019d put in a token appearance at a big bash at a hotel ballroom for the Grammy nominees. There had been so many famous people there I\u2019d gotten whiplash from gawking. Now we headed up to the suite. I\u2019d called Flo from the limo and she was meeting me there to help me decide which dress to wear on the green carpet tomorrow night. I couldn\u2019t really get excited about it. Not with Ray in a funk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet, Ray.\u201d I leaned against the elevator wall to take the pressure off my aching feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wake up Nate and ask him about my contract.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty late.\u201d The doors opened and I pushed myself up and out to head down the hall.</p><p>\u201cTough.\u201d Ray pulled out the key card and opened the door when we got there. \u201cI need some answers.\u201d</p><p>Valdez sat in front of the TV, his paw on the remote. He was fast, but not fast enough.</p><p>\u201cPay-per-view mud wrestling?\u201d I looked at Ray.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reimbursing me for that, asshole.\u201d Ray stalked over to Nathan\u2019s door.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got company. She\u2019s noisy. That\u2019s why I had the TV on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d Ray pounded on the door. \u201cNate, I need to talk to you. Now.\u201d</p><p>After a tense two minutes, Nate opened the door a crack. \u201cNot a good time, bro.\u201d</p><p>Ray grabbed Nate\u2019s arm and jerked his best friend into the living room. His naked best friend.</p><p>\u201cRay!\u201d I turned my back. Oh, boy. Nate\u2019s hours in the gym had sure paid off. There was a mirror across the room and I realized I still had an excellent view.</p><p>Ray glanced at me and handed Nate a throw pillow. \u201cCover yourself. Glory\u2019s getting off to this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm not.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hide my grin, though, as I sat on the couch and kicked off my shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this about?\u201d Nate looked longingly back at his dark bedroom, then closed the door. \u201cI\u2019m kind of in the middle of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo damned bad.\u201d Ray frowned. \u201cI met Chip Rollins tonight. We discussed my contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Nate picked up another pillow and covered his nicely toned tush.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Seems Chip owns me. His word. Why the hell would you make a deal like that for me, Nate?\u201d Ray paced the floor. \u201cAnd, news flash, Chip is a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say.\u201d Nate fumbled his pillows for a breathless moment, then regained control. \u201cNo freakin\u2019 way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay!\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d just ignored Chip\u2019s warning. And if he didn\u2019t think Chip would read Nate\u2019s mind the next time they met, he was crazy. Ray had just put Nate in incredible danger. I didn\u2019t say anything else, though. One crisis at a time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Chip\u2019s property, Glory. Nate knows what I know.\u201d He frowned and shook his head. \u201cBut obviously that doesn\u2019t go both ways, does it, Nate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did the best I could for you, Ray.\u201d Nate dropped the back end pillow to put his hand on Ray\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI was up against a wall. Your drinking was getting out of hand and everyone in the music business had heard the rumors. Sales were flat on your last album and reviewers called the work sloppy. The only hit to come out of the thing was the duet with Sienna Star, and that\u2019s because the woman\u2019s a perfectionist and you know it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here at the Grammys this year.\u201d</p><p>Ray jerked away from Nate and strode over to the open doors at the balcony. \u201cNo one said anything to me about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you remember anyway.\u201d Nate glanced back at me, then followed him to the doorway. \u201cRay, there were no other offers. You want to make records and, without a major label backing you, there\u2019s no distribution. Chip\u2019s got that all locked up. You have to work with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, man, this is good news. Don\u2019t you see? The Chipster will understand your condition. Am I right, Glory?\u201d Nate looked to me to back him up.</p><p>I got up and walked to Ray\u2019s other side. \u201cThat\u2019s what Chip said, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right before he started issuing orders and making threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ray, I don\u2019t think he exactly ordered you not to deal with MacDonald.\u201d Though I wished he had.</p><p>\u201cHe threatened you? And who\u2019s MacDonald?\u201d Nate looked at me, then Ray.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Go back to your playmate. Screw your brains out.\u201d Ray frowned at me. \u201cAt least one of us is getting some. Aw, fuck it!\u201d In a flash, he changed and flew off the balcony in bat form.</p><p>\u201cRay!\u201d I screamed. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say.\u201d Valdez jumped in front of me. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t go out alone in that mood. He might do something crazy.\u201d I wiped at my wet cheeks. Stupid to cry for Ray. He was going to have to get over his disappointments. But if he was going out to MacDonald\u2019s, I was going with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going. Is Flo coming here?\u201d Valdez bumped me back from the balcony railing.</p><p>\u201cYes, but what difference does that make? It\u2019ll be too late to follow Ray then. I have to go now or I\u2019ll lose his scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shit. Stay here. Do not leave.\u201d And in a blur, Valdez shifted into a bat and flew off the balcony in the same direction Ray had taken.</p><p>\u201cWow. What was that about?\u201d Nate gave up on modesty and gripped the railing to squint into the dark.</p><p>Good luck trying to see either Ray or Valdez. I had excellent vamp night vision and it was obvious to me that they were long out of sight. I just hoped Valdez caught up with Ray. I sighed and walked back to the couch.</p><p>\u201cRay wants to see daylight again. This vampire named MacDonald claims he has a magic formula that can make that possible. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s where Ray\u2019s going. To buy some of those drugs.\u201d I slumped in my seat and put my feet on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds dangerous.\u201d Nate was back in pillow mode and easing toward his bedroom. \u201cYou won\u2019t let Ray do anything stupid, will you, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying my best, Nate, but he\u2019s a man. Men do what they want. Am I right?\u201d Just then I heard a woman speak Nate\u2019s name from the bedroom. \u201cGo, your booty call is getting anxious. Oh, and I\u2019m expecting company. So would you keep it down? I\u2019d hate for Flo to be embarrassed.\u201d I said that with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry. I should have taken this downstairs to her room. There\u2019s still time . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, carry on.\u201d I waved my hand, my voice rough with tears I struggled not to shed. I cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019m just playing with you. We\u2019ll be in my bedroom. If we hear anything, we\u2019ll just turn the TV on loud.\u201d</p><p>Nate hurried out of the room and I gave in and actually shed a few tears. First for Ray because I felt like I\u2019d failed him. Chip was right. A good mentor would have taught Ray to appreciate his new vampire powers, not obsess about what he couldn\u2019t have. And how about Valdez? I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d taken off after Ray like that. He\u2019d done it for me, because he sure didn\u2019t care if Ray flew into the sunrise or not. When the knock came at the door and I realized Flo had arrived, I blew my nose and forced a smile. I didn\u2019t want her walking in on this sobfest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Why are you sad?\u201d Flo gave me a hug. \u201cWhere is your bodyguard? I don\u2019t think I ever see you by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went after Ray, who is upset and just took off. No guards, nothing.\u201d I took a shuddery breath. \u201cStupid idiot. I hope I never have to mentor another new vampire. They are nothing but trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right, girlfriend. I sure won\u2019t do it.\u201d Flo took my arm and pulled me to the bedroom. \u201cLook at you. You bought the green dress after all? It looks great on you. And a six. You are so skinny!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t care. Hadn\u2019t even weighed in for the last few hours. No point. The waistband was cutting into me and I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of this beautiful dress. Oh, God, I was not going to cry again. Wait. Really, I wasn\u2019t going to cry. Gee, maybe I was actually getting over my body image obsession.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy the dress. Ray bought it for me. To wear to the parties tonight. He was so proud of me.\u201d Oops. Another little crying jag. Stupid. I wiped my eyes and blew my nose.</p><p>Flo patted my shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s smart. He knows you did this to look good for him. For tomorrow night. Now, show me these three dresses. Do you like them? Is one your favorite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like all three of them. Each one has something special about it.\u201d I pulled the first garment bag out of the closet. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t lose the weight for Ray; I lost it for myself. It made me feel great. For about five minutes anyway.\u201d I unzipped the bag. The first dress was the black one that would work even when I gained the weight back. Good thing.</p><p>\u201cPretty. Black is always elegant. Try it on.\u201d Flo got busy inspecting the shoes and purse while I pulled the jewelry out of the safe. \u201cOh, these are real. Can you keep them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re on loan. Ray talked about buying me something, but I won\u2019t let him.\u201d I sniffed and then decided enough of that. I glanced at the clock. The men had been gone less than an hour. How long did a temper tantrum take anyway? Had Valdez just trailed Ray or had he confronted him and tried to force him to come back? They both had been itching for a fight. Maybe they\u2019d pounded each other and worked off some steam. Oops. More tears. No, not happening. I sucked it up and slipped into the black dress.</p><p>\u201cPants? The designer made you pants?\u201d Flo walked around me. \u201cCute. But I don\u2019t think so. Not for such a big night. But that\u2019s just my opinion. What does Israel say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say. I haven\u2019t asked him yet. But his first reaction was just like yours. No pants.\u201d I loosened the belt. Oh, hell, I hadn\u2019t gone through all of this just to give up now. I needed one more night of skinny and I didn\u2019t have a nighttime supplement. Ian might have called and I\u2019d turned off my cell at the parties. And Jerry. Had he tried to call me? I\u2019d been so wrapped up in the Ray drama, I hadn\u2019t given a thought to what was going on with the Campbell Clan. I grabbed my purse and turned on my cell. One message. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGloriana, this is Ian MacDonald. Trina didn\u2019t show up tonight but I\u2019ve got another mortal I can send you. Call me and let me know when you want your nighttime supplement.\u201d I closed the phone.</p><p>Flo pursed her lips. \u201cAre you going to call him back? What happened to that bitch who wanted you? Now she doesn\u2019t show up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to kill me. I had to take care of her.\u201d I sat on the side of the bed, then jumped up. Couldn\u2019t wrinkle the dress. \u201cUnzip me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute. She tried to kill you?\u201d Flo unzipped the dress. \u201cI hope you ripped out her throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just did the whammy on her. She\u2019s over the whole vampire obsession. Thinks we\u2019re a figment of her imagination.\u201d I stepped out of the dress and hung it up. Did I want to do one more treatment or not? I\u2019d try on the next dress and see how it fit, then decide.</p><p>\u201cYou are too good to her.\u201d Flo unzipped the next garment bag. \u201cI like blue. But the colors and fabrics are strange together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait till you see it on. Ray liked this one. It\u2019s different.\u201d I slipped my arms into the sheer sleeves and let Flo zip me up. I did love the tattoo thing. This time I could use Ian\u2019s webcam to at least see some of the effect. Cool. But maybe not what I wanted on the green carpet.</p><p>\u201cI see what you mean. There are designs on the material.\u201d Flo walked around me. \u201cI like the shoulders. Pretty beading.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee? I look like I have tattoos. But it feels snug.\u201d Snug? I had a vise around my waist. \u201cDoes it look too tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to have tattoos? Oh, yes, Israel has them. On him they\u2019re sexy.\u201d Flo stepped back and studied me. \u201cIt is a little clingy in the middle. You can\u2019t gain another ounce, girlfriend. I hate for you to drink Ian\u2019s stuff, but maybe you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me try on the red dress. I guess it really is my favorite.\u201d I let her unzip me and carefully hung up the blue dress. Good thing I didn\u2019t have to breathe because it had not been an option in that dress.</p><p>Flo opened the last bag. \u201cOh, yes! Now, this is a well-made dress! It reminds me of a couture piece I once bought in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does look like a classic, doesn\u2019t it? I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m drawn to it. You know how I am about vintage stuff.\u201d I slipped into the dress, loving the feel of the silk. \u201cWell, are you going to zip me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, but don\u2019t think I can.\u201d Flo tugged. \u201cSorry, Glory, but there is more you than there is dress. Have you weighed tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I was afraid to.\u201d I picked up the webcam and looked at the front of the dress. I loved the way the dress plunged. And the color was perfect with my skin and hair. The jewelry, shoes, everything about the outfit made me look like the lady I\u2019d always yearned to be when I\u2019d first met Jerry way back when. Oh, crap. Was that what this was all about?</p><p>Yeah, probably was. I wanted to walk down that carpet on Ray\u2019s arm and look like a first-class lady. The kind any man would be proud to be seen with. Maybe have Jerry get jealous and his mother finally admit that I wasn\u2019t the lowborn whore she\u2019d always called me. In this dress, I could greet the queen and not be ashamed. I saw the sheen of tears in my eyes and ordered myself to dry up. Enough of dreams and looking back. This wasn\u2019t going to happen without drastic action.</p><p>\u201cSuck it in, Glory. I think I can force it.\u201d Flo pulled on the fabric.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t! It might tear.\u201d I stroked the skirt and realized I had no choice if I wanted to wear this dress. And I really wanted to wear this one. \u201cI\u2019m calling Ian.\u201d I picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Flo put her hand on mine. \u201cYou know I have no problem with you drinking from some mortal. All for it. But his special stuff.\u201d She made a face. \u201cIf it makes you do strange things, like walk around and get in the sun. Mia amica, it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the last time, Flo. And I\u2019ve got Valdez to keep me from walking into the sun.\u201d I glanced at the closed bedroom door. Not back yet. I hoped I had Valdez. What if he and Ray landed at MacDonald\u2019s stronghold and got into it with the guards? A dozen scenarios flashed through my mind, all of them ending badly. No, couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m resigned. After this, I have to just let nature take its course. Which means it\u2019s back to the old Glory size and shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more of Ian\u2019s drinks?\u201d Flo tried on a pair of the diamond earrings and studied herself in the webcam. \u201cIf it\u2019s money that\u2019s stopping you, I can always help you out.\u201d She looked at me, her eyes shining. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you? If this is something you truly want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, dear friend.\u201d I hugged her. \u201cYour money is better spent on those earrings for yourself. Or make Richard buy them for you. They look great on you. Valentine\u2019s Day is coming up. The name of the jeweler is on the box.\u201d I sighed. \u201cNow, let me call Ian. While I\u2019m at it, I\u2019m going to ask if he\u2019s seen Ray. Or Jerry, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremiah?\u201d Flo stopped in the act of trying on a necklace. \u201cWhy would he go to see Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill him. And he\u2019d take the entire Campbell Clan with him. Remember the feud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird\u2019s in town?\u201d Flo dropped the necklace and jumped up. \u201cThis is not good. I must take Richard and leave here. We should go back to Austin. Or maybe take a little honeymoon trip to Tahiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think Flo was actually scared of something.</p><p>\u201cWell, in a stupid fit of honesty and wanting to have open communication, I told Richard about a little affair I had once.\u201d Flo took off the diamond earrings and spat a few Italian words as she paced the bedroom floor. \u201cDamn those TV talk shows. I should not listen to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd am I right in thinking the laird, the laird of Clan Campbell, was the man you played footsie with?\u201d I had to smile. So Mag, the very superior witch of the castle, had been betrayed by her beloved husband. This was too sweet.</p><p>\u201cMore than our feet were playing, Glory. And it was long ago. My name was totally different then. I can\u2019t even remember for sure what I called myself.\u201d Flo helped me pull off the red dress and hang it up.</p><p>\u201cSo why would Richard care about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I made the mistake of saying I\u2019d had a grand passion for Angus. That he had been the only man to ever really satisfy me before Richard came along.\u201d Flo opened her purse and pulled out her lipstick. \u201cNot true, of course. But I was telling a story, enjoying the way Richard was getting jealous. You know?\u201d</p><p>I knew Flo and her little dramas. I could imagine that she had embellished the hell out of the thing. By the time she\u2019d gotten through telling the tale, she and Angus had worked their way through a plaid version of the Kama Sutra, accompanied by bagpipes. No wonder she didn\u2019t want Richard to meet him. Well acquainted with Flo and her appetites, Richard would want to make sure Angus knew that his wife was off the market, permanently. And the Angus I remembered didn\u2019t like to be told anything.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mag know about this affair?\u201d</p><p>Flo jumped and smeared her lipstick. \u201cOf course not! We are dear friends. It would be like if I had a little fling with your Jeremiah.\u201d She got up and grabbed my hand. \u201cWhich I have not. I swear on the blessed Virgin that I have not, Glory.\u201d She crossed herself for good measure and looked skyward.</p><p>\u201cMagdalena cannot know. The only reason Angus and I got together was that he and his wife were taking a break. They hadn\u2019t lived together for, oh, decades then. And Angus was so charming.\u201d Flo got a faraway look in her eyes. \u201cI tell you, Glory, if Jeremiah is anything like his father? Mio Dio, what a lover.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut I moved on and now my Ricardo is everything to me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine the stern Scot Angus Campbell I knew, who made sure the women in his Clan were \u201cprotected\u201d just like they\u2019d always been in the Middle Ages, as a wild man in bed, but I just smiled and nodded. Hey, Jerry certainly drove me wild and had that protective gene too.</p><p>\u201cRichard and Angus can\u2019t come within shouting distance of each other. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. So I guess that means you\u2019ll be leaving L.A. as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Richard has been telling me he needs to get back to Austin for some business of his mother\u2019s. So I guess that means no honeymoon right now.\u201d Flo tapped her chin. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll tell Richard you need us to hurry back to help with some crisis at your little shop. You have one, don\u2019t you? You usually do.\u201d She smiled, like this was a good thing.</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. So glad I could help. I just had to fire one of my weekend night clerks. You can go work for me. How\u2019s that?\u201d I grinned, knowing that Florence da Vinci Mainwaring had never clerked in a store a day in her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Even if I have to\u201d\u2014she shuddered\u2014\u201cmake change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Take off. Tell Richard I begged you to help me. Pack and arrange to ship your clothes home. You and Rich can shift out of here right after sunset tomorrow. Sorry you\u2019ll miss the Grammys, though. Ray got you seats in the balcony, first row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m sad and upset. I\u2019ll watch you on TV. Everyone in your shop will watch with me.\u201d Flo hugged me. \u201cYou really are my best friend. But I must save my marriage. If the whole Clan is here with Angus, Richard might get hurt if he tries to start something. I can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. So go. I\u2019ll call Ian and see if he\u2019s got someone to send me.\u201d I sat on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right? When will Valdez be back?\u201d Flo paused in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cAny minute, I\u2019m sure. Head out. I\u2019m fine.\u201d I waved her out and hit speed dial for Ian. I heard the hall door close just as Ian picked up.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I was hoping to hear from you. I took the liberty of going ahead and sending someone to you. He should be there momentarily.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Ian. I\u2019m cutting it pretty close to dawn.\u201d I glanced at the clock. \u201cUh, have you seen Ray tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he just left here. We had a nice talk. And I sold him a new supplement to try.\u201d Ian chuckled. \u201cRelax, Glory. I can practically hear you grinding your teeth through the phone. Ray\u2019s being cautious. I told him to wait until after his awards show to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just swell of you, Ian. Thanks a lot.\u201d I shut the phone before I could say more. When there was a knock on the hall door, I threw a robe on over my underwear and went to answer it. I looked through the peephole and saw a tall handsome man standing there. Oh, yeah, Ian had said the mortal he had sent was a \u201che.\u201d Hmm.</p> <p>I heard a moan from Nathan\u2019s bedroom. Okay. Still action going on in there, apparently. And now I had my own boy toy. My game was definitely not anything Nate and his playmate would imagine playing.</p><p>A mere mortal? Sure, I could handle him. I\u2019d just have to make certain this guy didn\u2019t come with a stake in his pocket. I threw open the door and looked him over. Cute. So the search wouldn\u2019t be a hardship. At all.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>His name was Bart. Short for Bartholomew. He was out of breath from running up twenty-two flights of stairs per Ian\u2019s instructions. He glowed with good health and reeked of AB negative. I was beginning to wonder if every vampire in town had a Glory dossier. I might as well put up a Facebook page with my favorite things and be done with it. Bonus points for Bart. He was about to jump out of his gel-pumped running shoes he was so eager to do whatever my little fangs desired. Another vamp groupie.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep this simple, Bart. Just sit next to me on the couch and hand me your wrist.\u201d I kept one eye on the balcony and one on Nate\u2019s bedroom door. I was about to take my donor into my bedroom, when he stepped a little too close and eyed my cleavage. No, we\u2019d stay out here.</p> <p>If Ray\u2019s buddy and his date came out and caught me with my fangs down, I\u2019d just whammy the woman and be done with it. Nate had seen it all before and it grossed him out unless he thought it was vamp foreplay and he was the player who was finally going to get into my bed. Long story.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ms. St. Clair, if you\u2019d just take me at the neck, I\u2019d be really, really grateful. Or I could make you feel good, if you know what I mean.\u201d Bart ventured a hand toward where my robe had slipped open over my knees.</p><p>I froze him with a look that said \u201cstop\u201d and made sure my robe covered me down to my ankles. \u201cI already feel just fine, thank you, Bart. I\u2019m sure Ian explained that you\u2019re just a donor here. I have a man in my life, a fianc\u00e9, who gives me everything I need in that other department.\u201d Had Ian been pimping as well as providing his other services? Jeez.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get it.\u201d Bart managed to look suitably crushed, but he still wasn\u2019t giving up on the neck thing. He ripped his tank top off over his head and tossed it on the floor.</p><p>Wow. First Nate, now Bart. I was getting a clinic on how a buff male bod should look. Not that Jerry and Ray weren\u2019t built. They were. But neither had been fanatics about working out in their mortal lives. And Valdez . . . The times I\u2019d seen him in the altogether had been brief and I\u2019d tried not to stare because it would have been violating some kind of friendship thing. If there was a next time, though, I was going to have to do the full tour. I shook off the thought and focused.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Bart?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing you don\u2019t want, Ms. St. Clair. Ian says I\u2019m your very favorite blood type. Is he right?\u201d Bart stared at me with green eyes the color of old money. His dark hair was cut short and he either shaved his chest or didn\u2019t grow hair anywhere but on his head. Oops, I was checking out his body again.</p><p>\u201cIan\u2019s right. So what?\u201d I picked up his wrist and inhaled. Oh, man, but I loved his type. My fangs zipped into position.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing you a favor, aren\u2019t I? Why not hold me close and hit me in the jugular?\u201d Bart smiled, an even dimmer bulb than Trina had been.</p><p>Didn\u2019t these mortals have anything more in their lives than an obsession with vampires? I read Bart\u2019s mind\u2014except for an interest in what I might or might not be wearing under my terry robe, apparently not.</p><p>\u201cListen, Bart. I\u2019ve had a rough night. Sorry if this isn\u2019t the joyride you fantasized about, but I\u2019m hoping Ian compensates you well for this. Now, let\u2019s get this over with. Where\u2019s my supplement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you\u2019ll kiss me first and let me feel your fangs with my tongue.\u201d Bart leaned toward me, mouth open like a trout going for the goodies on the end of a hook.</p><p>That did it. I used the whammy, then checked the backpack Bart had worn in to the suite and pulled out the distinctive bottle of my supplement. I set it on the coffee table, then turned to fish face.</p><p>\u201cNow, Bart, you\u2019re going to give me your wrist. Feel lucky I didn\u2019t rip out your throat for being so insolent to a badass vampire. Now, snap out of it.\u201d I kept my face stern as he blinked, then shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. St. Clair. Please don\u2019t tell the master that I spoke to you like that.\u201d He held out his arm, his hand shaking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our little secret, Bart. But I want to warn you.\u201d I held his wrist and showed him that my fangs were full out. \u201cVampires come in all shapes and sizes and we may not look dangerous, but we always are. I could have taken offense just now. And, if my fianc\u00e9 had heard you . . .\u201d I faked a shudder. \u201cHe\u2019d have tossed you right off that balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t think . . .\u201d He glanced at the balcony, suddenly pale. \u201cYou won\u2019t say anything to him, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you just hush and let me get on with this.\u201d I pulled his wrist to my lips.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He closed his eyes when I sank my teeth into the sweet spot and drew. \u201cOh, my God, but this is the good part. Uh, excuse me. I\u2019ll shut up now.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t about to stop what I was doing to chitchat. I enjoyed the rush. I\u2019d forgotten to weigh myself before Bart had arrived, but I knew my target weight for tomorrow night. If this and the supplement got me there, then the red dress should fit perfectly. After that, it was home to Austin and back to the old Glory.</p><p>I felt the surge that told me I\u2019d probably had enough and pulled out, licking the punctures closed and patting Bart on the shoulder. He didn\u2019t open his eyes and I leaned closer, touching his cheek to make sure I hadn\u2019t accidentally taken too much.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Are you picking up mortals and bringing them home with you now, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew she was a whore. Look at him, almost naked. Bet it isn\u2019t just his blood she enjoyed. What did I tell you, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Ma. Da, let Glory explain.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and saw Jerry and his parents on the balcony. Oh, boy. My warning to Bart could not have been more timely. Mag looked like a thirtysomething schoolmistress with her stern mouth and sharp features. Her green and black wrap dress and high heels, though, could have come straight out of the pages of a glossy fashion magazine.</p><p>Angus, the laird of Clan Campbell, was a slightly shorter and sturdier version of Jerry with the same dark hair and dark eyes. Father and son could have passed for brothers. But that was the way of the Campbell men, turned vampire when they hit the age of thirty. Both of them wore dark cotton shirts and jeans but Jerry\u2019s were obviously Rodeo Drive and hugged his butt, while Angus could have benefited from a tighter fit.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t have noticed that. Not with the hard stares I was getting from two out of three on the balcony. Of course my Jerry still defended me and tried to look calm and unconcerned, even though he probably didn\u2019t like the scene they\u2019d stumbled upon any more than his parents did.</p><p>I stood and jerked Bart to his feet. He quickly recovered, his eyes bugging out when he saw the group on the balcony. That convinced me he\u2019d been faking weakness to try to get some sympathy from me and maybe a little mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>\u201cMy donor was just leaving.\u201d I handed Bart his shirt and backpack, dragged him to the door and shoved him out into the hall. \u201cTell Ian thanks. You were fine. No complaints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Bye.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the door and locked it, then glanced at Nate\u2019s closed bedroom door. \u201cThere are two mortals in there. Maybe this isn\u2019t a good time or place for this, uh, meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to do, lass. We need to know more about Ian MacDonald and apparently you\u2019ve been consorting with him and his minions.\u201d Angus nodded toward the hall door. \u201cThat mortal bein\u2019 one of them if I read him aright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s harmless. A blood donor, nothing more. Ian has several on his payroll.\u201d I gestured toward my bedroom. Of course Angus had read Bart\u2019s mind. They all had. And Mag knew I hadn\u2019t been whoring with the idiot. I gave her a cool look.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go into my bedroom. At least we won\u2019t be in danger of anyone walking in on us. Jerry?\u201d I held my hand out to him.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gloriana. I\u2019m sorry we had to drop in on you like this, but my parents were in a hurry to get this thing with MacDonald going.\u201d Jerry took my hand and dropped a kiss on my lips. \u201cAre you all right? You look flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m just a little high. Ian\u2019s donors come after exercising. It gives you a rush. Something to do with endorphins.\u201d I glanced at Jerry\u2019s mother. \u201cYou should try it sometime, Mag. Since you make a habit of drinking from mortals anyway. As you know, it\u2019s not my usual thing.\u201d I grabbed my supplement and led the way into the bedroom. Once there with the door safely closed, I pointed to the two chairs grouped around a table in the corner.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bring a strange mortal into my home, Gloriana. It\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d Mag looked at the king-size bed and sniffed. \u201cThis is the room you share with that Israel Caine, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She smiled at Jerry. \u201cI hear you\u2019re engaged to him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sham, Ma. I told you that.\u201d Jerry looked everywhere but at the bed.</p><p>\u201cShe wears his ring.\u201d Mag nodded toward my left hand.</p><p>\u201cWindow dressing. We had a Grammy thing tonight.\u201d I pulled it off and set it on the dresser. \u201cNow, please, Angus, Mag, won\u2019t you sit?\u201d I\u2019d just about quit calling them lord and lady over a century ago. It didn\u2019t seem to win me any points and Jerry had said it was okay to drop the titles. Being in America had given us both a new perspective on the whole royalty issue. The fact that it bugged the hell out of Mag when I didn\u2019t bother to give her the proper \u201crespect\u201d just sweetened the deal.</p> <p>Angus and Mag sat. Jerry gestured that I should sit beside him on the bed facing them. Well, why not? Guess Jerry had decided he was going to make the bed his turf now. So I sat, well aware that I was at a disadvantage in my robe and not much else. But the looks on their faces didn\u2019t give me time for a wardrobe change.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d I\u2019d be cooperative for Jerry\u2019s sake, but I wasn\u2019t about to offer information they didn\u2019t ask for.</p><p>\u201cAny idea how many men MacDonald has?\u201d Angus leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cThe most I\u2019ve seen is six bodyguards. They all look like surfers.\u201d I saw a puzzled frown on both Mag\u2019s and Angus\u2019s faces. \u201cTanned, blond, built. Like they spent a lot of time in the sun in their mortal lives. Anyway, they hang out on the beach in front of Ian\u2019s house. They\u2019re all vampires. I don\u2019t believe I saw a single shifter or other kind of paranormal in his crew. But he may have some as day guards. Just like I do.\u201d Which reminded me that Valdez wasn\u2019t back. I threw up a block. Oops. Too late. Jerry gave me a narrow-eyed look but, with his parents there, I knew the questions would come later.</p><p>\u201cAny other security?\u201d Jerry pulled a knife from the scabbard on his belt and toyed with it. \u201cDid you see any weapons?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? You think he would display stakes or something?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cHonestly, you guys need to rethink this. Ian is all about the future. He\u2019s computerized, on the Web. He\u2019s not going to worry about the Campbells. He\u2019s too busy trying to figure out how to stay awake during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say.\u201d Angus glanced at his wife. \u201cOnly a fool would believe in such a claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, Angus, but I\u2019ve seen a video. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s not some kind of fabrication, but Ray\u2014Israel Caine, the vampire I\u2019m mentoring\u2014believes in it so strongly he\u2019s willing to try Ian\u2019s special supplements.\u201d I sighed, leaned on Jerry a minute and felt his arm go around me. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll go up in flames, but Ian swears his stuff works. That he\u2019s been out during the day himself and lived to tell the tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Vampires out in daylight? It\u2019s a fantasy we\u2019ve all had, to see the sun again, but know better than to believe in. Especially coming from the likes of a MacDonald.\u201d Mag jumped up. \u201cAngus, maybe we won\u2019t have to risk an attack. Bide your time and this MacDonald will destroy himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, Ma.\u201d Jerry squeezed my shoulders. \u201cValdez tells me that Glory has been taking Ian\u2019s potions and has actually been awake during the day already. Haven\u2019t you, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I said it in a small voice, not sure I wanted to be Exhibit A with Mag and Angus staring a hole in me. I had a vivid memory of being burned at the stake as a witch. Not a dream, a nightmare. Never really happened.</p> <p>Mag approached me and I stood, not willing to be loomed over by her.</p><p>\u201cYou saw it. You saw the sun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid to actually look at it directly, Mag. But I did see the light from it around the curtains. I was awake after sunrise. The sunshine burned me when I stepped into it.\u201d I met her gaze. \u201cIt was strange and, I admit, awesome. I never thought it could happen again. That I\u2019d see daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d Mag slapped me across my face, rocking me back.</p><p>I balled up my fist and landed a good one right on her pointy chin, relishing her screech of outrage. Jerry threw himself between us. Was he protecting her or me?</p><p>\u201cYou bitch! I will never let you hit me again. You even haunt my nightmares!\u201d I dove for her, but Jerry grabbed me around the waist.</p><p>Angus grabbed Mag\u2019s arm, obviously stunned into silence.</p><p>\u201cFilthy whore! Lowborn slut! Jeremiah never should have brought you into our home.\u201d Mag held her jaw and sobbed.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Ma!\u201d Jerry held me against his chest when I tried to go after her again. \u201cCalm down, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe started it, Jerry. I wasn\u2019t lying and you know it.\u201d I shoved back and stomped to the far side of the bed, still pumped. I hoped Mag came after me again. I wanted to pound her into the carpet. Hit her until she wept and begged my forgiveness and admitted I was good enough for Jerry. I felt my nails digging into my palms and took a calming breath.</p><p>\u201cMother, listen to me!\u201d Jerry grabbed his mother\u2019s shoulders, pushing her away from me when she started forward again. \u201cGlory tells the truth. Valdez was there. He saved her from more harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019s the pity.\u201d Mag snarled. \u201cThey are probably lovers, Jeremiah. The shifter would say anything for her. When are you going to realize what this woman is?\u201d She turned to Angus. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting our time here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s best you leave. I\u2019ll see you at the hotel later.\u201d Jerry exchanged looks with his father before his parents stalked from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYes, get out, Mag. I\u2019ll be happy if I never see you again.\u201d I followed them to the bedroom door. Mag just sniffed, like she couldn\u2019t be bothered to reply to the ravings of a commoner. I collapsed on the bed when Jerry closed the bedroom door again. Damn. I guess I\u2019d never be a lady. But then, who\u2019d thrown the first punch? Not me. Not very ladylike of Mag, was it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. My mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother hates me. Nothing new there.\u201d I rubbed my throbbing cheek, coming down off my high with a vengeance. \u201cShe still packs a wallop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared the hell out of her.\u201d Jerry sat beside me and gathered me in his arms.</p><p>\u201cScared? Mag Campbell?\u201d I laughed and leaned against Jerry.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Glory. If the MacDonalds have the secret to staying awake during the day, we\u2019re lost. We\u2019d have to hire an army of shifters to protect us.\u201d Jerry rested his chin on my hair. \u201cAnd, sorry, but I\u2019ve yet to meet one I totally trust. Including your current Valdez.\u201d</p><p>That got me. I didn\u2019t, or actually couldn\u2019t, say anything. Because I knew what was coming. Where was my trusty bodyguard right now? The man who was never to leave my side under any circumstances? Oh, yeah. Off chasing after my fake fianc\u00e9. And it was close to dawn. If Valdez didn\u2019t make it back by then, where did that leave me? We both heard the hall door open and close and we jumped up.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I sniffed the air. \u201cBrittany.\u201d I smiled. \u201cShe can watch over me during the day if Valdez doesn\u2019t get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack from where, Glory?\u201d Jerry lifted my chin until I stared into his eyes. \u201cYou know damned good and well he has strict orders not to leave you alone. Not unless I\u2019m with you. Yet I found you with a strange mortal, unguarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mortal was clearly harmless. And Valdez followed Ray for me. I was desperate, Jerry. Ray was upset, bound and determined to go out to Ian\u2019s place to see about the daylight thing. I was going to follow him myself but Valdez forbade it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. You shouldn\u2019t be so foolish. Never should have gone out there in the first place. As I\u2019ve told you more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I know.\u201d I held up a hand to forestall another lecture. I\u2019d had enough of them. \u201cJust spare me, okay?\u201d I opened the bedroom door. Brittany stood on the balcony. She turned when she saw Jerry and me in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be back any minute. He followed Ray tonight. Since you weren\u2019t here.\u201d I frowned at her. \u201cWhere were you anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Caine told me to take the night off. So I did.\u201d Brittany crossed her arms over her ample chest. \u201cUnlike Rafe, I do try to maintain a decent life away from the job.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cThey\u2019re coming, both of them.\u201d She stepped back. \u201cGood thing too. You\u2019ve only got about a half hour till dawn.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jerry. \u201cThat means you\u2019d better go.\u201d Too much to hope that I could get him out of there before Valdez and Ray dropped out of the sky.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d He smiled grimly. \u201cNot before I have a word with, um, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>Too late anyway. First one bat, then another landed on the balcony. One morphed into a man, the other into a Labradoodle dog.</p><p>\u201cI see you entertained while I was gone, Glory.\u201d Ray scowled and strode into the living room. He pulled a small bottle from his pants pocket and set it on the bar.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly entertaining. Jerry and his parents dropped by for some information about Ian.\u201d I gasped when Jerry squeezed my waist. Oops, maybe I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell that. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who wants to see the sun, you know.\u201d I looked back at Jerry. Had that been a nice save or what?</p><p>\u201cGive me a break. I know about your feud, Blade.\u201d Ray sat in a chair and kicked off his shoes. \u201cSo your parents are in town. The head of the Clan. I\u2019d better let Ian know to run for his life or call up his own clan and prepare for battle.\u201d</p><p>Jerry crossed the room in a blur of motion and had Ray up by his shirt in an instant. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands off, Blade.\u201d Brittany held a stake against Jerry\u2019s back, right where it could go through to his heart. \u201cMr. Caine pays me to keep him safe. If I have to turn you to dust, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrit, put that damned thing down.\u201d Valdez stood next to her, every sharp tooth in his mouth showing and he was clearly poised to spring. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to get ugly, but I\u2019ll tear off your arm if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, all of you.\u201d I tried to push myself between Ray and Jerry. Not happening now that Ray had both hands wrapped around Jerry\u2019s neck and was doing his best to break it. Jerry\u2019s face was turning red but he couldn\u2019t move. Not with a stake pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not backing off, Rafe. You put one claw on me and Blade\u2019s gone.\u201d Brittany\u2019s hand stayed steady and she didn\u2019t once look at Valdez. \u201cMr. Caine, say the word and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p> <p>Ray glanced at me. I could see his mind working. Yep, this was his chance to get rid of his rival. I let Ray see that if he ordered Blade killed, he\u2019d lose any hope of being with me. That I\u2019d be out of his life forever. Not that I really believed that was a deal breaker. But I had to give it a shot.</p><p>\u201cJerry, let him go. You can talk this out like reasonable men.\u201d I tried again to get between them, jerking on Jerry\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cRay, tell Brit to put down the stake.\u201d I hit Ray\u2019s back. No answer. Reasonable? Forget it. These were two damned stubborn men hell-bent on killing each other.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what happened next. Blame it on the weight-loss gig or emotional overload. I have no idea. But next thing I knew, I was on the floor sobbing my heart out. Yep, big boo hoos. Loud and obnoxious enough to bring Nathan to his bedroom door to peek out. What he saw sent him right back inside, and we all heard his lock click. Where was strong, self-reliant Glory now? Guess when both the men I loved were at risk, all my tough talk was just that. I tried to stop crying, but obviously Mag\u2019s slap had jarred something loose in my tiny brain and I was stuck in \u201cpoor me\u201d mode.</p><p>Jerry swore bitterly and released Ray. Ray let his hands slide off of Jerry\u2019s neck. He nodded to Brittany and she lowered the stake. Valdez didn\u2019t move, still not convinced the action wouldn\u2019t escalate again.</p> <p>I just kept crying. I couldn\u2019t see any way out of this mess. Of course Ray wanted Ian to live. The man was a friggin\u2019 genius who might be able to give vampires sunlight someday. Even the Neanderthal-throwback Campbells probably wanted to see the light for themselves. And of course Jerry wanted to kill Ian. It was as natural as breathing for a Campbell to hate a MacDonald. Rational thought didn\u2019t enter into the equation.</p><p>Jerry knelt on one side of me and Ray on the other.</p><p>\u201cGloriana. Stop yer bawling, lass. The she-shifter didn\u2019t stake me.\u201d Jerry tried to pull me into his arms, but I shook my head and held him off.</p><p>\u201cGlory, baby, come on, now. We stopped fighting. See?\u201d Ray rubbed my back until I raised my head and iced him with a look that made him snatch his hand away.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her, both of you. She\u2019s finally had enough.\u201d Valdez pushed between the two of them. \u201cCome on, Glory. Get up and sit on the couch. Your eyes are red and your nose is running. One of you get her a box of tissues.\u201d</p><p>I sniffled and leaned on my bodyguard to get up. Seemed I\u2019d accidentally restored some sort of order. Of course, I\u2019d lost points on the \u201cstrong, independent Glory\u201d scale. But at least the two men in my life had quit trying to kill each other and Brittany had put that horrible stake out of sight. I waved away any other offers of help and settled on the couch, accepting tissues from Brittany and wiping my eyes and nose.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, both of you, get away from me and sit over there.\u201d I gestured at the chairs on the other side of the room, frowning away first Jerry\u2019s, then Ray\u2019s, attempt to sit beside me on the couch. \u201cNot you either, Rafe. I\u2019ve had it with all of you.\u201d I sniffed, then gave Brittany a hard look. \u201cNot too fond of you either, Brit. You carry a stake? Would you use it on me if Ray asked you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot answering that.\u201d Brit held up her hand and glanced at Valdez. \u201cBut I\u2019m hired to do a job. Mr. Caine\u2019s a vampire who might be attacked by another vampire. I have to carry a stake. Blade, you put Rafe at a hell of a disadvantage requiring that dog body. I guess you know that.\u201d She focused on Jerry. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, if you ask me. Either you trust your woman or you don\u2019t. And if you don\u2019t, why the hell are you paying the freight for a full-time bodyguard?\u201d With that, she stepped out on the balcony and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cGood point, Blade. Something I\u2019ve said to Glory more than once.\u201d Ray leaned back in one of the club chairs and smiled. \u201cTime to face facts. The way you\u2019ve been treating this woman is criminal. No wonder she\u2019s leaning toward cutting you loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, shut up,\u201d I said this calmly when I wanted to smack that stupid smile right off his handsome face. \u201cJerry, which way I lean is not the point. And Brittany was way out of line. My relationship with either one of you is not up for discussion. I\u2019m worried about Ian MacDonald and this feud with the Campbells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, Gloriana. It\u2019ll be over soon enough.\u201d Jerry frowned at Ray. \u201cAnd how I treat my woman is none of your damned business, Caine. I\u2019ve managed to keep her for over four hundred years. You\u2019ve known her less than one. Don\u2019t think that makes you an expert on what she wants or needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, stop! The feud won\u2019t be over. There are MacDonalds all over the world. There will be retaliations just like there always are. You simply cannot attack Ian MacDonald.\u201d Now I was pissed. Mr. Expert on Glory didn\u2019t have a freakin\u2019 clue. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t \u2018kept\u2019 me for four hundred years. Seems like we\u2019re off as much as we\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Ray\u2019s eyes gleamed and he leaned forward. \u201cNow I get the Valdez deal. Blade needs to keep tabs on you, Glory. In case you get away from him again.\u201d</p><p>I could see Jerry\u2019s steam rising, fists clenching, jaw like iron. \u201cCan we get back to this Ian MacDonald thing?\u201d</p> <p>Jerry reluctantly gave up trying to stare a hole in Ray and turned to me. \u201cWhat about him? You described his pitiful defense. I\u2019ve got more men and the element of surprise. Tomorrow night will be the end of that worthless sod.\u201d He whipped around and glared at Ray. \u201cAnd you will not warn him. I\u2019ll make sure of that if I have to lock you in a lead-lined coffin until after the battle is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so scared.\u201d Ray laughed.</p><p>Fool. Didn\u2019t he realize that Jerry could do just that? But maybe I hadn\u2019t told Ray we were vulnerable to the lead-lined thing. Yep. Vamps can\u2019t get out through lead, no matter how much strength we\u2019ve got. Forget the myths about silver. It\u2019s lead that stymies us. But never mind that. I needed to convince Jerry that Ian had to live.</p><p>\u201cI heard your mother tonight, Jerry. I\u2019ll bet both your parents want to see the sun again.\u201d I leaned forward. So what if my robe gapped open to flash some boob? I carry my own weapons and know how to use them. Remember, I had three virile men in the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course they would. What vampire wouldn\u2019t? They\u2019re a little more ancient than I am. The three of us are over five hundred years old.\u201d Jerry sneered at Ray. \u201cAll of it spent in the dark. Best get used to it, Caine. The rest of us have. Instead of chasing silly dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re silly dreams?\u201d Ray smiled slowly. \u201cAsk me about that after the Grammys. I\u2019ve got a potion here that Ian says will keep me awake during the day. Hell, Glory\u2019s already seen daylight, haven\u2019t you, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it was an accident. Ian\u2019s claims of having a formula that could help vampires see the day, Jerry, may be true.\u201d I couldn\u2019t sit still a moment longer. I got up and walked around the coffee table to pick up the small bottle Ray had brought from Ian\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what this will do for Ray.\u201d I turned to him. \u201cAnd I hope like hell you\u2019ll be careful with it. But it\u2019s a beginning, Jerry. Ian\u2019s on to something. He\u2019s not the worthless sod you take him for.\u201d</p><p>Jerry actually looked thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Blade. I told you she stayed awake after the sun came up. Wide-awake, not just sleepwalking.\u201d Valdez nodded toward Ray. \u201cOf course she got burned when the sunlight hit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so far it\u2019s just looking at sunlight, not actually letting it touch you. But Ian said he\u2019s working on a special sunscreen. He\u2019s tried it on himself, but, like Glory, suffered painful burns.\u201d Ray jumped up. \u201cSeriously, Glory. I\u2019m not stupid or suicidal. I just want to see some daylight. I\u2019m going to try this, see if I can stay awake first. That\u2019s a big freakin\u2019 deal, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Just be careful. It would be so easy to get carried away.\u201d I waved toward the balcony. \u201cYou be sure Brittany is there to take care of you. To keep you from forgetting what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. A Master of the Night.\u201d Ray laughed and sat again. \u201cThat Chip Rollins. He\u2019s a jerk, but he got me to thinking anyway. Even with your watchdog here tailing me, it was cool flying back and forth to Malibu while mortals were fighting traffic down below me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Valdez and I need to discuss that later. But you met Chip?\u201d Jerry was up and pacing the way he did when he had a lot on his mind.</p><p>\u201cAt the party tonight. He owns Ray\u2019s recording company. I didn\u2019t tell him I\u2019d been to two of his houses.\u201d I smiled at Ray. \u201cChip\u2019s into real estate. Jerry showed me two of Chip\u2019s fabulous houses he\u2019s got for sale. One near the beach and one in the Hollywood Hills.\u201d</p><p>Ray frowned, quickly figuring out why Jerry had taken me to a vacant house. \u201cInteresting. Guess if I decide to stay in town, I\u2019ll know who to call for a place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think MacDonald will make this drug for vampires safe to use?\u201d Jerry stopped next to me, his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But, Jerry, he\u2019s not plotting ways to kill Campbells. He\u2019s a businessman. If you guys are on his radar at all, it\u2019s because he knows the Campbells are rich. You\u2019re his kind of clients. He\u2019d like nothing more than to sell you some product. He sure wouldn\u2019t let an ancient feud stand in the way of making a profit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that for sure, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry started pacing again. \u201cDa is hot to go after Ian. He\u2019s the MacDonald heir, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith vampires that doesn\u2019t mean a lot, us being immortal and all. I\u2019m sure Ian\u2019s not worrying about leading his clan someday.\u201d I paced right along with Jerry. \u201cThink, Jerry. If you were right and Ian knew all along that you and I were together, then he willingly let me have the diet stuff anyway. And it didn\u2019t kill me. It worked. Made me lose an incredible amount of weight in time for the Grammys just like I wanted.\u201d I glanced at Ray. \u201cBecause Ray paid him big bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend me the bill, Caine.\u201d Jerry stopped and pulled me tight against him. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me plenty to think about, Gloriana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want the bill, you got it.\u201d Ray stood and yawned. \u201cNow you\u2019d better get the hell out of here. Dawn\u2019s only minutes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess than that, boss.\u201d Valdez walked over to the balcony and tapped it with his paw. Brittany opened the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can make it back to your hotel in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here. We\u2019re dead after dawn anyway.\u201d I looked at Ray.</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell.\u201d He headed into the bedroom, pulling off his shirt as he went.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ray. What can it hurt?\u201d I followed him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not, Gloriana. Maybe there\u2019s a vacancy in the hotel.\u201d Jerry stayed right behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have time to check in and arrange that. Besides, I know for a fact the place is booked solid. I heard the desk clerk on the phone when we walked through the lobby tonight.\u201d I sighed when Ray dropped his pants.</p><p>Jerry growled as I knew he would. \u201cWhat the hell is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans nothing, Jerry. Ignore him. I do.\u201d I slid my hand down Jerry\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Jerry smiled and unbuttoned his shirt, flinging it on the chair behind him. Then he deliberately pulled off his belt and set his knife and scabbard on the nightstand. When he went to work on his jeans, Ray growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGetting ready for bed.\u201d Jerry grinned, dropped his jeans on the floor and stepped out of them.</p><p>Wow, did I ever have a view. Two hunky men standing on either side of a king-size bed in nothing but their underwear. Jerry favored briefs and had worn black stretchy ones that left nothing to the imagination. Not that I needed one. I\u2019d seen his stuff thousands of times. Yeah.</p><p>\u201cGlory, your mouth is open. Want us to go head-to-head?\u201d Ray grinned. \u201cOr will your old man there be exposing his shortcomings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God!\u201d Jerry roared.</p><p>\u201cRay, behave. I\u2019m sleeping in the middle. Vampires have to stick together and this is an emergency. No one will be naked.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my gown from a drawer and ran into the bathroom.</p><p>The silence coming from the bedroom was deafening. I quickly brushed my teeth, washed my face, then decided to slap on some makeup again since I was sleeping with two hot guys. I emerged in my floor-length, totally unsexy gown and saw Ray in his usual spot on the bed. Jerry stood on the other side, glaring at Ray.</p><p>\u201cThis is not going to work, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry snarled when Ray patted the spot next to him.</p> <p>\u201cCuddle up next to me, baby.\u201d Ray grinned at Jerry. \u201cBlade, why don\u2019t you just lay on the floor. Dead men don\u2019t care where they lie, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ray, be nice. Jerry can sleep on my other side.\u201d I picked up my bottle of supplement and opened it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that you\u2019re drinking?\u201d Jerry made a grab for it.</p><p>I skipped out of reach. \u201cI have to lose the pounds I gained yesterday. This will take care of it. Don\u2019t mess with me, Jerry. This is important. I know which dress I want to wear and I won\u2019t fit into it otherwise.\u201d I quickly drained the bottle.</p><p>\u201cValdez!\u201d Jerry shouted and I jumped.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d Valdez appeared in the open doorway.</p><p>\u201cI want this door locked. But if Gloriana somehow does her day walking and gets out of here, make sure she doesn\u2019t harm herself. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Valdez looked at me. \u201cDid you drink some more of Ian\u2019s shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And don\u2019t give me a hard time about it. It\u2019s too late. Done deal. Now, do as Jerry said. I\u2019m counting on you. And I\u2019ll take care of the door.\u201d I walked over and shut the door myself, then turned the lock.</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel the dawn coming but I could tell that both men were just about out for the count. So I pretended that I was conking out too. I yawned and stretched, gratified that both watched my chest rise and fall. Then I crawled into bed, leaving a few inches between me and Ray. Jerry climbed in beside me, making a big deal out of taking me in his arms. In moments, both he and Ray were goners.</p><p>I slipped out of Jerry\u2019s arms and lay there, staring at the ceiling and waiting for Ian\u2019s death sleep to come. I\u2019d left the bathroom door open and could see the lightening sky around the edges of the curtains again. Magic. This time I was going to appreciate it. I crept out of bed, though I could have ridden an elephant out of there with accompanying trumpets and the guys wouldn\u2019t have heard it. I walked into the bathroom and carefully raised the edge of the curtain.</p><p>There it was. The pinks, pale blues and yellows of the dawn. For the first time in over four hundred years I saw the beginning of a new day. I leaned against the marble counter and wept. Silly, but I cried for my lost mortality. I\u2019d given up so many things for love. For the first time I realized I might be able to get at least one of them back.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>I woke up before sunset. I knew it in my bones. Cool. Even more cool was lying there, the filling in a man sandwich. I could reach out and touch a perfect male chest on either side of me. First, out of loyalty and, yeah, love, I rolled over to study Jerry. Dark stubble that he\u2019d shave as soon as he had a chance covered his firm jaw and, even in sleep, he never seemed fully relaxed. He had long lashes. Nice. His great broad chest with its well-earned scars from so very long ago tapered down to a flat stomach that he certainly didn\u2019t shave like my earlier donor had.</p><p>None of us had pulled up the covers. Probably a case of dueling egos with the men and I\u2019d just forgotten. We don\u2019t get cold when we sleep. We just die. I shuddered, suddenly freaked-out at the thought. Stupid, I knew it, but the fact that I could lay my cheek against Jerry\u2019s chest and hear absolutely nothing disturbed me. A sure cure for that was to continue my tour south, to where his briefs bulged. No morning or, in our case, evening erection for a vamp. Nope, just the usual at-ease position. Which was impressive enough. Now down to his muscular legs, so very fine and strong. I smiled and leaned down to kiss his shoulder, then turned to my other side.</p><p>Ray. He was as still as Jerry. And I loved him too. When had that happened? Didn\u2019t matter. It did matter that, when he\u2019d tossed in the fact that he was thinking of staying in L.A., my heart had rolled over. Yep, it had really hurt.</p><p>I shook off my emotional confusion and focused on the physical. Ray had a nice body. Okay, be honest, Glory. Ray had a great body. Which was a miracle considering his hard-drinking lifestyle before he\u2019d been turned. But he\u2019d hit the gym often enough with his buddy Nate to be trim with naturally broad shoulders and flat abs. He had evening stubble too. Both my guys were dark. Though when Ray opened his eyes they\u2019d be that bright blue that sent his fans into orgasms.</p><p>Ray had an arrow of hair pointing straight down to his trademark black silk boxers. They hid the package I knew was inside. I didn\u2019t need to see it. He\u2019d flaunted it often enough. In a comparison, I\u2019d say the men were about equal in the size department. I\u2019d never given Ray a chance to demonstrate his prowess. I sighed, sure I\u2019d missed the boat now. He\u2019d move here, I\u2019d go back to Austin and our fake engagement would be called off as planned.</p><p>I collapsed back on the pillow and boldly put a hand on each man\u2019s chest, imagining what it would be like to have them both doing whatever I wanted to please me. I laughed. Impossible. Neither one was into sharing. There\u2019d be a dead vampire on one side of the bed before I got any attention.</p><p>\u201cGlory? Are you awake?\u201d Valdez from outside the door.</p><p>I crawled out of bed. A glance at the digital clock beside the bed showed me I probably still had some time before sunset. I unlocked the door and opened it.</p><p>\u201cYep. What\u2019s up?\u201d I saw Valdez with Nate hovering anxiously behind him.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone okay in there?\u201d Nate looked around me. \u201cOh, my God! How did you manage that?\u201d He grinned. \u201cOr is one of them dead permanently?\u201d He stopped smiling. \u201cIt had better not be Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re both fine. We called a truce. Nothing happens while we sleep, remember?\u201d I glanced at the closed drapes. Brittany sat on the couch. She nodded at me but didn\u2019t say anything. I had a feeling we weren\u2019t exactly friends. Well, what did I do? Oh, yeah, made Valdez my slave, I guess. Ouch.</p><p>\u201cThat was quite a scene I almost walked in on last night. I hope you guys worked things out.\u201d Nate shook his head. \u201cThe people from Designed to Kill have called six times already. They\u2019ve got the hair and makeup people waiting in the lobby for the signal to come up and start on you, Glory. You and Ray are going to be cutting it close.\u201d He glanced at the drapes. \u201cHey, the sun\u2019s not down yet. What the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took something and woke up early. Wait right here.\u201d I ran into the powder room and weighed. Yes. The red dress would fit. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll jump in the shower and wash my hair. The guys should wake up in about ten minutes. As soon as the sun hits the horizon, call the TV people and have them come up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should go with you to the Grammys, Glory.\u201d Valdez glanced at Brittany. \u201cIn human form. To keep an eye on things. Brittany can stay with Ray when he\u2019s backstage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have something to wear?\u201d I guess I owed this to Rafe. And if Jerry had a problem with it, he\u2019d just have to get over it. Brittany was right. This wasn\u2019t fair to me. Hey, where was the trust? It was nice having a bodyguard, but when I got home to Austin, I was going to learn to live without one and Rafe was going to have to go job hunting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I had Brit buy me something in the shops downstairs. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He nodded toward the bedroom. \u201cYou should clear it with Blade first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just do it. Brit, go get his stuff. V, you can shower and change in Nate\u2019s room. Is that okay with you, Nate?\u201d I could see Ray\u2019s friend and manager was ready to go in a sharp-looking Armani suit with his usual white shirt and gray silk tie.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019ve got the two tickets Flo and Richard were going to use. Brit and Valdez can have them to get in and sit up there in the balcony.\u201d Nate pulled the tickets out of his jacket pocket and handed them to Brittany. \u201cNow, get in that shower, Glory. Clock\u2019s ticking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I grabbed underwear and my robe and jumped in the shower. I was excited. I\u2019d been looking forward to this night for ages and I was going to wear the most glorious dress. My picture would be in the tabloids and they couldn\u2019t possibly say anything nasty about me for once. By the time I rinsed out the shampoo, I was so happy I was humming one of Ray\u2019s tunes.</p><p>Then the glass door opened and I wasn\u2019t alone. Jerry, naked and reaching for me.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea, Jer.\u201d I ran my hands over his chest, then looked behind him. Thank God, I didn\u2019t see Ray getting ready to lunge with a stake in his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your fianc\u00e9 is in the living room talking to his manager. There are television people there too. I\u2019m supposed to be ducking out through the bathroom window.\u201d Jerry leaned down to lick my breast.</p><p>\u201cWhich is what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d I enjoyed the sensation of his mouth on my nipple for a breathless moment, then reluctantly pushed him away. \u201cI can\u2019t do this now.\u201d I reached behind me and turned off the water. \u201cThe crew from the show is waiting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet them wait.\u201d Jerry slid his hands down my back to grab my ass. \u201cSpread your legs, lass, and let me inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I gasped as he lifted me until my back hit the tile wall. I closed my eyes as he pushed into me, taking me hard and fast, possessing me. My eyes popped open. Bastard. What had happened to foreplay? He stared into my eyes, his gaze fierce and determined as he held me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not come for you, damn you.\u201d I raked his shoulders with my nails.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye will.\u201d He bent his head and teased the vein in my neck, breathing on it, then lightly stroking it with his fangs. All the while he kept up his rhythm, deeper and faster.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous, aren\u2019t you? Of Ray?\u201d I pushed my hands into his hair and tugged.</p><p>\u201cDamned right, I am.\u201d He finally eased back and began to kiss my breasts like he regretted the rough approach. Too late. \u201cI made you, lass. I won\u2019t share you again,\u201d he murmured as he ran his hands over my body, trying to coax a response from me.</p> <p>\u201cNot your call.\u201d I could see that bathroom window where I\u2019d cried for the dawn and all the pieces of my mortality I\u2019d left behind. Jerry had selfishly taken those from me. For a moment I hated him. I\u2019d been so young, so blinded by lust and a grand passion that I hadn\u2019t realized what I\u2019d be giving up. He\u2019d known but had wanted me with him. Forever. The consequences to me be damned.</p><p>Enough. I used my vamp strength to shove him off of me and down to his knees. The look on his face would have been funny if I hadn\u2019t been so near tears.</p><p>\u201cGloriana! What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg me for it, Jeremiah.\u201d I kept my hands hard on his shoulders. \u201cYou want it so damned badly. By God, beg me for it.\u201d I leaned against the tile, my head thrown back to expose my throat, my legs still wide. \u201cSay the words. \u2018Please, Gloriana, please let me inside you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d His eyes were cold as they raked up my body.</p><p>\u201cMad as hell.\u201d I pushed him away. \u201cForget it. But this is why I never married you, Jeremiah Campbell. Why I didn\u2019t take your ring.\u201d I was suddenly sick of this. It was so late in the game. I brushed the wet strands of hair from my face. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. This isn\u2019t the time or place for this.\u201d</p><p>He stood and put his hands on the wall on either side of my head. \u201cOh, no. Spit it out. You\u2019ve run me a merry chase for over four hundred years. I deserve the truth. You say you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. That\u2019s the problem and what got me into this in the first place. I gave up my mortality for you, Jerry.\u201d I put my hand over his heart, that heart that died every sunrise. \u201cYou took my mortality. I\u2019ve been mad about it ever since.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAngry? All this time? But you knew . . .\u201d Jerry looked honestly confused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. I need time to sort it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gloriana, you\u2019ve had four hundred years!\u201d</p><p>There was a loud knock on the door. \u201cGlory! Quit listening to that radio and come out of there. The TV people need to get started on you.\u201d Ray pounded on the door again.</p><p>\u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! We\u2019re not done, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry frowned and opened the shower stall door. He grabbed his clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we are.\u201d I threw open the window and watched Jerry turn into a bat and fly into the night. I slipped on a terry robe before hurrying to the bathroom door that Jerry must have locked.</p><p>\u201cGlory, are you all right? You were in there quite a while.\u201d Ray pulled me into his arms. I could tell he was worried. He looked around the bathroom in case Jerry still lurked somewhere, but Ray couldn\u2019t miss the open window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Sorry to keep everyone waiting.\u201d I grabbed a towel for my wet hair. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d I could see a crowd behind him in the bedroom. A frowning Rafe in trousers and no shirt, Nate, Brittany and the reality show hair and makeup crew, all craning their necks to see what was up.</p><p>\u201cRay, don\u2019t you need to get a shower too? We\u2019ve got to get moving.\u201d Might as well let the prep begin. But, after that scene with Jerry, not even the fact that my perfect red dress zipped up easily could bring my excitement back. Damn.</p><p>\u201cGlory, what made you decide to pick Darren\u2019s design as the winner of the green-carpet challenge?\u201d Zia held the microphone in front of me. She looked stunning in a cream silk one-shoulder dress that hit her midthigh.</p><p>\u201cI loved the details and the way it fit, Zia. It had a retro look that appealed to me too. Ray and I both agreed that the color was perfect with my hair and skin tone.\u201d I smiled as Ray slid his arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cShe looks great, doesn\u2019t she, Zia?\u201d Ray kissed my cheek, totally convincing as my adoring fianc\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m buying her these earrings. They\u2019re perfect on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know Beaman\u2019s of Hollywood, jeweler to the stars, will be happy to hear that, Ray. Now, I know you\u2019re in a hurry to get inside.\u201d Zia managed to wedge herself between Ray and me. \u201cFor your Grammy-nominated duet with Sienna Star. We\u2019re all going to be rooting for you to win that category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Zia. Now we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d Ray pulled me away and down the green carpet that was almost deserted except for the excited fans that still lined the roped-off area outside. They\u2019d screamed and shouted his name when we\u2019d arrived in our limo. The paparazzi had gone crazy too. I\u2019d heard whispered speculation about the new bodyguard in our retinue.</p><p>Rafe looked sharp in his dark suit with white silk shirt open at the neck. With his steady gaze and no-nonsense attitude, he fit right in with the other hot guys working the crowd. When one middle-aged groupie had tried to launch herself across the ropes into Ray\u2019s arms, Rafe had simply picked up the screaming woman and gently set her back behind the barrier.</p><p>Brittany was kept busy working the other side of the walkway. She managed to look sexy and professional in a black silk jumpsuit unbuttoned just far enough to be interesting.</p><p>\u201cGlory!\u201d I turned. Paparazzi? No, the group of women looked angry.</p><p>\u201cSellout!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit starving yourself!\u201d This last was accompanied by a blueberry pie thrown by a woman with a strong right arm.</p><p>Only Rafe\u2019s quick reflexes kept me from getting it in my face. Of course I dodged too, relieved when not one blue drop splattered my skirt. Zia\u2019s Manolos weren\u2019t so lucky and we could hear her curses echoing down the corridor as we rushed into the building.</p><p>\u201cThat was close.\u201d Ray looked me over. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Rafe?\u201d I looked behind me before the door swished closed.</p><p>\u201cNever better.\u201d He grinned and licked whipped cream off his fingers. \u201cGuess that was the California branch of what used to be your fan club, Glory. Not exactly happy about your diet, are they? But damn, the ladies can cook.\u201d</p><p>Ray laughed. \u201cDid you hear Zia? Hope that wasn\u2019t going out live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ve learned to delay her broadcasts.\u201d I sighed. The Glory St. Clair MySpace fan club, the Blueberries, had been so great, cheering me on because a woman with curves had hooked a rock star. If the women had just waited a week, they\u2019d see me back in my old body. Back in Austin without my rocker too. Damn. I refused to cry and ruin my makeup. I dredged up a smile and put my hand on Ray\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYou heading straight backstage, Ray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure Sienna\u2019s chewing the scenery by now. I should have been back there and changed ten minutes ago.\u201d Ray whispered, even though we were still in the lobby. The program, televised around the world, had already started, and an usher had quickly made it clear we\u2019d have to wait for a commercial break before we could go to our seats.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be great. Break a leg or knock \u2019em dead or whatever they say at times like these.\u201d I smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Glory.\u201d He dropped a kiss on my lips and looked at Brittany. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d They dashed off to a side door that led backstage.</p><p>\u201cCommercial break, folks.\u201d The usher looked at our tickets, directing Rafe up a flight of stairs while I got star treatment and his arm to go right down to one of the first rows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wow. It paid to be with one of the Grammy nominees. I loved it and felt great in my red dress. I even got a whispered compliment from one of the stars next to me. Cool. The show started again with songs sung by famous recording artists up for Grammys in different categories and more awards were given out.</p><p>Then it was time for Ray and Sienna\u2019s duet. The auditorium went dark until there was a single spotlight on the grand piano. Ray sat there in a tux and white shirt, open at the throat. My heart skipped a beat, he looked so gorgeous and so lonely. He started to play the haunting melody I\u2019d heard hundreds of times. He and Sienna had practiced together in Austin before we\u2019d ever arrived in L.A.</p><p>Then Sienna strolled up to the piano in a hot pink mini-dress that matched a stripe in her short spiky hair and she started to sing. She sang of missed chances and how she\u2019d lost her love. Ray sang with her, a counterpoint. How he\u2019d wanted to try again. But she said no. They harmonized, then went off on their own riffs. It was beautiful and sad and when it ended, you could have heard a sigh or a sniffle, it was that quiet.</p> <p>The applause rolled up from the floor all the way to the balcony. Sienna grinned and pulled Ray up from the piano bench. She hugged him, then they both took a bow and hurried off the stage. No time for more. The show was on a schedule.</p><p>I sat back, relieved that it was over and that it had been so glorious. Wow. I felt a hand touch mine and looked over to take whispered compliments from artists nearby who I\u2019d admired for years. Double wow. A few minutes later, Ray, now changed back into the black silk suit and black shirt he\u2019d worn in to the awards show, slid into his seat. I leaned over and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou were awesome.\u201d I held on to his hand. \u201cI never heard you sing like that before. With your whole heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, babe.\u201d He smiled. \u201cGuess I had nothing to lose.\u201d He looked around, answered some hand signals from some people around him, nodded to others. The smile became a grin. He was beginning to believe he had done well and could relax. I could see it.</p><p>We sat back then and enjoyed the show until it was time for the award for best performance by a group or duo. Ray\u2019s category. Sienna and her date, a new guy I\u2019d met just a few times, sat just behind us. She put her hand on Ray\u2019s shoulder when they read the nominees. Their names got a lot of loud applause and whistles, so they were a popular choice.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the winner is, Israel Caine and Sienna Star for\u2014\u201d The rest was drowned out by a roar of applause.</p><p>Ray grabbed me and gave me a big kiss, then turned around and hugged Sienna. They jumped into the aisle and headed toward the stage to the whoops and hollers of their friends and fellow nominees. Both of them had such joyful grins, I felt myself tear up. Ray held his Grammy for a moment, then handed it to Sienna.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank my lady, Glory St. Clair, for literally saving my life. I wouldn\u2019t be standing here today if it wasn\u2019t for her. I love you, babe.\u201d He blew me a kiss and I wiped my eyes and blew one back. \u201cAlso, thanks to Chip Rollins and O.B.G. Sounds for keeping the faith.\u201d He winked at me, then turned the mike over to Sienna. She thanked a long list of people until music drowned her out.</p><p>A few minutes later, Ray was back in his seat with a Grammy in his lap. \u201cCheck it out,\u201d he whispered, then handed it over.</p><p>I fondled it, though it was just a piece of metal and wood to me. What mattered was what Ray had told millions of people tonight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, Ray.\u201d I handed it back. \u201cI already knew you were a star. This is just concrete proof.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed to take forever, but finally the last award was handed out and the show was over. Ray and Sienna were surrounded and congratulated. Several of the well-wishers wanted to talk future deals. Nate worked his way forward from where he had been sitting and passed out business cards. Seemed like Chip might have some competition if it came to contract talks again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, woman, I think we can get out of here now.\u201d Ray slung his arm around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to Chip\u2019s party?\u201d The vampire had made sure we knew he was holding a special celebration for his winners. Ray wasn\u2019t the only one of his stars to cop a Grammy tonight. There had been three others. As far as I knew Ray was the only vampire among them.</p><p>\u201cI let him know I was skipping out. He gave me a key to the Masters\u2019 Club. That\u2019s the private vamp club here. Why don\u2019t we go check it out?\u201d He was leaning close and said this into my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be teaching me the joys of my condition, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I owe you something after that tribute from the podium.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it. I pulled his face down and gave him a kiss. He quickly turned it into something special. When I heard someone clearing his throat, I pulled back. Valdez, with Brittany beside him, stood in the aisle waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t show by his expression what he thought of the kiss, just followed us up the aisle of the rapidly clearing building. \u201cFred called. The limo\u2019s in front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re heading to a new club. I\u2019ve got the address right here.\u201d Ray handed a card to Rafe. \u201cGive this to Fred.\u201d Outside, Ray followed me into the back of the limo while Brittany and Rafe were told to squeeze into the front with Fred.</p><p>\u201cAlone at last. Where were we?\u201d Ray pulled me into his arms.</p> <p>\u201cOn our way to a club. I was thanking you a minute ago. Don\u2019t take it as a green light, Ray.\u201d I smiled and patted his chest. \u201cThat was a wonderful thing you said up there. My friends will be amazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it. I\u2019ve never forgotten how you took me on after Lucky turned me. You kept me from losing my mind and my life.\u201d Ray kept his arm around me. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a vampire, you know that. But I\u2019m stuck. Chip\u2019s right. Time to make the best of it. I\u2019m staying in L.A. and keeping an eye on Ian\u2019s experiments. I\u2019m going to plug into the vampire scene and get in good with Chip\u2019s crowd. He\u2019s got power and not just in the music biz.\u201d Ray played with one of the curls the hairdresser had left to fall next to my cheeks. The rest of my hair was in a twist at the back of my head. It exposed my neck and let the fabulous earrings and diamond necklace I wore show off to advantage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you making plans like that, Ray.\u201d I shivered when his fingers brushed down my jaw to my neck. \u201cBut I\u2019ll miss you. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve always known Austin is too far from your usual scene to stay your home base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I could make it work if I thought you really wanted me there.\u201d Ray leaned down and put his lips against the vein throbbing at my neck.</p><p>God, but these vampire men and their moves. Of course it didn\u2019t take them long to figure out how erotic it was to have a man play around with your life force. I shifted in the leather seat and ordered my body to quit reacting. So what if I\u2019d sort of had sex with Blade just hours before? If Ray had figured that out, he\u2019d just take it as a challenge. He eased his hand along my knee and up my thigh. Somehow my silk dress worked its way even higher.</p><p>\u201cYou do need to be here. Chip\u2019s a good connection for you. He obviously can show you aspects of the vamp life that I don\u2019t have a clue about. I\u2019ve never been into the power and, uh, the high life the way he is.\u201d I worked hard to keep my voice steady, but it wasn\u2019t easy with Mr. Magic Fingers such a busy boy.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want Ray to get away with touching my breast. It was wrong. I wasn\u2019t going to make love with him. It would send the wrong message. I was leaving and he was staying. I\u2019d push him away in a moment, but, oh, when he slipped aside a bodice so well made it hadn\u2019t required a bra, it felt so, um, good. He had a light touch. Not mean and rough against a tile wall.</p><p>My eyes popped open. When had I closed them? Ray\u2019s head was bent over my breast and he\u2019d worked the dress down. He was about to draw my nipple into his mouth if I didn\u2019t stop him. I slid my hands into his hair and helped him along instead. Why the hell not?</p><p>\u201cGlory,\u201d he whispered just before he pulled it into the warmth of his mouth. He traced the lacy edge of my thong and slipped a finger inside. Of course I was wet. This man could always make me want him. I\u2019d like to blame Ian\u2019s supplement, which revved my libido along with my metabolism, but it was more than physical this time.</p><p>Israel Caine had stood onstage and told millions of people all over the world that I\u2019d saved his life and that he loved me. Loved me. I pulled him with me, to lie on top of me as I fell back on the leather seat.</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d My hands were in his hair again as I brought his mouth to mine. \u201cKiss me, Ray.\u201d I wanted to taste him and memorize his flavor. It would be a long time, maybe never, before I\u2019d see him again. He licked his tongue into my mouth and I raked it with my fangs. His finger probed me and I knew he felt my desire as I moaned and arched against his hand.</p><p>The car stopped and the intercom came to life. \u201cMr. Caine, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to drive around the block,\u201d a shameless slut named Glory whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust once?\u201d He smiled against my mouth and added a second finger inside me.</p><p>\u201cTwenty times.\u201d Then I laughed and sat up, forcing him to roll off of me and almost hit the floor. \u201cOops. Guess that was a close call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. We\u2019re going around the block.\u201d Ray reached for the switch to call the driver.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. I\u2019m not doing this in a backseat of a rented limo.\u201d I pulled up my bodice and straightened my skirt. \u201cLet\u2019s go check out this club.\u201d I put my hand on his flushed cheek. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know something else that\u2019ll be fun. In bed back at the hotel.\u201d Ray slid his hand up under my skirt again.</p><p>\u201cNope. We\u2019re here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I plucked out his hand and shook my head. \u201cNot happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, I thought I finally got you with that big speech tonight.\u201d Ray reached for the door handle.</p><p>\u201cWas that all that dramatic declaration was? A way to get into my panties?\u201d I slapped at his arm. \u201cAnd here I was full of warm fuzzy feelings and you were just being a conniving jackass.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re such pretty panties.\u201d Ray grabbed my hand and pulled it against his swollen crotch. \u201cAnd the way you\u2019ve been leading me around by my cock made me desperate. Whatever works, darlin\u2019, whatever works.\u201d</p><p>The car door opened and Ray hopped out like nothing had happened. I climbed out after him, swishing my skirt and taking his arm. Two could play at that game. And that was all it had to be. A game. He was the great Grammy-winning Israel Caine, and I was ordinary shopgirl Glory St. Clair. I needed to keep that in mind. Too bad my heart didn\u2019t seem to be getting the message. And Ray forgot that I was a mind reader. All that tough talk had been so much b.s. He did have some genuine feelings for me behind that smart talk and playful attitude. But I\u2019d rejected him one too many times. So he was being cautious. I couldn\u2019t blame him. If I truly wanted him, I was going to have to send a clear signal with no last-minute rejection. I just wished like hell I knew what to do about that.</p><p>He said something to Brittany and she laughed and stayed with the limo. Rafe ignored him and followed us inside what looked like an upscale office building. The doorman stood under a red awning and watched as Ray used a key card to enter. Soon we were in an elevator and headed for the penthouse.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is Brittany still downstairs?\u201d I decided we needed to talk. Anything to keep Rafe from examining my wrinkled dress too closely. Fortunately, it had come with a matching wrap and I held it over my bodice where one of the ruffles had come loose.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s guarding my Grammy. I\u2019d hate for some obsessed fan to get hold of it.\u201d Ray grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got three more of them at home, but this one\u2019s special. Everyone had written me off. This signals a big comeback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. That\u2019s what Chip said.\u201d I stepped out of the elevator as soon as it stopped. \u201cNice place.\u201d An understatement. The luxurious bar was made of zebra wood and curved around one side of the room. There were walls of sliding glass doors that opened onto terraces. Tables were scattered over the darkened room and wine-colored leather banquettes made for cozy corners where couples lounged over goblets of red. I sniffed. There were mortals and vampires here. Shifters too. Maybe some other paranormals. I\u2019d have to ask Valdez if he could identify some of the others.</p><p>The music was heavy on the bass and conducive to slow dancing. Some couples were taking advantage. Just like at the other vamp club, some were heterosexual, some were same sex. All were very friendly to each other.</p><p>\u201cGood evening. Mr. Caine. Congratulations on your win. I\u2019m Dom, your host. Mr. Rollins phoned and said you might be joining us.\u201d The tall man wore a tux and black tie with his snowy shirt.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Dom.\u201d Ray looked around. \u201cCan we get a table? You can put our bodyguard at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, Mr. Caine, this way.\u201d Dom directed Rafe to a spot at the bar, then led us to a table near the terrace. We had a great view of the city lights. Ray held my chair, then ordered us drinks of fresh in my favorite flavor.</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re off the diet now, aren\u2019t you, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well. I\u2019m not taking any more of Ian\u2019s supplement.\u201d I inhaled when the goblet was placed in front of me. I looked up at the young waiter. \u201cYour source?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood bank, ma\u2019am. We\u2019re very careful here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p> <p>The waiter nodded and stepped away.</p><p>\u201cVery smooth, Glory. I wouldn\u2019t have thought to ask. What could be wrong with it?\u201d Ray sipped his drink. \u201cThis is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m still your mentor, you know. Remember it could be tainted with alcohol or drugs. We\u2019ve been through that scene and I know you don\u2019t want someone else\u2019s hangover.\u201d I glanced around again. \u201cI\u2019m sure the Council approved this place. So we can relax here and drink freely. Kind of like a health inspection for vamps. That\u2019s a perk of having an organization in town. That\u2019s why Damian\u2019s trying to do it in Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But I need to ask Ian if he\u2019s got a supplement that\u2019ll let me have a glass of Jack once in a while.\u201d Ray laughed. \u201cHey, it\u2019s as important to me as your diet is to you.\u201d He frowned. \u201cShit, I guess I am an alcoholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? One of the blessings of being made vampire. It cured you of that.\u201d I sipped my drink. \u201cAnother caution. Always smell the blood you\u2019re taking for disease too, Ray. Don\u2019t know if your life out here is going to include hunting mortals. I hope not. I don\u2019t recommend it. Too dangerous. For the mortal and for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, unless someone like Ian sends you an offering. Didn\u2019t see you turning that down.\u201d Ray sipped his drink. \u201cThis beats the hell out of most synthetics. I\u2019ll have to see how to hook up with a blood bank. That\u2019s the way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpensive, but you\u2019re probably right. I\u2019ll stick with my synthetics from now on.\u201d I looked around and spotted a few attractive female mortals in the crowd giving Ray the eye. \u201cJust play it safe, Ray. You may find some mortals served to you on a platter, so to speak. Vamp groupies. Just be careful. If something smells off to you, pass. If they\u2019ve got a disease, you can pick it up, at least for a while. You\u2019ll heal, but sometimes it can be a painful process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird. You mean I could take on someone\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, butt boils and end up with them?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me picture that.\u201d I sipped my drink and felt the pressure increase at my waistline. \u201cThis is good. I\u2019ll miss this dress. But it was fun while it lasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the most beautiful woman there tonight.\u201d Ray reached for my hand. \u201cI was proud to be seen with you. I arranged for a DVD of the TV show to be sent to our suite. When I thanked you, I saw them flash your picture on the big screen. You were glowing, you know.\u201d He squeezed my fingers.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Ray. I was so in the moment, I didn\u2019t even look.\u201d I blinked back stupid tears. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He pulled my fingers to his lips and nibbled them. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to stay here in L.A. and keep me company? Hell, I need your guidance. I might end up with butt boils or cock rot.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and slipped my hand from his. \u201cIf you pick up a case of either of those, you deserve to suffer. E-mail me pictures.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI appreciate the offer, Ray, but you know I\u2019ve got a store in Austin. People depend on me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLacy would love to run it for you. Turn it over to her and start one here. Have you had a chance to check out the vintage-clothing scene? Sienna tells me it\u2019s cool.\u201d Ray picked up his glass again.</p><p>\u201cI know. I talked to her about it. She\u2019s found some great buys. The dress she wore tonight was sixties haute couture.\u201d I could see that I\u2019d just lost Ray\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I just spotted my first vampire call girl.\u201d Ray nodded toward the bar and a woman talking to Valdez.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I examined the redhead with legs a mile long and creamy skin. In a way she reminded me of Mara, except this woman was less evil witch and more Miss Con-geniality. She leaned toward Valdez and flashed him some impressive cleavage before they both laughed at something she said. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cWell, she just slid a business card across the bar to him. Her number.\u201d Ray glanced at me. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s not for hire. Maybe she\u2019s just into old Rafe. He\u2019s a decent-looking guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is.\u201d I picked up my goblet again. \u201cGood to know you can find a call girl here. You need to get laid. That much is obvious. And by a vampire. Since your try with mortal DeeDee was such a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me. She\u2019s called me twice, wanting to know what\u2019s up with us. Told her you and I were making up. Now we\u2019re the real deal. That\u2019s why I ignored her in the elevator. Had to keep on message.\u201d Ray slid close on the leather banquette. \u201cCome on, Glory. Stay here, make it real. We have fun together. Like right now. Fly with me to the beach. We can stop at Ian\u2019s, pick up two bottles of the daylight thing and see the sun rise together. How does that sound?\u201d He picked up my hand and stroked his fangs across my palm.</p><p>Truth? It sounded wonderful. I was so tempted I almost jumped up and ran out to the terrace.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay. And I can\u2019t make it real. But I could use some fun.\u201d I took a breath. \u201cRay, I saw the sun rise this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d He groaned and leaned his head on my hand. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d He looked up and waited. \u201cEvery detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing. The colors. I\u2019d forgotten. You have any idea how long it\u2019s been for me?\u201d I blinked and had to stop while I gathered myself. \u201cAnyway, I knew enough not to let the sun touch me, but I looked out the window and saw the sun come up. Birds chirped and the sky gradually lightened. You and Blade were lying there on the bed. No heartbeat, no movement. Dead. And I was, well, alive. It was incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Ray jumped up and pulled me toward the terrace.</p><p>I stopped and looked back. Valdez was on his feet and tossing a few bills on our table. I nodded once, then did the bat thing. Why not? I wanted to go. Ray wanted me with him. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I wasn\u2019t going to miss out.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>\u201cHow long does this last, Ian?\u201d Now that I had this tiny bottle in my hand, I was having second thoughts. Nothing Ian had given me so far had acted like it was supposed to. And it didn\u2019t help that Ray was practically jumping out of his skin and talking about lying on the beach under some cabana and watching the sun come up over the ocean. Yeah, right. And what if this wore off and we died right there in the sand? Was Rafe going to cover us with a tarp or something and stand guard until sunset?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say, Glory.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cIt varies. You\u2019re smaller than Ray. The same dosage might last a little longer with you than him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee, Ray? It\u2019s unpredictable. Think this through.\u201d I held on to his arm. Valdez was behind us and staying silent. I liked him better as a dog. Then I couldn\u2019t see the stony disapproval on his handsome face. Or the lethal glances he divided equally between Ian and Ray.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t last all day?\u201d Ray uncapped his bottle and sniffed. \u201cWhat\u2019s in this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one dose anyway. And the formula\u2019s my secret. So\u2019s the diet one.\u201d Ian smiled at me. \u201cYou look great, Glory. You want to keep this up, we can work something out. Make a special deal. Recruit new clients and I\u2019ll give you the supplement for free.\u201d</p> <p>My breath stalled. Forever a size six?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of an offer.\u201d Ray grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe certainly is. One of my best success stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad you don\u2019t have a video.\u201d Ray obviously had visions of me in a bikini.</p><p>No way. Even at a six, my thighs weren\u2019t anywhere near camera ready.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but I do.\u201d Ian picked up a remote. \u201cPut this together from surveillance footage.\u201d The screen lit up. \u201cBefore.\u201d There I was, stuffed into my size-twelve jeans and T-shirt playing cool rocker chick as I stood next to Ray on Ian\u2019s deck.</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with that, babe.\u201d Ray squeezed my waist. \u201cNobody fills out a T-shirt like my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ray.\u201d But when I saw the \u201cafter\u201d picture, obviously taken just minutes ago, I had to sigh. My beautiful dress. Like a flame. Thanks to Darren\u2019s genius design, my waist looked impossibly small. And my hips! Even my face looked thinner. Yep, I had cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cVery dramatic. What do you say, Glory? Want to keep it up?\u201d Ian froze the picture. To tease me, I guess.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, not interested. I\u2019d have to chase down runners every night and I don\u2019t like taking advantage of mortals. Then there\u2019s the fact that your supplements do weird things to me, like wake me up and give me nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Your reactions intrigue me.\u201d Ian picked up my wrist and inhaled. \u201cI\u2019d like to draw a blood sample if you don\u2019t mind. To analyze this. It might help me make my products more effective.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRather not.\u201d I snatched my hand away. Ian was a scientist. And I knew he was only trying to help vamps realize a dream. But it was all about the money. He wasn\u2019t exactly handing out daylight to the average working vamp, was he? And the diet thing had a high price too. I didn\u2019t want to become one of his lab rats. Next thing you knew I\u2019d be calling him \u201cmaster\u201d and making house calls. No thanks.</p><p>\u201cYour decision, of course. But if you change your mind . . .\u201d He looked out toward the deck. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got company. I\u2019ve been expecting this. Your boyfriend and his family have arrived, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay is my boyfriend.\u201d I slid my arm around his waist. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d I\u2019d really hoped I\u2019d talked Jerry into stalling his father, maybe even getting him to head back to Scotland.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fool. I\u2019ve known since the first night that you and Jeremiah Campbell are together.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cSurprised you share the same woman, Ray.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut obviously Glory is something special.\u201d</p><p>Ray and Valdez both made ominous sounds.</p><p>\u201cI think that was a compliment, guys. To me anyway. Please don\u2019t start something.\u201d I looked out the glass toward the beach. Hell, there was an army. No, make that two armies facing each other. One looked like the guys were ready for a remake of Beach Blanket Bingo. The other? The warrior gang from 300. What woman wouldn\u2019t be happy to share a towel or a plaid with any one of the buff hunks doing the stare-down out there? \u201cI think Ian\u2019s already got his hands full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle. But looks like the fangs are about to start ripping and tearing.\u201d Ian was surprisingly calm considering he was the prize in this blood war.</p><p>\u201cIan, do something. They\u2019ll kill each other.\u201d I stepped out of his reach when I realized I would make an excellent hostage in a negotiation. The laird might not care, but Jerry would feel obligated to take me into account.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be entertaining.\u201d Ian glanced at Ray. He knew Ray wasn\u2019t going to harm him. Ray was all about the formulas. No Ian, no daylight. In a fight, I had no doubt where Ray would line up.</p><p>\u201cRafe, back off.\u201d Because Valdez looked ready to take on Ian. Not a good idea. When it came to vampire against shifter? I\u2019d always assumed vamps would come out the winner and that\u2019s what Jerry claimed. I really didn\u2019t want to see that tested.</p><p>\u201cShall we join the party?\u201d Ian nodded toward the terrace. \u201cThere seems to be a standoff and the laird is calling for me. I\u2019d hate to disappoint him.\u201d</p><p>I looked around for something to use as a weapon. I\u2019d like to threaten Ian and make him avoid a showdown. Didn\u2019t he have a tunnel or some way he could disappear and avoid what was sure to be a bloodbath? But I\u2019d told Jerry that Ian didn\u2019t display stakes and it was the truth. He didn\u2019t have so much as a toothpick lying around that could be used against him. Even the fire in the fireplace was done with fake logs. I did manage to slip a small Murano glass sculpture into the folds of my skirts. The dolphin\u2019s snout wasn\u2019t much of a weapon, but it might slow somebody down for a moment or two.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should fly out the back, Ian. Set up shop somewhere else.\u201d Ray slipped his bottle into his pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t know how tough your guys are, but those Highlanders look like mean sons of bitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they are, Ray. \u2019Tis my heritage too.\u201d Ian smiled, showing impressive fangs. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being mean sons of bitches.\u201d He cocked his head toward the beach. \u201cAngus has a way with words. He\u2019s describing my mother\u2019s character now. Thinks that will bring me to the sand.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it?\u201d I knew how these Scots were about the women in their families. I wasn\u2019t even technically part of Jerry\u2019s and look what he\u2019d done for me. I heard a particularly ugly word shouted down below and winced. Now Ian was bound to charge down those stairs.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Glory. You look worried about your Campbell lover.\u201d He smiled at Ray. \u201cOr friend or whatever. Angus is wasting his breath. My mum is a slut. I quit defending her so-called honor centuries ago.\u201d He winked. \u201cRay, you\u2019d love my baby sister LeeAnn. She\u2019s a fiery redhead. God knows who her father is. Da sure doesn\u2019t.\u201d He laughed bitterly. \u201cYou see why I can\u2019t concern myself with matters of clan loyalty? It\u2019s a joke.\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand. \u201cNow, that was a low blow. There was never a MacDonald man who didn\u2019t have a cock less than . . .\u201d Ian grinned at me. \u201cSorry you and I never hooked up, Glory. You could see what I mean.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough of Campbell\u2019s rants. I\u2019m going out. Are you coming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I stared at him. I\u2019d known too many proud Highlanders and there was something off here. \u201cCut the crap, Ian. I\u2019m not buying this \u2018I don\u2019t care about the feud\u2019 line. How do you really feel about it?\u201d I gripped his arm and took a chance. I stared directly into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to know?\u201d He covered my hand with his and I felt Ray and Rafe move closer. I gestured them back with my other hand.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I didn\u2019t blink. \u201cMen have died on both sides, haven\u2019t they? Don\u2019t you want it to end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes! I hate this. I\u2019ve lost two brothers to it. More cousins than I can count.\u201d He still didn\u2019t look away. \u201cThe lairds are stubborn bastards and immortal, damn them. They won\u2019t quit. It\u2019s endless and mindless. So I left.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair, a gesture very like Jerry\u2019s when he was upset. \u201cYet here they are. Bloody hell. Why won\u2019t they leave me be?\u201d</p><p>I looked into his mind and saw the truth, amazed that Ian let me see it. So much pain. There\u2019d been a child lost too, but he wouldn\u2019t speak of it. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s see if we can fix this.\u201d I turned and walked boldly out to the terrace at Ian\u2019s side. I had an idea and gripped the small bottle in one of my fists, the dolphin still hidden in the other.</p><p>Angus stopped raving as soon as he saw our group step to the edge of the terrace. Jerry stood next to him. No sign of Mag, but that didn\u2019t surprise me. Angus would have ordered her to stay behind. War was man\u2019s work in his universe.</p><p>\u201cMacDonald. Come down here and fight me like a man.\u201d Angus stepped away from the pack and glared up at Ian.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ian leaned against the railing. \u201cI have no quarrel with you, Campbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the son of a whore. I spit on the name MacDonald.\u201d Angus spit in the sand and stomped the spot for good measure.</p><p>Ian laughed. Angus charged then, headed straight for the stairs. Jerry jumped in front of his father, but was knocked flat by a swing of a beefy fist. The surfers moved into action, but stopped at a word from Ian.</p><p>\u201cLet him come.\u201d Ian jumped to the top of the stairs. \u201cHave at me, Campbell. I can take whatever you think you\u2019ve got. But this will solve nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I leaped in front of Ian, my red dress flowing around me like a bloodred cape. I barely made it before Angus bellowed and stopped right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cOut of the way, Gloriana!\u201d Angus\u2019s face was red and his fangs looked huge. Fortunately, he was just enough of a gentleman to hesitate using his fist on me.</p><p>\u201cNo! Listen to me.\u201d I could see Jerry behind his father, poised to grab his shoulders and try to jerk him back down the stairs. \u201cLeave him for a moment, Jerry. Just listen, Angus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell should I? I\u2019ve got a coffin all ready. I\u2019m taking the MacDonald heir back to Scotland. We\u2019ll see what his father thinks when we send word we\u2019ve got his boy set to stake.\u201d Angus laughed. \u201cFinally, we\u2019ll have this settled in our favor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be daft.

Hasn\u2019t that been the way of it for centuries?\u201d Ian shook his head. \u201cYou and my father are fools, stuck in a time when action substituted for brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to this.\u201d Angus reached for me.</p><p>\u201cTouch her and I won\u2019t hesitate to hurt you, Da.\u201d Jerry had his hands on his father\u2019s neck.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to. I\u2019m taking care of any one of you who lays a hand on the lady.\u201d Valdez had ripped a leg off a table and held the jagged piece of wood in his hand as he leaped into position next to me. \u201cNow, listen to what she has to say or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Valdez, way to go.\u201d Ray shouldered past Ian to flank my other side. \u201cYou heard the man. Let her say her piece.\u201d</p><p>I took a shaky breath and prayed this would work. \u201cOkay, now listen. I have a bottle of Ian\u2019s daylight formula here.\u201d I held it up. \u201cAngus, you\u2019d like to see the sun, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in that nonsense.\u201d Angus didn\u2019t take his eyes off the makeshift stake in Rafe\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it. I told you. It works. Want to see the sun again?\u201d I waved it under his nose. \u201cYou could try it this very day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd trust a MacDonald? I\u2019d have to be mad.\u201d He finally glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cHe sold the bottle to me, Angus. Had no idea a Campbell might taste it. It\u2019s safe. You could see the sun rise.\u201d I reached out and brushed his cheek, so much like his son\u2019s, with the back of my fist. I looked past him and gazed into Jerry\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Angus. The break of day. Can you remember it? The cool quiet as the earth turns and the sun begins to peek above the horizon?\u201d</p><p>Angus cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long, lass. Ye ken I\u2019ve not seen it in centuries. And even then I was apt to play all night and sleep well into the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this would be a new and wondrous experience.\u201d I grabbed his hand, jabbing it with the dolphin before tossing it impatiently aside to press the bottle into it. \u201cJust imagine, Angus. Ian can make that happen. Is working on making it possible for vampires to actually walk in the sun without burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. It\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Ian nodded. \u201cRight now all I can promise is a view of the day from safely inside, where the sun\u2019s rays can\u2019t harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to keep us from taking your formula, making this stuff ourselves and then staking you anyway?\u201d Angus clutched the bottle and stared at Ian like he was primed to do just that.</p> <p>\u201cI have my formulas right up here.\u201d Ian pointed to his head. \u201cNowhere else. I die and all my work goes with me. Do you really want to lose that opportunity, Campbell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure I believe it anyway. But can\u2019t deny the MacDs are a wily bunch or we would have finished this feud in our favor centuries ago.\u201d Angus looked down at the bottle again, then at Jerry. \u201cYou trust what Gloriana says? Enough to take this potion with her?\u201d</p><p>Jerry narrowed his eyes on Ian. \u201cGloriana\u2019s word I don\u2019t doubt for a second. But Ian\u2019s swill? Glory, it did strange things to you. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, please. This is different. I know you must be as sick of this feud as Ian is. Prove to your father that this works and maybe . . .\u201d I wondered if I was wasting my breath, but Angus still stared down at the bottle in his hand. Maybe not.</p><p>\u201cThe secret to seeing daylight. Mag and I talked of this after Gloriana told us what happened to her. I agree a businessman is unlikely to poison a paying customer. Is there another untainted bottle handy, lass? One this MacDonald intended to sell ye?\u201d Angus thrust his bottle into Jerry\u2019s hand.</p><p>I turned to Ray. \u201cGive me your bottle, Ray. I\u2019m sure Ian will give you another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cAnd, Campbell, I guarantee you and your son will be back with your checkbooks once you\u2019ve proof for yourself that the potion works. Of course I take all major credit cards. Price list is on my Web site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeb sites. Credit cards. Seems the MacDonalds have gone soft in the new century.\u201d Angus toyed with the handle of a dagger stuck in his belt. \u201cJeremiah, you don\u2019t have to do this. We can still finish things here and now.\u201d</p> <p>Two of Ian\u2019s guards, who\u2019d been in the shadows, suddenly moved in behind Ian. They looked ready to leap into action. I wondered if this was all about to go to hell in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cSoft?\u201d Ian laughed and gestured. More guards appeared on the roof. \u201cYou\u2019re outnumbered two to one. But I\u2019ll not take anything for granted. I know Highlanders.\u201d</p><p>Angus never blinked. \u201cAye. That you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Da. I\u2019ll go with Gloriana and try the drug. If I see daylight, then we\u2019ll know this MacDonald is worth more alive than dead.\u201d Jerry held out his hand to me. \u201cIs that what you wish, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it will keep you all from killing each other.\u201d I glanced at Ray, then stepped toward Jerry. \u201cRafe\u2019s coming too.\u201d</p><p>Angus frowned. \u201cAll right, MacDonald. But if this doesn\u2019t work, you know I\u2019ll be back. And I\u2019ll no waste time blatherin\u2019 either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make no claim I can\u2019t back up with facts.\u201d Ian stuck his hands in his pockets and smiled.</p><p>Angus swept his clansmen with a stare. \u201cI have said how it will be. MacDonald, your men will not follow them. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Jeremiah, enjoy the sunrise. Glory, sorry you\u2019ll have to endure with a Campbell for company.\u201d Ian lost his smile and waved his men off until they moved enough to give the Campbells room to retreat.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Ray held my arm.</p><p>\u201cCaine\u2019s right. You don\u2019t owe the Campbells this.\u201d Rafe glared at Angus. \u201cGlory shouldn\u2019t be dragged into the middle of your damned feud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put myself here. And I may not owe the Campbells anything, but I don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt if it can be avoided. Are you with me, Rafe?\u201d The fact that I was surrounded by a Campbell army had obviously freaked out both Ray and Rafe. \u201cRay, I\u2019ll be okay. You say you believe in this daylight drug. So believe that. You know Jerry has never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but I don\u2019t know that about his father.\u201d Ray acted like he wanted to follow us down to the sand.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, Caine. I can take care of Gloriana.\u201d Jerry held on to my hand, his stern face still in warrior mode and not giving me much reassurance that I wasn\u2019t about to be in the middle of a vamp tug-of-war. \u201cMy father would never harm her. Rafe, are you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Glory all the way.\u201d Rafe kept his makeshift stake firmly in hand, sticking close behind me.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Angus raked the group, both camps, with another hard stare. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here to be sure you\u2019re not followed. Jeremiah, you know where to go. I\u2019ll meet you back at the hotel right after sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, I\u2019ll see you back at our hotel then too.\u201d I saw that his face was beyond grim. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. Jerry, let me go.\u201d I looked down until he dropped my hand, then I moved closer to Ray.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Glory.\u201d Ray pulled me to him for a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I eased back and took his bottle of daylight drug, handing it to Jerry. He stuck both bottles into his sporran. Jerry started to say something, then just firmed his lips. I stared at him, looking my fill. At least the clan hadn\u2019t broken out the bagpipes, but they looked mighty fine in their plaids. My heart twisted and I wished . . . I started to brush past him, but he grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, thank you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to help.\u201d I smoothed my skirt. No comment on my dress?</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful tonight.\u201d Jerry had obviously read my thoughts. Which made the compliment too late and not worth a damn.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I headed down the stairs behind Angus, Rafe at my back.</p><p>\u201cStay close to Jeremiah. He\u2019ll show you where to go.\u201d Once we hit the sand, Angus stepped aside and clasped Jerry\u2019s hand. \u201cGodspeed, son.\u201d Jerry nodded, then shifted into bat form and flew inland.</p><p>Rafe and I shifted and followed him. It soon became obvious that Jerry was taking no chances that anyone might have decided to pursue us. He led us on a long and winding tour of the coast before we landed on the deck of a beach house not very far from Ian\u2019s place. Jerry used a key he pulled from his sporran, then punched in a security code.</p><p>\u201cAnother of Chip\u2019s properties?\u201d I shook out my skirt as I stepped inside the well-furnished living room.</p><p>\u201cYes. The man is heavily invested in real estate. Da\u2019s men scouted the area around MacDonald\u2019s home, then I arranged to rent this place for a week so we\u2019d have somewhere to bring the wounded after the battle.\u201d Jerry sighed. \u201cThank God it hasn\u2019t come to that. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it never does.\u201d I could feel the dawn coming and saw Jerry yawn. \u201cReady to try Ian\u2019s daylight drug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure it\u2019s not poison, Glory? I haven\u2019t forgotten how some of MacDonald\u2019s brew tainted your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for a short time. And that was his weight-loss stuff. This is totally different. Remember, I\u2019ve seen the dawn since then. And awakened before sunset. As far as I know, vamps can\u2019t be poisoned. Why would I lie about that, Jerry?\u201d I smiled. \u201cSeeing a sunrise is a miracle that I hope we can share together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez, I guess you\u2019re the one who will have to go tell my parents if Glory and I both expire after we drink this. I don\u2019t envy you the task.\u201d Jerry dug the bottles out of his sporran and held them up to the lightening sky. We\u2019d stepped outside and stood on a deck overlooking the Pacific. It was a beautiful, quiet night, with waves coming ashore just yards away on a sandy beach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better both live through this, because you don\u2019t pay me enough to face Mag Campbell with that kind of news. Come in here, both of you, before the sun catches you.\u201d Rafe went into the large house and shut the French doors after we were safely inside.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be thrilled if I finally went up in smoke.\u201d I took my bottle and twisted off the cap. It smelled different from the other drugs I\u2019d had from Ian. Still fruity but very subtle. I watched Jerry sniff it suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cIgnore her, Glory. I\u2019ll tell you why Ma\u2019s like that with you if we stay awake long enough.\u201d Jerry finally looked up. \u201cGuess we\u2019d better drink.\u201d It was perilously close to dawn, and I\u2019m sure he felt the heaviness of it as much as I did. \u201cTo miracles.\u201d He held his bottle out toward mine.</p> <p>I saw all kinds of hidden meanings in his eyes but was too tired to figure them out right then.</p><p>\u201cMiracles.\u201d I smiled, we clinked bottles, then both drank.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Bit of a treat to taste something besides blood, you know.\u201d His eyes opened wide. \u201cWell, well. How are you feeling, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Awake actually.\u201d I turned to Rafe. \u201cLook out and see if the sun\u2019s coming up yet.\u201d</p><p>Rafe walked over and peeked, then looked at his watch. \u201cJust about. There are sheers behind these drapes. Both of you step way back in the room. I\u2019m going to open the drapes. You two can enjoy the view as long as you stay awake. Just don\u2019t allow a ray of sunshine to hit you or you\u2019ll get burned. That\u2019s what happened to Glory before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful.\u201d Jerry put his arm around me, and I could see the excitement in his eyes. We both waited until Rafe got the drapes open and the sheers closed to filter the sunshine. The sky was just beginning to lighten.</p><p>\u201cOkay, all clear. Come closer.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cBlade, don\u2019t press your nose on the glass. That\u2019s a little too close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, would you look at that.\u201d Jerry laughed and hugged me, his eyes wide.</p><p>I looked. It was a beautiful sunrise. Even through sheer curtains and despite the fact that we weren\u2019t even facing east, the colors were incredible. Jerry and I held on to each other and watched, neither of us sleepy, as the beach came to life. We pulled up chairs and the hours flew by. Children built sand castles, their mothers gossiping with each other as they sat on towels and laid out picnics. It was so wonderfully ordinary. And the sun rose to shine down on all of it.</p><p>\u201cI want Ma and Da to see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does Mag hate me so? I know I\u2019m common, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not common. Don\u2019t ever say that about yourself again.\u201d Jerry jumped up and paced around the room. Rafe had headed into the den hours before, and we could see him asleep on a couch through a doorway.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t tell me Mag doesn\u2019t think so. Otherwise, why did she hate me on sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d brought home another. Liza.\u201d Jerry ran his fingers through his hair, keeping a good distance between us.</p><p>\u201cLiza?\u201d Why had I never heard this name before?</p><p>\u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been married?\u201d I jumped up, knocking over my chair.</p><p>Rafe, obviously a light sleeper, ran in with that stupid broken table leg in his hand. \u201cGlory? Are the MacDonalds outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay, Rafe. Go back to sleep. Please.\u201d I picked up the chair and sat again.</p> <p>\u201cI never told you about her, did I?\u201d Jerry stared out at the beach instead of meeting my gaze.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d And I thought I kept secrets.</p><p>\u201cI was young. Fell in love. Her father was a simple tailor in the village. My mother declared her an unsuitable match for the heir, and so we ran away together. Came back married. This was long before I was made vampire, of course.\u201d He finally turned and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d My mind was spinning. Jerry married. And Liza. I\u2019d never heard one soul mention that name in the castle in all these years. Why?</p><p>\u201cI can read your thoughts pretty clearly, Gloriana. I forbade anyone to mention her. That\u2019s why you never heard Liza spoken of in the castle.\u201d Jerry sat across from me. His hands were fists when he dropped them to his knees. He stared down at them. \u201cShe carried my child, Gloriana. Then one day I rode out on a raid against the MacDonalds. Heard they were on our land again, stealing cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat damned feud.\u201d My heart skipped a beat. I didn\u2019t want to hear this. \u201cWhat . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis feud needs to end. Taking the heir won\u2019t end it. Only stir things up all over again. Make it ten times worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, what happened to Liza and the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe MacDonalds tricked us. While we were gone, they raided the village, burned some houses and killed the few lads left behind to defend the place.\u201d He punched his knees and laughed, a bitter sound. \u201cWe have a code, ye ken. They don\u2019t touch our women and children, and we abide by the same rule. I\u2019ll give them this: They fight fair. But fat lot of good that did Liza that day.\u201d Jerry scrubbed his hands over his face, but his eyes were dry.</p><p>I reached out and rubbed his knee. \u201cJerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long, long time, Gloriana, since I\u2019ve let myself remember.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNay, that\u2019s a lie. I remember every day. Wonder what my son would have looked like. Grown up to be.\u201d He covered my hand with his and squeezed hard. \u201cLiza went into labor that day. It was too soon. She and the babe both died.\u201d Jerry turned his head to stare at the children playing on the beach. \u201cMy fault. Ma didn\u2019t want Liza to live in the castle, and I let her have her way. If Liza had been safely inside, she and the babe would have lived.\u201d His eyes met mine, the pain I saw there stealing my breath.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gloriana, that\u2019s why when I brought you home, I made sure you were set up in the castle, pushed in my mother\u2019s face. I dared her to object. Ma knew she\u2019d lose me for good if she didn\u2019t go along with it publicly. I\u2019d not have another woman I loved risked because of Ma\u2019s pride.\u201d He looked down and realized he was about to crush my fingers. He loosened his hold. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s done plenty to punish you when I\u2019m not around. That slap the other night wasn\u2019t the first, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it, Jerry. I\u2019ve learned to handle Mag.\u201d Including dodging a few of her attempts at staking me in the back in castle hallways. I touched his cheek with my fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, Gloriana. I set Ma straight after we left you. She\u2019ll treat you with respect from now on, by God, or I\u2019ll never see her again.\u201d He stood suddenly, as if all this talk and eye contact had been too much for him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty heavy threat.\u201d I got up too and followed him to the windows. We were close enough to feel the warmth of the sun through the sheers, and we both watched a surfer ride a wave in.</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake. I meant what I said to her. Ma understood that too.\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do after Liza\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begged to be turned vampire right away. My first thought was to tear out some MacDonald throats. But I soon realized it was me and my own mother who held the most blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were mad with grief.\u201d I put my arms around Jerry\u2019s waist and leaned against him. I could only imagine how he\u2019d felt. Yes, I\u2019d lost my husband as well, but poverty had dulled the shine of my first love for a struggling actor long before he\u2019d been killed in a freak accident. And then I\u2019d had to scramble just to survive. I hadn\u2019t had time to indulge in tears or grieving. I\u2019d been too terrified and too hungry.</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess I was a bit mad. But Da obliged me, turning me even though Ma wanted me to marry again and have more bairns first. I didn\u2019t have the heart for it and certainly wasn\u2019t going to do anything to please her. Not after the way she\u2019d treated Liza.\u201d Jerry faced me and put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cOnce I found you, I held on tight, didn\u2019t I? Maybe too tight. I\u2019ll always protect you, Gloriana, no matter the cost. You needed me when I found you, and I guess I can\u2019t forget that. I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s no longer to your liking, but there it is. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s pushing you away now, seeing as how you\u2019ve become so independent. I\u2019ve tried to change, but I\u2019m not sure I have it in me.\u201d</p><p>When he was right, he was right. I reached up and stroked his cheek. Did I want him to change? Of course I did. No way was I the same woman Jerry had fallen for more than four hundred years ago. But now wasn\u2019t the time to get into that. I noticed that Ian\u2019s drug was wearing off. Jerry suddenly looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me this, Jerry. I wish I\u2019d known it years ago. It would have helped me understand a few things.\u201d Like why my maker had continued to feel so responsible for me. Example: Valdez number whatever sleeping on the couch a few yards away.</p><p>Jerry yawned. \u201cMacDonald\u2019s drug has made me loopy, or I probably wouldn\u2019t have spilled my guts now. It\u2019s not my way to trot out my pain, as you know. But if it makes you happy to know this, so be it.\u201d He pulled me to him and sighed against my hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gloriana, but I don\u2019t think I can stay on my feet much longer. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still good for a few minutes more. For some reason, Ian\u2019s drugs don\u2019t work on me the same way they do on other vampires.\u201d I pulled his lips down to mine and kissed him. \u201cI mean it, Jerry. Thank you for sharing so much. I know that was hard for you. I\u2019m really sorry about Liza and . . . and the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago. And I can\u2019t lay the blame on the MacDonalds any more than I can on my own stubborn family. You\u2019re right. The feud must end. I\u2019ll tell Da that the daylight drug works. We\u2019ll use that as our excuse to end it.\u201d He gestured toward the beach. \u201cThis was a miracle. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let the man who made it possible be sacrificed in the name of an ancient hatred that started over a stolen cow and a tumble in a hayloft with the wrong woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery sensible.\u201d I hid a smile. I knew how these Highlanders felt about their livestock and their women.</p><p>This time it was Jerry who dropped a kiss on my lips. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to find a bed, or I\u2019ll hit the floor. Are you sure you\u2019re all right, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m going to stay here and enjoy the day.\u201d I smiled and watched him stop to hit Rafe\u2019s foot, then head down the hall.</p> <p>Rafe stood and stretched. \u201cHe had a pretty good dose of daylight. Think this will really stop the feud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks promising. Uh-oh.\u201d I realized I was sinking fast myself. \u201cI thought I had more time, but now I think I may have run out.\u201d I yawned. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hit the sheets as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Rafe led me down the hall to what looked like the master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe.\u201d I yawned and stumbled after him.</p><p>\u201cWatch your step.\u201d He smiled and took my arm when I bumped into the door.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m swearing off those supplements. Too much weird stuff happens. Daylight was cool, though.\u201d I patted his cheek. \u201cThanks, pal.\u201d I smiled back at him, feeling some of that weirdness right then. Like maybe I wanted to kiss him. His human form was so totally hot, and I was more than a little miffed at Jerry for keeping such a huge secret from me for, oh, centuries. Nope, couldn\u2019t do that. Rafe was a pal. Besides, he\u2019d think I was crazy.</p><p>\u201cAll part of the job, Glory. Now you\u2019d better take off that beautiful dress. Don\u2019t want to wrinkle it.\u201d He steered me to a spot next to the empty bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jerry?\u201d I tried to reach my zipper but couldn\u2019t manage it.</p><p>\u201cDown the hall, in another bedroom. Stretched out, still in his kilt. This bed is bigger. You\u2019ll be more comfortable here.\u201d He gently turned me around and unzipped my dress. \u201cWait till I leave the room before you drop that. Lay it over a chair.\u201d</p><p>I yawned again and smiled, holding the dress to my breasts. \u201cAlways taking care of me. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did look amazing tonight, my lady.\u201d He touched my cheek, then sketched an old-fashioned bow. \u201cPerfect.\u201d He turned on his heel and walked out of the bedroom, shutting the door quietly behind him.</p> <p>I put my hand on my cheek. Nice. Should\u2019ve at least given him a hug. Oh, well. I let go of the dress, then realized I didn\u2019t have on anything underneath but a thong. I staggered to a chair, dragging the dress over it before I fell on the bed. I was out.</p><p>I woke to a most delicious feeling. Hands on my body, knowing hands that got it just right. Umm. I lifted my hips and then I was naked. Skin against skin. Rough against smooth. I explored a firm back and walked my fingers up through silky hair until I angled his head where I wanted it. I opened my mouth and kissed him, seeking his tongue and his taste. My eyes snapped open.</p><p>\u201cRay, where did you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d Ray grinned and ran his hands over my bare bum.</p><p>\u201cJerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs dead to the world in a bed down the hall.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, my heart in my throat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStake your lover in his sleep?\u201d Ray grimaced. \u201cDamn, why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d He pulled me back under him. \u201cBut, no, he\u2019s safe and sound. I doubt Rafe would have let me at him anyway.\u201d He leaned down and drew his fangs along my throat.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. But we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I realized my legs were wrapped around Ray\u2019s hips, sending a totally different message.</p><p>\u201cSure we can.\u201d He nibbled my lower lip and pulled my breasts against his chest. \u201cMmm. This has been too long coming. I need you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel that.\u201d Obviously Ray had taken one look and decided to strip so he could join the party. He felt amazing against me and tempting beyond belief. What was stopping me? A man who hadn\u2019t trusted me enough to share his past with me?</p><p>Ray kissed me, his thoughts wide-open. He\u2019d reached his limit as far as watching me with Jerry was concerned. If I rejected him this time . . . And part of me ached to finally let go and have him love me like he wanted to.</p><p>But he was going to stay in L.A. I knew it. And I was leaving. I had no choice. My real life was in Austin. This rock-star fantasy was just that. I\u2019d known when it started that it couldn\u2019t last. A one-night stand would just make our parting harder. It was already going to just about kill me.</p><p>He rolled me on top of him and gazed up at me. \u201cLet me look at you. God, you\u2019re beautiful. No more of that diet shit. I want to just fall into these breasts and forget breathing.\u201d He proceeded to bury his face between them, then kiss his way from one nipple to the other with the enthusiasm of a true believer. He explored every inch until I shivered and moaned and clutched his hair.</p><p>I tried to think. Tried to push him away and start a rational discussion of all the reasons why this wasn\u2019t going to happen. Then he slid me up and began to lick a path down my stomach. Oh, this was a bad idea. I grabbed the iron headboard when I meant to push him away. How had that happened? I couldn\u2019t let him . . . But he was strong and he had a goal and knew clever ways to get there. Oh, yeah. Touchdown. Or score. Or home run. Whatever. I gasped and bucked, so far gone I had to bite my lip to keep from keening and slamming my head into the wall behind the bed.</p><p>\u201cSay my name,\u201d he whispered, his breath warm against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d I barely managed it. \u201cRay, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t chicken out on me now, Glory. It would kill me.\u201d</p><p>I forced my eyes open and glimpsed the heavy drapes across the room. There, just at the edge, I could see a trace of light. The one thing that, for Ray, might rank above mind-blowing sex at this point. It was reason enough to shove him aside, leap off the bed and hopefully not infuriate him or break his heart. And mine.</p><p>\u201cRay, look! We\u2019re awake and it\u2019s still daylight outside.\u201d I stood next to the window.</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t you love it? Ian\u2019s a friggin\u2019 genius for sure.\u201d He dragged his eyes from my naked body to the drapes where I pointed at that sliver of light.</p><p>I grabbed a pillow and held it in front of me. \u201cTell me how you managed to get here. In daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a double dose of Ian\u2019s drug at his place. Then I watched the beach through his tinted windows all day. It was totally cool, Glory.\u201d Ray lay back, all glorious naked male.</p><p>Why was I talking when I could be doing? No, I had a list of reasons why that was a bad idea. I struggled to trot them out again. Ray grinned, doing a little mind reading. Then he climbed out of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI did the same thing. Watched the beach with Jerry.\u201d I put out my hand to keep Ray from getting too close. \u201cBut how\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Fred and had the limo pick me up. Tinted windows. Ian has a covered carport at his front door. So does this house. Sun\u2019s rays never hit me, and here I am.\u201d He moved in and tried to steal my pillow. \u201cWith my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did you find me?\u201d</p><p>Ray grinned when I did a vamp leap across the bed and out of reach. \u201cI\u2019m in tight with Chip now, and who else is a vampire going to go to for a safe house? My new buddy was happy to help out when I told him you\u2019d practically been abducted by the Campbells.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe Council isn\u2019t too happy about a feud on their turf. Blade didn\u2019t mention it to Chip when he rented this place. I told my boss I\u2019d make sure the Campbells cleared out.\u201d Ray snatched at my pillow, but I dodged him.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. This was just temporary. When Jerry wakes up\u2014\u201d I gasped when Ray leaped and landed behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d He nuzzled my neck, his desire hot, hard and very apparent against my backside.</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d I snagged my thong with my toe and dragged it to me. \u201cWe can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we can.\u201d Ray snatched the thong and tossed it at the door. \u201cNot thinking of getting dressed, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ray.\u201d I dropped the pillow and turned in his arms. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a sunset coming. You have any idea how rare that is for me? I don\u2019t want to miss it. Do you?\u201d</p><p>He pushed me down to the bed and fell on top of me.</p><p>\u201cGlory, Glory, Glory. Making love to you would be way better than any sunset, any sunrise. Stick with me, and I\u2019ll buy you a thousand sunsets.\u201d Ray licked the vein throbbing in my neck and I shivered.</p><p>Every inch of Ray pressed against me, and I knew he meant what he said. Which made this so much harder to do. But Jerry was down the hall. And now I understood him. Knew why . . . Then I felt a vibration. No, a hum. Ray had closed his eyes and held me close, his mouth against my throat where the blood pumped slowly to my heart. He rocked us gently to a beat only he could hear. It was a lovely tune, one I\u2019d never heard before. He even sang a few words, his breath soft and sighing against my skin, and my eyes filled with tears. One dripped down my cheek and landed on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cNot the reaction I was going for.\u201d He looked up and smiled sadly. \u201cSee how you inspire me?\u201d He braced himself on both elbows and gazed down at me.</p><p>I felt his strength and saw his tenderness. God, I hated to deny him or myself. But I couldn\u2019t do this. He saw my answer and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShit. This is going to be one of those \u2018crying in your beer\u2019 love songs, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so, Ray.\u201d I pulled his head down and kissed his lips. \u201cLet\u2019s go see that sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? No sunset color will ever compare to the way your cheeks go pink when you\u2019re turned on, baby.\u201d He brushed his thumb along my cheekbone. \u201cOr the way your eyes sparkle when you\u2019re happy. Like you were last night wearing that red dress and looking like a goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d I swallowed. I wished . . . I finally shook my head.</p><p>He smiled sadly and eased off of me, then held out his hand. \u201cGuess there\u2019s a sunset for us to see, then. Come on.\u201d He pulled me to the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPut on your pants, Ray. Please?\u201d I jumped between him and the door. No way was he going out there naked in front of Valdez. \u201cI\u2019ll wear your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Afraid Rafe will get jealous if he thinks you and I did the wild thing in here? Or report your infidelity to Blade?\u201d Ray feinted right, then left, but I didn\u2019t fall for his tricks. I just stayed in front of the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Ray. This is nonnegotiable. If I have to\u201d\u2014I grabbed a lamp\u2014\u201cbean you over the head, you\u2019re going to put on those pants.\u201d</p> <p>Ray grinned and picked up a lamp of his own. \u201cDueling lamps. Let\u2019s go, baby. I\u2019d love to see Blade lose his security deposit.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head. I knew what Ray was doing. Playing to save his pride and maybe give me time to get over my urge to cry, which was pretty strong right now. I think I loved him more in that moment than I ever had. But having sex with him wasn\u2019t the right move here. Wrong place, wrong time. I wished for a shred of dignity. Forget it. Not while I was standing there naked, wearing nothing but a frown.</p><p>\u201cHumor me. I refuse to flaunt my love life in front of the hired help.\u201d God, I hoped that hadn\u2019t carried into the den. I\u2019d never thought of Rafe as just an employee. But whatever worked at this point. \u201cWe can waste time like this until the sun goes down and Jerry comes out of his bedroom. Don\u2019t think that\u2019s a threesome you\u2019d enjoy. Blade would be wanting to kill you for being here. But it\u2019s your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Ray grabbed his pants and stepped into them. \u201cNow, move.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and did just that, then grabbed his shirt and slipped it and my thong on. They covered me enough for modesty, and I followed Ray. Twilight streamed into the living room through the sheers, and Ray stopped and stared for a moment. Then he was slapping Rafe on the back and talking a mile a minute.</p> <p>\u201cSee that Jet Ski? I have one like that on the island. No, mine\u2019s got a larger engine.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cFool\u2019s going to turn over.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat did I tell you? Glory, check it out. Look what\u2019s coming down the sand. You ever see a dune buggy before?\u201d</p><p>I joined him at the window. \u201cNot until this morning. Funny how Ian\u2019s formula works differently on some of us. Guess Jerry is still dead to the world.\u201d I took Ray\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd a double dose let you stay up all day.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBlade will be sorry he missed this. But I bet the Campbells stop feuding now that Blade\u2019s realized Ian\u2019s stuff is the real deal and he saw the sunrise this morning. He did see it, didn\u2019t he, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did. He\u2019s all for ending the feud now. That\u2019s what he plans to tell his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess he\u2019ll shift out of here when he wakes up.\u201d Ray turned to Valdez. \u201cRafe, call Fred and arrange to have the limo pick up Glory and me here after dark. You know, I want to buy a place on the beach. I wonder if this one is for sale.\u201d Ray couldn\u2019t quit smiling.</p><p>I saw Rafe pull out his cell phone. He just turned his back and hit speed dial. The hired help. Okay.</p> <p>\u201cTalk to Chip. If you\u2019re staying in L.A., he has several properties he\u2019s trying to sell. Check out all his listings.\u201d I turned back to the beach. A group of teenagers had gathered wood and looked ready to light a bonfire. What fun.</p><p>When I\u2019d been sixteen, I\u2019d already run away from home and married an actor. It had been a hard life and, after he\u2019d died, worse than hard. My parents had decided it was better to pretend I was dead than admit I\u2019d made such a foolish choice. So I\u2019d had no support. No wonder Jerry had been so important to me and I\u2019d jumped at the chance to be taken care of.</p><p>Of course I\u2019d loved him and been dazzled by his power and sensuality. I\u2019d never known a man like him before, a vampire. I\u2019d been so grateful that he\u2019d wanted me I\u2019d been blinded to the complications my choice to join him for eternity brought with it. And every time I\u2019d tried to think, to analyze why I might hesitate, he\u2019d put his hands on me and I was lost. Damn. No wonder I had this simmering anger that had no place to go.</p><p>I turned to Ray. Not angry with him. But not going to take advantage of his gratitude either. I smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo what you want, Ray. But no hasty decisions. That\u2019s my best advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Glory. I\u2019ll take my time and do this right. Rent first, then buy later. L.A. is where I need to be. Close to Ian and his miracles. And close to the music scene. Nate\u2019s told me that a time or two or six.\u201d Ray slipped his arm around me. \u201cStay. We can have a ball here.\u201d</p><p>I leaned against him. \u201cI\u2019m tempted, but no. I\u2019m heading home tomorrow. I\u2019ll check into flights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe limo\u2019s not that far away. With traffic, it should be here in half an hour. Right after dark.\u201d Rafe walked up to stand beside me. \u201cNice evening. I get this is big for both of you. Guess MacDonald is something of a genius.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bet he is.\u201d Ray walked to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s almost dark. I\u2019m going outside. If I freak or start frying, pull me in, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>I started to call him back, then realized it was too late, Ray was already out there. He was right. The sun was slipping below the horizon. In about ten minutes or so we would have been waking anyway. Ray stood, arms out like he was hugging the last bit of daylight. Thank God he didn\u2019t seem to be having any bad reaction to it. He grinned and waved me to come on out.</p><p>I ran to join him. So we stood there hand in hand and felt the magic. I tucked the memory away in my Israel Caine scrapbook. For once I wished for one of those damned paparazzi. A picture would have been nice. But, as the sun finally disappeared, I knew a photo wasn\u2019t necessary. The smell of wood smoke, the crash of the waves and the giggles of teenagers along with the feel of Ray\u2019s hand in mine were enough to make this a moment I\u2019d never forget.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really leaving, are you, Glory?\u201d Ray watched me carefully fold that beautiful red dress and place it in my suitcase.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid so.\u201d I\u2019d tried it on one last time. Snug. Of course. The reentry into Glory as usual had already begun. Actually going back to Austin would just make it official.</p><p>\u201cI had Nate book you a first-class seat. Here.\u201d Ray stuck a packet into the side pocket of the case.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking money from you, Ray.\u201d I started to take it out, but he put his hand over mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not money. It\u2019s a return ticket. So you can come back.\u201d He grinned and pulled me into his arms. \u201cYou know you\u2019re going to miss me.\u201d He had me up against him and I had to admit I missed him already.</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. But you\u2019ll get busy and the women will be hitting on you, as usual. And\u201d\u2014I slid my hand along his jaw\u2014\u201cone of those hot female vamps we saw at that Masters\u2019 Club will initiate you like you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted it to be you, babe.\u201d He turned his head and teased my fingers with his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019d have been great together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I laid my head on his shoulder. \u201cGive me some space, Ray. I\u2019m too tangled up in this business with Jerry to get involved, really involved, with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I knew he\u2019d be part of this.\u201d Ray kissed the top of my head. \u201cHe\u2019s in the living room. Surrounded by my guys from the band and looking like he wants to be anywhere but here. Too damned bad.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back. \u201cI didn\u2019t even sense him come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because he behaved himself for a change. Used the elevator, not the balcony, and actually knocked on the door.\u201d Ray put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cYou ready to see him? Is he going home with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know about that, but, yeah, I need to talk to him.\u201d I smiled and pulled Ray\u2019s head down to kiss his lips. \u201cThanks for being so cool about this, Ray. I\u2019ll keep that ticket. And if you ever need me, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d His eyes glittered and he did what he always did, had to take this to another level. \u201cIf this is my kiss-off, Glory girl, it\u2019s got to be a good one.\u201d He pulled me to him, slid his hands down to my hips and snugged me as close as we could get with clothes between us.</p><p>I sighed and slid my arms up around his neck. I looked into his eyes and saw my reflection. I was Glory fangirl, Glory who melted when she heard the right song and Glory who knew a good man when she kissed him. I pulled his head down and let him know just how much he meant to me.</p><p>For a minute or more I thought I might not be able to go away after all. Oh, but he made me feel things. Then I heard the bedroom door open and the blast of music from the living room along with the shouts of the celebration still going on. Ray\u2019s Grammy win. A boon for him and his band. The guys had been all over him the minute we\u2019d walked back into the hotel the night before.</p><p>Finally, Ray lifted his head and licked his lips. \u201cI\u2019m going to remember that. But it won\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><p>I gently eased my hands from around his neck and stepped back. I knew who was behind me. Now that he was in the room, I couldn\u2019t miss his scent or his disapproval. I wasn\u2019t about to turn around, though, and ruin this moment for Ray.</p><p>\u201cCome visit if you get the chance.\u201d I touched my swollen lips. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll remember that too.\u201d I blinked back sudden tears. \u201cTake care of yourself. Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrittany\u2019s staying with me. She\u2019ll be my watchdog during the day.\u201d Ray glared at the man behind me. \u201cHe gives you any trouble, shout and I\u2019ll throw his ass off the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and what army, Caine?\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice was a growl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Go enjoy your win with your guests, Ray. I\u2019m not leaving for another hour. I\u2019ll see you before I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Dismissed. I get it.\u201d He frowned and kissed me on the cheek, then strode out of the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I still didn\u2019t turn around, just picked up a stack of T-shirts and added them to the suitcase.</p><p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d He was right behind me. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to acknowledge me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jerry. Didn\u2019t know you were coming. Did I miss your call?\u201d I made a show of picking up my cell phone. \u201cNo, guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was tied up, but I\u2019m here now.\u201d He turned me to face him. He was back in one of his new Rodeo Drive outfits, handsome in faded jeans and a burgundy silk shirt. \u201cWhy are you packing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going home. I\u2019ve got a flight in a few hours. Can\u2019t leave too late or I won\u2019t beat the sun.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cOh, speaking of. What did Angus say when you told him how Ian\u2019s formula worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could hardly believe it. Wondered if I\u2019d been tricked somehow. He questioned me for hours. Centuries of distrust don\u2019t go away overnight. Now he\u2019s convinced we\u2019ve got to keep an eye on MacDonald and let him keep making his brews.\u201d Jerry frowned. \u201cHe wants me to stay here and do that. Da will go home and start what he calls peace talks with the head of the MacDonalds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be staying in Los Angeles.\u201d I sat on the side of the bed. Well, I\u2019d always said I wanted to be independent. If both men in my life stayed here and I headed east, then I\u2019d be truly on my own. I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIt would be the smart thing to do. If I really want this feud to end. It\u2019s the first real incentive we\u2019ve had to end it. You and Caine said your good-byes just now?\u201d Jerry pushed the suitcase over and sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s staying here too. The music scene is here. And he\u2019s hooked on Ian\u2019s formula. It was amazing, Jerry. Remember? Dune buggies and Jet Skis.\u201d I grabbed his sleeve. \u201cWe saw all of that after centuries in the dark. People going about their business in the daylight.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIan\u2019s brilliant. The Campbells have to let him do his thing in peace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, obviously. Da is already trying to figure out how to buy some of Ian\u2019s formula through a third party so he can try it himself. He doesn\u2019t want MacDonald to know it\u2019s him doing the buying.\u201d Jerry smiled. \u201cI do want to try it again, Glory. With you.\u201d He lost his smile. \u201cBut I sure as hell never again want to wake up after sunset to find you practically naked with Caine. Did you and Caine make love in that damned beach house with the sun shining outside?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. Just stared at him. He hadn\u2019t even given me time to explain when he\u2019d walked in on us at the beach house. He\u2019d just taken one look at us standing on that deck, shifted and flown off in a rage.</p><p>Jerry flushed and stood. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t deserve to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given Ray back his ring. I never accepted yours. So, no, you\u2019ll not get an answer. I\u2019m a woman who\u2019s free to love any man I wish, Jeremiah. Any man I wish. But I\u2019m on my way back to Austin alone.\u201d I stood and put my hands on my hips. Hips that were wider tonight than they\u2019d been the night before. Too damned bad.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go alone. I can get one of my brothers to take over here. If I knew you wanted me with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I put my hand over his mouth. Want him? God help me, always. But have him?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve depended on you too much already, Jerry. I see that now.\u201d I drew my hand across his lips to caress his jaw. \u201cI love you. Will always love you. But I need to do this. Go back and be totally on my own. While I figure out a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush to go back? Take a few days to think about this. Consider moving here. Look around Los Angeles without the Israel Caine circus going on. Stay with me in my hotel. I put my parents on their plane an hour ago. We can be alone.\u201d Jerry took my hand and pulled it to his lips.</p><p>I was actually tempted. What would a day or two hurt after I\u2019d already been gone a week? I started to say as much when Jerry spoke again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not been yourself lately. I blame MacDonald\u2019s swill. I think I can persuade you to reconsider this mad plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith sex?\u201d I jerked my hand from his. \u201cNo, thank you. And just because I\u2019m not melting in a puddle when you touch me doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m drugged or deranged.\u201d I turned my back on him and stuffed my precious pair of skinny jeans in the suitcase. I felt his hand on my waist and whirled around. \u201cYou think all you have to do is bed me and I\u2019ll cave. Well, get this, Jeremiah Campbell, Jeremy Blade or whatever the hell you chose to call yourself this century. I\u2019m more than just a willing bedmate, that idiot who threw away her mortality for a dark and dangerous vampire lover centuries ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you regret that choice, Gloriana. But it\u2019s a little late\u2014\u201d Jerry reached for me again.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Do not touch me right now.\u201d I leaped over the bed to the other side. \u201cI do not regret my decision. I love this century. Wouldn\u2019t have missed it for anything. I\u2019ve learned so much since I met you. The main thing? Woo-hoo. I actually have a brain. I\u2019ve built a successful business that needs me. People depend on me for their livelihood.\u201d It was true and something I was proud of.</p><p>\u201cI always knew you were intelligent, Gloriana. Otherwise you would have bored me long ago.\u201d Jerry was pretty smart himself, staying on his side of the bed and jamming his hands in his pockets.</p> <p>\u201cWell, would it have killed you to have said something?\u201d I wanted to throw a chair at him. \u201cNever mind. Hear this. I want to go back, Jerry. I know you have no real ties to Austin. L.A. will be a good move for you. You\u2019ll enjoy the structure of the Council and it\u2019s important to keep an eye on Ian.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist the wounded look in his eyes. My big bad vampire wasn\u2019t used to being dumped. Well, not dumped exactly. I was definitely leaving the door open for him. Couldn\u2019t imagine not having him back in my life sooner rather than later.</p><p>I walked around the bed and eased up in front of him. \u201cCome on, Jerry. Surely you can see this is for the best. A little time apart. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s forever. We\u2019ve done this before and survived it.\u201d I pulled his head down to kiss his cheeks, his chin, then his mouth. \u201cGet to know Ian and the other members of the Council. Try the daylight drug again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d want to share it with you, Gloriana.\u201d He crushed me to him and stole my breath with a kiss that was part good-bye and part stay.</p><p>I twined my fingers in his thick hair and held on, tempted to give in to his persuasion. So many memories. I finally had to push him away before I ripped open his shirt and pants and knocked him to the floor. Damn me for a slut.</p><p>I stepped back from him. \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind, Jerry. I\u2019m going. Maybe not forever. Maybe I\u2019ll sell the shop or let someone else run it eventually and come back here to Los Angeles.\u201d I ran my hands through my hair, my mind so muddled I didn\u2019t know what I was saying. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting on that plane. I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take this.\u201d He shoved a packet in my hand and took a step back. \u201cValdez told me what you were planning. Use it when you need to. Or want to. Call me and I\u2019ll come. Just don\u2019t forget who made you. Who loves you. Who is always going to be yours.\u201d He spun on his heel and slammed out of the room.</p><p>I stood there, still out of breath and off-kilter. I looked down and began to laugh. Yep, I had another first-class round-trip ticket from Austin to Los Angeles.</p><p>The flight attendant warned us that they were about to close the doors when a man slipped into the seat next to me. I\u2019d been alternately crying and just staring out at the dark tarmac as the other first-class passengers boarded the plane. I\u2019d left one piece of unfinished business that bothered me. Oh, come on, Glory. \u201cBothered\u201d? Hell, I was beside myself. I\u2019d wanted to talk to Rafe. Explain why I wasn\u2019t going to have a bodyguard anymore. But I hadn\u2019t been able to find him.</p><p>I\u2019d talked to Brittany. Asked her to explain. She\u2019d been happy to pass the word. Right. I could just imagine how that conversation would go. My Rafael Valdez deserved so much more than a secondhand kiss-off and the hastily scribbled note on hotel stationery I\u2019d managed before the limo had picked me up to take me to the airport. I\u2019d insisted Ray not see me off. The paparazzi would be rabid enough as it was. We planned to have Nate issue a statement in a few days about our engagement ending. But Flo had already called me to let me know that TMZ had reported that I wasn\u2019t wearing my engagement ring when I was spotted by a reporter as I was heading for the airport.</p><p>Oops, more tears. I turned away so the stranger couldn\u2019t see. Stupid. Tears did nothing but make my eyes red and swollen. A tissue suddenly appeared in front of me.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I grabbed it and dabbed at my wet cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better buckle your seat belt. We\u2019re getting ready to take off.\u201d</p><p>I knew that deep voice. I whipped around to make sure.</p><p>\u201cRafe! What are you doing here? I left you a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Saw it.\u201d He frowned and waved to the flight attendant. \u201cI\u2019ll take Jack Daniel\u2019s neat as soon as you get a chance. Thanks.\u201d He smiled at the woman, who looked only too happy to serve him anything he wanted, then he turned back to me. \u201cYou really going to do this thing all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I didn\u2019t share the thought that I was scared spit-less. Any vampire would worry about vulnerability during daylight and the death sleep. But my building was owned by Damian, a vampire who\u2019d planned for those kinds of security issues. I just had to be careful. That\u2019s all.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He leaned back and closed his eyes as the jet engines revved for takeoff.</p><p>\u201cFine? Then what are you doing here? You know I can\u2019t afford you. And I don\u2019t want a bodyguard now anyway. That\u2019s for rock stars and gangsters.\u201d I sat up and buckled my seat belt.</p><p>He just kept his eyes closed. \u201cI get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d I shook his arm. \u201cWhat are you doing on this plane?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGoing to Austin. Same as you.\u201d He opened one eye. \u201cRelax. The plane\u2019s taking off. I\u2019ll talk to you after I get my drink. I haven\u2019t been getting a hell of a lot of sleep lately. Sit back and be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d I huffed, crossed my arms and plucked a magazine out of the seat back in front of me. Oh, great. One of the few I\u2019d read this month. I stared at it anyway while the jet climbed and Rafe sat there with his eyes closed.</p><p>He looked different. Relaxed. Wow. Long lashes against his tanned skin. His black hair was growing out and curled against the collar of his white cotton shirt. His jeans were the kind of butt huggers that made me lick my lips. I quickly went back to my magazine and an article on designer shoes. I looked down. He wore black leather boots, the kind that went with Harleys. Did he own a motorcycle in his human form?</p> <p>I had lots of questions for him. We really didn\u2019t know each other. Take that back. He knew everything about me. I knew next to nothing about him. Like what Jerry had on him that had put Rafe into a five-year contract to do the dog thing. And it hadn\u2019t been just about the money. They\u2019d let that much drop.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, Mr. Valdez.\u201d The flight attendant served Rafe a glass and fussed with his tray table. \u201cMay I get you something now, Ms. St. Clair?\u201d She\u2019d already tried to serve me before and I\u2019d turned her down.</p><p>I shook my head. No synthetics on this flight and I didn\u2019t feel like dragging her into the bathroom and taking her down a pint. Oh, come on. Just a little sick vamp humor. I was enjoying a nice wallow in self-pity. Rafe took a swallow and smiled.</p><p>\u201cNice. Great to be off duty. Can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019s been since I could just kick back and enjoy a drink.\u201d He took another sip. The flight attendant stopped on her way down the aisle and looked a question at him. \u201cKeep \u2019em coming, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get drunk, are you, Rafe?\u201d I could just see me trying to get him off the plane. I had vamp strength, but it would be awkward to say the least. Maybe I should call Flo and Richard to pick us up at the airport.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll stop at three. I\u2019ll just be pleasantly relaxed, then I\u2019ll sleep the rest of the way.\u201d He glanced around the first-class cabin. \u201cNot that I\u2019m supposed to care, but I think you\u2019ll be okay if I actually sleep, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You read my note, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I stuck the magazine back in with the others. \u201cI\u2019m not going to need your services. I e-mailed Jerry and told him the same thing. We\u2019re done. I\u2019m on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Got it.\u201d Rafe handed his empty glass to the attendant and took a fresh one, this obviously a double. He grinned at her. \u201cYou read my mind. Thanks.\u201d He took a sip. \u201cNow, where were we? Oh, yeah. You were firing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I can give you references if you need them. Jerry can too, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I nibbled a fingernail, then jerked my hand back into my lap.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. I\u2019ve got my future all worked out. I\u2019ve been saving and plan to open a bar. I\u2019m used to being up all night. Seems like the perfect fit.\u201d He smiled and tilted the glass to look at the liquid inside. \u201cAnd you owe me a place to stay. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I was still processing the bar thing.</p> <p>\u201cYou told me I could have Flo\u2019s old room if I ever needed it. Since I\u2019ll be using all my money for this new business, I\u2019m taking you up on that. The restaurant on the other side of the tattoo parlor next to your shop is folding, and it\u2019ll work for the bar. So your digs are a convenient location.\u201d He took another swallow. \u201cWe\u2019ll be roommates, Glory. But, sorry, no more dog body for me. You\u2019ll have to get used to my human form. I\u2019ll shift for emergencies, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, wow.\u201d I leaned back in my seat. Rafael Valdez as roommate. Sharing the one bathroom. I sat up. \u201cWe need ground rules, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I get that.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m really pretty easy to get along with. Same guy, just different\u201d\u2014he leaned closer when the flight attendant passed by\u2014\u201cexterior. This way you won\u2019t have to put me on a leash.\u201d He winked. \u201cUnless that floats your boat.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks grew hot and I cleared my throat. \u201cYou know better than that. No running around in your underwear, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Don\u2019t own much anyway. But, Glory\u201d\u2014he drained his second glass and reached for his third\u2014\u201cfeel free to run around in yours. I\u2019ve always loved a woman with curves.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
