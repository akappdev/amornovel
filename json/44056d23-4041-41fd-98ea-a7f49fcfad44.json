The Protocol itself arose out of the overwhelming incidence of insanity and serial killing in the Psy populace. Driven to the edge, the Psy made a choice. They conditioned their young to feel nothing\u2014not jealousy, not rage, and definitely not joy at the thought of Christmas morning.</p><p>So it was that by 2019, only ice ran in the veins of the Psy politicians who wanted to make Christmas illegal. Since the Psy race controlled government then as it does now, Law 5198: Deletion of Christmas and Associated Holidays was near certain to pass.</p> <p>There were a few minor hiccups. Some elderly Psy\u2014those who had been too old at the inception of Silence to allow for true conditioning\u2014weren\u2019t certain they wanted the holiday outlawed. But the old ones were few; the last, unwanted vestiges of an emotion-filled past the Psy preferred to forget. They were ignored, their fading voices drowned out by the Silent majority.</p><p>Law 5198was read into the statute books and life moved on.</p><p>Except that the humans and changelings, the other two parts of the triumvirate that is the world, took no notice. Christmas trees went up as usual, gifts were bought, and carols were sung. Human business owners did a roaring trade in mulled wine, fruit cake, and roasts with all the trimmings.</p><p>In comparison, Psy who owned interests in companies that usually profited from Christmas suffered a sharp drop in income\u2014Law 5198meant they could no longer advertise their products in conjunction with the outlawed holiday.</p><p>The Psy Council found itself faced with both a mass revolt by the other races, and considerable opposition from the very businesses that backed up its regime. Psy might not feel, but they also did not appreciate their profit margins being compromised. The businesses weren\u2019t the only ones who felt the negative impact of Law 5198 \u2014Enforcement could find no way to prosecute everyone who violated the law against Christmas.</p> <p>The churches simply acted as if the law didn\u2019t exist. But they, in their solemn dignity, weren\u2019t the worst offenders. The changelings, in particular the nonpredatory deer species, took great amusement in walking the streets in their animal forms, dressed up as Santa\u2019s reindeer.</p><p>Then the horse-changelings decided it wouldn\u2019t hurt their pride to be harnessed two by two to large sleds in order to transport shoppers around the cities. Finally, the humans, the weakest of the three races\u2014with neither the psychic powers of the Psy, nor the animal strength of the changelings\u2014came up with the killing strike.</p><p>They changed the name of Christmas to the Day of Happiness.</p><p>It was unacceptable for Psy to feel happiness. Those who did had their minds wiped clean and their personalities destroyed in a horrifying process known as \u201crehabilitation.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t illegal for anyone else to celebrate happiness. And if they wanted to do it by singing songs, gathering with loved ones, and attending certain ceremonies dressed in their Sunday best, well, that wasn\u2019t illegal either.</p><p>The powerful, deadly Psy Council was used to instant obedience in all things. However, in the year 2021, the Councilors admitted that wasting Psy resources to ensure compliance with Law 5198 made no financial or strategic sense. The law was quietly repealed.</p><p>Now, some forty years later, Christmas is a celebration unlike any other. Though the Day of Happiness was retired soon after the repeal of Law 5198 , changelings and humans have always known that they are one and the same thing. Of course, happiness isn\u2019t guaranteed by the magic of Christmas. Sometimes, a woman has to fight with everything in her, with her pride and her fury, her love and her anger, with her very soul, in order to claim the joy...or the man, meant to be hers.</p> <p>One</p><p>TAMSYN LOOKED ACROSS THE PACK CIRCLE TO THE MEN AND women who stood on the other side. Lachlan, their alpha, his hair going the white of wisdom and age, was saying something to Lucas, who was barely fifteen but carried the scent of a future alpha. The past and the future side by side. One day soon, Lucas would lead them. Everyone knew that. The boy had been drenched in blood, his parents murdered in front of his eyes. But he would lead. It didn\u2019t matter that even if they waited a decade, he\u2019d still be far too young.</p><p>Just like Tamsyn was too young at nineteen to be the senior healer for the DarkRiver leopard pack. Her mentor had been Lucas\u2019s mother, Shayla. The attack on Lucas\u2019s family had not only stolen their healer, it had left DarkRiver in a state of constant alert. That didn\u2019t mean they had given up. No, they were quietly building their strength until the day they could destroy the ShadowWalkers\u2014the pack that had murdered their own.</p><p>She knew Nate would be one of those who went after the rogue pack when the time came. He stood tall and strong beside Lachlan, his concentration on whatever it was they were discussing. At twenty-nine years of age, he was one of the pack\u2019s top soldiers and would soon be a sentinel, assuming Cian\u2019s position when the older man retired from active duty. The sentinels were the pack\u2019s first line of defense. They were the strongest, most intelligent, and most dangerous predators of them all.</p><p>\u201cTammy, you\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked away from Nate and into Lysa\u2019s bright green eyes. \u201cI only got in an hour ago.\u201d Even now, she didn\u2019t quite believe she was home\u2014the six months she\u2019d spent at the teaching hospital in New York had been the hardest of her life.</p><p>\u201cSo the course is over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That part of it anyway.\u201d She could finish the rest of her medical training in nearby San Francisco. Most changeling healers relied on their inborn gifts, but Tamsyn had made the decision to study conventional medicine as well. It was one more way to compensate for her inexperience, for the healing gifts that hadn\u2019t yet matured to full strength. She refused to allow her youth to disadvantage her pack.</p> <p>\u201cNothing went wrong while I was away?\u201d She\u2019d hated leaving DarkRiver in someone else\u2019s care, though she fully trusted the healer who\u2019d stepped in to hold the fort during her absence. \u201cMaria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left this morning. Itching to get back home exactly like you.\u201d Lysa smiled. \u201cIt was nice of Maria\u2019s pack to lend her to us and she was great, but damn, I\u2019m glad to have you back.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn returned her friend\u2019s fierce hug. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be back.\u201d</p><p>Lysa set her free. \u201cGo on. I know you\u2019re wanting to catch up with Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s busy with Lachlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s your mate, girl. You can drag him away.\u201d</p><p>Mate. The word made her heart skip as it had since the day she\u2019d turned fifteen. That was when the mating instinct had awakened, when she\u2019d realized she was one of the lucky ones\u2014she\u2019d been born into the same pack as her mate, had known him since childhood. \u201cIt\u2019s not official yet.\u201d</p><p>Lysa rolled her eyes. \u201cAs if that matters. Everyone knows you two are meant for each other.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, but they were nowhere near to consummating the relationship. Nate was determined she get the chance to explore her freedom before settling down. What she had never been able to make him see was that he was her freedom. She didn\u2019t want to be apart from him. But Nate was stronger than her. And at ten years her senior, he was used to giving orders and having them followed.</p><p>\u201cI should freshen up,\u201d she said, dragging her eyes away from him a second time. \u201cI just dropped off my bags before coming here.\u201d Searching for him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see you after you\u2019ve settled in.\u201d Lysa smiled. \u201cI have to go talk to Lachlan about something.\u201d</p><p>Nodding good-bye, Tamsyn began to move away from the large clearing ringed by trees that was the pack\u2019s outdoor meeting place.</p><p>NATE HAD SEEN TAMMY ARRIVE, WAITED FOR HER TO COME to him. And now she was walking away. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said to Lachlan, no longer caring about the discussion at hand. Some Psy named Solias King was apparently making what he thought were discreet inquiries about DarkRiver\u2019s territorial reach and ability to defend itself. Lachlan was fairly certain the man wanted to steal their land.</p><p>\u201cThis is important\u2014oh.\u201d The DarkRiver alpha looked up and followed the path of Nate\u2019s gaze. His frown turned into a grin. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re distracted. Guess we won\u2019t be seeing you for a while. We\u2019ll have to track this idiot down ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Good-natured laughter followed Nate out of the Pack Circle as he tracked his mate\u2019s scent through the trees. He caught her in under a minute. The second his palm clasped the back of her neck, she froze. \u201cNathan.\u201d</p><p>Her skin was delicate under his hand and he was very aware of how easily he could damage her. With her hair swept up into a long tail, her neck appeared even more vulnerable. He rubbed his thumb over the softness of her. \u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround four.\u201d</p><p>It was now five-thirty and winter-dark. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d The leopard who was his other half didn\u2019t like that she hadn\u2019t come to him first.</p><p>She turned her head, eyes narrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you left a note as to your whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>His beast calmed. She\u2019d gone looking for him. Gentling his hold, he slid his hand to the side of her neck and pulled her to him. She came but her body was stiff against his. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuanita was very happy to tell me where you were.\u201d</p><p>He heard the jealousy. \u201cShe\u2019s a friend and a fellow soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was also your lover.\u201d</p><p>The beast wanted to growl. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a decade younger than you,\u201d she retorted. \u201cOf course you\u2019ve had women. I don\u2019t need anyone to paint me a sign.\u201d</p><p>The jagged edge of anger turned his next words razor-sharp. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken a lover since your fifteenth birthday.\u201d He was a healthy leopard male in his prime. Sexual hunger did not sit well with him. But neither did cheating on his mate. \u201cAnd if someone\u2019s telling you different, I\u2019ll tear out their throat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blinked. \u201cNo one\u2019s telling me different.\u201d Her voice was husky. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like knowing you\u2019ve had other women in your bed, that they\u2019ve touched you, pleasured you.\u201d</p><p>Her bluntness shocked him. Tamsyn did not talk to him like that. \u201cWhat exactly did you do in New York?\u201d The possessive fury that hit him was close to feral, a harsh thing with claws and teeth.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d Breaking his hold with a quick move of her head\u2014a move he\u2019d taught her\u2014she faced him, hands on her hips. \u201cYou think I would\u2014\u201d She gave a little scream. \u201cYou know what, if I had, whose fault would that be?\u201d</p> <p>He folded his arms to keep them from hauling her back against his chest and proving to his beast that she still belonged to him. \u201cTamsyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve had it up to here!\u201d She jerked the edge of her hand to below her chin. \u201cAll the other females my age are taking lovers left, right, and center, and the only thing I get is frustration!\u201d</p><p>Her raw need was simple truth. Newly mature females were very sexual, their scent intoxicating to the young males. Then there was the fact that the mating heat had shifted Tammy\u2019s natural hunger into higher gear. He could taste the woman musk of her, the lush ripeness just waiting to be bitten into\u2014it was an exhilarating blend, and one he alone had the right to crave. Even the idea of any other male lusting after her pushed his temperature into explosive range. \u201cIf I take you,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cit\u2019ll be for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that! And I accept it. I need to belong to you\u2014in every way.\u201d</p><p>His cock wanted to take her up on it. But she was nineteen . She didn\u2019t understand what it was she was committing to. He wasn\u2019t some kitten who\u2019d follow her around with his tongue hanging out like the young males did with the females. He\u2019d take her and he\u2019d keep her. Sexually, he was far more mature than she was, and a leopard-changeling\u2019s sexual needs only grew more intense with time. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDammit Nate, I\u2019m sick of needing you so much I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Her hands fisted by her sides, caramel-colored eyes rich with heat. \u201cI\u2019m sick of stroking myself to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. The images that hit him were hot and erotic and so detailed they threatened his beast to madness. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion before,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying too much responsibility as it is.\u201d Shayla\u2019s murder had forced Tammy to step into the older woman\u2019s position\u2014as DarkRiver\u2019s healer\u2014at seventeen years of age. She\u2019d never had a chance to be a juvenile, to mess about, to play and roam. \u201cI\u2019ve seen exactly how wrong things can go if leopards bond before they\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not your parents,\u201d she spit back.</p><p>He went silent. \u201cI told you to never bring up my parents again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She was trembling. \u201cThey\u2019re the reason you\u2019re being so stupid. Just because your mother was miserable after deciding to take a permanent partner at age eighteen doesn\u2019t mean I will be.\u201d</p><p>His mother had been more than miserable. \u201cShe committed suicide.\u201d If not in truth, then in effect. Her drinking had escalated to such an extent that even her tough changeling physiology hadn\u2019t been able to repair the damage.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not your parents!\u201d Tamsyn repeated, her voice breaking on the last word. \u201cYou\u2019re my mate . And I\u2019m yours. Your mother and father didn\u2019t have that connection.\u201d</p><p>No, his parents had fallen in love the old-fashioned way, without being driven by the mating instincts of the leopard. It happened like that sometimes. Though mating wasn\u2019t uncommon, not every changeling found his or her true mate, the one with whom they could bond on a level that was almost psychic. \u201cMating will demand more from you than a nonbond relationship ever would,\u201d he told her, cognizant of the terrifying animal fury of his hunger for her. \u201cI don\u2019t want you walking into that before you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one who decides if and when I\u2019m ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m older and more experienced.\u201d She had years to go before she caught up.</p><p>She seemed to be gritting her teeth. \u201cFine! Enjoy yourself in your perfect little world where everything goes according to your plans. Don\u2019t blame me if I get sick of waiting for you!\u201d She turned and began to stalk through the trees.</p><p>\u201cTamsyn.\u201d He used the tone of voice that made even the rowdiest juvenile stop and pay attention.</p><p>She kept walking.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Striding after her, he caught up just in time to see her clothes disintegrate off her body as she shifted into leopard form.</p> <p>He froze, stunned as always by the beauty of her. Her pelt was glossy, the dark rosettes defined luxuriantly against the gold. Suddenly, she looked over her shoulder and gave him a look that could only be described as haughty. Her eyes were green-gold, not caramel, in this form, but they were very definitely all female.</p><p>He growled at the implied challenge. She snapped her teeth in response and took off. He almost went after her\u2014his claws were already out by the time he brought himself back under control. If he ran her down in his current state...well, she wouldn\u2019t be complaining about stroking herself to sleep again.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Now his mind was so full of images of soft feminine flesh and long stroking fingers that he was in danger of bursting out of his pants. \u201cShit.\u201d Turning in the opposite direction from her, he ran toward a nearby waterfall. An ice cold bath was exactly what he needed to knock some sense into his head.</p><p>He wondered if she moaned when she brought herself to orgasm.</p><p>Two</p><p>TAMSYN SHIFTED BACK INTO HUMAN FORM NEAR HER PARENTS\u2019 home. They lived fairly close to the Pack Circle and it was where she was staying for the time being, her life in limbo\u2014she should have been living with Nate by now. Eyes stinging at the reminder of his rejection, she went to retrieve some clothes she\u2019d hidden for just such contingencies. Nudity was no big deal in the pack, but she was already going to be a crybaby. At least she could be a clothed crybaby.</p><p>Dressed, she walked to the front door. Her mother opened it before she could knock. With her dark hair and pale brown eyes, Sadie Mahaire was an older, smaller version of Tamsyn. It was Tamsyn\u2019s father who had given his daughter her height. Her mother took one look at her face and opened her arms. \u201cCome here, my darling.\u201d</p><p>Sobbing, Tamsyn went into her mother\u2019s embrace. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, Mom,\u201d she said, what felt like hours later. She was lying on the sofa, her head in her mother\u2019s lap and her legs curled up on the cushions. \u201cThis need I have for him, it\u2019s clawing me to pieces. But...but he doesn\u2019t seem to feel the same.\u201d That knowledge crushed her, made her feel as if she were bleeding inside.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes he does.\u201d Sadie stroked Tamsyn\u2019s hair off her face with gentle hands. \u201cHe\u2019s simply had longer to get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonger? How? The bond awakened at the same instant in both of us.\u201d He\u2019d come to the door on her fifteenth birthday and she\u2019d felt something in her snap taut, a connection so strong, it vibrated with how utterly right it was.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you were fifteen. Your sexuality was young, immature.\u201d</p><p>She remembered the wave of heavy warmth that had uncurled in her stomach whenever she\u2019d been around Nathan, the soft ache in low places. \u201cI wanted him even then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut as a girl wants, not as a woman.\u201d Sadie pressed a kiss to her brow. \u201cHe, on the other hand, had to have had a brutal time of it. You were a baby and he\u2019d never have allowed himself to touch you, but he was a man and his beast knew you were his mate.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn began to see what her mother was saying. \u201cHe had to learn to chain the mating urges of the leopard, wait until I was ready.\u201d For the first time, she understood the pain it must\u2019ve caused him. \u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t be with any other woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMates don\u2019t cheat.\u201d Sadie sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing, but it\u2019s also a hard thing to bear when things don\u2019t work out perfectly. But you understand about Nate now, don\u2019t you? He\u2019s as hungry for you as you are for him\u2014it\u2019s just that he\u2019s had years to build up his will against the need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a sentinel, Mom,\u201d she said, proud but afraid. \u201cYou know the kind of men who become sentinels. His will was already as strong as steel before he found out about the bond. Now I\u2019m pretty certain it\u2019s unbreakable.\u201d She rubbed a hand over her heart, where the bond was a savagely twisted knot. Though it was meant to be an instinctive link, Nate had somehow learned to block it. Her animal heart kept reaching out to him...only to slam up against a solid wall of resistance.</p><p>\u201cOh, my baby.\u201d Sadie squeezed her shoulder and Tamsyn sat up, wiping away the final evidence of her tears. \u201cNow listen,\u201d her mother said, pure love in her expression. \u201cThe man\u2019s will might be unbreakable for some, but not for you. You\u2019re his mate. You have a direct line to his soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he won\u2019t listen. He\u2019s made up his mind that we\u2019re going to wait and wait and wait and\u2014\u201d She shook her head, shoulders hunching in defeat. \u201cI know he\u2019s thinking in terms of years, not months.\u201d A wait that long would drive her insane. She wasn\u2019t being overly dramatic\u2014the lack of tactile contact between her and Nate, the denial of what their beasts craved, it physically hurt . \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019m some sexy little thing that can seduce him.\u201d It was out before she could feel embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice was full of maternal pride. \u201cYou have courage and strength and such spirit.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her mom that while those qualities might be nice, they didn\u2019t exactly make her a knockout. Her hands were practical healer\u2019s hands, her hair a plain brown, and her eyes...well, her eyes were okay. Sometimes she thought they looked like dark amber. But what man would care about her eyes when women like Juanita with their seductive, curvy bodies were sashaying around? Tamsyn was all legs and strong bones. More horse than leopard, she thought morosely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you give up,\u201d Sadie said, cupping Tamsyn\u2019s cheeks with soft hands, \u201cyou\u2019ll regret it for all the long, lonely years that follow. So will he. Nathan thinks he knows what he\u2019s doing, but starving the bond will destroy both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I reach him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you to figure out.\u201d Her mother smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give you a hint\u2014he\u2019s a man. Treat him like one.\u201d</p> <p>TWO HOURS LATER,TAMSYN STILL HADN\u2019T A CLUE ABOUT what she was going to do. Frustrated in more ways than one, she stomped downstairs with the intention of finding something with which to take her mind off Nate. Maybe her mom was quilting and needed an assistant. But the house proved to be empty. Sadie had left a note tacked to the back of the front door.</p><p>Your father and I decided to go for a bit of a roam.</p><p>Translation: They were off feeding their animals\u2019 need for the wild and who knew when they would be back. It could be days.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she muttered, feeling sorry for herself. Trudging back into the living room, she had the beginnings of a good sulk going when she spied a box on the coffee table with her name on it.</p><p>Another note:</p> <p>Tammy, darling, I thought you might like to do these while things are quiet (and you\u2019re sulking). We could do with some new ones. Love, Mom</p><p>Opening the box, she found it filled with homemade Christmas decorations. She smiled, unable to resist their magic. Every year until the horrible day when a bloody nightmare had forced her to step into the position of DarkRiver\u2019s healer, she had made these with her family. There were silver cardboard angels and beads strung on fishing wire and beautifully detailed paper dolls. But what held her attention were the round glass ornaments.</p><p>Each was meticulously painted with scenes from fairy tale and legend. Most had been done by Tamsyn and her mother as they sat side by side for hours, her father content to \u201csupervise.\u201d She smiled. Every ornament held a memory of happiness, of love. Her hand found one decorated with the image of a running panther. She stilled.</p><p>Healing\u2019s not just about bones and cuts, Tammy, sweetheart.</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes at the memory of Shayla\u2019s patient voice. Lucas\u2019s mother had been a black panther like her son. She had also been Tamsyn\u2019s teacher, her friend\u2014a friend whose advice and guidance Tamsyn missed desperately. But today, in this moment, it felt as if Shayla stood right beside her, telling her the truths she needed to hear.</p><p>This would be the second Christmas since the attack. No one had been in the mood to celebrate the first, but perhaps it was time to heal her family, her pack.</p> <p>Even if she couldn\u2019t heal herself.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at the self-pitying thought. \u201cSnap out of it,\u201d she ordered herself. Sulking be damned\u2014she would not let Nate\u2019s idiocy ruin this Christmas for her. And she was going to make sure he knew it.</p><p>Three</p><p>SOLIAS KING WAS A TP-PSY, A TELEPATH WITH A GRADIENT 8 ability. That meant he was strong enough to use mind control should he ever decide to. Solias had done so before\u2014politics didn\u2019t allow for such niceties as high moral principles.</p><p>His current plans, too, would have been far easier to implement had he been able to utilize his telepathic abilities to coerce and persuade. Unfortunately, changelings had rock-solid natural shields. He might be able to turn one of them\u2014and that with considerable effort\u2014but he couldn\u2019t control the entire DarkRiver pack. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, sir?\u201d his aide and son, Kinshasa Lhosa, asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing of note.\u201d Solias turned. \u201cDo you have the details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Kinshasa passed them over. Despite his youth, the eighteen-year-old was extremely efficient. Solias had made a good investment when he\u2019d entered into a reproduction contract with the Gradient 7 Tp-Psy who was Kinshasa\u2019s mother. Both Kinshasa and the second child from the contract were high Gradient minds, powerful in their respective abilities.</p> <p>\u201cGive me a pr\u00e9cis.\u201d</p><p>Kinshasa spoke from memory, his dark skin unlined. \u201cThe land in question is perfect for your needs. You can locate a small comm station and office there, then use it as a base for further expansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe leopard pack?\u201d Solias didn\u2019t trust Kinshasa\u2014he trusted no one, blood relative or not. But the boy was undoubtedly good at research. \u201cWill they pose a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kinshasa said, his tone holding the cool emptiness of Silence. \u201cDarkRiver is a small group with no real presence. If we were going up against the SnowDancer wolves, it would be a different story. They\u2019re somewhat more aggressive.\u201d</p><p>That was why Solias hadn\u2019t looked into \u201cacquiring\u201d wolf land. \u201cBegin preparations for development.\u201d The leopards\u2014animals shackled by the choke of emotion\u2014were clearly no threat.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Kinshasa paused. \u201cThere was another matter, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Psy Council has requested a meeting with you.\u201d</p><p>Solias nodded. \u201cForward me the details.\u201d The Council was likely interested in the details of his political aspirations\u2014power never changed hands without the Council\u2019s approval. If Solias played his cards right, he might not only take over the leadership of San Francisco, he could rise to the Council itself.</p><p>The Councilors would appreciate his firm hand with the animals. And if it all ended with a few dead leopards thrown into the mix, so much the better.</p><p>Four</p><p>HAVING HALF-FROZEN HIMSELF IN THE ICY CHILL OF THE waterfall, Nate finally hunted Tamsyn down well after sunset. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t know where she was. It was that he wasn\u2019t sure he could face her without doing something stupid. Like yelling, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing up there?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were night glow as she stood on a tree limb several dangerous feet off the ground, in human form. It would have been another matter if he\u2019d found her there in leopard form. That was normal. The same couldn\u2019t be said for a woman with a rope of Christmas lights slung over one shoulder. Now, that woman snorted and began to string the lights around and along the boughs above her head.</p><p>\u201cTamsyn, I swear to God,\u201d he grit out, tracking her so he could catch her if she lost her footing, \u201cif you make me come up there, you won\u2019t be sitting without wincing for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t lay a hand on me, Nathan Ryder,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>She was right, of course. He\u2019d rather cut off his hand than hurt her. \u201cFine.\u201d Slicing out his claws, he prepared to scale the tree and drag her down to safety.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare mess up my Christmas tree.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. \u201cYour what ?\u201d The fir was so tall it seemed to touch the night clouds. Only a crazy woman would attempt to decorate this. But instead of asking if she\u2019d lost her mind and chance getting his head bitten off, he decided to point out another fact. \u201cIt\u2019s not Christmas for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big tree.\u201d She continued walking along the branch as she strung the lights. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to leave, make yourself useful and string the other side. There are more lights at the bottom of the trunk. Don\u2019t insult my cat by playing catcher.\u201d</p><p>Knowing she was right about her leopard being agile enough to ensure she\u2019d always land on her feet, he looked down, then wished he hadn\u2019t. \u201cWhere did you get this many lights?\u201d He picked up the heaviest rope, shoved it over one arm, and started climbing.</p><p>\u201cPeople liked the idea of a giant Christmas tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll draw Psy to the area like magnets.\u201d The other race knew nothing of the pack\u2019s network of lairs and aeries. It was a form of protection against the Psy hunger for power. \u201cYou want to announce our Pack Circle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d The words were blades. \u201cThe lights are special low-impact ones. They won\u2019t even show to the top of the tree, much less put out a detectable heat signature.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if insanity was catching. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m having this conversation with you. It\u2019s ten o\u2019clock at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free to leave if it\u2019s past your bedtime.\u201d</p><p>The bite of sarcasm made him grin. His cat liked being near Tamsyn, no matter her mood. And he was animal enough to appreciate her claws\u2014no leopard wanted a weak mate. \u201cSo, what are you planning to do for an encore? A parade of giant jack o\u2019lanterns? Maybe we can use them to scare off the wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d He could hear her smirk. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be out doing important sentinel stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not officially a sentinel yet.\u201d Though he was already being allocated most of Cian\u2019s work as the other man concentrated on his role as advisor to Lachlan and trainer to Lucas. \u201cI have the night off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re here? What, Juanita was busy?\u201d</p><p>He let her hear the angry rumble of his growl. \u201cAre you really accusing me of cheating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible to cheat on something that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTamsyn,\u201d he began, intending to tear into her. Then his beast suddenly realized something. \u201cYou\u2019re still jealous of a relationship that was over years ago.\u201d He couldn\u2019t understand why, not when he\u2019d made it plain that he\u2019d been celibate since the mating bond snapped into being.</p><p>Silence for several minutes. \u201cIt hurts me to know a woman who\u2019s been allowed full skin privileges with you\u2014while I\u2019m not even worth a simple kiss.\u201d</p><p>He froze at the amount of pain in that single statement. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever compare yourself to any other woman,\u201d he said, his beast raging at the mere idea. The instant he\u2019d realized she\u2019d been born for him, it had blinded him to anyone else.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cTammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk anymore.\u201d</p><p>He was certain he heard tears in her voice. It shook him. His strong, beautiful mate never cried. \u201cTammy, don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t what? Decorate my tree in peace?\u201d The acerbic edge was back.</p><p>\u201cI thought...\u201d He shook his head, relieved. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, after the lights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrnaments. They\u2019ll take a while. I\u2019m going to get the kids to make one each.\u201d</p> <p>He jumped easily to the ground and picked up the last rope. Stringing that took far too little time though he tried to stretch it out. Tamsyn was waiting for him when he jumped down the second time. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He fisted his hands to keep from stroking the delicate line of her profile. \u201cYou going to turn it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until it\u2019s ready.\u201d She shoved her own hands into the pockets of her jeans. \u201cI better get inside. It\u2019s chilly.\u201d</p><p>He was one step from pulling her into a hug, would have done so for any other packmate who needed it\u2014touch was the cornerstone of who they were. But if he touched Tamsyn, it wouldn\u2019t stop at a simple hug. He\u2019d take all of her, claim proprietary skin privileges from head to toe, spending extra time on every seductive feminine curve in between. His voice was leopard-rough when he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking with the kids on the ornaments. Going over some study papers.\u201d She turned on her heel. \u201cGood night, Nate.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re still angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave him a tight smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m also not a sucker for punishment. You might have had years to get used to resisting the full brunt of the mating heat, but I haven\u2019t. So help me out and keep your distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKEEP MY DISTANCE.\u201d NATE PACED ACROSS THE LENGTH OF his living room and back. \u201cKeep my distance.\u201d He was her mate\u2014she belonged to him\u2014and she\u2019d told him to keep his distance.</p><p>Something growled deep in the forests that surrounded his home and he wondered which one of his pack was running under the moon. If he\u2019d had to bet, he\u2019d have said either Lucas or Vaughn, or maybe both. The two were still juveniles, but both had already seen death firsthand, been scarred by their losses. Now they waited to grow up so they could claim vengeance.</p><p>He would go with them when it was time to destroy the ShadowWalkers. The younger males would be fighting their demons, but he would be fighting for his mate\u2019s right to be safe. Something dark and almost violent in him tightened at the thought of her, a sense of complete rightness filling his soul. She was his, wouldn\u2019t ever be anyone else\u2019s. The reminder calmed the visceral hunger of his beast.</p><p>He would never forget the moment when he\u2019d realized what she was to him. Because of the disparity in their ages, they had had different friends, moved in different levels of the pack. But he had always known who she was, adored her in a way that was everything good\u2014her laugh soothed the rough edges of his beast, her smile made him want to smile in turn.</p> <p>On the night of her fifteenth birthday, she had hosted a small sleepover party at her parents\u2019 home. He\u2019d dropped in to wish her a happy birthday. It had been no fleeting impulse\u2014he\u2019d become used to swinging by to check if she was okay, especially during the times when her parents were out. As soon as she had opened the door, he\u2019d felt the bond snap taut. The knowledge had been in her eyes, too, shocked and bright.</p><p>He\u2019d touched her then, cupped her cheek with his hand. She had leaned into him, soft and welcoming and everything he had ever wanted. He\u2019d known that, at that moment, he could ask anything of her and she\u2019d give it to him. That was what had made him draw back. \u201cNot until you\u2019re ready,\u201d he\u2019d said, ending the contact.</p><p>It was a promise he refused to break.</p><p>Tamsyn thought he was being cruel. She hadn\u2019t seen what he had with his parents. His mother had been too young, his father too demanding. Within a decade, they had destroyed each other and themselves. The idea of doing that to Tamsyn was his worst nightmare. Because he knew he was too much like his father\u2014he would not be an easy man to mate with. He\u2019d expect total devotion, demand complete sexual surrender, take absolute possession.</p><p>Tonight, his body hungered for her with a fury that was more animal than man. The cat had wanted her from the first. To the leopard, she\u2019d smelled mature at fifteen, but the man had known she was nowhere near ready. Now...now he could have her\u2014if he was willing to look into her eyes for the rest of his life and know he\u2019d stolen what little freedom she could have had.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He would not do that to her. She might be frustrated and annoyed with him, but she\u2019d forgive him. It was what mates did.</p><p>TAMSYN WAS NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE NATHAN FOR PUTTING her through this! \u201cI can\u2019t stand it!\u201d Her skin was so sensitive even the sheets felt abrasive. The flesh between her legs was swollen with need and there was only one man she wanted to rub against, only one thing she wanted to do. Unfortunately, Nate didn\u2019t want to play.</p><p>Why had he turned up tonight? To torture her? Her beast had become drunk on his scent, addicted to the proud masculine taste of him. It wanted more. So much more. Maybe that was why he\u2019d come over\u2014because his beast was starving, too? She snorted. More likely he\u2019d come to tell her off for daring to turn her back on him this afternoon.</p> <p>Nate was used to obedience. Particularly from her. As a fifteen-year-old, she\u2019d taken everything he said as gospel. At sixteen, she\u2019d given him the occasional moment of lip but had always accepted his decisions in the end. And he\u2019d never let her down. He\u2019d been her rock...especially after that dark day two years ago when she had failed to save Lucas\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cCarlos wanted to die,\u201d Nate had whispered in her ear, holding her tight as she sobbed over the loss. He\u2019d still held her then. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to live without Shayla.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken away her sense of failure, but she\u2019d understood. The bond between mates was beautiful, powerful. Separated mates could live without each other, but it hurt. As she knew too well. And she shouldn\u2019t! Unlike those whose mates had been lost to death, Nate was alive but wouldn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>That was so incredibly wrong. Changelings weren\u2019t Psy. Touch was as necessary to them as food and air. Tamsyn thought nothing of hugging and kissing a fellow packmate who needed reassurance. That her mate wouldn\u2019t even give her that...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she lied into the dark. \u201cHell, yes I do.\u201d Shoving off the sheets and blankets, she slid off the bed and went to get a glass of water. Ice cold water. God, even her skin ached.</p><p>Filling up the glass, she took it and herself to the front window. Her plan\u2014to distract herself by admiring her tree\u2014disappeared the second she saw the leopard asleep on one of the branches. She couldn\u2019t make out his markings but she already knew who it was. Nathan. The man wouldn\u2019t take her as his mate in truth, but he thought he had the right to protect her? Damn him. Slamming down the glass, she was halfway to the door when she looked down at herself.</p><p>All she wore was an old football jersey. It was Nate\u2019s. She\u2019d stolen it from him in a blatant bit of thievery, needing his scent around her. But big as it was, it gaped over her full breasts and only hit her midthigh. Maybe she should change. And it was freezing outside.</p><p>Nate probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate her walking around half-naked any\u2014She slapped her forehead. \u201cTamsyn, sometimes you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Of course he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her walking around half-naked. The sight of so much skin might incite his beast, tempt it enough to overpower the man\u2019s will.</p><p>Her lips curved.</p><p>Five</p><p>SHOVING HER FEET INTO A PAIR OF FLUFFY SLIPPERS, SHE stamped outside and to the tree, knowing he\u2019d have woken the second she opened the door. \u201cNathan, you get out of here right now!\u201d She hugged her arms around herself, well aware the move plumped up her breasts, creating a deep cleavage.</p><p>The leopard growled at her, its green eyes dangerously bright.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you growl at me,\u201d she said and her breath turned the air to mist. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to pick and choose which parts of the mating deal you want. It\u2019s all or nothing. Go away! \u201d</p><p>He padded along the tree limb and leaped to the ground by her feet, a stunning creature she could stroke for hours. Then he butted at her legs, urging her inside the house.</p><p>The touch of his fur against her skin made her shiver. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you\u2019re gone.\u201d She\u2019d meant to tease him, but already, her own leopard was scraping at the insides of her skin, so darkly needy it scared her.</p><p>He bared his teeth and gave a short, husky roar meant to snap her to attention. His eyes told her to get her little butt back inside or he\u2019d do it for her. She hoped he would. Because if he shifted now, he\u2019d be naked. Skin to skin contact at last. Her thighs trembled, but she somehow found the strength to stamp her foot and point away from her home. \u201cOut! Leave!\u201d</p><p>He began walking toward the house. She frowned, wondering what he was up to. He got to the door and looked over his shoulder. She wasn\u2019t going to fall for that. Then he walked inside. Her eyes wide, she hotfooted it inside, closing the door behind her.</p><p>The leopard was sitting in front of the currently unlit laz-fire, the artificial heating system designed to resemble a live blaze\u2014but one that had zero chance of getting out of control. He glanced at her, his eyes night-glow in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said, half-frozen. Kicking off the furry slippers, she turned on the laz-fire. The flames shot to instantaneous life. \u201cBrr.\u201d Rubbing her hands together, she sat down beside Nathan. She couldn\u2019t quite think straight but that was okay. Nate was in her house. He was here. And they were alone.</p><p>He butted at her hand with his head and she began to stroke him, her body warming up from the inside out. \u201cWhat were you doing out there, Nate?\u201d</p><p>He lay his head on her thigh and growled softly in response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because my parents are gone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She sighed and tried not to tremble at the proximity of him. He was so lethally beautiful, his body pure muscle under her strokes. \u201cWhen are you going to accept that I\u2019m a grown-up? Huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No response. The steady rhythm of his breathing told her he\u2019d fallen asleep. She couldn\u2019t bear to wake him. Tears pricked her eyes. If she shifted, they would both be cat and...No, she thought. She wouldn\u2019t use the animals\u2019 driving need against Nate.</p><p>It was the man who wanted to give her \u201cfreedom\u201d and it was the man she had to convince. The animal already knew what was right. If only Nate\u2019s human half hadn\u2019t gotten in the way. Except, of course, she loved that part of him, too. Sighing, she stroked her fingers through his fur over and over.</p><p>It was a long while later when she curled up beside him and went to sleep.</p> <p>NATE WAITED TO LIFT HIS HEAD UNTIL HE WAS ABSOLUTELY sure Tamsyn was fast asleep. The last hour had been both pain and pleasure, torture and redemption. The animal couldn\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t claim her. One thought, a split-second shift into human form, and he could take her right there on the softness of the rug.</p><p>The temptation was shockingly strong.</p><p>She was the most exquisite creature he had ever seen. A long, tall drink of woman. He could spend all night stroking his hand up and down the sleekness of her thighs\u2014exposed by that jersey she\u2019d stolen years ago.</p><p>He\u2019d known, of course. It had given him pleasure to think of her covered in his scent. Since he hadn\u2019t seen her wearing it around, he had guessed, had wanted , it to be her nightwear of choice. His claws dug into the rug as he shifted his attention to the proud thrust of her breasts. There was no question about it\u2014Tamsyn was every inch a woman. And so heartbreakingly young.</p><p>No one would think to look at her that she\u2019d been their healer for two years already. Oh, the few packs they had trusted after Shayla\u2019s murder\u2014packs with men and women seeded from DarkRiver\u2014had sent senior healers to complete her education, but it was Tamsyn the pack looked to. She was their own and she was deeply trusted.</p> <p>Because she had never let them down.</p><p>He remembered her at seventeen. Her mentor was dead and Shayla\u2019s mate, Carlos, lay critically injured. Their son, Lucas, remained missing. Tammy had been so slender back then, a fragile reed he\u2019d thought would snap under the weight of the dying sentinel\u2019s wounds. But she hadn\u2019t broken. Instead, she\u2019d put every inch of her abilities into healing Carlos.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been able to save his life, but she had given him the strength to whisper his final words\u2014ones that told them Lucas was still alive. Tammy had been completely drained by the effort to save Carlos, but when they had rescued a badly injured Lucas, she had somehow found impossibly more to give. And she\u2019d kept doing it for weeks.</p><p>She had slept only when Nate forced her to, worried she\u2019d collapse under the strain. Even then, she would crawl out of bed after a few hours at most. Finally, Nate had had to half-kidnap her. He\u2019d held her in his lap and told her to sleep. And she had, curled up trustingly in his arms.</p><p>The girl who had been that slender reed was gone. She\u2019d grown into a woman of courage and beauty, but one who had never been given the chance to be a juvenile. Leopards valued their freedom to roam\u2014many left the pack and came back after spending time in the wild. He, too, had left DarkRiver for several years in his late teens. Tammy had never had that choice, her wings clipped at fifteen.</p><p>Backing away from the lush temptation of her, he dragged an afghan off the couch using his teeth and pulled it over her. It would\u2019ve been easier in his human form, but he didn\u2019t trust his willpower that much. One touch was all it would take. He\u2019d crumble like so much dust.</p> <p>He decided to keep watch over her from the outside.</p><p>TAMSYN WOKE UP WARM...AND ALONE.IT HURT. \u201cI COULD hate you, Nathan.\u201d Getting up, she hugged the afghan around herself and stared into the laz-fire. Her internal clock told her it was morning, sometime around six. Despite the fact that she\u2019d done all she could to entice Nate, he hadn\u2019t so much as kissed her.</p><p>Was she that disgusting to him?</p><p>A sob caught in her throat. It was the first time she\u2019d considered that Nate\u2019s recalcitrance might spring, not from his overwhelming protectiveness, but because he didn\u2019t want to be tied to her. Her lower lip trembled. She hugged the afghan even tighter around her body in a vain effort to ward off hysteria.</p><p>Being unwanted by a mate was a nightmare beyond comprehension. Mating wasn\u2019t marriage, wasn\u2019t infatuation, wasn\u2019t a connection you ever broke. She was tied to Nate on the level of her soul. More than that, she loved him. Some people said that there was no difference between the bond and love, but she knew there was. It was one thing to be compelled toward Nate, another to adore him like she did. She loved everything about him, from his strength to his laugh to his unashamed masculinity.</p><p>But what if, for Nate, the bond was simply a compulsion? One he couldn\u2019t dissolve, but that he wouldn\u2019t have chosen if he\u2019d been given the choice? She was hardly a prize, she knew that, had always known it. Added to that, Nate was older, more experienced. Maybe he\u2019d expected and wanted to find a mate who could match him, a woman who\u2019d seen far more of the world than just their small corner of it.</p><p>In contrast, Tamsyn had always been tied to DarkRiver. That didn\u2019t matter to her. She was a woman of home and hearth. It was the way of most healers. They liked to be near their people, their lands. Healers built permanent homes before most others, took in any who needed their help, and cherished those who were their own. The months in New York had almost torn out her heart, she\u2019d been so homesick.</p><p>But Nate had roamed. He\u2019d left the pack for years as a juvenile and come back a man, strong, loyal, and with wild horizons in his eyes. What did he see in hers? Home\u2014calm, steady, enduring. But not very exciting. No wonder he didn\u2019t want her!</p> <p>Tamsyn had worked herself into quite a state, something that would\u2019ve flabbergasted those who knew her, when the comm console chimed. It was the emergency code. She blinked and snapped to attention, the healer in her taking over. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>Juanita\u2019s face appeared onscreen. \u201cDorian broke his arm while we were sparring near the Circle. It\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move him.\u201d Turning off the screen, she got up, changed at the speed of light, grabbed her emergency supplies, and headed out.</p><p>The cold air cut across her cheeks as she ran. If Dorian hadn\u2019t been so close by, she\u2019d have taken a vehicle. But at this distance, her changeling speed was faster than the vehicle would have been on the rutted forest roads. The roads had been damaged on purpose. It was another line of defense, meant to bog down the unwary. DarkRiver was never going to be caught off-guard again.</p><p>She found Juanita crouched beside Dorian, who was sitting propped up against a tree. Though the woman looked concerned, Dorian\u2019s face betrayed nothing. Barely into double digits, the boy was better at hiding his feelings than most adults. \u201cWhat were you two doing to break that arm?\u201d she asked, going down beside him.</p><p>\u201cKarate. Brown belt. San-kyu,\u201d Juanita answered.</p><p>Tamsyn didn\u2019t berate the other woman for using such advanced techniques against a boy. They all knew Dorian was no child. He\u2019d been born latent and had no ability to shift into leopard form. Perhaps it was something that might have been held against him had he not made it his mission to become so dangerous, no one would dare treat him as anything but another cat.</p><p>\u201cA single break. Clean,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou were lucky.\u201d</p><p>Pure blue eyes looked into hers. \u201cHow long till I can use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I say.\u201d She put a pressure injector against his arm before he could object that he didn\u2019t need the anesthetic. Then, using the portable deep-tissue viewer to double-check the conclusions of her healing gift, she set the break and encased it in a lightweight but durable cast. Dorian had normal changeling strength and healing capacity\u2014he\u2019d regain the use of his arm far sooner than a human or Psy would have in the same situation.</p><p>\u201cNita, can you give me a minute with Dorian?\u201d She glanced at the beautiful woman.</p><p>Juanita nodded. \u201cI have a perimeter watch to take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he gets home.\u201d</p><p>Dorian scowled as they talked about him but didn\u2019t say anything until Juanita had disappeared into the trees. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head at that stubborn male expression, Tamsyn moved to sit slightly behind him. Then she threw her arms around his neck and leaned down to press her cheek against his. \u201cSan-kyu, that\u2019s the third level, isn\u2019t it?\u201d With the dominant males\u2014or with the young ones who would one day be dominant\u2014you had to tread carefully. Demanding would get her nothing from Dorian.</p><p>He softened a little. \u201cYep. I\u2019m going for black next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive. When I left for New York, you were still on the first level of brown.\u201d</p><p>He let her tug him further into her embrace. Touch was at the heart of a healthy pack. It was what bound them together, what gave them their strength. Smiling, she raised her hand and began to brush her fingers through his incongruously silky blond hair as he lay against her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be past Juanita\u2019s level soon.\u201d It was a small boast and it was perfectly normal. Whatever had happened to break his arm, it hadn\u2019t bruised his pride too much.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThen who are you going to beat up?\u201d</p><p>He actually smiled. \u201cYou want I should do Nate for you?\u201d</p><p>It seemed the whole pack knew how things were between her and Nathan. \u201cBrat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you like me.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she pressed a kiss to his cheek before rising. He followed, his bones showing the promise of a height that would top hers by several inches at least. \u201cLook after yourself, Dorian. If I see you one more time this year, I\u2019m going to do something nasty like pull healer rank and ground you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wish you could ground Nate\u2014maybe in your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorian!\u201d</p><p>Mischief in his grin, he backed away from her before turning to run off through the trees. She kept her smile hidden until he was gone. Then she bent down and began to gather up her supplies and equipment. She was pleased. Her medical training had come in very handy today. Otherwise she\u2019d have used up healing energy to no useful purpose. What she did came from inside her\u2014she had to conserve her strength for the worst injuries...as had happened with Carlos. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaves rustled to her left and she looked up to see Juanita step out. \u201cDid you see my\u2014ah, there it is.\u201d Nita picked a slender black timepiece off the ground. \u201cTook it off while we were sparring. That boy is dangerous when he gets going.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Tamsyn continued to put away her things. Nita was the last person she wanted to chat to, especially after the horrible realization she\u2019d had that morning. Then the other woman went down on her haunches beside Tamsyn.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tammy. I need some advice.\u201d</p> <p>Her healer core came to the surface, consigning the sick ugliness of jealousy to one tiny corner. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d She looked into that sensual, exotic face and no longer saw a rival, but a packmate who might need help.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Dark eyes twinkled. \u201cI\u2019m wondering how to bring up Nate without putting my foot in it.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>TAMSYN FROZE.\u201cWHAT ABOUT NATE?\u201d SHE FORCED HERSELF to say.</p><p>\u201cLook\u201d\u2014Juanita tapped a finger against her knee\u2014\u201che\u2019s a wonderful guy and we had some fun together\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Tamsyn shut her bag and prepared to get up.</p><p>Juanita stopped her by holding onto her upper arm. \u201cBut that\u2019s all it was. Fun. We were friends then and we\u2019re friends now. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I have to go.\u201d She was so hungry for Nate\u2019s touch that even the idea of him with another woman bruised her raw.</p><p>Juanita didn\u2019t release her. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening, Tammy. I\u2019m telling you that that man never looked at me with the kind of wild heat with which he looks at you. He never craved me, not like he craves you.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn stared at the other woman. \u201cHe left me,\u201d she found herself saying. \u201cI was all but offering myself to him on a silver platter and he left me. He doesn\u2019t crave me.\u201d</p><p>Juanita laughed. \u201cThe man wants you so much, he\u2019s driving all the juveniles crazy. You know how sensitive they are to sexual hunger, and right now, Nate is a six-feet-plus shot of pure animal need. And he\u2019s not interested in anyone but you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing.\u201d Juanita stood and waited until Tamsyn, too, was up before continuing. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way but you\u2019re young.\u201d</p><p>How else could she take it? \u201cI\u2019m more mature than people years older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to come to you for advice on a thousand things.\u201d Juanita\u2019s matter-of-fact words took the wind out of Tamsyn\u2019s sails. \u201cBut there\u2019s one area in which you are a babe in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d Tamsyn whispered, embarrassment a blaze across her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYep. You were one of the lucky ones\u2014you found your mate early, but that came with a price.\u201d Juanita didn\u2019t need to spell it out. \u201cSo trust me when I tell you the man is dying for a taste of you.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn ached to believe. \u201cHe\u2019s very good at hiding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is. He\u2019s stubborn and he\u2019s dominant. He wants to do this his way. It\u2019s up to you to change his mind. Please do it before he drives everyone insane.\u201d</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, Tamsyn swallowed her pride and put her faith in the bonds of Pack. \u201cYou have experience. Teach me what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Juanita grinned. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><p>ADAY AFTER HE\u2019D LEFT TAMMY SLEEPING BY THE FIRE, NATE returned from a meeting with Lachlan to find the area around her home crawling with children. Not all of them were exactly underage. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked Cian, who was sitting on what looked like a bench and table set stolen from their alpha\u2019s backyard.</p><p>The older man grinned. \u201cMaking Christmas decorations, what does it look like?\u201d He returned to painting the small glass ball in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Nate insisted.</p><p>Cian scowled at him. \u201cBecause Tamsyn said I had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s less than half your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried to argue with her when she wants to get her own way?\u201d Shaking his head, Cian returned to his task. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s kind of fun. And she\u2019s got the juveniles interested in something other than raising hell, which makes our job easier.\u201d</p><p>Now that Cian had mentioned it, Nate realized just how many of the older kids were present. Even arm-cast-laden Dorian appeared to be having fun. Nate watched as the boy bent down to help a five-year-old paint something on her globe. When she smiled, so did Dorian.</p><p>Turning his head, Nate found Lucas sitting with another group of young ones. Several cubs were trying to use his body as a climbing frame, but from the sharp grin on his face, he didn\u2019t seem to be worried. He called out to someone else and Nate\u2019s eyes followed his gaze to locate another unexpected addition to Tamsyn\u2019s gathering. Vaughn. He was even worse a loner than Dorian. But there he was, patiently helping several of the three-year-olds.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re happy,\u201d a feminine voice said from beside him.</p><p>He looked down. \u201cYou did good.\u201d</p><p>Astonishment was open on her face. \u201cOh.\u201d A pause. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me complimenting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She shrugged, her breasts pushing out against the softness of her black cowl-neck sweater. \u201cYou just don\u2019t do it much.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to pinch a bit of her sweater with his fingertips. \u201cWhat is this stuff?\u201d It was so damn strokable he was having a hard time keeping himself from doing exactly that. Shaping his mate\u2019s body with his palms seemed like the best idea he\u2019d had all day.</p><p>\u201cAngora blend.\u201d She pulled away from his touch and took a step backward. \u201cDo you want to paint an ornament? Or you can help the children.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the distance she\u2019d put between them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in her eyes before her lashes lowered to screen her expression. \u201cI\u2019m living my own life. It\u2019s what you want, right?\u201d A small smile. \u201cI\u2019m finally beginning to appreciate what you\u2019ve been trying to tell me.\u201d With that, she went off to check up on a group of giggling teenage girls.</p><p>Nate wondered if he looked as sucker-punched as he felt. She\u2019d pulled that stunt out of nowhere. All these months of fighting him, of demanding he accept their bond, and she was suddenly going to fall in line? Right. He\u2019d believe that when he saw it. Tamsyn had called him every day from New York\u2014she couldn\u2019t shut him out if she tried.</p><p>Twelve hours of near-silence later, long after everyone else had left, he grit his teeth and handed her an ornament. \u201cThis is the last finished one.\u201d Many had taken theirs home to complete.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She hung it on her damn tree before jumping down from the branch on which she\u2019d crouched. \u201cI think it\u2019ll look fabulous when it\u2019s done, don\u2019t you?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, she turned to walk up the path to her door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He barely kept the growl out of his voice.</p><p>She threw him a confused look. \u201cIt\u2019s dark. I\u2019m going to have a bath and dinner.\u201d</p><p>He waited for the invitation to join her. It didn\u2019t come. \u201cYour parents aren\u2019t back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry.\u201d A tight smile accompanied her words. \u201cA few of my girlfriends are dropping by tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends. Actually, do you mind not coming by at all?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe can hardly talk girl-talk if we know you\u2019re out here skulking.\u201d</p><p>His temper wasn\u2019t easily stoked. But it was smoking now. \u201cSkulking?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an airy wave. \u201cYou know what I mean. We\u2019ll be fine. I even asked some of the other soldiers to swing past during their night watches. You should go do your own thing.\u201d A few seconds later, her door shut behind her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, rooted to the spot by pure disbelief. She\u2019d told him to get lost. Nobody told him to get lost. Especially not his mate. He\u2019d taken the first step up the path to her home when he felt someone walk out of the woods behind him. He turned to find Juanita. \u201cWhat?\u201d It was the leopard speaking.</p><p>\u201cThis is part of my night route.\u201d She gave him a curious look. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>What kind of idiotic question was that? \u201cLooking after my mate.\u201d</p><p>Juanita scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re on the eastern perimeter, Nate. If you wanted a change, you should\u2019ve told Cian. We\u2019ll have a gap there otherwise and you know we can\u2019t afford to. Especially not with Solias King\u2019s men sniffing around.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was right. \u201cCian factors mates into the watch assignments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you haven\u2019t claimed Tammy. He probably thought you wanted some space from her\u2014you\u2019re getting more and more irritable.\u201d Her tone was blunt. \u201cLook, I\u2019d take the eastern for you, but I\u2019m pulling a double anyway and I\u2019d prefer to stay close to home.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing he could say to that. He was one of the most experienced soldiers in the pack, and as such, he had a job to do. \u201cDon\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d It was half warning, half threat.</p><p>Juanita\u2019s response was a raised eyebrow. \u201cTammy\u2019s no cub. She can handle herself.\u201d</p><p>TAMSYN PUT OUT THE SNACKS WITH TREMBLING HANDS. SHE couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d \u201cignored\u201d Nate all day. The act had stretched her nerves to screaming point, the compulsion to speak to him as powerful and as intrinsic as her heartbeat. She was obsessing over their parting words when the soft buzz of the doorbell sliced her thoughts in half.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she opened the door. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Juanita grinned. \u201cI told you it would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s furious.\u201d She looked over the other woman\u2019s shoulder, hoping to see Nate. \u201cI thought he was going to march up here and demand I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Juanita put her hands on her hips and shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s used to demanding something from you and getting it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what mates do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But he\u2019s being an ass about it. He\u2019s not exactly meeting your demands, is he?\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn scowled on Nate\u2019s behalf. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare defend him,\u201d Juanita ordered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you back down, either. You\u2019re just giving him a taste of his own medicine. This is what he\u2019s been doing to you for over a year. Let him see how he likes it.\u201d</p><p>It made sense, but Tamsyn wasn\u2019t a soldier, to think of love like strategy. Her heart was that of a healer\u2014gentle and easy to forgive. \u201cHe hates it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The other woman grinned. \u201cIf you don\u2019t allow him access to you anytime he wants to feed the animal\u2019s need to be close to you, he\u2019s going to get desperate sooner rather than later. Then he\u2019ll jump you and, bang, we\u2019ll all live happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn nodded. She liked the idea of being jumped by a sexually hungry Nate. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t do it soon, I might attack him myself.\u201d Her sensitivity to his proximity was getting worse, the mere sound of his voice enough to melt her to damp readiness.</p><p>Juanita grinned. \u201cI give him a week.\u201d</p> <p>TWO NIGHTS LATER,TAMSYN DECIDEDJUANITA WAS A GENIUS. Nate was scowling at her from across the Pack Circle, such violent need in those midnight blue eyes that she could feel her stomach twist itself into a thousand knots.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at him,\u201d she muttered noiselessly to herself. She hadn\u2019t said much more than hello to him for the past forty-eight hours, but if she didn\u2019t keep her eyes to herself, he\u2019d figure out just how hard it was for her to maintain her distant air. She ached for him and the ache was a pulsing beat in every inch of her skin...and worse in lower, hotter places.</p><p>Breaking the connection through sheer effort of will, she focused on the dancers in the middle of the Circle. They were part of an impromptu gathering sparked by the full yellow moon, a happy diversion from the general air of wary alertness that had gripped DarkRiver since the attack by the ShadowWalkers. That wasn\u2019t to say that their defenses were compromised. Those on watch were being spelled by off-duty packmates so everyone could join in the fun.</p><p>And it was fun\u2014warm, friendly, brilliantly alive. Several people had pulled out instruments and the music was energetic and strong. She clapped along with the players, and when Lucas came to offer her his hand, she took it with a smile. \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve got two left feet.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, the savage markings on one side of his face\u2014markings he\u2019d been born with\u2014making him look more panther than boy. \u201cGood thing I don\u2019t scare easy.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she let him swirl her around in an energetic dance that required enough of her concentration that she almost stopped thinking about Nate. When the tall juvenile snapped her back into his arms, she was breathless. \u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d she said, glad to see him happy for once.</p> <p>There was darkness in Lucas, such darkness. She knew it would be there until the day he took vengeance on those who had stolen his family from him. He was four years younger than her, but looking into those eyes, she saw not a child but a man. Lucas would one day be an alpha of incredible strength, of that she had no doubt.</p><p>He held her closer, touching her with the easy friendliness of Pack. She rested her cheek against his shoulder and swayed to the gentler beat that had replaced the pounding dance music. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I thought you needed to be held.\u201d The words were blunt, the tone affectionate.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I did.\u201d There was no need to lie. Not with Pack.</p><p>\u201cDorian said you don\u2019t want us to beat some sense into Nate.\u201d He sighed as if in disappointment. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at his teasing. \u201cI like him in once piece, but thanks for the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to dance with him? \u2019Cause he\u2019s heading this way.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p> <p>SHE SMELLED THE RICH EARTHINESS OF NATHAN\u2019S DISTINCTIVE scent before she could answer. It hit her system like a drug. An instant later, the heavy weight of his hand dropped on to her hip. \u201cLuc. Go find a girl your own age.\u201d</p><p>Lucas released her. \u201cI think I like sexy older women\u2014why don\u2019t I keep Tammy and you find someone else?\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s growl was met with unrepentant laughter as Lucas threw Tammy a wink and walked away. She paid little attention to the exchange, her entire body focused on Nate as he placed both his hands low on her hips and pulled her back against his chest. \u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d He spoke against her ear, breath hot.</p><p>It was an effort to think. \u201cJeans and a sweater. Is that a crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sweater is orange and anyone can see down your cleavage.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to laugh. \u201cNate, the vee isn\u2019t that deep and the color is soft peach, not orange.\u201d It went beautifully with her hair and eyes, throwing up golden highlights she\u2019d never have believed possible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking painted on your body, just like your jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, Nathan Ryder.\u201d Firming up her tone, she put her hands over his and began to sway against him. It wasn\u2019t a calculated act\u2014her body simply craved the contact. \u201cI\u2019m nineteen years old. This is what women my age wear.\u201d</p><p>His breath seemed to catch for an instant. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t. It had always seemed to her that she shouldn\u2019t aggravate the situation between them by being deliberately sexual. But tonight, she\u2019d followed Juanita\u2019s advice again and gone wild. The jeans\u2014brought on a whim in New York\u2014shaped her butt, and from the good-natured whistles she\u2019d inspired in male packmates, it wasn\u2019t a bad butt.</p><p>As for the long-forgotten sweater, baggy when she\u2019d been a gangly thirteen, it was made of a soft, strokable material that did feel painted on over her now-womanly figure. That was the point. It was meant to make it hotly clear to Nate that she was a sexual young female, not a nun happy to wait for him to make up his mind.</p><p>\u201cI decided it was time to change my personal style.\u201d She moved against him again, exquisitely aware of the unforgiving ridge of his erection. \u201cHave some fun before we settle down, exactly like you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d But he didn\u2019t do anything to halt her subtle erotic movements. \u201cThis kind of fun isn\u2019t good for the blood pressure of the other men.\u201d He pulled her even closer.</p><p>\u201cThey know I\u2019m yours,\u201d she murmured, feeling her skin flush. \u201cOnly yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you dressed like an invitation?\u201d</p><p>For you, you idiot, she wanted to say. \u201cI wanted to feel sexy.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much of a chance to explore that side of me.\u201d That, at least, was true. Between Nate\u2019s pigheadedness and her responsibilities, she hadn\u2019t had much play in her life. She did so want to play with Nate\u2014silly, intimate, affectionate games.</p><p>His hands tightened. \u201cAnd what are you going to do after getting yourself all heated up like this?\u201d It was a half-growled question, but she knew him well enough to know that that roughness was an indication of need, not anger.</p><p>She tilted her head, looking up at him as he looked down. \u201cI bought a friend.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to choke for a second. \u201cA friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. He vibrates.\u201d It was a whisper meant to carry to his ears alone. \u201cI think I\u2019ll try him out tonight.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were pressing down so hard, he was probably going to leave bruises. She didn\u2019t care. Not when he was burning her up with the heat in his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Raising her arms, she linked them behind his neck. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first time shouldn\u2019t be with that .\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m getting older, Nathan. I have needs.\u201d Dark, clawing needs. Needs only he could fulfill.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t use that stupid toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid.\u201d She rubbed against the hardness of him and heard him suck in a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Pulling her arms off his neck, he spun her around so she faced him. \u201cDon\u2019t. Use. That. Thing. \u201d It was an order.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She pressed into him, the leopard in her inciting a desire to taunt, to torment. \u201cLots of women do it.\u201d</p><p>Eyes going cat, he leaned down to speak against her ear, his lips teasing a suddenly sensitive portion of her anatomy. \u201cIf you promise not to use it on yourself tonight,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll use it on you.\u201d</p><p>Her legs threatened to collapse. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise first.\u201d</p><p>She was weak, so weak where he was concerned. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t use it tonight.\u201d</p><p>He nipped at the shell of her ear and it was then she realized he\u2019d danced them to the farthest edge of the Pack Circle, well away from the reach of the temporary lights. She whimpered and held on. \u201cNate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. It won\u2019t be that long, baby.\u201d His hand stroked over her back, a rigid inflexibility to his body that hadn\u2019t been there before. \u201cYou need a little more time.\u201d</p><p>A nauseous feeling twisted through her. \u201cNate, you said you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the time is right.\u201d There it was again, that tense restraint...as if with her surrender, he had found control.</p><p>Anger and pain mixed a caustic brew inside her. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, wrenching away from him, \u201cI only promised not to use it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTamsyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d she continued, \u201cI\u2019m not going to fall for that dirty trick again.\u201d She began backing into the Circle. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being teased and left wanting. Tomorrow night, I\u2019m taking care of business.\u201d</p><p>TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS.</p><p>Nate glared into his morning coffee and then at the duty roster he\u2019d just received from Cian. Punching in the sentinel\u2019s code on the comm console, he waited for Cian\u2019s face to appear. \u201cWhat the hell are you on? This roster is a joke!\u201d He was so pissed, he consigned seniority and rank to Hades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cian blinked. \u201cI heard you wanted to be on the perimeter, away from Tammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall asking for that particular favor .\u201d</p><p>The other man winced at his tone. \u201cYou do make a point of avoiding her whenever she comes after you.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThough she seems to have stopped doing that lately.\u201d</p> <p>That observation made Nate\u2019s incisors threaten to erupt. The leopard was not happy with Tamsyn right now. Neither was the man. They both wanted to bite. To dominate. To mark. \u201cSwitch me with Juanita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Cian scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly in a good mood. Do you want to be around Tammy?\u201d</p><p>It was an insult\u2014as if he\u2019d ever hurt her. \u201cIf I had wanted advice, I\u2019d have asked for it. Switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Cian threw up his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Nita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mind your own damn business from now on.\u201d Turning off the comm, he finished his coffee and headed out. He was hungry, but he figured Tammy would have something\u2014she was the best cook in DarkRiver.</p> <p>His new watch area was in the immediate vicinity of the Pack Circle and included Tammy\u2019s home among a few others. On his first pass, it appeared she was still asleep, but he caught the sharp freshness of tea leaves on the second pass. Since he\u2019d remained in human form, it was easy to walk up to her back door and knock.</p><p>He knew she had to have scented him, but she peered out suspiciously from the kitchen window before opening the door with a scowl. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so she was still mad. His cock throbbed at the memory of the events that had led to their fight. He wanted to put his hands on the sweet curves of her bottom, crush her to him, and kiss the hell out of her bad mood.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, too, sunshine,\u201d he managed to say through the chokehold of desire. It was torture being near her, but that was infinitely better than the distance she\u2019d maintained over the past few days.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just hungry.\u201d She snorted and turned away, leaving the door open.</p><p>He walked in to find her at the counter, cutting slices of bread from what looked like a home-baked loaf. He forced himself to stand to the side instead of going behind her and bending down to draw in the lusciously feminine scent along the line of her throat. \u201cOnly bread today?\u201d</p> <p>She lifted the knife and pointed it in his direction. \u201cDo you want to get fed or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love bread.\u201d He knew how to stroke his mate when she needed stroking. His mind immediately took the image and ran with it, ratcheting his hunger past explosive. \u201cWhy are you half-dressed?\u201d She was wearing his old football shirt and those ridiculous pink fluffy slippers. Sexy and adorable. A killer combination.</p><p>\u201cI was minding my own business in my own house. You\u2019re the one who decided to intrude.\u201d She slapped some butter onto a slice of bread and shoved it in his direction.</p><p>He decided not to ask for jam. \u201cBad night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate,\u201d she said very quietly, gripping the edge of the counter with her hands. \u201cDid you come here to gloat?\u201d</p><p>He put down the half-eaten piece of bread. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d She turned and poked at his chest with a sharp finger. \u201cLook, I can make stupid, virginal Tammy Mahaire so hot she doesn\u2019t know which way is up. I can leave her gasping for me and walk away as if it doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He grabbed at her hand, but she pulled away. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything like that. I didn\u2019t have a good night\u2019s sleep, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that makes it all right!\u201d She threw up her arms. \u201cWe were both miserable. Whoop-de-frickin\u2019-do!\u201d</p><p>There was no missing the sarcasm. It dripped from every word. \u201cWhat the hell is it with you lately?\u201d He succeeded in trapping her against the counter.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d She shoved at him but he was far stronger. \u201cGo away. Go away and leave me alone. Don\u2019t you get that? How many times do I have to tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that\u2014I\u2019m your mate.\u201d</p><p>She stopped fighting, her chest heaving. \u201cNo, Nate, like I told you before, you don\u2019t get to pick and choose which parts of the mating bond you want to accept. As far as your treatment of me goes, I\u2019m not your mate. I\u2019m simply another young, uninteresting female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m sexually frustrated.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cBut as we discussed last night, that can be easily fixed.\u201d</p><p>He snapped. How could she possibly think to replace him with some mechanical object? Masculine pride, pure need, and raw heat made for a volatile combination. \u201cSex? That\u2019s really what this is about?\u201d He pushed harder into her, crushing the softness of her thighs under his.</p><p>Instead of backing off, she pushed into him. \u201cYes! Yes! Yes! Clear enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Grabbing her waist, he lifted her onto the counter, spreading her knees wide in the same move. Something fell to the floor and shattered, but he didn\u2019t give a shit. \u201cYou want to fuck, we\u2019ll fuck.\u201d</p><p>A hint of uncertainty moved over her face. \u201cNate\u2014\u201d</p><p>He closed his hand over the bare skin of her upper thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re backing off? Don\u2019t want me now that you\u2019re faced with the reality?\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered. \u201cNot like this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy are you being so mean?\u201d</p><p>The protective male core of him couldn\u2019t bear to see her looking so emotionally bruised, but they had to have this out. He couldn\u2019t handle being pushed the way she\u2019d been pushing him since her return from New York. \u201cI\u2019m trying to give you something\u2014I\u2019m trying to love you the only way I know how, and you\u2019re rejecting it because you\u2019re hot for sex?\u201d That hurt him. Her freedom was the biggest gift he could give her. Some days, the cost it demanded threatened to drive him to murder.</p><p>\u201cNo, Nathan, no.\u201d She cupped her face in his hands. \u201cI just need you\u2014all of you\u2014so much that I\u2019m going crazy. I need your laugh. I need your company. I need you to sleep beside me and I need you to wake when I wake. I need you with everything in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop with the sex talk. It\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands dropped to his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s not me?\u201d A soft question.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re warm and practical and loyal. You don\u2019t go around flaunting yourself like a\u2014\u201d He caught himself before he said something unforgivable.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I finish it for you\u2014like a bitch in heat\u2014that\u2019s what you were going to say, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cDAMN IT, TAMMY, DON\u2019T LOOK LIKE THAT.\u201d HE WAS THE one who cupped her face this time\u2014her spine was straight, but she couldn\u2019t hide the hurt in her eyes. \u201cAll this, the way you\u2019ve been talking and dressing, it\u2019s not anything normal for you and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him through her lashes. \u201cYeah. Don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>His beast didn\u2019t like the flatness in her tone. Reacting instinctively, he bent until their foreheads touched. \u201cCome on, where\u2019s my sweet Tammy?\u201d He missed the woman who had become his closest friend over the years, the one with whom he could totally lower his guard. It was something he hadn\u2019t been able to do since the day she\u2019d started pushing at him. \u201cTamsyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine and I\u2019m also late.\u201d She gave him a shaky smile, then pressed her hands gently against his chest. \u201cSome of the kids will be here soon to finish up their ornaments. I\u2019d better get dressed. I\u2019ll talk to you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right, baby?\u201d His leopard was pacing inside his skull, growling that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cJust a headache. Lack of sleep, you know.\u201d She shrugged, making the former point of contention a joke. When her lips curved upward in a deeper smile, the leopard relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Laughing, he helped her down from the counter, then lifted her over the mess of the broken jam jar on the floor. \u201cGo get changed. I\u2019ll clean this up and head out to continue my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She reached out, picked up a muffin from a tin, and gave it to him. \u201cI made them for the kids.\u201d</p><p>He bit into it. \u201cGood thing I got here first.\u201d</p><p>TAMSYN LEFT THE ROOM TO THE SOUND OF NATE\u2019S chuckle. The knives of pain inside her stabbed with brutal force, but she kept her composure until she heard him leave the house. Then she sat down on her bed and cried. The tears weren\u2019t of frustration or simple hurt. They were the shattered cries of a broken heart.</p><p>Juanita had been wrong. The mating heat might have forced Nate into wanting her, but he didn\u2019t actually see her as a sexual, desirable woman. He saw her as comfortable...practical. Warm, loyal Tamsyn. If the bond hadn\u2019t thrown them together, he\u2019d probably never have looked at her twice, not as a man looks at a woman.</p><p>She might have lain there for hours, but she couldn\u2019t bear to disappoint the kids. So she got up and dressed. What she saw in the mirror simply reinforced her earlier conclusions. Dressed in a pair of old jeans and a thick white sweater, with her hair pulled back into a ponytail, she looked young and...ordinary.</p><p>She was no temptress. She was safe and sensible, the one that juveniles came to for help without judgment, and mature women for ideas about how to handle rambunctious infants. Even senior packmates didn\u2019t blink at asking her advice on Pack issues. Because she was trusted, both for her steady temperament and for her loyal heart. None of which was bad. Only she didn\u2019t want Nathan to see her as that\u2014she wanted him to see her as she saw him. As a lover, a playmate in the most intimate of arenas.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. And that blow cut so deep, she could barely think.</p><p>Something registered in her consciousness. A second later, she picked up the high-pitched sounds of children\u2019s voices. The healer in her took over\u2014there was no time for self-pity. Wiping her eyes with the backs of her hands, she went to the bathroom and splashed cold water over her face. Then she used her healing abilities to get rid of the redness around her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Pasting on a smile, she walked down and opened the door. The kids\u2019 bright and excited faces turned her faux smile real, but nothing could heal the open wound that was the jagged beat of her animal heart.</p><p>NATE SAW TAMSYN AGAIN THAT DAY, BUT IT WAS HOURS later and with several others as they sat around her kitchen table eating dinner. She\u2019d chosen not to sit next to him, but he could understand why. The awareness between them had only gotten stronger since this morning, until he could scent nothing but the sensual promise of her. She was everything he had ever wanted\u2014that smile, that acerbic wit she seemed to show him alone, and lord help him, that body\u2014and she was his. No other man had the right to her.</p> <p>His beast wanted to roar its claim, but he fought the impulse. He\u2019d wait. He\u2019d wait...but maybe not as long as he\u2019d initially planned. He\u2019d give her another six months of freedom at least, let her live some of her dreams. She could go roaming if she liked, explore a bit of the wild. It might be dangerous, but Tamsyn was smarter and more mature than most of the other young leopards. She\u2019d be fine.</p><p>The cat in him didn\u2019t like the idea, knew how badly it would hurt to be parted from her, but it had to be done. He never wanted her to turn to him\u2014as his mother had turned to his father\u2014and accuse him of stealing her life. That would destroy him. Because she was his life. The thought of crushing her spirit was his personal nightmare.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to eat or do you plan on staring at Tammy the whole night?\u201d Juanita passed him the potatoes.</p><p>\u201cI can stare if I like.\u201d It was his right.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she called out to Tammy. \u201cHey, where\u2019s that dress you were going to wear tonight?\u201d</p> <p>Tammy colored. \u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look fine to me.\u201d Dressed in black slacks and a pale blue cardigan, she appeared soft and touchable. Strokable. Shit. His mind was going off track again. Before long, he\u2019d start thinking about unbuttoning that cardigan and kissing his way\u2014</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Juanita hissed, breaking into the taut eroticism of his newest daydream. \u201cTell your mate she looks fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d He took the peas she almost shoved into his chest. \u201cShe looks\u2014\u201d He cut himself off before he said what he wanted to say, which was \u201cpretty enough to bite into.\u201d</p><p>Juanita shot him a disgusted glance before turning her attention to the packmate on her other side. Ignoring her, Nate went back to the pleasurable task of watching Tamsyn. The beast bucked to taste her. Six months , he told it. Six more months and then you can have her. In every way. And over again.</p><p>BUT A BARE WEEK LATER, HIS HUNGER FOR HER HAD GOTTEN so bad that he had Cian reassign him to the perimeter. Tammy was no longer trying to flaunt herself at him\u2014if anything, she seemed to be going to great lengths to give him space. Paradoxically, that only amplified the building pressure to mate, to touch and taste and claim. Without the control provided by the vivid scars of memory, he\u2019d have given in a hundred times already.</p> <p>Still, he couldn\u2019t keep from going to her each morning, just to see her smile. \u201cHey, sweetheart, any muffins today?\u201d</p><p>She gave him one, but there was no smile on her lips. \u201cHow\u2019s the Solias King situation? Any decisions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning to make a move in a few days.\u201d He\u2019d already told her what they intended to do\u2014she was his mate, and more than that, she was damn sharp, an integral part of the steel backbone of the pack. \u201cYou want to come along? Be a nice run.\u201d He wanted to feel her beside him, strong and hotly female.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working, Nate.\u201d</p><p>The quick change in subject rattled him. He put down the food, belatedly aware of the bags under her eyes, the lack of light in her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll get past it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot living so close.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cOne of us has to leave.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought about setting her free to roam, but now that it had come down to it, he found he couldn\u2019t let her go. \u201cDon\u2019t make any impulsive decisions. It\u2019ll die down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t. Don\u2019t lie to me,\u201d she snapped, folding her arms. \u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the final stages of the mating dance and it\u2019s going to keep getting worse, especially if our beasts continuously sense each other\u2019s presence. I was thinking I should go to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust wait.\u201d He fisted his hands to keep from touching her. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to some of the other mated pairs. Maybe there\u2019s something we can do to lessen the impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to go out into the world?\u201d Her voice was soft, her skin flushed with need. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why you keep pushing me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d That single word held his heart.</p><p>Nine</p><p>STAY, HE\u2019D SAID, BUT TAMSYN KNEW HE DIDN\u2019T MEAN IT the way she needed him to mean it. The mating instinct urged him to protect her and so he wanted her in sight. It didn\u2019t make him happy just to see her. Not like it made her heart bloom simply being in the same room as him.</p><p>If the mating urge died tomorrow, there would still be no other man for her. He was her one and only. But she wasn\u2019t his. Her throat feeling as if she\u2019d gotten a rock stuck in it, she left the parking garage in the city and crossed the street.</p><p>She\u2019d promised the kids she\u2019d get more lights for the tree, but now that she was here, she decided to pop into the bookstore, too. Nate liked reading. She knew exactly what to get him for Christmas. That thought made her want to cry again. Her nose grew stuffy with withheld tears as she strolled through the small and expensive hard-copy section. Most people bought the downloads, but she wanted to give Nate something he could hold, something that made him think of her.</p><p>Her choice was sold out, so she went to one of the consoles and ordered in another copy. That done, she picked up her other purchases and began to make her way to the exit.</p><p>That was when she saw her.</p><p>The Psy woman\u2014a stranger with eyes of darkest brown and skin the same rich shade\u2014was occupying a booth near the door. Dressed in a black pantsuit teamed with a white shirt, she appeared a serious business professional. But then again, all Psy seemed to wear variations on the same theme. Tamsyn had never seen one of the psychic race in any color, excepting white, that didn\u2019t fall in the range from deep gray to brown/black.</p><p>On any other day, she would have kept walking. But today, she didn\u2019t, her motive a mystery even to herself. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said, coming to a standstill near the woman.</p><p>The Psy looked up. \u201cDid you want the terminal? I\u2019ll be finished in approximately one minute.\u201d She glanced over Tamsyn\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThere are several others that appear free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want the terminal.\u201d Tamsyn looked at her, at her human-seeming eyes, her clear skin and shining fall of jet-black hair. There was nothing that marked this woman as different, as Psy, part of a race that had eliminated its emotions. \u201cI wanted to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>The stranger considered her request for a second. \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to ask a Psy and you\u2019re the only one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fault your logic.\u201d She tapped her finger on the screen to complete her purchase, then turned to give Tamsyn her full attention. \u201cYour question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever cry?\u201d It seemed imperative that she know the answer.</p><p>The Psy didn\u2019t react to the oddness of the question\u2014if she had, she wouldn\u2019t be Psy. \u201cEven those of my race have little to no control over certain physiological reactions. If, for example, a foreign object were to accidentally enter or touch my eye, that eye would certainly produce fluid in an attempt to excrete the intruding matter.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn frowned at the clinical description of such a wrenching, heartbreaking act. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t mean that. I mean, do you cry ?\u201d</p><p>The stranger looked at her for several long moments. \u201cAs you chose to approach a Psy, you must know the answer to that question. However, I\u2019ll respond as I see no possible negative repercussions from doing so.\u201d She picked up a slim electronic pad from the desk near the terminal. \u201cNo. We do not cry out of fear or sadness, anger, or rage. We do not feel, therefore, we do not shed tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you miss it?\u201d Tamsyn asked.</p><p>The Psy ran her gaze over Tamsyn\u2019s face. \u201cJudging from the redness of the blood vessels in your eyes and your stuffy nose, I believe I can say with certainty that crying is in no way a positive experience. Why would I miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I meant...don\u2019t you miss feeling?\u201d Love and hope, joy and need.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t miss what I\u2019ve never experienced,\u201d the other woman said, as if that should have been self-evident. \u201cMy race chose to eradicate emotion for a reason. Those with emotions are weak. We\u2019re not. It\u2019s why the Psy rule this planet.\u201d With that, she gave a curt nod and left.</p><p>Tamsyn stared after her, the words circling around and around in her head. Those with emotions are weak. She saw the reflection of her drawn, listless face in the terminal and found herself agreeing. For a frozen heartbeat, she wished she were like that Psy woman. Cool, controlled, focused. No attachments, no hopes, no dreams.</p><p>And no Nathan.</p><p>Her eyes, which had started to close, snapped open. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered fiercely. She would not, could not, live in a world where Nathan didn\u2019t exist. He might make her cry as much as he made her laugh, but she couldn\u2019t imagine waking up one day and having emptiness where he was.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know much about how and why the Psy race had stopped feeling, but it had to have been a terrible thing that had driven them down this path. Her healer\u2019s soul ached for them\u2014for the love they would never touch, but she knew she couldn\u2019t help them. Not when they barricaded themselves in their high-rises, their minds shut to the possibility of hope.</p><p>It\u2019s why the Psy rule this planet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tamsyn shook her head. The stranger was wrong. The Psy might rule, but their world was limited to towers of steel and glass. They knew nothing of the joy of running under a full moon and listening to the music played by the wind, of feeling the sensation of a packmate\u2019s fur against human skin, of the sheer life that existed in the forests that were her world.</p><p>But the woman had been right about one thing\u2014how could you miss something you had never experienced? Nathan had never been hers. Their beasts might cry out for each other, but if the human half of Nathan chose to repudiate that bond, who was she to stop him?</p><p>SHE LEFT THE NEXT DAY. THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY. IF SHE remained within reach, Nathan\u2019s beast would eventually push him over the edge. And she couldn\u2019t bear to lie with him knowing their intimacy was nothing more than the result of a physical compulsion. It would be a glimpse into her own personal vision of hell.</p><p>Her friend, Finn, was more than happy to fly in on short notice.</p> <p>\u201cThe healer in our pack\u2019s not even forty, so I\u2019m not going to get to do anything serious for a while,\u201d he told her when she met him at the airport and escorted him into their territory. DarkRiver wasn\u2019t known for its friendliness toward unknown males. They couldn\u2019t afford to be, not after the attack by the ShadowWalkers.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked you rather than Maria.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a smile but his eyes were watchful. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the unasked question. \u201cI\u2019m going to introduce you to the alpha. He knows you\u2019re coming, of course, but the hierarchy has to be maintained.\u201d The laws of rank and hierarchy were there for a reason\u2014they balanced the predatory nature of their animal halves with order.</p><p>Finn nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll feel better once he adopts me into DarkRiver. It wouldn\u2019t do for one of your pack to slice me up because they figured me for an intruder.\u201d</p> <p>Since she thought the same, she made sure to take him to Lachlan first thing. Even with that delay, she was ready to be on her way out of DarkRiver territory by late afternoon. \u201cTake care of my people, Finn.\u201d</p><p>The twenty-one-year-old healer didn\u2019t bother to conceal his worry this time. \u201cWhat about you, Tam? Who\u2019s looking after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She tightened her hands around the straps of her bag. \u201cIt might be permanent, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stroked his hand over her hair, offering comfort in the changeling way. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be. You were born to be DarkRiver\u2019s healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can work with another leopard pack.\u201d But Nathan couldn\u2019t be replaced. Not when it was clear that Lachlan was preparing Lucas to step into his role as alpha sooner rather than later. When the time came, Lucas would need to rely on Nate\u2019s experience and rock-solid advice. \u201cTry it here,\u201d she made herself say. \u201cIf everything works out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rush.\u201d Finn\u2019s tone was gentle. \u201cI\u2019ll hold your place until you come to your senses. Then I\u2019ll happily return to the civilized world of our territory instead of this jungle.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at his joking, but as she walked away, she had the sick feeling she might never return. When she neared the fir she\u2019d strung with Christmas decorations and lights, her eyes stung. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Shayla,\u201d she whispered to the ghost that reproached her for leaving her pack when it still needed her.</p><p>They would be okay, she told herself. She\u2019d started them on the road to healing. All they had to do was follow it. Tempting as it was to pass by quickly, she made herself look up. There was the ornament Vaughn had painted, right next to the one by Cian. Around them wove the string of lights Nate had hung after he\u2019d growled at her for putting her fool neck in danger. And there was the star she\u2019d almost thrown at him, she\u2019d been so mad.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Blinking, she looked away...and kept walking.</p><p>Ten</p><p>NATE RETURNED HOME CLOSE TO DAWN, COMING FROM A night raid to \u201csuggest\u201d Solias King look elsewhere for his development. The damn, encroaching Psy would follow their advice, of that Nate was certain. Even in leopard form, he wanted to grin.</p><p>He\u2019d stood watch for hours as Cian and a couple of others with tech training had methodically taken apart every piece of Psy equipment already onsite. While that might have been enough, Nate had gone a step further and buried several of the most expensive pieces in a section of DarkRiver land that bordered SnowDancer territory. No Psy would dare venture that close to wolf land. The feral pack had a reputation for ripping out intruders\u2019 throats and using the bleached-out bones as fence posts.</p><p>Just in case Solias King missed their point even after all that, they had also removed the semi permanent survey markers and disabled the rudimentary comm tower erected a few days ago. It was why DarkRiver had allowed the thing to go up in the first place\u2014so they could destroy it, and in a fashion that made it clear they would brook no further trespass on their lands.</p><p>Nate was particularly proud of the crowning touch. Inspired by Tammy, he\u2019d taken along a large Christmas ornament\u2014an old-fashioned picture of the man in red and white\u2014and hung it from the now useless comm tower. Then he\u2019d wrapped a string of blinking multicolored lights around the metal skeleton.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t wait to tell Tammy\u2014she\u2019d bust a gut over it. Taking on the Psy wasn\u2019t usually a laughing matter, as the cold psychic race didn\u2019t hesitate to kill. But from everything they had been able to unearth, it appeared that Solias King\u2019s darker impulses were currently being curbed by his political aspirations. He couldn\u2019t afford to come down hard on the changelings. Any violence and his own Council would turn against him.</p><p>Nate had no illusions that the Psy Council cared about changelings, but they damn well did care about their bottom line. And that would suffer massive depreciation if people thought the Psy were declaring a racial war. The Council would never allow such a panic to start over a small piece of land in the territory of what they considered a minor pack. Nate had a feeling DarkRiver wasn\u2019t going to stay minor long, but until then, they could and would use the Council\u2019s sense of arrogance to their advantage.</p><p>Shifting the second he cleared the doorway to his home, he pulled on a pair of jeans and an old cable-knit sweater. He had to see Tamsyn, no matter the ridiculously early hour. The royal blue sweater had been a gift from her. Maybe it would thaw her mood\u2014she\u2019d been more than a little distant when he\u2019d dropped by this morning.</p><p>But his hopeful frame of mind disappeared the instant he got near her house\u2014the area was blanketed in the scent of an unfamiliar male.</p><p>Unbidden, scenes of the carnage that had taken their last healer from them filled his mind. \u201cTammy!\u201d He pounded on the door. \u201cTammy!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open to reveal a young male. \u201cHel\u2014\u201d His voice cut off as Nate gripped him around the neck and lifted him off the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to her?\u201d He tried to ignore the fact that the male was dressed only in a pair of pajama bottoms, his hair mussed.</p><p>I\u2019m sick of stroking myself to sleep.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t do that to him. The agony he felt at the thought of Tammy, his Tammy, with anyone, much less this runt, was enough to call the beast to the surface. His eyes shifted to cat. He couldn\u2019t hear anything through the pounding roar of blood in his head, was dangerously close to killing.</p><p>The single reason he didn\u2019t do so was that his leopard suddenly started scrambling to find Tammy. He threw aside the other man and strode into the house, preparing himself for what he would find. If she was in bed\u2014Something tore inside him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He could never hurt her.</p><p>But that boy was going to die a slow, cruel death.</p><p>He shoved open the bedroom door...and found the bed made, with no signs of recent occupation.</p><p>\u201cI slept on the couch,\u201d a raspy voice said from the doorway.</p><p>He turned to find the stranger supporting himself against a wall, one hand rubbing at his throat. \u201cDidn\u2019t seem right to sleep in Tam\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>Tam? The leopard growled, harsh and vocal. \u201cWho are you and what are you doing in my mate\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>The other man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMate? She never\u2014\u201d He slapped up his hands, palms out, when Nate started advancing. \u201cI\u2019m a healer. Name\u2019s Finn.\u201d</p><p>That stopped Nate midstep. Healers, even enemy healers, had automatic protection. Only blood-hungry packs like the ShadowWalkers broke that rule. \u201cWe already have a healer.\u201d Claws raked his gut, twisted through his body like hard fire.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to fly in and take over for a while.\u201d Finn coughed a few times. \u201cSaid it might be permanent. Our pack\u2019s got a senior healer and another apprentice, so they were happy to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we already have a healer.\u201d Nate glared.</p><p>Finn didn\u2019t back down. \u201cNot anymore you don\u2019t. She left.\u201d</p><p>The beast wanted to lash out, to tear and scar. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>The healer held up his hands a second time and Nate wondered what the other man had seen in his eyes. \u201cI swear I don\u2019t know. I figured she\u2019d talked it over with your alpha\u2014maybe a sabbatical or some extra training. She introduced me to him.\u201d</p><p>Nate left on a mission to find Lachlan, but it was Lucas he ran into first. He would have pushed past except that Lucas stepped into his path and said, \u201cLooking for Tammy?\u201d</p><p>Nate stilled. \u201cYou knew she left?\u201d At that moment, the first rays of the rising sun hit the tree line, throwing light across Lucas\u2019s savage facial markings.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Luc. Answer the damn question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The juvenile folded his arms. \u201cI heard her ask Nita to drive her out of the territory.\u201d</p><p>The urge to grab Lucas and shake Tammy\u2019s location out of him was so strong, Nate looked away and took a deep breath before saying, \u201cAnd neither of you tried to stop her from leaving?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would we?\u201d Lucas\u2019s tone was hard. \u201cYou made her cry, Nathan. You made your mate cry and then you didn\u2019t hold her.\u201d</p><p>The blow hit him with bruising force. \u201cWhere is she, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014you could ask Nita, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s around.\u201d He glanced at the sun-touched trees. \u201cI have to get to the Circle for training.\u201d</p> <p>Nate didn\u2019t try to stop him from leaving, and was still standing there when Cian appeared out of the shadows. \u201cNate? You after Lachlan? I just left him\u2014he\u2019s free for the next half hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find Tammy.\u201d</p><p>Cian\u2019s face showed instant comprehension and not a little anger. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing to that girl, Nate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s right for her.\u201d Cian didn\u2019t understand what it was to watch a woman fall out of love with her man, turn bitter and self-destructive...and finally, suicidal. He\u2019d held his mother\u2019s dead body. He refused to hold Tamsyn\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was too young when Shayla died. But did you hear her complain?\u201d The sentinel\u2019s voice was a whip. \u201cSeventeen years old and she took on a position most people don\u2019t touch until they\u2019ve reached their third decade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly!\u201d He blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cAll that responsibility and then a mate, too? I\u2019d demand things she has no conception of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cian swore, low and pithy. \u201cIsn\u2019t that your job as her mate? To demand but to let her demand as much in turn? You\u2019re supposed to fucking share the burden, not add to it like you\u2019ve been doing with your self-pitying bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be my senior,\u201d Nate said, the leopard in his voice, \u201cbut you are not my father.\u201d His father was long dead, having literally driven himself to an early grave after his wife\u2019s death\u2014he\u2019d wrapped his car around a tree. \u201cYou want to take me on, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that.\u201d Cian shrugged. \u201cIf I damaged you, Tammy would have my head.\u201d</p><p>With that simple comment, the other man defused every bit of Nate\u2019s anger. \u201cTell me where she is. I have to make sure she\u2019s safe.\u201d The leopard\u2019s desperation grew by the minute.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Cian shoved up his sleeves. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think you deserve to know, either. And don\u2019t bother asking Nita\u2014she has no idea where Tammy went after getting out of the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, none of you bothered to ask her?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe that, not with how protective they had become after what had happened to Shayla. As this inquisition clearly proved. \u201cYou let her go off on her own without a word of protest?\u201d</p><p>Cian\u2019s eyes turned opaque. \u201cShe\u2019s an adult leopard. No one has the right to question her decisions.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d made one to leave him. Nate leaned against a tree and stared up at the dawn sky. It promised to turn a pure, mocking blue. \u201cWhere did Nita drop her?\u201d She wouldn\u2019t be hard to track\u2014she was carrying his heart with her.</p><p>Cian snorted. \u201cSorry, you\u2019re on your own. You made the mess, you can damn well clean it up. But since you look like you\u2019ve been gut-punched, I will tell you something she said to Lachlan when she made the request to leave and bring Finn in as cover.\u201d</p><p>Nate straightened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you were more important to the pack. Since one of you had to go, she decided it had better be her.\u201d The older male shook his head. \u201cMy Keelie is the most precious part of my life. How could you let your mate think she was less than you, Nate?\u201d</p><p>Nate still hadn\u2019t found an answer to that question seven hours later when he finally located the first hint of a trail. He was certain that this was where she\u2019d left Nita\u2019s car. He looked up and found himself close to Tahoe. Tamsyn had vanished somewhere in the lake city\u2019s streets. Nathan had every intention of hunting her down.</p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE DEN TO PICK up his gear, he found another surprise waiting for him, this time in his living room.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter, Nathan?\u201d was Sadie\u2019s first question.</p><p>He began to grab what he needed. \u201cI\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want you to find her.\u201d Tamsyn\u2019s mother scowled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do a great job of keeping her this time around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? So you can make her miserable?\u201d She moved to block the doorway, fierce in her maternal protectiveness. \u201cLet her roam. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve been telling her to do. Well, looks like she listened. Don\u2019t you dare go after her.\u201d</p><p>The blunt words brought him to a halt. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s exactly what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine to protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave up that right when you decided you didn\u2019t want to be her mate.\u201d Sadie shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough. Let my baby go.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, a sick feeling in his gut. \u201cI never said I didn\u2019t want to be her mate. Where the hell did you get that idea?\u201d And did Tammy think the same?</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cFROM YOU, NATHAN.\u201d SADIE GAVE HIM AN ARCH LOOK AS she shook the foundations of his world. \u201cTammy was practically screaming for your love and you wouldn\u2019t so much as hold her. She got the message\u2014she can\u2019t break the bond, but she might be able to mute it with distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat damn message?\u201d Impatience, anger, and a painful hunger for the scent of his mate combined to roughen his tone. \u201cThe only thing I wanted to give her was a taste of freedom before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it all before.\u201d She lifted a hand. \u201cIf you really mean it, then you\u2019ll put down that pack and go sit down. After all, she\u2019s free now, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d he said between gritted teeth. \u201cI wanted her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted her on your leash\u2014close enough to watch over so you could satisfy your beast.\u201d Sadie\u2019s eyes went pure leopard. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to you that her need was turning into a kind of slow torture. You are not doing that to my baby again! You let her go. Let her find someone who\u2019ll love her for what she is.\u201d</p><p>Violent rage turned to lethal calm. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? She\u2019s my mate . That is not negotiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you won\u2019t let it be. If you set her free, maybe she\u2019ll fall for someone who\u2019ll adore her like she\u2019s meant to be adored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore her!\u201d he yelled in disbelief. \u201cNo one else has that right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Sadie\u2019s features settled into a resolute expression. \u201cThen show her, for goodness\u2019 sake. Otherwise, free her in reality instead of just giving lip service to the idea.\u201d She vacated the doorway.</p><p>Nate walked out without replying, but her words wouldn\u2019t leave his mind, no matter how far he went. Tammy thought he didn\u2019t want to be her mate? How could such an idiotic idea have ever entered her head? The second he saw her, he was going to growl the truth to her until she damn well listened.</p><p>Well...maybe he\u2019d hold her first. He\u2019d made her cry and he hadn\u2019t held her. Lucas was right. That was unforgivable. But Tammy was his mate. She had to forgive him. And she had to come home. He couldn\u2019t exist without her close to him. Those months she had spent in New York had almost killed him, but at least then he\u2019d been able to tell himself that she was still a girl, not a woman.</p><p>But now that he\u2019d felt the lush heat of her, he could no longer kid himself. Tammy had grown up. And she\u2019d left him. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d The leopard snarled, mad as hell.</p><p>Not much later, he reached the point where he\u2019d first picked up her trail\u2014close to Tahoe. From there, he could try to track her by scent or...or he could do the one thing certain to lead him to her. No choice at all, really.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he released the stranglehold of control he\u2019d held over the mating bond since the day she\u2019d turned fifteen and he\u2019d realized what she was to him. It felt like the whiplash unfurling of a coiled spring\u2014a burst of pure power that actually hurt as it boomeranged off his chest, driving him to his knees.</p><p>When his head finally stopped spinning, he felt for the bond and found it stretched out taut and clear, a vibrating cord of need, desire, and belonging. He could feel Tammy deep within his core, as if he had a homing beacon tuned only to her signal. It was perfection. And he wasn\u2019t sure he could ever block it again. But he\u2019d think about that later.</p><p>Right now, he had to survive the intensity of the emotions shooting down the bond. It felt like he could reach out and touch her. She was sweetness and hope, woman and fire, erotic heat and gentle affection. And she was his. Not fucking negotiable.</p><p>IT FELT LIKE GETTING BROADSIDED WITH A BASEBALL BAT.</p><p>Tamsyn staggered under the point-blank surge of pure emotion, sliding down the wall to sit with her back braced against it.</p><p>Nate had opened the bond.</p><p>She rubbed a hand over her chest, then realized the usual persistent ache, the hard knot of dull hurt was simply...gone. In its place was the blazing glory of a fully functioning mating bond. She trembled. Why had he taken that step now\u2014after she\u2019d done what he wanted and put distance between them? Surely he wasn\u2019t trying to track her?</p><p>No, she thought, she wasn\u2019t going to believe in fairy tales anymore. Nate had probably done it by accident. Okay, no. That was stupid. No one who\u2019d been as determined as Nate to block their mating would lose that much control by accident. Her eye fell on the small silver phone sitting on the table by the sofa.</p><p>Her mother had called soon after Tamsyn arrived at the cabin. Sadie had been distraught to return from her run in the wild and find her daughter gone. Tamsyn had assured her over and over that she was fine, but knowing Sadie, she\u2019d probably ordered Nate to locate her daughter and provide a firsthand report. Tamsyn shuddered, trying to breathe past the impact of the fully flowing bond. She had to think, had to stabilize herself before Nathan arrived, so he\u2019d go back and tell Sadie there was no reason to worry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That done, he would think the bond shut again.</p><p>Her blood flushed hot as the vibrant male energy of him raced through her veins. Mates were joined on an incredibly deep level. To other changelings, the scent of one half of a mated pair became difficult to distinguish from the other the longer they were together. Nate\u2019s refusal to accept the bond had denied them that closeness, starving her. Now, her senses wanted to gorge.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said out loud, forcing calm on herself. All healers had to learn such discipline. It allowed them to work in the chaos of a fight or when attempting to heal those they loved\u2014a pack healer didn\u2019t have the luxury of passing on the hard cases to another medic. Every one of their cases was hard, because Pack was family.</p> <p>Finally, after ten long minutes, she could think despite the masculine strength of the emotional connection surging through her. Then, for the first time, she tried to close her end of the exquisite pleasure/pain that was her link to this man she adored beyond life...and discovered she couldn\u2019t. She fisted her hands. Forget the known wisdom that said the bond couldn\u2019t be blocked\u2014if Nate could do it, why couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>It took her an hour to come up with some sort of answer. She remembered what her mother had said\u2014that Nate had had to learn to suppress his needs in order to allow her the time she needed to come of age. That control seemed to have carried over into everything he did in relation to her. But now he\u2019d thrown off the reins and let the cat out to play.</p><p>It might be impossible to put the lid back on that bottle.</p><p>Her eyes widened. Nate was not going to be pleased if that proved true. More importantly, she wasn\u2019t pleased. She didn\u2019t want him to want her because he\u2019d been forced into it by the primal cravings of his beast\u2014cravings her own beast understood far too well. She wanted him to love her.</p><p>It was a terribly impractical dream for a practical, sensible healer.</p> <p>EVEN WITH THE BOND, IT TOOK NATE THREE DAYS TO TRACK Tamsyn to an isolated cottage so far south of the lake, there was nothing else within shouting distance. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing out in the middle of nowhere?\u201d he said, the second she opened the door.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cTrying to get away from you.\u201d Turning her back, she walked into the house, her hips encased in those damn painted-on jeans.</p><p>He was tired, sweaty, and hungry. Not for food. For her. Every soft, curvy, bitable piece of her. His cat wanted to test the resilience of her butt, while his\u2014He slammed the door shut behind himself. \u201cJesus, Tammy. DarkRiver\u2019s operating at red alert while we prepare to take on the ShadowWalkers and you choose this shack to hide in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a shack and I\u2019m not hiding,\u201d she said, sitting back down to what appeared to be her breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s Cian\u2019s place. He likes the water.\u201d</p><p>Cian had lied to him. Not exactly a surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s miles from the lake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that far. He likes privacy, too.\u201d</p> <p>Nate dropped his stuff by the door and shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat, this was some silly little jaunt and no one bothered to tell me?\u201d He saw red.</p><p>Then she raised an eyebrow and that red morphed into something darker, more intense, a blatantly sexual surge of dominance. \u201cI\u2019m leaving DarkRiver. Finn\u2019s agreed to stay on permanently. His agreement was what I was waiting for.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She put down her uneaten toast and stood. \u201cThere, you\u2019ve seen me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Her smile was sharp enough to cut, her eyes sparking with anger that intrigued the leopard even more than the spicy/wild/hot woman scent of her. \u201cYou can leave the same way you came in.\u201d She began to clear the table.</p><p>\u201cPut those dishes down .\u201d</p><p>She ignored him.</p><p>Covering the distance between them, he closed his hand over her wrist. She released the dishes softly to the table but didn\u2019t turn to face him. \u201cWhat do you want, Nate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to talk to me.\u201d He found himself pressing against her. It took only a single move to enclose her in the circle of his arms and bury his face against her neck. He was ravenous for the scent of her, the feel of her. \u201cCome on, baby.\u201d</p> <p>Her body trembled so violently he felt her skin move against his caressing lips. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Her voice was a whisper. \u201cPlease let me go.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>A GROWL ROLLED UP FROM HIS THROAT. \u201cFOR HOW LONG?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the tremor in her voice. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare cry, Tammy. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d But there was a wet kind of pain her words. \u201cI know you don\u2019t really want me. I know it\u2019s the cat pushing for mating. That\u2019s okay. If I go far enough away, maybe you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe his ears. \u201cYou really believe that load of shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made it very clear.\u201d</p><p>Everything went quiet inside him. Lifting his head, he turned her in his arms. Her head stayed down\u2014she wouldn\u2019t look at him. Keeping one arm around her, not sure she wasn\u2019t getting ready to bolt, he used the fingers of his other hand to tip up her chin. Her eyes were shiny-wet, but she met his gaze without flinching.</p><p>God, she was so proud. Proud and strong and stubborn. And she\u2019d decided he didn\u2019t want her. He intended to teach her the error of her ways once and for all. Holding her gaze, he slid his hand down her neck, over her shoulder, and along her arm until he cupped the back of her hand with his. Then he lifted that feminine hand and placed it on his erection. She jerked in shock. The reflexive tightening of her fingers almost made him cry out.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel like I don\u2019t want you?\u201d he grit out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d She paused, her breath hitching. \u201cIt\u2019s a result of the mating dance. You don\u2019t want me, not really.\u201d She pulled away her hand, curling it up to her chest as if it hurt.</p><p>Oh Jesus. She was not doing this to him. \u201cOr is it that you don\u2019t want me ?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cIs that it, Tamsyn? Am I too old for you?\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. \u201cDon\u2019t you put this on me!\u201d The first hint of fire entered her tone. \u201cI begged you, begged you, to make the bond real, to be my mate in truth. But you said no. You always say no! Well, you know what, I\u2019m through with begging. I\u2019m through with not being good enough for you!\u201d</p><p>It felt like she\u2019d stabbed him. \u201cYou are the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d he said, the leopard alive in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve spent every day of the past four years thinking of myself as the luckiest man on the Earth\u2014frustrated as hell, but damn lucky.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>It was all he could do not to crush his lips to hers and kiss her into accepting his words. \u201cI watch you work and feel such pride, sometimes I think my heart will explode. I look at your body and have to fight the urge to bare my teeth and warn off anyone else from doing the same. You want to know why I lost it when you wore those tight, sexy clothes?</p><p>\u201cIt was because others could see what was mine .\u201d It was a possessive, animal reaction, one he usually tempered with human civility. But Tamsyn needed to see the real man, claws and all. \u201cI don\u2019t like to share.\u201d</p><p>Finally a reaction. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I looked stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to peel you out of those damn come-to-bed jeans\u201d\u2014something he was definitely going to do today\u2014\u201cand mount you right there in the Pack Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to show everyone that you were mine. I wanted to put my hands on your breasts and my lips on yours and my co\u2014\u201d</p><p>She squeaked, slapping a hand over his mouth. \u201cNate!\u201d The scandalized expression on her face was very Tamsyn. His mate had come back to him.</p><p>He pulled away the restraint, using his other hand to manacle her free hand, too. \u201cWhere was I? I have wanted you so damn long, my balls are permanently blue. As\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you!\u201d A hint of desperation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any mistakes about this.\u201d And her time was up. The things he wanted to do to her were probably illegal in some countries. Too bad.</p><p>He backed her into a wall with slow deliberation, not stopping until her breasts were crushed warm and tempting against him, her stomach muscles clenching at the granite-hard thrust of his erection. \u201cThe sex\u2014hell, yes, I want the sex. I want it so much I could devour you right this second, take little bites out of all those soft, delicate places.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts rose and fell in a jagged rhythm as she watched him through her lashes.</p><p>\u201cBut baby, I fell in love with you long before the mating heat kicked in this bad. Do you know why I came to wish you happy birthday when you were fifteen?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, mute.</p><p>\u201cBecause I adored everything about you as much then as I do now,\u201d he whispered, giving her words because she needed them, and because he\u2019d made her cry. There was no excuse for that. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t sexual\u2014you were too young. It was just this tightness inside my chest. Every time you smiled, my world lit up. All I wanted to do was keep giving you reasons to smile. The day I realized you were my mate, the happiness almost killed me. So don\u2019t you ever say I don\u2019t love or want you. I chose you, Tamsyn Mahaire. I chose you.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn wanted to burst out crying. \u201cOh, Nate.\u201d She buried her face against his chest and, when he let go of her hands, wrapped her arms around him as he wrapped his around hers. She had never heard him speak in that impassioned, romantic way, never imagined he would. And to her? To his practical, sensible mate?</p><p>\u201cYou are not leaving me,\u201d he ordered, his voice predator deep. \u201cIf you want to go roaming, I\u2019ll take you. But you are not leaving me.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he expected them to go back to the way things were. If so, he was about to get a surprise. Half of the mess that was their relationship had been her fault. She\u2019d let him think he was the boss. Well, he wasn\u2019t. They were a partnership. Breaking the embrace, she pushed off his jacket. He was so surprised, he let her. Then she began undoing his rough wool-blend shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTammy.\u201d He grabbed at her wrist.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Nathan,\u201d she snapped, tearing the shirt down the middle. Buttons went flying every which way. \u201cI\u2019m ready to lose my virginity and you\u2019re going to help me do it. I don\u2019t care if I have to kidnap you and tie you to the bed.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth as if to speak, but then she flattened her palms on his wonderful, hard chest and he shuddered instead. The same head-spinning rush hit her, powered by the skin to skin contact. Skin privileges. She had the most intimate kind.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your freedom?\u201d he whispered in her ear over a minute later, bracing his hands palms down on the wall beside her head. He made no move to stop her as she stroked and petted every inch of that sinfully gorgeous chest, all hard muscle and gleaming skin overlaid with silky-rough strands of dark hair.</p><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d She nipped at his jaw with her teeth. \u201cThe only freedom I ever wanted was the right to love you.\u201d</p><p>One of his hands stroked down to slip under her sweater. It was her turn to tremble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The roughness of his skin felt delicious on her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re set on making this real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and it was beautiful and strong and quintessentially male. \u201cWhat, and give up the chance to finally see your pretty breasts? Not a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan!\u201d And then his hand was squeezing her sensitive flesh and she was drowning in the rush of sensation.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing a bra?\u201d he asked before kissing the wits half out of her.</p><p>By the time she could gasp in enough air to breathe, her sweater was in shreds on the floor. Nate had used his claws to slice it to bits. His hand returned to massage and mold flesh that had never known a man\u2019s touch. She pushed into the caress. \u201cUm...I forgot,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI was nervous about you\u2014Oh!\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d lifted her up so her legs wrapped around his waist. \u201cYou were right to be nervous.\u201d He kissed her again, then ran his lips down her neck to nibble on the tender upper slopes of her breasts.</p><p>She held on to his shoulders, trying hard to find a sensible thought. \u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ve been exercising.\u201d His mouth closed over her nipple.</p><p>It might\u2019ve been hours before she spoke again. \u201cExercising?\u201d Single words seemed to be all her brain could manage.</p><p>He released her sensitive flesh...after gripping it lightly between his teeth for a heart-pounding instant. \u201cBecause you\u2019re going to be indulging in a lot of creative physical activity over the next few days.\u201d</p><p>Had he said days ?</p><p>Then she lost even that thought and simply felt. Nate didn\u2019t ravage her as she\u2019d half expected, given their combined hunger. He was excruciatingly tender and she knew how much that control had to be costing him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said several times.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your first time. I\u2019ll say when it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She might have taken that order badly if he hadn\u2019t already brought her to orgasm twice by then. His tone may have been rough, but his hands were gentle and his mouth was pure magic. When he did finally decide she\u2019d been pleasured enough, he took her with care that brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>The second time, she took him.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>SOLIAS KING DID NOT LIKE TO LOSE. \u201cHOW MUCH DAMAGE?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kinshasa repeated the number. \u201cThe missing parts will take weeks to reacquire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said they were a minor pack?\u201d He pinned his aide to the spot with his eyes. \u201cYour risk analysis was faulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy variables were based on the known parameters of changeling intellect.\u201d</p><p>Solias couldn\u2019t fault Kinshasa. The general consensus among the Psy was that the animals weren\u2019t that smart. \u201cFind me another site.\u201d</p><p>As Kinshasa left the suite, Solias wondered which one of his enemies had orchestrated the attack\u2014covert Psy involvement had to be how the changelings had pulled this off. It was preposterous to think he\u2019d been beaten by a pack of animals.</p><p>Arrogant in his belief of the Psy race\u2019s genetic and intellectual superiority, he never once considered that he might be blind to the truth. The truth that things were changing...that the Psy no longer ruled every corner of the planet. And that this minor pack had shown the first signs of the lethal danger it would one day become.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>A WEEK LATER, NATE WATCHED TAMSYN BANDAGE UP A JUVENILE\u2019S arm and give the kid a stern warning about rock climbing without gear. She was firm and practical, her hands strong, her body tall. And she had breasts to make a man\u2019s mouth water, sweet feminine curves his palms itched to shape.</p><p>Then she looked up and smiled and he felt it deep, deep in his core. He wanted to pick her up and kiss her silly, but since the juvenile\u2019s eyes were already going wide, he decided to make himself scarce. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight. I have to make that run into San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Another smile. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to pick up the things I asked for.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and left, recalling the list he\u2019d shoved into his pocket. Tammy wanted a few healing supplies, a number of grocery items, and some paint to complete the Christmas decorations. He had the list in hand when he reached the city. It was easy to fill, as she\u2019d included instructions about where to go and had called her suppliers ahead of time to let them know he was coming by.</p><p>\u201cFor Tammy?\u201d a wizened old man asked as soon as Nate stepped into his tiny store in one of the older parts of Chinatown.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His beast picked up a thousand intermingled traces\u2014herbs and spices, medicines and incense, but the mix was strangely soothing. \u201cI\u2019m her mate, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s smile was fond as he bent under the counter and lifted up a box. \u201cShe\u2019s a good soul, Tammy. You will protect her, love her. That is your destiny.\u201d</p><p>Nate looked at the shopkeeper, startled. \u201cDo you see the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The man laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not Psy. Only human.\u201d</p><p>Only human, and yet there was such ageless wisdom in those dark button eyes. Nate wondered if the Psy, for all their gifts, would ever be able to achieve that look of utter peace. \u201cYou\u2019re right. About the loving and the protecting.\u201d</p><p>Wrinkled hands picked up a leather-bound book and consulted something written in a strange, unknown language. \u201cThe stars say you\u2019ll have a long and happy life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d Nate grinned.</p><p>A hint of mischief entered the old man\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe women, they don\u2019t know what they do to us. It is our secret.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Nate exited the shop with Tammy\u2019s things and began to walk back to the vehicle. He was putting the box into the trunk when he realized he\u2019d parked in front of a florist\u2019s, though he didn\u2019t recall seeing it the first time around. Shrugging, he closed the trunk and wandered over to the shop, Tammy on his mind.</p><p>There was no stock displayed outside, probably because of the cold, so he pushed open the door. Hothouse air greeted him. The interior was a jungle of flowers, the air thick with their competing perfumes. \u201cSome shop,\u201d he muttered, trying to separate out the mingled scents.</p><p>\u201cI do try,\u201d said a gentle voice.</p><p>He turned to find a tiny Chinese woman beside him, her smile beatific. There was a twinkle in her eye that reminded him of someone. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know the healer down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, that seemed right. \u201cOh.\u201d He shifted his feet, slightly uncomfortable in a place that was so intrinsically female. \u201cI want to buy flowers for my mate.\u201d</p><p>The woman slid her small hands into the front pockets of her apron. \u201cDoes she like roses? I just received a new batch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a healer, too,\u201d he found himself saying, never having thought to ask Tammy if she liked roses.</p><p>\u201cAh, a sensible woman.\u201d The florist waved him to follow as she weaved through the wild tangle of her shop. \u201cHere.\u201d She pointed to a sturdy green potted plant with a few white flowers. \u201cThis will last for years with a little water. Doesn\u2019t need much care or attention. Practical. It will suit your healer.\u201d</p><p>Nathan scowled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and moved to another area of the shop, to point at a bunch of daisies. \u201cSunny, easy to enjoy, but there will be no sadness when they fade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d All of him\u2014man and leopard\u2014was getting angry and he couldn\u2019t understand why. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want.\u201d</p><p>Unperturbed, the florist took him around another corner in this shop that was far larger than it appeared from the outside. \u201cAh, I think this must be what you are searching for.\u201d She touched the edges of a rough bouquet. \u201cThese flowers will survive no matter what. Very cheap,\u201d she said with a shopkeeper\u2019s smile. \u201cCommon, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The leopard\u2019s claws pricked the insides of his skin, a growl building in his throat. \u201cShow me something beautiful, something extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d The woman seemed to think for a while before nodding. She took him to the back of the shop, to a small glass case tucked away under special lights. \u201cI have these. They aren\u2019t very strong and, as you can see, require much care. But if you love them right, they will reward you with great beauty. They\u2019re precious and rare, not easy to find or replace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d man and beast said together, fascinated by the delicacy of the blooms he could see beyond the glass. \u201cGive them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a healer?\u201d The florist raised a skeptical eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a healer to me. She\u2019s my lover, my mate.\u201d Unlike these hothouse flowers, she was strong. But just like these rare blooms, she was both irreplaceable and beautiful enough to break his heart. \u201cShe\u2019s mine to cherish.\u201d</p><p>This time, the florist\u2019s smile was pure brightness. \u201cIt is as it should be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TAMSYN HAD COOKED THE MEAL, SET THE TABLE, AND shimmied into a pretty knee-length dress. She bit her lip and looked in the mirror. The dress was an autumn red-orange that brought out the copper strands in her unbound hair. Shaping her body to the waist, it then flared out in a playful swirl. She\u2019d paired it with heels and a fine gold bracelet.</p><p>\u201cI look okay,\u201d she told herself, knowing Nate probably wouldn\u2019t even notice. It wasn\u2019t as if the dress changed who she was. But it made her feel good.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she went into the front room, ready to fluff the cushions for the tenth time. She delighted in living with Nate and wanted to make a good home for him, but had to admit she might be going a bit overboard. The man loved her. He couldn\u2019t care less if the pillows were skewed or dinner was late.</p> <p>She smelled Nathan\u2019s wild masculine scent before he knocked. Her heart tripped a beat. Thinking he must have his hands full, she pulled the door open. \u201cNathan, what\u2014\u201d Her eyes dropped to the flowers in his arms. They were a sumptuous cream color, with gold streaks that shimmered with an almost otherworldly iridescence.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like these,\u201d he said, the cat in his voice.</p><p>She touched a hesitant finger to one perfect petal. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re for you.\u201d It was more growl than anything close to human. \u201cDo you think I go around giving other women flowers?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she looked up into the velvet blue of his eyes. \u201cYou think I\u2019m an orchid kind of girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell yes.\u201d He put them into her arms and wiped away the tear she hadn\u2019t been aware of shedding. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, staring at those precious flowers. Orchids. Nathan had given her orchids. Rare and precious and beautiful...the kind of flowers a man gave to a girl who was all those things. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later,\u201d he murmured against her ear. \u201cWhen I peel this sexy dress off you.\u201d He was behind her now, his hands caressing her hips as he pulled her back against his body. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll leave the dress on and only take off the underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me blush.\u201d It was a playful rejoinder\u2014she loved his earthy sensuality.</p><p>\u201cA dress gives a man ideas.\u201d He nibbled at her earlobe.</p><p>Her smile turned into a full-fledged grin as her heart filled with so much love she thought it would burst. \u201cWhat if I took off everything but the heels?\u201d</p> <p>He groaned. \u201cPut the damn orchids in water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need tender care,\u201d she murmured, touching another petal.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He kissed the curve of her neck. \u201cBut I want to take care of you. Let me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. No one had ever offered to take care of her. She was the pack healer\u2014she took care of everyone else. But Nate thought she was an orchid kind of girl. She had the wondrous realization that, to him, that was what she\u2019d always been. He saw the woman behind the healer. Another tear streaked down her cheek. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>His arms came around her tight.</p><p>BY THE TIME CHRISTMAS ROLLED AROUND, SOLIAS KING was a dim memory. The Psy had removed all his equipment from their land, leaving behind only the ornament and Christmas lights. Tamsyn had been more than happy to use them on her tree, though the chosen fir had no lack of decorations\u2014every one of her packmates had added a piece or ten, so that by Christmas Day, that tree was truly the pack\u2019s Christmas tree.</p><p>Tamsyn thought Shayla would have been pleased. So many in DarkRiver remained damaged by what had happened, but at least this silly extravagant tree had brought some joy back into their lives. They held the Christmas party under its snow-dusted branches and it was there that Lachlan formally acknowledged her and Nate\u2019s mating.</p><p>\u201cFor me, our anniversary will always be the day you gave me orchids,\u201d she said to Nathan as they danced under sparkling tinsel.</p> <p>He slid his hands down to her lower back. \u201cI vote for the cabin in Tahoe.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhat are we going to tell our children when they ask about our mating if we pick Tahoe? Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat DarkRiver looks after its own.\u201d Sadie\u2019s, Cian\u2019s, and even Nita\u2019s interference had been born of the ties of Pack, and Nate accepted it. \u201cAnd that their daddy was a stupid idiot, but one who came to his senses in time.\u201d Nate wondered what their cubs would look like. Not that he was going to ask Tammy to have children anytime soon. She was only nineteen...and part of him still wasn\u2019t sure she wouldn\u2019t regret having mated so young. But on this magical Christmas night, he decided to believe in happy endings. \u201cWant a replay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the orchids?\u201d</p><p>It was such an innocent question he almost missed the mischief in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll make you pay for that.\u201d He stroked his hand over her bottom.</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d she whispered with a blush. \u201cThe others will see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d He turned her until her back was to the tree. \u201cI\u2019m just playing with my mate.\u201d</p><p>This time, she cuddled into him, her hands sliding up under his sweater. \u201cI want the replay with cream on top.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWhy do you think I bought those cans of whipped cream?\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, she licked her lips. \u201cMe first.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Eighteen Years Later: Year 2079</p><p>\u201cWHERE\u2019S THE WHIPPED CREAM?\u201d NATE KISSED HIS WAY down the naked line of his mate\u2019s back.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, beautiful enough to steal his breath. \u201cHave you forgotten we have guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can entertain themselves,\u201d he said, referring to the houseful of packmates who\u2019d dropped by for a family dinner.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already been doing that for an hour.\u201d She moaned. \u201cOooh, again.\u201d</p><p>He complied, kissing the dip at the base of her spine. \u201cI suppose I have to go play host.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He bit the curve of her buttock. \u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me, Tamsyn Ryder. I know all your secrets.\u201d And after eighteen years together, he knew she was his, body and soul. It had taken him almost two years to really believe that truth\u2014but when she\u2019d only gotten happier and happier as time passed, it had become impossible not to.</p><p>She nuzzled at his neck. \u201cStop seducing me. I need to go finish making dinner.\u201d</p><p>Rising halfway, he found his gaze caught by a golden envelope on the bureau. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCard from Nita,\u201d she said, referring to the former packmate who\u2019d mated with an outside-Pack male not long after his and Tamsyn\u2019s mating. \u201cHer cubs are growing up so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are ours.\u201d He stroked his hand over the curve where her waist flared into her hip. \u201cGod, I\u2019ll have to teach them about women soon.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd what do you know about women?\u201d</p><p>His reply was a kiss that stole her breath.</p><p>THE HOUSE WAS STRANGELY QUIET WHEN THEY WENT DOWN. Tamsyn soon found out why. Lucas and Vaughn were outside playing ball. They\u2019d roped in their own mates and a couple of other sentinels, as well as the kids and several older juveniles.</p><p>\u201cSee, I told you they\u2019d take care of themselves.\u201d Nate kissed the pulse in her neck as they stood on the back doorstep.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMore like the women decided we needed privacy.\u201d They had been in the kitchen with her when Nate had walked in with the orchids. He did that every year, and every year, she turned to putty in his arms. It was hard not to melt for a man who still saw her as an orchid kind of girl after all these years together.</p><p>Her mate\u2019s teasing reply was lost in the gleeful cries of their cubs as they spotted their parents. Nate walked out and intercepted the pair, scooping them up and hanging them over his shoulders. In spite of Nate\u2019s worries, Roman and Julian were still babies, not even three years old. \u201cMommy! Help!\u201d they cried now, between giggles.</p><p>Nate threw her a grin and something went hot and tight in her stomach. God, she loved him. Walking over, she tilted her head to peer at her babies. That knot in her stomach grew tighter. \u201cI think you look good in that position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she freed a wriggling Roman. He peppered her face with kisses before asking to be put down so he could rejoin the game. Julian was playing with his daddy, but waited to give his mom a kiss before chasing off after his twin. \u201cThey\u2019re so tiny,\u201d she whispered, standing in the curve of Nate\u2019s arm. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy little pistons,\u201d Nate said proudly, watching as Vaughn threw Roman a soft pass. Instead of running, Roman threw a sneaky pass to his twin, who shot off down the field. \u201cSee that\u2014a few more years and they\u2019ll be pummeling everyone else on the field. So, what about the Christmas tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove out there yesterday.\u201d A living Christmas tree had become a tradition, a happy memory that had survived the turmoil of the bleak years after the ShadowWalkers\u2019 attack. \u201cOur tree is still going strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like the pack,\u201d Nate said, echoing her thoughts.</p><p>She wrapped her arm around his waist. \u201cJust like us.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, a tenderness in his gaze that would have surprised those who saw him only as the most experienced of DarkRiver\u2019s dangerous sentinels. \u201cAs if I\u2019d ever let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet talker.\u201d She leaned up and kissed him, thinking that her mate was simply getting sexier with age. He now had the darkly sensual beauty of a leopard in the prime of his life, pure hard muscle and a finely honed sexuality that demanded everything she had. She found him irresistible. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He nibbled at her lower lip and there was smug male pride in his eyes as he said, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. It had taken her years to get him to that point, where he believed she truly was happy with their life. Never once had she regretted mating at nineteen. She\u2019d been one of the lucky ones\u2014she\u2019d found her mate early. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>And then he whispered, \u201cAlways,\u201d and she fell in love with him all over again. </p>  </body></html>"]
