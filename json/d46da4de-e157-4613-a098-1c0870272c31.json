George Turner, a man with a curious mix of races running through his blood, was playing the piano. Milly Taylor, a soprano who survived by prostitution in this godforsaken hellhole, was singing about being in a gilded cage. The desert dust, which never seemed to really settle, joined with the miasma of smoke, and it was only the fact that the fiery red ball of the sun was finally settling that made it bearable to sit at the poker table.</p><p>John Wolf was holding a flush, aces high. He leaned back easily in his chair. There was a fair amount of money on the table, but if he appeared casual, it wasn\u2019t just his customary stoicism that made him so.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t give a damn about the money at stake. He\u2019d just returned from a trip that could change the lives of everyone around him. Now he was waiting for Mariah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see your dollar, breed,\u201d Mark Davison said.</p><p>John didn\u2019t bat an eye. He knew Davison was trying to rile him with the remark. The man should have known better. If there was anything John had learned from being raised between two worlds in this lawless sandpit, it was to control any outward display of emotion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll raise you two,\u201d Davison continued.</p><p>Davison was an ass, a would-be gunslinger.</p> <p>He\u2019d come from the East, with family money and an attitude. Whether he won or lost, he tipped the bartenders and the girls, so that, at least, was good. But he\u2019d taken up with Frank Varny and his crowd, and that was bad.</p><p>\u201cTwo bucks,\u201d Davison repeated. There was color in his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cTwo bucks,\u201d John said, smoothly sliding the sum onto the pile.</p><p>He could tell by Davison\u2019s expression that the other man had expected him to fold.</p><p>\u201cThis is a friendly poker game, fellows,\u201d Grant Percy, the so-called sheriff said, fidgeting uneasily in his seat and folding his cards. He might wear a badge, but the truth was, Frank Varny owned the town.</p><p>He had muscled his way in, and he had kept his power in the usual way: by intimidation. You joined him\u2014or you went out into the desert with your mule and pickax, and only the mule and pickax came back.</p> <p>But today, John Wolf knew, things were going to change. Mariah would come, and whatever happened to him after that wouldn\u2019t matter. She was the one good, honest human being he\u2019d come across in his life, and he was going to give her the information she needed to ensure that the people here\u2014not just the tribe but all the people in this town who\u2019d suffered for too long under Varny\u2019s corrupt rule\u2014found life worth living again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out, so lay down your cards,\u201d Ringo Murphy, the fourth and last man at the table, said. Murphy was a wild card himself. He\u2019d been an opinionated rancher down in Missouri, so the story went. Just a kid when his world had gone to hell. He\u2019d become a sharpshooter during the War Between the States, and now that it was over, he was chasing a dream of wealth and comfort. He was gaunt but well toned, a fellow with a devil-may-care attitude, and he wasn\u2019t quick to bend to any man\u2019s brutal tactics. He leaned back in his chair with his guns visible, nestled into the shoulder holsters he wore. Names were etched on the barrels: Lola and Lilly. \u201cCome on, Davison,\u201d Ringo said impatiently. \u201cI\u2019d like to get back into this game.\u201d</p><p>Davison was a lean man, as skinny as a string bean\u2014letting his muscle come from the two Colts he wore holstered on his hips.</p><p>John was armed himself. Always. He, too, carried Colts. Six-shooters, each one double-barreled, providing him with an extra shot per gun. He also carried two knives, sheathed at his ankles. It wasn\u2019t out of meanness. Out here, it meant survival.</p><p>\u201cCall,\u201d Davison said gruffly. John laid his cards on the table.</p><p>That was when the swinging doors to the saloon burst open. The sun was setting, painting the sky a deep red hue. Against it, a man was silhouetted in the doorway.</p><p>Frank Varny had come, just as John had known he would. But the timing was bad; Varny shouldn\u2019t have made it in from his \u201coffice\u201d in the hills until nightfall.</p><p>\u201cWolf!\u201d he said, the single word sounding like a roar.</p> <p>John didn\u2019t twitch. He cursed silently and didn\u2019t acknowledge the newcomer. He\u2019d had it all planned down to a crossed T, but someone had betrayed him. Varny shouldn\u2019t have known he was back. Not until Mariah had come.</p><p>The smoke in the air began to dissipate as most of the crowd scattered hurriedly, like dry leaves caught in a high wind, heading out the backdoor.</p><p>Even the bartender disappeared. Milly Taylor croaked out one last note, then froze, as her accompanist scrambled up the stairs.</p><p>Only John paid no attention to the other man\u2019s arrival.</p><p>Frank Varny didn\u2019t like being ignored. He strode across the room, so accustomed to being a law unto himself that he didn\u2019t see the flicker of annoyance in Ringo Murphy\u2019s black eyes.</p><p>Davison looked up nervously, though, barely noticing anything as he set his cards down by reflex alone.</p><p>John had won. \u201cMy flush beats your straight,\u201d he said, and scooped in the gold dollars piled on the table.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now the rest of us can get back into the game,\u201d Ringo Murphy muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe game is over,\u201d Frank Varny announced. By then, four of his henchmen had followed him into the saloon. They were all resting their hands on the guns holstered at their hips.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d John told Grant Percy.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Sheriff Percy said, licking his lips nervously. \u201cSeems like Mr. Varny needs to have a word with you first, John Wolf.\u201d</p><p>John looked toward the swinging doors and saw a tumbleweed dance by in the breeze that had suddenly lifted. He looked upward, not at Varny, but at the red sky that was darkening to crimson, deep as a dead man\u2019s blood. From the corner of his eye, he judged where Varny\u2019s men were standing.</p><p>Varny planted a fist on the table, leaning down. \u201cYou found the vein, didn\u2019t you? Well, it\u2019s my land. And it\u2019s my gold.\u201d</p><p>John stared back at him and smiled slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s Paiute land,\u201d he said calmly. He drew the cards toward himself and started to shuffle. \u201cI brought a claim into Carson City, and I took ownership, on behalf of the tribe, of the land that once belonged to the Paiute nation, before you white men came and took it all away. Up in those offices in Carson City, they\u2019re not afraid of you, Varny. They believe in something called the law. So now the claim is on Paiute land, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Ringo Murphy let out a snort and stared from one man to the other. \u201cWhat the hell? Are we playing cards here or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth,\u201d Varny said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing business here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my sight, Varny,\u201d John said. \u201cI told you, that gold is mine.\u201d</p><p>It was amazing, John thought, that Varny didn\u2019t die of apoplexy on the spot. He looked as if he was about to explode. \u201cThat\u2019s my gold, and you\u2019re going to tell me where to find it, you red bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone going to deal?\u201d Murphy demanded. \u201cI would like to win my money back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get right back to it,\u201d John said to Murphy. He turned back to Varny. \u201cActually, I\u2019m only half-red. My mother was white. She was working in this very saloon when she was captured, and she soon realized she had a better life as a Paiute captive than a white barmaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarmaid? Whore, more like,\u201d Varny spat out.</p><p>John looked evenly into the other man\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhatever she might have done in life to survive, she was a far better person than you. Hell, Varny, you murdering scum. That makes her pretty damn fine in comparison, no matter what the hell she did.\u201d</p><p>Varny drew his gun, and his men drew theirs. Left with no choice, John Wolf rose, kicking the table over and using it for cover, as he drew, himself. He noticed Murphy drawing his own gun, evening the odds at least slightly.</p><p>As the shots began to explode and ricochet, the sheriff and Davison dived for cover, and Milly Taylor ducked behind the piano and screamed.</p><p>To John Wolf, the world seemed to slow down, letting him see every little detail of what was happening.</p><p>Murphy was good. Faster than lightning, even in John\u2019s slowed-down view. As the sheriff threw himself under a nearby table for protection, Murphy held his ground, both guns blazing. John heard the sickening thuds as first one bullet struck home, then the other, as Murphy took out two of Varny\u2019s men, saving John\u2019s hide.</p><p>John Wolf took that in even as his own guns blazed against Varny\u2019s other two thugs.</p><p>Another thud, and a spray of brilliant color as one man was struck in the heart. A moment later, the other took a bullet in the lung. Blood streamed across the floor, matching the sunset.</p><p>Varny\u2019s men were dead, all four of them, but Ringo Murphy been hit himself. He looked at John before he died. \u201cSorry, partner,\u201d he said, and fell. Hiding under a table hadn\u2019t helped the sheriff; he was sprawled out under it now, his eyes glazed in death. It hadn\u2019t saved the skinny fool from the East, either. Davison was bleeding out on top of the sheriff; his jugular had been hit, his geysering blood turning into a deep, dark river as it mingled with the dirt on the floor.</p><p>Milly Taylor wasn\u2019t dead, though. She had wilted against the piano and was sobbing. The wall was blown out behind her. Varny had been hit in the right arm, but he was still standing.</p><p>Now it was just the two of them.</p><p>They stood in the midst of the carnage and stared at one another.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky son of a bitch,\u201d Varny said. \u201cYour buddy there took down Riley and Austin. Without him, you\u2019d be dead. You couldn\u2019t have shot all four of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world is full of what might have happened,\u201d John said softly.</p><p>Varny grinned slowly. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, you know. Thing is, why the hell are you holding out? Give me the gold and I\u2019ll let you live. Are you going to give me some cock and bull about your father\u2019s people? You said that it was your land now. So which is it? Misplaced heroics or personal greed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John shrugged. \u201cMisplaced heroics? Those who came here first, my father\u2019s people, they need it. They\u2019ll share. And you, you already have more than any man needs in a lifetime. You know, there\u2019s a rumor out there that you have Indian blood, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. The Indian nations don\u2019t need your kind.\u201d</p> <p>Varny knew how to hold his temper, and he grinned, even if there was a tic at the vein in his throat. \u201cWhat about your white half, boy?\u201d</p><p>John hiked a brow slowly. Boy? \u201cWell, Pops, my mother is dead. And what folks she had, I never knew about. But this isn\u2019t about red or white. It\u2019s about greed. Yours. You\u2019ve managed to cause a hell of a lot of trouble since the Paiute War, kidnapping women from the villages, discarding them like garbage. And when their husbands, fathers and brothers have come after you, you\u2019ve managed to shoot them down or get them hanged. All you\u2019ve wanted for as long as I\u2019ve known about you is gold. Paiute gold. And you\u2019re not going to get it. This land\u2014and any gold that\u2019s on it\u2014is the tribe\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p>Varny\u2019s eyes filled with rage, but he kept his distance. John couldn\u2019t be sure, but he thought Varny might be out of ammunition. It had been hard to count when a half-dozen guns were blazing, but if Varny carried the old army Colts he always had, he was most probably out of bullets.</p><p>Then Varny smiled coldly. \u201cI\u2019ve got something you want as much as I want that gold.\u201d</p><p>John didn\u2019t allow any sign of wariness to show on his features. He waited. What the hell did he have to lose at this point? Things hadn\u2019t gone the way he\u2019d expected, but now it was down to Varny and himself. He might die, but he would take Varny down with him if he did.</p> <p>\u201cDid you think I\u2019d play all my cards so quickly?\u201d Varny asked. He never looked away from John. \u201cTobias! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>Tobias was a big man, like some corn-fed Nebraskan. He didn\u2019t look happy as he came in, straw-colored hair flying, denims held up by suspenders.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t give John pause. What caused his heart to skip a beat was the fact that Tobias was dragging a terrified captive.</p><p>Mariah.</p><p>She was in deerskin and moccasins, her hair braided, as befitted a Paiute maiden. But her eyes were bluer than a clear sky at noon, and her skin was as pale as porcelain. She was one of those rare creatures who found happiness and harmony wherever she went; she adored her Indian stepsiblings as much as she had loved her white father, before he died and the Paiute took her in. She was a voice of sanity and peace, and Varny must have grabbed her as she had hurried here to meet him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill her,\u201d Varny said flatly. There was no emotion in the man\u2019s voice at all. \u201cI\u2019d have fun with her first, except she\u2019s such a timid little mouse, and that\u2019s no fun at all. But who knows? I might give it a try. I actually prefer my women wild and wicked, like Milly over there, but I\u2019m willing to put up with a lot for that deed and that vein of gold. Then again, there\u2019s nothing like blowing off someone\u2019s kneecap. That would hurt like hell, and I\u2019m betting it would get you to talk.\u201d</p> <p>The first thought that occurred to John was that he would do anything, anything at all, to save Mariah\u2019s life. He would give up all the gold in the universe, salvation for the world, just to see her free. He should drop his weapons and give Varny everything he wanted.</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t help. Varny was going to kill them both, possibly torture them both, no matter what he said to the contrary, once he had the gold.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Varny pressed.</p><p>It was amazing, John thought, that Varny hadn\u2019t realized the truth about the gold.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give him anything!\u201d Mariah cried, fighting the hold Varny\u2019s lackey had upon her. \u201cDon\u2019t give him anything at all.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed with her fury and her hatred, which only seemed to amuse Varny\u2014and appeal to him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the lady isn\u2019t so boring after all,\u201d he mused.</p><p>With only split seconds before the choice was no longer his, John weighed his options. And they were few. No aid was coming. Ringo Murphy was dead on the ground, and he was the only fool who would have dared to help.</p> <p>How good was he? John asked himself. He could take down Varny, but could he do that and save Mariah? Maybe. If he tried negotiation, if he stalled, if Varny was the first to draw...</p><p>No help, no hope.</p><p>He drew.</p><p>He fired like lightning; both guns blazing. One bullet for Tobias, one for Varny.</p><p>But Varny was fast, too.</p><p>John\u2019s bullets struck both men, but Varny hit John in the chest, dead center, as well. Oddly, he didn\u2019t feel pain. Just the punch of the bullet, and then...cold.</p><p>Cold like ice.</p><p>They always said this kind of death was instantaneous.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. He was aware of far too much as he died.</p><p>He saw Mariah\u2019s face, her mouth the O of a silent scream, as he fell. He tried to say what he needed to tell her, but didn\u2019t know if his lips moved, didn\u2019t know if he made any sound. He wasn\u2019t sure it mattered.</p><p>At least she was free. She would live. He tried again to tell her the things she needed to know, but he couldn\u2019t tell if she understood him or not.</p><p>But death trapped the final words in his throat, and death came with its white light, then darkness, and after that he was aware of nothing more, not even the ever-present dust as it sifted down and mingled with his blood as his life ebbed away.</p><p>1</p><p>Tension was high around the table, but then, there were thousands of dollars strewn out across the board, represented by colorful plastic chips.</p><p>Because this was Vegas, where men and women could rise like meteors to the top of the world, then plummet to the bottom just as quickly.</p><p>Jessy Sparhawk could feel the pressure, could feel the eyes of the other gamblers on her.</p><p>Some people were playing big money.</p><p>Others\u2014idiots like herself\u2014were taking a desperate, edgy, ridiculous chance, playing to beat the odds. To defy the gods of Vegas, who always proclaimed that the house won.</p><p>Oh, yes, she was an idiot. Why in God\u2019s name had she taken the last of her savings to the craps table? She worked in Vegas, she had grown up out here. She\u2019d seen the down-and-outers. She\u2019d seen the poor, the pathetic, the alcoholics, the junkies, all trying for a big win when they knew the law of averages.</p><p>\u201cTen, baby, roll a hard ten\u201d a man called from the end of the table. He wasn\u2019t one of the down-and-outers. He was a regular all over town. She had seen him over at the Big Easy, and he had a deep Southern accent, but one with a Texas twang. His name was Coot Calhoun. All right, so his real name probably wasn\u2019t Coot, but that was how he was known. Nice man. He\u2019d inherited one of the biggest oil fields in Texas. She liked him. He had a wife named Minnie\u2014though Jessy was doubtful about that name, too\u2014who he genuinely loved, and he tipped well because he was generous, not because he was expecting any favors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Coot, I\u2019m trying,\u201d she assured him, praying for a hard ten not for Coot\u2019s sake but for Tim\u2019s.</p><p>She was here, gambling at the Vegas Sun, because she wasn\u2019t allowed to gamble in the casino where she worked, which usually didn\u2019t bother her, since she wasn\u2019t a gambler. The Sun was owned by a billionaire who had been in the casino trade a long time. Her own Big Easy was owned by Emil Landon. A rich man, yes. A very rich man. But he hadn\u2019t been at the casino game long. Even though she wasn\u2019t a gambler, she knew the games. She\u2019d been a dealer, a hostess, a waitress, a bartender, a singer, a dancer\u2014even an acrobat for a brief period of time. She knew Vegas in and out, backward and forward, and she had learned long, long ago, not to gamble, because the house always won.</p><p>\u201cBaby, baby, baby, bee-you-ti-ful baby, do it. Hard ten,\u201d another man called. He was young. Drunk. Probably had too much money on the board, and definitely had too much alcohol in his system.</p><p>She was aware of so many people watching her. It had been kind of fun at first, but now she felt the tension. Even Darrell Frye, one of the Sun\u2019s pit bosses, was watching her with a measuring stare, as if afraid she was on one of those long rolls that totally outweighed the odds.</p><p>\u201cTen, ten, ten,\u201d a nearby woman repeated fervently. She was haggard looking, thin, and her dress had been stylish twenty years ago, back when she had been pretty. Now her features bore the weight of time, but she offered Jessy a smile, and Jessy smiled back.</p><p>\u201cGet on with it,\u201d someone else insisted. \u201cJust roll.\u201d</p><p>She did. To her horror, the dice bounced off the table.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s all right, just a game,\u201d said a deep, smooth, masculine voice.</p><p>She looked up. The man who had spoken was several people away to her left, and she had noticed him earlier. He was the kind of man it was hard not to notice. He wasn\u2019t typically handsome, and certainly not a pretty boy, but he had what she could only call presence. Tall, with broad shoulders, he managed to be simultaneously casual and elegant, and rugged on top of that.</p><p>She flashed him a smile. He wasn\u2019t drunk; he had been sipping the same drink since she had started watching the table. She was five-ten and wearing heels, but he towered over her by several inches. His eyes were so dark that to call them brown would be an injustice. His hair, too, was almost ebony, and the striking cut of his cheekbones made her think there had to be Native American blood in his background, and maybe not far back. He was simply striking, dressed in a white pin-striped shirt open at the neck, a nicely fitted jacket and black jeans. He hadn\u2019t been risking big money, but he had played as if he knew something about the game, and he\u2019d been playing the same money since she first noticed him. And he seemed to be watching for more than just the roll of the dice.</p><p>He lifted his glass to her and looked over at the dealer as he tossed out two hundred-dollar chips. \u201cHard ten for me and for the roller,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cJessy, just roll, sweetie,\u201d Coot called to her, then turned to the croupier as he picked up two chips himself. \u201cMy money is on the little lady. Throw this on the hard ten, one for me, one for her, please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hundreds went down.</p><p>More chips were thrown down on the hard ten, plenty of them for her, and she knew that she was blushing. \u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured, looking at the man who had started it all. The pressure was really on now. A so-called \u201chard\u201d bet paid really well.</p><p>But there was a lot of money to be lost if she failed.</p> <p>Her handsome benefactor said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s going to be a hard ten. And if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s all right. I never put down what I can\u2019t afford to lose.\u201d</p><p>She wished she could say the same thing. But at this point, she was desperate. If she didn\u2019t come up with the money, she couldn\u2019t pay to keep Timothy in the home. She could see Mr. Hoskins\u2019 face now, as he calmly told her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss Sparhawk, but there\u2019s nothing we can do. I\u2019ve been as patient as I can, but if I don\u2019t have that three thousand dollars by tomorrow morning, you\u2019ll have to find another facility.\u201d</p><p>She hated Hoskins. He was a thin-lipped, nose-in-the-air jerk, but he only ran the Hawthorne Home; he wasn\u2019t the one who spent time with Tim. And Tim loved Jimmy Britin, the orderly, and Liz Freeze, his nurse. And Dr. Joe, who was a wonderful man, who worked at the home in order to be able to afford to donate his time at several local shelters.</p><p>A hard ten. If she rolled a hard ten, two fives, she made not just her own hundred-dollar bet, but...ten times that hundred. Plenty of money to keep Timothy where he needed to be.</p><p>She swallowed hard and rolled the dice.</p> <p>\u201cHard ten, hard ten!\u201d It became a chant.</p><p>She had never seen dice roll for so long on a craps table. A four and a three...and groans went around the table, because a seven meant that she would crap out. But the dice were still rolling....</p><p>A five and a three.</p><p>A five and a two.</p><p>A five and...</p><p>A five. A hard ten.</p> <p>The screaming and shouting was deafening. Hands clapping, high fives all around. She wasn\u2019t sure who picked her up and swung her around, but she didn\u2019t protest that any more than she protested the hugs and backslaps that came her way, or even Coot\u2019s enthusiastic kiss on her cheek. She was simply too stunned.</p><p>The one man who didn\u2019t grab her or go insane was the tall, dark-haired stranger. He just watched her, pleased, and yet somehow grave.</p><p>Jessy couldn\u2019t believe the number of chips coming her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cashing in,\u201d she told the dealer.</p><p>He gave her an odd look. \u201cYou\u2019re still rolling,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIf you leave, these folks will lynch me. Don\u2019t pass the roll. Go until you crap out.\u201d</p><p>She glanced to the side, looking for the dark-haired stranger.</p><p>He was gone; of course. He wasn\u2019t rolling. Still, she missed him. And she had the oddest feeling that things weren\u2019t going to go right, now that he was gone. And she was right, because it wasn\u2019t long until she crapped out. Still, as she collected her chips, which were still worth far more than the three thousand dollars she needed, everyone regaled her as if she were a celebrity. She thanked them, then turned, eager to escape as quickly as possible.</p><p>That was when the huge man plowed into her.</p> <p>Huge. Bodyguard huge. He was bald and built like a wall of solid rock. His eyes were hazel and streaked with red.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Coot yelled indignantly.</p><p>It didn\u2019t stop the man, who hit her so hard that he knocked her flat onto the craps table, then fell on top of her.</p><p>She was pinned, and when she tried to budge his weight, she couldn\u2019t. She started to ask the onlookers for assistance, but her words were cut short by someone\u2019s shrill, hysterical scream.</p><p>And then she felt the blood trickling down on her as she struggled under the man\u2019s weight.</p><p>His dead weight...</p><p>His glazed and frozen eyes stared at her, and then his mouth moved.</p><p>He spoke one word.</p><p>\u201cIndigo.\u201d</p><p>And then his lips stopped moving and something, some light, went out in his eyes.</p><p>She tried to twist out from beneath him, and that was when she saw the knife sticking out of his back, saw the blood, and began to scream herself.</p><p>Dillon Wolf heard the screams just seconds after he had stepped into the special \u201chigh-roller\u201d section of the casino. He spun around, returning at a breakneck speed, and arrived back at the craps table just as casino security descended on it. He saw the beautiful redhead he\u2019d staked earlier, desperately trying to push the weight of the huge man off her, and he saw the man\u2019s face almost as quickly.</p><p>Tanner Green. Hell.</p><p>He\u2019d spent most of the night keeping track of who was coming and going, trying to get a handle on who was frequenting the new casino, and the last damn thing he\u2019d imagined was Green turning up dead. The man was a pro. Had been a pro. Not only that, before rejoining the world, he\u2019d worked as a mercenary; there was no way in hell he should have been taken by surprise by anyone. But a knife in the back? That pretty much screamed surprise.</p><p>The fact that the police would want the body left in situ didn\u2019t prevent him from diving in to help the redhead free herself as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey!\u201d one of the security officers said, hurrying forward, but he ignored the man.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the redhead whispered as he shifted her free of the corpse and she managed to get back on her feet. For a moment, though, her eyes were on his. Huge. A deep, radiant blue, like a cloudless sky. Those eyes had first met his just a few minutes earlier as she rolled the dice. Now he also noticed that she smelled good, not to mention that she felt good against him.</p><p>As soon as he saw that she was steady, he delved into his pocket for his ID, presenting it to the security officer.</p><p>\u201cDillon Wolf, licensed P.I.,\u201d he said. \u201cHave the police been called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe 911 has gone in, they\u2019ll be here momentarily,\u201d the security officer said. Two of the men accompanying him had already begun to form an invisible ring around the craps table; two more were hurrying over to bar the door.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I have to get out of here. I have to get out of here!\u201d a woman cried hysterically.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Dillon said, his voice taking on a deep authoritative pitch. He had long ago learned that people didn\u2019t obey high voices in an emergency; they only became more hysterical.</p><p>The redhead was silent, but he saw that she was shivering. Something in her eyes told him that she knew she was going to be there for a long time, the center of a murder investigation. She was stunning, absolutely stunning, and something about her intrigued him. Las Vegas was full of gorgeous women, of course\u2014show-girls, waitresses, actresses, singers\u2014but she seemed different somehow.</p><p>When he\u2019d first noticed her, those eyes of hers had been...haunted. Not as if she was afraid of losing a dream, certainly not as if she was afraid of simply losing...money, but as if she was terrified of losing something far more precious. As if the roll of the dice could cost her her very soul.</p><p>He gave himself a mental shake. He had other things to think about here. Not only was there a dead man lying on the craps table, but that dead man was Tanner Green.</p><p>A man came striding onto the scene. A big guy with an attitude. Jerry Cheever, Las Vegas homicide. Dillon was pretty sure that Cheever resented him, but Cheever knew the lay of the land. He might despise Dillon on every level, but he\u2019d been told by his bosses that Dillon was to be granted free rein. Cheever liked his paycheck and his position, so he obeyed, but he also liked to take credit for things that went well, and he knew Dillon had a talent for seeing an investigation through, and he wasn\u2019t above taking advantage of that fact.</p><p>Especially because he simply wasn\u2019t the sharpest knife in the drawer.</p><p>\u201cNo one move!\u201d Cheever bellowed. \u201cAnd I mean no one!\u201d</p><p>He took note of the blood seeping into the green felt tabletop and soaking the multicolored chips.</p><p>\u201cWolf,\u201d he said curtly, acknowledging Dillon\u2019s presence. His eyes settled on the redhead as he asked Dillon, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t here. I ran over when I heard the screaming,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Jerry Cheever turned to the redhead.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demanded curtly.</p><p>\u201cI was leaving the table. This man came over and...and fell on me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d Cheever demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Cheever pressed.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely sure,\u201d she said with confidence. She was still trembling slightly. Not surprising, Dillon thought, given that she was wearing the dead man\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked her quietly.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Cheever took in the corpse. \u201cChrist! It\u2019s Tanner Green.\u201d He glared at Dillon again. \u201cAren\u2019t you two working for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dillon said curtly.</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Cheever, the M.E. is here,\u201d a newly arrived police officer informed him.</p><p>\u201cGive him room. No one gets out those doors, do you hear?\u201d Cheever said.</p><p>A murmur arose from the crowd, but Cheever wasn\u2019t disturbed. \u201cGive your payouts, close your tables,\u201d he commanded the casino employees, then turned to his fellow officers. \u201cI want men posted at all the doors. No one leaves here without presenting ID and a valid local address, and not until they\u2019ve been questioned. Are we understood?\u201d</p><p>Another swell of protest emanated from the crowd, but no one moved. Not even the casino employees. \u201cPayouts. Now. I want the tables closed up. I want some order here,\u201d Cheever announced.</p><p>At last things began to happen. The M.E.\u2014it was Doug Tarleton, a decent guy and an expert in his field, Dillon thought\u2014was sliding his gloved hands over the dead man\u2019s face, closing the staring eyes.</p><p>\u201cLord!\u201d Tarleton said, startled. \u201cIt\u2019s Tanner Green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dillon said simply.</p><p>Cheever turned to the redhead. \u201cAnd you are...?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJessy Sparhawk,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cExactly what happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She arched a brow but answered levelly. \u201cI was leaving the table. I don\u2019t know where this man came from. He fell on me and knocked me onto the table. I was trapped under him until he\u2014\u201d she pointed at Dillon \u201c\u2014got me out. And that\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>Cheever\u2019s officers were good, and the floor had quietly filled with them.</p><p>Dillon knew there were men already stationed at the doors, and he knew that the others would soon begin questioning the hundreds of people who had been in the casino. Crime-scene tape was already being stretched around the table.</p><p>Cheever suddenly stared at Jessy Sparhawk again. \u201cThe surveillance cameras will have picked up everything, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you exactly what happened,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAnd I had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Cheever,\u201d Dillon said, taking a step forward, \u201cMiss Sparhawk is a victim here, and undoubtedly pretty damn uncomfortable right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man is uncomfortable,\u201d Cheever said irritably, pointing to Tanner Green.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Tarleton said. \u201cThat man isn\u2019t feeling a thing. He\u2019s dead. Knife wound to the back, short-hilted, long-bladed weapon, which is why no one noticed it\u2014that, and the fact that they were all staring at the tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure on the weapon?\u201d Cheever asked.</p><p>Tarleton cleared his throat and looked daggers at the detective. He wasn\u2019t fond of Cheever. \u201cOh, yeah. I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s still sticking out of his back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t there be a blood trail to show where he was stabbed?\u201d Cheever asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThere might be a few specks somewhere. The knife acted like a cork,\u201d Doug explained patiently. \u201cWhen Tanner fell, the knife was knocked aside and the blood began to gush. That\u2019s why Miss Sparhawk is covered in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring in the crime unit\u2014I want fingerprints ASAP,\u201d Cheever said huffily. He was embarrassed, Dillon knew, that he hadn\u2019t figured out that the knife would have kept the blood from flowing. \u201cAll right, get everyone cleared out of here, and let the crime unit have the area from the door to the table.\u201d He glared at Dillon suspiciously. \u201cYou, too, Wolf. Let the crime-scene team get in here, and let Tarleton do his job.\u201d</p><p>Dillon stuck like glue to Jessy Sparhawk, who didn\u2019t protest when he led her away. He gave his own name, credentials and address to one of the officers, and watched as Jessy did the same. He noted that her address was in Henderson, a suburb just outside the city, and her occupation was entertainer. She was working at the newly opened Big Easy\u2014casino. When a uniformed officer came over to interrogate her, she answered his questions calmly, even though she was still trembling.</p><p>No wonder. She was still bathed in the dead man\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cHey! How long are we going to be kept here?\u201d a florid man in a plaid jacket shouted angrily.</p><p>\u201cUntil the lieutenant says you can go,\u201d one of the officers said.</p><p>Jessy Sparhawk looked at her watch and bit her lower lip.</p> <p>\u201cAre you late for work?\u201d Wolf asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Timothy.... I didn\u2019t expect to be away from him this long,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYour...son?\u201d he asked. She couldn\u2019t possibly have a kid over ten, and she didn\u2019t look like the kind who would leave a child at home alone while she went out and gambled.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cTimothy\u2019s my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>He strode across the room, to where Lieutenant Cheever was bullying a couple of the players who had been by the door when Green had entered. \u201cExcuse me, Lieutenant,\u201d he said politely.</p><p>Cheever stared at him and controlled his hostility. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman who was caught under the corpse, Jessy Sparhawk. She\u2019s miserable. Why not have a heart?\u201d Dillon asked, as if there had never been the least animosity between them. \u201cLet her go home and get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Cheever frowned and pointed at Dillon. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your convenience. But let her go home. I can see that you\u2019ve started releasing people once you\u2019ve questioned them.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Cheever appeared to be almost human. He shook his head in frustration. \u201cI\u2019m trying to prevent an all-out riot here and not let a murderer slip through my fingers,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, Green entered the casino, staggered through the crowd and crashed down dead on top of Ms. Sparhawk,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cIt\u2019s probable that he was stabbed outside the casino. Even a bunch of hard-core gamblers would probably notice someone going after someone else with a knife that big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say. He was a bodyguard for Emil Landon, wasn\u2019t he? Just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bodyguard. Landon is convinced that someone is trying to kill him. I\u2019m supposed to be finding out who. I just took the case, and I wasn\u2019t pals with Tanner Green. I knew him, yes, but that was it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where the hell were you, if you weren\u2019t at the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been playing at the table, but I had just wandered into the high-stakes area over there,\u201d Dillon said, pointing toward the far left.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Cheever said, his eyes narrowing. His tone and his look clearly asked, What were you doing in the high-stakes area?</p><p>\u201cI was checking out what players are in Vegas right now,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cLike I said, I just accepted Emil Landon\u2019s offer. This morning, in fact. Plus, I was nowhere near the front door. And he was stabbed outside. I\u2019d bet ten years that the crime-scene team will find specks of blood somewhere along the way.\u201d</p><p>Cheever stared at him, knowing he was right.</p><p>\u201cThe girl obviously didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d Dillon said flatly. \u201cAnd she takes care of her grandfather. You need to let her get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant?\u201d an officer said, approaching Cheever quickly through the crowd. \u201cThe security tapes are ready.\u201d</p><p>Cheever started to move.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant?\u201d Dillon said, calling him back.</p><p>\u201cAll right, take her home. But you\u2014I want you in my office tomorrow morning, eight o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Dillon assured him. \u201cEmil Landon will want to know everything possible about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he will\u2014when I have something to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll want me to see those tapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like repeating myself, Wolf, so I\u2019ll only say this once. I know you know someone who knows the damn governor, but you\u2019ll still wait until I\u2019ve seen those tapes myself. Tomorrow morning, eight sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dillon said, turning away. More and more people were being released. Some, Dillon thought, would be heading on to other casinos, irritated that a man\u2019s death had ruined their evening. Others were guests at the Sun, and some of them would be heading up to their rooms, shaken by tonight\u2019s events.</p><p>Tanner Green had been no angel. He was known around Vegas. He had a record. And no matter what Cheever did that night, the killer was long gone. Even Cheever himself had to know that. He was just covering his ass, going through the motions.</p><p>Cheever suddenly called his name again. \u201cWolf!\u201d</p><p>Dillon paused and waited.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Eight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Dillon tried not to laugh. Cheever always liked having the last word. It gave him a feeling of control.</p><p>Dillon turned again and made his way back around the closed-off gaming tables. Dr. Tarleton was still standing by the body with a member of the forensics unit, looking for trace evidence. Dillon paused for a moment, waiting. Watching.</p><p>Feeling the room.</p><p>But nothing came to him. He paused for a moment longer, then proceeded to the area where Jessy Sparhawk was waiting. He pulled out his investigator\u2019s license again, in case the officers on crowd control didn\u2019t know him. \u201cMs. Sparhawk has been cleared,\u201d he said quietly to the one standing with his arms crossed over his chest, blocking the exit.</p><p>The man nodded, recognizing Dillon and barely glancing at his ID.</p><p>Dillon took Jessy\u2019s arm and led her out the door. She didn\u2019t protest; she readily hurried along at his side.</p><p>Once out the door\u2014where police cars were as thick now as ants on a hill at the grand entryway\u2014she let out a sigh of relief. \u201cThanks. Thanks so much. A P.I., huh? Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re friends with that lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly friends,\u201d Dillon murmured.</p><p>They kept walking until they reached Las Vegas Boulevard, where another crowd had gathered on the sidewalk, everyone staring at the action and speculating.</p><p>When his cell phone started to ring, he wasn\u2019t surprised. In fact, he was surprised it hadn\u2019t done so earlier.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said to Jessy, then answered the phone. \u201cWolf.\u201d</p><p>Emil Landon\u2019s voice came through clearly, and hard with agitation. \u201cI\u2019ve just heard Tanner Green is dead. Dead. Murdered. Knifed in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was in the casino when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have known, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see you. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a bodyguard on my payroll. And he\u2019s dead. I want to see you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d Dillon repeated steadily.</p><p>\u201cI can fire you, Wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free.\u201d</p><p>Immediately Landon backed down. \u201cJust get here as soon as you can. I told you I was in danger.\u201d</p><p>Dillon closed his phone. Jessy was looking away, courteously pretending she hadn\u2019t been privy to his conversation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You must be busy, and I have to get home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car, then?

She flushed. \u201cI had a business appointment, and I thought I might be stopping somewhere on the way home, so I decided not to drive. I, uh, I don\u2019t drink and drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you drinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, but I might have been. Long story.

He didn\u2019t have the right.</p><p>\u201cYou could be in danger,\u201d he said. What a crock.</p> <p>She smiled, knowing it was a line.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze locked on the crystalline blue of her eyes as he reached into his pocket for his card. \u201cPlease, call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>She smiled without glancing at it. \u201cWolf. Ute?\u201d she asked. \u201cLocal tribe? Distant tribe? Hell, Erie? Cherokee? Apache?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cPaiute,\u201d he informed her, then offered her an awkward grin. \u201cAll right, so...Sparhawk? Ute, Apache, Nez Perce\u2014stage name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLakota Sioux, my great-great-grandfather. I\u2019m a real all-American mix,\u201d she replied, sounding amused. They stared at each other for another moment. Then she awkwardly took a step away. \u201cI really have to go. Thank you again.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cYou knew him?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always sorry if a man is dead. But he wasn\u2019t a close friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cash in your chips, did you? No time, I guess. I forgot about them in the mass confusion.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSo did I. I have them, though. I can cash them tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose chips represent a lot of money. You could be mugged,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cA cabdriver isn\u2019t going to know about my chips,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019m okay, honestly. I\u2019m a big girl. I grew up out here. I carry pepper spray. I\u2019ll be all right. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>He saw a taxi. He wondered about the grandfather she had mentioned. Was he ill and waiting for her?</p><p>Dillon stepped out to the curb and whistled, flagging down the approaching cab. He saw her into it and waved goodbye. There was nothing else to do.</p><p>He frowned, watching the cab as it pulled away. There was a strange shadow next to her, almost as if there was a second person in the seat beside her.</p><p>His muscles knotted with tension. The cab passed under a streetlight, and he could see that there was only one person in the backseat. She was alone.</p><p>So why was he still so uneasy? he wondered as he watched the cab disappear down the street.</p><p>2</p><p>She should have driven herself, but she\u2019d known that she was likely to have a bad time out at the home, and that she might stop to have a few drinks on her way home, try to console herself with a pity party and take a little time figuring out her life.</p><p>The cab seemed very slow.</p><p>She was tense with anxiety by the time the driver pulled up in front of her home in Henderson, and she nearly fell over her own feet in her hurry to get out and reach the house.</p><p>\u201cSandra?\u201d She was calling her friend\u2019s name even as she turned the key in the lock. As the door opened, Sandra heard her and came rushing from the back of the house to meet her at the front door.</p><p>She was a pretty woman in her mid-thirties and had once been a showgirl, but now she wrote novels for young adults, having found a way to mine her own youthful angst for profit. She also had a sixteen-year-old daughter, born when she was very young herself, and Reggie gave her an even greater insight into the teenage mind.</p><p>Sandra Nelson was a good friend. Many people would have shied away from watching Timothy when he was visiting Jessy and she had to go out. Not Sandra. She considered it an easy gig and said all she had to do was listen to Timothy\u2019s stories\u2014and see that he didn\u2019t set the house on fire because he was convinced he needed another log for his grandfather\u2019s sweat-lodge fire.</p><p>Sandra\u2019s alarmed stare brought an apologetic smile to Jessy\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t finish, because just then a loud gasp came from her right, where the family room abutted a courtyard. \u201cMom! Mom! It\u2019s Jessy\u2014she\u2019s on TV! A man was murdered!\u201d</p><p>Sandra stared at Jessy, who grimaced and went running past her to reach the family room, where Reggie was draped over the big comfortable sofa, staring at the television. She gasped again when Jessy walked in.</p><p>Jessy stared at the television. She\u2019d been so focused on getting home that she hadn\u2019t noticed the news cameras out front when she and Dillon Wolf had finally escaped the casino, but there she was. She hadn\u2019t realized that she had actually been hanging on his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou were involved in a murder?\u201d Sandra asked.</p><p>\u201cForget that. Who the hell\u2019s the hottie?\u201d Reggie demanded. Tall and slim, she had her mother\u2019s green, dark-lashed eyes and a perfect heart-shaped face. Despite her beauty and her age, though, she was basically a nice kid, and Jessy was always pleased when she came over to help Sandra with Timothy.</p><p>\u201cMurder?\u201d Sandra repeated.</p><p>At that moment, Timothy emerged from his bedroom. He was wearing jeans and a plaid shirt that was on backward. Despite that, he maintained his dignity as he straightened regally and said, \u201cMurder? Yes, it was murder. They can bury my heart at Wounded Knee for a fact, because the slaughter of the American Indian remains one of the greatest tragedies and injustices of our nation\u2019s history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The Native Americans are taking a just revenge. It\u2019s called bingo, and it\u2019s wonderful. They make money, and no one dies,\u201d Sandra said, placating him gently.</p><p>Jessy walked over to give him a hug, but he only stared at her. His eyes, light blue and misted like fog at the coming of day, were blank at first. Then they registered that she was in front of him. \u201cGranddaughter. You\u2019re home. And you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>She was startled to feel him trembling as he hugged her. She looked over his shoulder, frowning questioningly at Sandra.</p><p>\u201cThis just came on,\u201d Reggie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou were in danger,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cThey told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you so?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe ghost riders. Their ghosts came and told me that I needed to be strong, that you were in danger, and that I need to defend you,\u201d he said earnestly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. Honestly,\u201d Jessy said, really worried now. Ghosts? This was new. \u201cTimothy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss my bed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTim, you have a bed here,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He smiled at her, his eyes misty again. \u201cYes, and I\u2019m grateful. But it\u2019s not my bed. I should be in my own place, where you come to visit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back tomorrow, Timothy. It\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sandra was staring at her, arching a brow. Her silent look said quite clearly, It\u2019s wrong to lie to him. Where can you get that kind of money?</p><p>\u201cCome on, Timothy, let me get you to bed,\u201d Jessy told him, ignoring her friend\u2019s silent admonition.</p><p>His shoulders straightened, and he was entirely lucid. \u201cI can take myself to bed, Jessy girl.\u201d He turned to face Sandra and Reggie. \u201cThank you, ladies, for the lovely dinner, and for listening to an old man tell even older tales. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Reggie hurried over to give him a hug, and Sandra gave him a kiss on the cheek. He turned and headed back to his room. Jessy didn\u2019t want him to see her checking up on him, so she kept an eye on him from where she was and promised herself that she would look in on him later.</p><p>When she turned back to Sandra and Reggie, they were both staring at her, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Sandra demanded.</p><p>\u201cAnd I still want to know who that guy is,\u201d Reggie added.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s...blood all over you,\u201d Sandra said, ignoring her daughter. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I promise, but you\u2019ll have to excuse me,\u201d Jessy said, wiping at the blood, suddenly desperate for a shower.</p><p>She practically ran to her room, where she couldn\u2019t get her clothing off quickly enough. She threw it all straight into the trash basket, knowing she would never wear a single piece of it ever again. She hurried into the shower and turned the water on so hot that it was almost scalding, then rubbed her skin practically raw. She massaged shampoo through her hair over and over, until, finished at last, she threw on her terry robe and hurried back into the family room.</p><p>Reggie and Sandra spun around to stare at her again, and before Sandra could manage a word, Reggie demanded, \u201cTell me now. Who is that guy? Have you been holding out on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never saw him before tonight. His name is Dillon Wolf,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. They said his name on TV,\u201d Reggie said.</p><p>\u201cOh? Did they say my name?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re just the unidentified redhead,\u201d Sandra told her. She looked concerned, and rose from the sofa to bring Jessy a cup of tea.</p><p>Jessy thanked her and took a sip, then choked. It was half brandy.</p><p>\u201cSandra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need it,\u201d Sandra told her.</p><p>\u201cYou might have warned me,\u201d Jessy protested.</p><p>\u201cCould we get back to what happened?\u201d Sandra asked.</p><p>\u201cI was playing craps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sandra broke in, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, I wasn\u2019t betting the house or anything,\u201d she said. Not quite, anyway.</p><p>\u201cAnd was the hottie playing craps, too?\u201d Reggie asked.</p><p>Jessy laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d like being called a hottie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs he here to complain?\u201d Reggie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get off the guy,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cWe know more about him now than Jessy does, I\u2019m willing to bet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, they kept announcing his name on TV, like Reggie said,\u201d Sandra explained. \u201cHe\u2019s a P.I. with a hush-hush government agency of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s working for Emil Landon,\u201d Jessy said, confused. She took another swallow of the brandy-laced tea. Now that she was forewarned, it was delicious.</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s working undercover,\u201d Reggie said, excited. \u201cSo how did you get to know him so quickly? When is your next date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t on a date,\u201d Jessy said.</p> <p>\u201cI was playing craps. Dillon Wolf was at the table\u2014I didn\u2019t even know his name then. But\u2014I won. I won a lot of money. It was bizarre\u2014as if an invisible hand was literally moving the dice until they landed on a hard ten. Anyway, I was starting to leave, and then the man plowed into me, knocked me onto the table\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon Wolf knocked you onto the craps table?\u201d Reggie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, the dead man, the murder victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was dead, but he knocked you down?\u201d Sandra asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cHe was dying when he knocked me down, and then he died on top of me. And then Dillon Wolf came back and helped me up. Actually, I think he convinced the cops to let me out of there, too,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Reggie told her. \u201cSo are you going to see him again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I would,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Reggie said.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask me out, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Reggie said confidently.</p><p>Jessy smiled and took another sip of the tea. It all seemed distant now, as if it had all happened to someone else. The man, Tanner Green, falling on her...dying.</p><p>\u201cWhat a night,\u201d Sandra said quietly. \u201cWhat you told Timothy...Before all that happened, you made enough to keep him at the home?\u201d</p><p>Jessy smiled falteringly. \u201cIt was amazing. It never happened before, and I\u2019m sure it will never happen again, but yes, I made enough to keep Timothy there for the year.\u201d</p><p>Sandra gasped. \u201cYou made that much? You did bet your house!\u201d</p> <p>Jessy shook her head. \u201cNo, honestly, I wasn\u2019t that crazy. It wasn\u2019t my money I was betting. I was rolling well, so other people kept throwing money down for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all so unbelievable,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cAll that money. And then a man dying on you. That is one bizarre night.\u201d She looked thoughtful for a moment, then asked, \u201cAnd no one saw anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of. He plowed into me, and he...died,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>They all sat in silence for a long moment, and then Sandra said, \u201cAll right, we\u2019re up and out of here. If you\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay...?\u201d</p><p>Jessy nodded.</p><p>\u201cI still feel creeped out.\u201d Reggie shivered suddenly. \u201cI mean...whoever murdered that guy is still out there, right?\u201d</p><p>Jessy felt a chill streak down her spine. Suddenly, as if she were reliving the moment, she could see Tanner Green\u2019s face, the lips moving, the eyes going dim, clearly before her. Shaking herself to drive the image out of her mind, she stood to see them out. \u201cI\u2019m fine. We\u2019ll all forget it in a couple of days,\u201d she lied, knowing she would never forget the events of tonight.</p><p>\u201cCall me. Let me know if...well, if there\u2019s anything I can do,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Jessy assured her. She watched as the two women made it into Sandra\u2019s car, then carefully closed and locked the door. She suddenly wished she had an alarm system, but until tonight, it would have been wasted money, considering the cost of Timothy\u2019s care.</p><p>With the door closed and locked, she checked in on Timothy, who had dressed for bed properly and was sleeping soundly.</p><p>She went on to her own room, thankful for the house. It had belonged to her parents, who had bought it long before Henderson became a popular spot to live. The courtyard was pebbled, with cacti here and there, along with statuary they had bought through the years. The living room held her mother\u2019s old piano, and had glass doors that led out to the small patio and pool area. She had a kitchen, dining room, family room, three bedrooms and an office.</p><p>Tonight, however, she wished that she also had an alarm.</p><p>She tried to tell herself that it was ridiculous to feel fear. Whoever had killed Tanner Green surely had no interest in her. She hadn\u2019t seen anything. She had just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But since Timothy was going to get to live happily because of the evening, she couldn\u2019t really regret it.</p><p>As she curled up in her own bed, she found herself thinking about Dillon Wolf. She\u2019d been intrigued by him, attracted to him, when he had just been standing there. That he had reappeared in time to help her up from the table was her own little minor miracle.</p><p>Why the hell hadn\u2019t she let him drive her home?</p><p>Because there would have been no point, she told herself. She didn\u2019t even have time to date. She was responsible for Timothy, for one thing, and she didn\u2019t mind that. Not at all. He had always been there for her, so it made her happy that now she could be there for him. And now she was so accustomed to working, trying to catch whatever overtime came along, that she barely remembered dating, much less having a relationship, and she wouldn\u2019t know how to date anymore, anyway, even if the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>It had been nice to touch him, though. To be touched. To feel the fabric of his jacket. To...</p><p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>And allowed herself to dream about the man named Wolf.</p><p>But in the middle of the dream, just as Dillon Wolf was smiling at her, things suddenly changed. She was at the table again, and everything seemed to shrink away. She turned, and Tanner Green was stumbling toward her. Straight at her. She could almost feel his crushing weight against her again. See his eyes staring into hers just before the light of life faded from them for good.</p><p>She saw his mouth moving, and once again heard the word he had whispered.</p><p>Indigo.</p><p>She woke with a start. It was still night, and the darkness seemed to press down on her. She was suddenly certain that something was there with her, hidden in the shadows, that she was being watched.</p><p>She leaped out of bed and dived for her light switch. The room jumped into view, and she blinked against the sudden harshness, tense, her body ready to spring.</p><p>But there was no one there. The room was empty.</p><p>She felt foolish, but she went into her bathroom, took the bloodied, discarded clothing and carried it into the kitchen, where she placed it in a larger trash bag, which she hauled out into the garage. She knew it was silly, but she wanted that reminder of the evening as far away as she could get it. Then she went back to bed, where she turned on her small bedroom TV and didn\u2019t turn off the light.</p><p>It occurred to her then that no one had asked her if the dying man had said anything.</p><p>And so she was the only one who knew that he had spoken that single word.</p><p>Indigo.</p><p>Emil Landon was a man of an indeterminate age; he might have been a worn thirtysomething, or a fit man in his fifties. Because Adam Harrison\u2014owner and director of Harrison Investigations, the rather unique private investigations firm that was Dillon\u2019s actual employer\u2014had contacts with access to just about any record on any human being living in the United States and beyond, he knew that Landon was forty-eight, had married and divorced three wives, had fathered one child who lived in Dublin with his mother, and had inherited millions from a grandfather who had been a Turkish oil baron. Sound real-estate investments had added to those millions. He liked to be a player. He liked the clothing and the cars, and the women who followed the call of big money. But he wasn\u2019t a lucky gambler himself, so he\u2019d discovered a way to profit from the propensity of most men to count on luck\u2019s eventual appearance, gamble\u2014and lose. He\u2019d opened his own casino and was in the process of negotiations to create more gambling meccas, something of a sore point in the community. On his mother\u2019s side, he could provide the proper court-required documents to prove that he was one thirty-second Paiute\u2014in fact, he only needed to be one sixty-fourth\u2014which gave him the right to build casinos on Indian land, where he would no doubt see to it that the proceeds of his venture stayed in his pockets and didn\u2019t reach the Indian nation that should benefit from it.</p><p>Dillon hadn\u2019t followed much of the legal process; he had seen it far too often already. He didn\u2019t think much of Emil Landon, and he still wasn\u2019t sure why a man as moral as Adam Harrison had wanted him to take the case.</p><p>Dillon knew plenty of wealthy people who were also extremely responsible with their money and were courteous to those around them, no matter what their financial or social status.</p><p>Emil Landon wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Now Landon was convinced that someone was trying to kill him, and Dillon figured that the man had been a jerk to enough people during his life that there might easily be several who found the thought of killing him appealing. But that was the thing. Most people thought about killing someone but didn\u2019t actually take steps to do it. Revenge was frequently savored sweetly in the mind. Most people had a conscience, and even if they didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t have the means to commit the perfect murder, and they sure as hell didn\u2019t want to get caught and spend the rest of their lives in prison. Of course, with enough money, murder for hire was always a possibility. And if a crack assassin couldn\u2019t be found, there was usually some dope addict around, willing to take a life for a few thousand\u2014or a few hits. But dope addicts weren\u2019t playing with all their cards, and such an attempt usually ended with a dead dope addict.</p><p>Tonight Dillon had been checking out the casinos, seeing who was in town and had the right money and connections to order a hit, along with a real bone to pick with Emil Landon. He still wasn\u2019t certain that Landon was even in any real danger. During his first consultation with the man, Landon had told him that he\u2019d been having dreams about being murdered. Gunned down in his own casino, stabbed in his own bed. He was certain he was being followed, though he had no proof of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had hired two of the best-known bodyguards in Las Vegas, Hugo Blythe and Tanner Green. Though now only Hugo Blythe was left, and he lived in a penthouse high atop the Big Easy, where the casino security staff\u2014bonded and put through a screening process that would have done the CIA proud\u2014was always on guard at both the penthouse elevators and the actual door to his suite.</p><p>When Dillon arrived, Landon was wearing a designer leopard-print robe and was surrounded by his secretary\u2014a blonde with breast implants the size of Texas\u2014his chief security officer and Hugo Blythe.</p><p>And he was in a state.</p> <p>Pacing, he barely paused to glare at Dillon when he entered, then launched right into a tirade. \u201cI told you I was in danger. I could tell you didn\u2019t believe me. But now Tanner Green is dead, and it\u2019s a warning to me. A message that the killer can pick off people around me so I don\u2019t have anyone to depend on. How the hell was he killed right in front of you?\u201d He paused in his pacing to stare accusingly at Dillon.</p><p>Dillon just shook his head disdainfully.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t killed right in front of me, he was stabbed outside the casino. And there are dozens of security cameras focused on the area, so hopefully the cops will find something on one of the tapes. My theory is that he was stabbed inside a car, then thrown out at the entry. From there, he staggered inside before dying. I suggest checking his phone records and his movements over the last few days to see who might have gotten him into that car and under what pretense. Of course, there\u2019s still the possibility that he was killed for something he did in his past, or just because he pissed off the wrong person.\u201d</p><p>Landon frowned at him, shaking his head. \u201cI told you, someone is after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you told me that, but have you told me everything I need to know?\u201d Dillon asked. He wasn\u2019t expecting a real answer from Landon. The man had been cagey from the start. There was no doubt that his activities hadn\u2019t been totally legit through the years, and he seemed to have a hidden agenda, as well, maybe pertaining to the casino on tribal land. Still, asking him questions, even if Dillon didn\u2019t expect real answers, might provide some bit of information he needed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Landon demanded impatiently. \u201cSomeone is trying to kill me. What more do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know all the possible whys,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cI need you to be honest with me, to think really hard about any business deal that might have gone sour, any affair that might have ended badly. I need to know any possible reason why someone with the resources to have you killed might want you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am being honest with you. Sure, I have enemies.\u201d Landon\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThere are some radical members of certain Indian tribes who don\u2019t get the fact that my casinos could provide jobs for a lot of people. Any rich man has enemies. You know that. But this...shit! Tanner Green? He was a pro.\u201d</p><p>The quadruple-D blonde came over to Dillon with a tray of shot glasses filled with assorted liquors. \u201cDrink, Mr. Wolf?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThanks, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wolf, I\u2019m going to be on duty twenty-four hours a day now,\u201d Hugo Blythe said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ll be following Mr. Landon every step he takes. But we\u2019ve got to figure out who\u2019s trying to kill Mr. Landon, and take care of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an assassin,\u201d Dillon said sharply. \u201cAnyway, the police are on this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police?\u201d Landon exclaimed derisively, then suggested what the police could do with themselves.</p><p>Dillon rose. \u201cI should be seeing those tapes first thing in the morning. I\u2019ll call you after I\u2019ve seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something, and you\u2019ve got to do it quickly,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cI can still use more help from you,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Landon looked as if he wanted to explode at Dillon again, but though he wasn\u2019t a genius, he wasn\u2019t stupid, either. \u201cI\u2019ll think back and come up with whatever I can,\u201d he acknowledged.</p><p>Dillon left. As he rode down on Landon\u2019s private elevator and strode out onto the main casino floor, he appreciated the fact that Landon had found the right business managers and builders. The Big Easy was going to do well. He wasn\u2019t too sure that he would choose Vegas for a family vacation himself, but plenty of people did, and Landon had made sure to cater to them as well as the hard-core gamblers. The Big Easy offered an entire floor of arcades, character restaurants, toddler rides and one huge roller coaster. There was a Western show aimed just at kids and a room reserved for \u201cyoung\u2019uns\u2019\u201d birthday parties.</p><p>As he headed over to the elevators to the parking garage, his eye was caught by an advertisement for the party room. It showed two Old West gunslingers with a pretty saloon maid between them. The picture was pure PG, but the face of the woman grabbed his attention and stabbed oddly at his heart.</p> <p>It was Jessy Sparhawk. Smiling, her beautiful red hair twisted up on her head and topped with a saloon-girl hat. The costume she was wearing was almost prim, and yet he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen a picture of such an arresting woman.</p><p>He headed down to the parking lot, his mind still full of Jessy, so lost in thought that it took him a moment to recognize the presence at his side.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant, just brilliant,\u201d Ringo said, keeping pace with Dillon Wolf\u2019s strong and determined walk. The folds of his long railway jacket made a slight rustling sound, but nothing compared to his spurs ringing against the ground.</p><p>Every now and then Dillon saw a head turn. Someone out there, someone who couldn\u2019t quite see Ringo, was still aware that something, someone, was in the area. They heard the sound of his passing on some distant level.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dillon asked impatiently.</p><p>Ringo cleared his throat. \u201cThe most beautiful creature in the world holds court at the craps table, I perform amazing tricks\u2014and you let her get away. Brilliant. I may be deceased, but you\u2019re the one who\u2019s really dead, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, my friend,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cBut I have work to do. Tanner Green was murdered and Emil Landon is getting restless\u2014and working for the man, I might remind you, is something you pushed me into.\u201d</p><p>Ringo ignored him and stuck with his original topic. \u201cI saw the way you smiled at her. Take a minute to smell the roses or you\u2019ll be dead a whole hell of a lot sooner than you think,\u201d he said knowingly.</p><p>\u201cThe way I hear it, you stopped to smell the roses and wound up smelling a dung heap,\u201d Dillon said curtly.</p><p>\u201cOuch! Not kind at all,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cAnd may I remind you, I died because I was caught up in someone\u2019s grudge against one of your ancestors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRingo, I\u2019m sorry, but that was more than a hundred years ago, and there\u2019s not a damn thing I can do about it now. I\u2019m sure he appreciated your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. I was good back then. Damn good.\u201d</p><p>A woman walked by, frowning nervously as she stared at him. He lowered his head, wincing. Usually Ringo refrained from speaking to him when they were in public, because usually he didn\u2019t reply. What the hell was up with him tonight? A man had been killed, of course. But it went beyond that. Something felt off. Felt...</p><p>Felt urgent.</p><p>It was as if he was facing the onset of something critical. Something that might end in death.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to ask her out, right?\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>\u201cI tried to drive her home. She isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man had just died on top of her. You need to give it another go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Ringo, you and Adam got me into this mess with Emil Landon, so let\u2019s deal with that first, huh?\u201d He put aside the fact that Jessy Sparhawk had affected him more deeply than he could possibly have expected, but there had just been something about her. She wasn\u2019t some hustler hanging on to the money men, wasn\u2019t a wild-eyed party child out to prove the truth of the slogan \u201cWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.\u201d She was different. She lived here, worked here. She knew the city. Knew the pitfalls to be found in a place where every business in town was out to separate you from your money.</p><p>So it was interesting that she had been playing high-stakes craps.</p><p>\u201cAre you paying any attention to me?\u201d Ringo demanded.</p><p>He felt himself flushing, because the fact was, he was completely intrigued by the woman. So why was he embarrassed around Ringo? Maybe precisely because he was so fascinated by her. But his life didn\u2019t allow for emotional intimacy, at least right now, and business had to come first. \u201cRingo, I\u2019m looking for a killer. Don\u2019t you think I ought to find out what the hell is going on before I drag someone else into my life?\u201d</p><p>Ringo didn\u2019t have an answer for that. He followed Dillon to his car, seeping through the passenger door, though he could have opened it. He sat silently throughout the ride to Dillon\u2019s house, just on the outskirts of the Strip.</p><p>Clancy, Dillon\u2019s huge Belgian shepherd, was wagging her tail at the door. She knew Ringo was there. At first she had hated him. She had barked up a storm whenever he was around, and it had all but driven Dillon crazy. But then, to his huge relief, she hadn\u2019t just accepted Ringo\u2019s ghostly presence, she had decided that she liked him. And when Dillon could get Ringo to stay home, rather than trailing after him, he was great, letting the dog in and out, and playing with her.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Ringo asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be off somewhere, doing something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but I\u2019m getting some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ringo cursed as Dillon headed for his room. Feeling completely worn-out, he stripped down and slipped between the sheets. They were into the wee hours of the morning, and he wanted a nap, at least, before heading to the police station.</p><p>But instead he lay awake. And when he closed his eyes, he could hear the drums of his childhood. He could hear the chants, see the warriors in the circle at the dance. A Paiute chief had been the one to develop the Ghost Dance, which had been picked up by many western tribes. The chief had envisioned casting the white men from the land, leading to a return of tribal power. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It hadn\u2019t happened. Not by a long shot.</p><p>He\u2019d been to dozens of Ghost Dances as a child, but he\u2019d never seen a single ghost at any of them. It had been at his parents\u2019 funeral, when he\u2019d been a bitter young idiot, that he\u2019d first seen the maiden in white.</p><p>It was rumored among the Indian nations that she was the guardian of the white buffalo, a mythical heroine who knew the hearts and minds of both the living and the dead. She was beautiful and wise, and she could read a man\u2019s soul.</p> <p>She had never been anything but a myth to him, a beautiful story told by his people.</p><p>Until that day at the funeral, when he looked up and she was just...there. She couldn\u2019t be real, he had told himself. She was a figment of his imagination, dredged up by the pain in his heart, and the fury against God and fate that burned so savagely inside him.</p><p>She had stared at him across the open graves. Then, later, when he\u2019d been about to get involved in an idiotic fight at the bar, she had stepped in between him and the man he had intentionally insulted. Apparently he\u2019d wanted to get his face smashed in, had wanted to feel the physical pain to ease the deeper pain that tore at his soul.</p><p>But she had stopped him. He had felt her hand on his shoulder, and when he\u2019d turned to face her, her eyes had locked with his and she had whispered, \u201cNo, this is not the way. Only time and the true path to peace will ease the bleeding in the soul.\u201d</p><p>And ever since then...</p> <p>Ever since then he\u2019d seen the dead.</p><p>Usually they just passed through his life because they needed something, and once they got it, they moved on. He\u2019d learned that through Adam Harrison and Harrison Investigations. Adam had taken him and turned him from a rebellious and bitter half-breed to a man with a calling. Adam had taught him about life and death, and how to value himself as a human being.</p><p>He owed Adam. Not only that, he liked the man.</p><p>So the ghosts came, he helped them...</p><p>And the ghosts left.</p><p>Except for Ringo Murphy. The problem was, Ringo himself didn\u2019t know why he was sticking around.</p> <p>He\u2019d lived by the gun, and then he\u2019d died by it, and there had been nothing in his life or death to indicate why he was still here.</p><p>Dillon shifted around, longing for even an hour\u2019s sleep.</p><p>He closed his eyes tightly.</p><p>And then, in that state between wakefulness and sleep, in a netherworld between conscious thought and oblivion, he saw the maiden, felt her gentle hand on his face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cIt is the beginning, the beginning\u2014and the end.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cI see them dancing in the sky,\u201d Timothy told Jessy.</p><p>She was driving him back to the home, and she felt torn. Worried about leaving him alone, she\u2019d had Sandra come over to watch him this morning while she\u2019d returned to the casino to turn her chips into cash\u2014later exchanged for a cashier\u2019s check made out to the home\u2014and fill out the IRS forms. She\u2019d never had to fill them out before, because her winnings\u2014the few times she\u2019d played a few dollars for fun\u2014had never been close to enough to report to the government.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t mind. The government was welcome to its share.</p><p>She was concerned now because she had to work that afternoon, and even her sizable winnings weren\u2019t enough to keep her job from being very important to her ongoing well-being. But Sandra had met her at the door when she\u2019d returned and suggested she might want to talk to someone at the home before she left Timothy there.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not as bad as I think, but...\u201d Sandra hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019s having conversations with imaginary people. And when I asked him who he was talking to, he gave me a sly look and said they were people in the walls, and that they were his friends and they made him happy, so I shouldn\u2019t worry. And maybe, if he\u2019s happy...\u201d</p><p>Now it seemed that his friends were in the sky.</p><p>Maybe she was just nervous because she\u2019d woken up in the night, certain that someone was watching her again. That kind of feeling usually vanished with the coming of day, though, and this time it hadn\u2019t.... This morning, as she\u2019d been brewing coffee and tossing raisin bread into the toaster, she\u2019d paused again, feeling eyes on her before telling herself that you couldn\u2019t feel someone watching you. Except that you could. Somehow people knew when they were being observed. Maybe it had to do with that huge part of the brain scientists said went unused.</p><p>But there hadn\u2019t been anyone there. Not last night, and not this morning.</p><p>But this morning Timothy had been talking to people in the walls, and now he was seeing dancers in the sky.</p><p>Which one of us is actually going crazy here? she asked herself.</p><p>The Hawthorne Home was just outside Las Vegas proper. She parked in front of the administration building, and Timothy frowned. She usually parked by Building A, his building, when she was bringing him back from a visit or an outing.</p><p>\u201cI have to go in and pay Mr. Hoskins,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cPay him?\u201d Timothy asked indignantly.</p><p>She patted his hand. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s life, Timothy,\u201d she said, and leaned over to kiss his cheek. Once upon a time he\u2019d been the best guardian in the world, and she still loved him so much.</p><p>\u201cWe all have to pay the rent, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot in the day of the ghost dancers,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but that was a long time ago. And there\u2019s no such thing as ghosts, anyway,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cBut if there were,\u201d Timothy said, cracking a dry grin, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent, would they? They\u2019d just phase in, and phase out, huh?\u201d</p><p>She was pleased by the pleasure Timothy took in his small joke. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure this would have been reservation land,\u201d she said, grinning back. She started to tell him to wait in the car while she went inside to pay, then thought better of it. He still knew how to drive. His imaginary friends might suggest that he needed to run over to a convenience store for something.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in with me,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that idiot Mr. Hoskins will be there?\u201d he asked tartly.</p><p>She almost laughed aloud at his indignation. He was half Lakota, which had given him straight black hair\u2014faded to white now\u2014but those genes hadn\u2019t reached his eyes. They were blue. He was still a handsome man, she thought, when he was standing straight and proud, as he was now, his face set in firm lines.</p><p>\u201cYes, I need to see him. And don\u2019t say anything rude to him, okay? At least we only have to see him once a month or so....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be perfectly courteous,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all certain about that. Hoskins was a man who didn\u2019t just find himself uncomfortable around the aged, he flat out didn\u2019t like them, and he let it show\u2014which made her wonder why he\u2019d taken this job to begin with. Well, like all people, he would get there soon enough, she thought. Or maybe he wouldn\u2019t. There was always that alternative. But she hoped he would lead a long life, until one day he needed care himself, only to discover that the younger generation wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>They got out of the car, and she linked arms with him as they walked inside together. The receptionist was pretty and young, and she looked at Jessy with surprise. \u201cMiss Sparhawk! Good morning. We thought perhaps you\u2019d decided to keep your grandfather at home with you. We...we weren\u2019t expecting to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Why not? I always enjoy having Timothy at home for a visit\u2014\u201d she turned to smile at him \u201c\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t be practical for him to live with me, seeing as I have to work. I\u2019ve brought the rent for the next few months,\u201d she added, giving the other woman a saccharine smile.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, if you\u2019ll just excuse me...I\u2019ll get Mr. Hoskins,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ring his office, she jumped up and went in. A moment later Hoskins appeared, frowning. \u201cMiss Sparhawk, Mr. Sparhawk. I hadn\u2019t expected to see you. I was assuming that you\u2019d be making other arrangements today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as you can see, we\u2019re not. I\u2019ll be taking Timothy back to his room now,\u201d she said, handing him a cashier\u2019s check.</p><p>He stared at her as if she were a ghost herself. \u201cHe was paid up through today,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cNow he\u2019s paid up for the next three months. Everything is in perfect order, contractually speaking.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why Hoskins looked so distressed, and she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cGood day, Mr. Hoskins,\u201d Timothy said, then turned to head out. Jessy said her own rather more triumphant goodbye, and followed him.</p><p>As they walked back to the car, Jessy saw a luxury sedan pull up a few spaces away. A young guy got out, then went around to help an elderly man from the passenger side, and the reason for Hoskins\u2019s white face became suddenly clear. He\u2019d been all set to rent Timothy\u2019s room to someone else. She laughed as she and her grandfather got back into the car, sharing the joke as she drove over to his building.</p><p>They checked in downstairs with the young male orderly on desk duty during the day\u2014every building had someone at the entry day and night since they weren\u2019t taking any chances with wandering seniors\u2014and headed up to Timothy\u2019s room. In the upstairs hallway they ran into another orderly, Jimmy Britin, a tall African-American with a wide smile. \u201cTimothy, Jessy,\u201d he said, his surprised pleasure evident.</p><p>\u201cHoskins was about to rent my room right out from right under me,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cBut he underestimated my granddaughter. And the ghosts, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Jimmy said, obviously unsurprised by what Timothy had said. He looked at Jessy, a question in eyes. What did you do? Rob a bank?</p><p>As Timothy headed straight for his room, Jessy smiled ruefully at Jimmy. \u201cI don\u2019t know about any ghosts, but someone must have been looking out for me. I won a small fortune at the craps table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Jimmy told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never gamble, but...\u201d She shook her head, as if puzzled by the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cYou were desperate. And you got lucky,\u201d Jimmy said.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to get to work,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cNo sweat. I\u2019ll get him situated. And stop looking so guilty. You take him home lots of weekends. Meanwhile, I\u2019m here, and Liz Freeze, his favorite nurse, is on today, too. He\u2019ll be fine. Now out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know, he\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s what?\u201d Jimmy asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hallucinating. A lot. About ghosts. They\u2019re in the walls, in the sky.... He even talks to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019ll be okay, I promise,\u201d he said, giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Jimmy.\u201d</p><p>With a grateful smile, she hurried into Timothy\u2019s room and gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m off to work now, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The ghosts are busy dancing in the sky. Things are going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they are,\u201d she said, then gave him another kiss and hurried out. Glancing at her watch, she realized she was going to be a bit rushed getting into costume, but she would manage. Things will be all right, she told herself. She had the routine down pat.</p><p>She hurried back down to her car, but before she unlocked it, she paused and looked around, certain that someone was watching her again, but she couldn\u2019t see anybody.</p><p>She checked the backseat.</p> <p>No one.</p><p>She looked around one last time, then gave herself a mental shake and told herself to stop being ridiculous. It was a bright, sunny day. If anyone was watching her, it was Hoskins, no doubt ruing the fact that she had made the payment, so he couldn\u2019t rent Timothy\u2019s room to someone else\u2014probably at a higher rate.</p><p>But the sensation of being watched followed her as she wove through traffic and all the way into the casino.</p><p>It was almost as if someone were sitting right next to her in the car.</p><p>\u201cSee? Two cameras, but notice the range,\u201d Jerry Cheever told Dillon. \u201cThere\u2019s Tanner Green, though it\u2019s difficult to see him because there were a dozen other cars in the entryway at the same time. It looks as if he got out of a white limo. Can\u2019t see the plate, though, and there must be a hundred of those things in town,\u201d he said in frustration. \u201cAnd Green looks like half the other drunks coming out of the woodwork at that time of night. He staggers there\u2014\u201d Cheever pointed at the screen \u201c\u2014but the guy ahead of him just shoves him away. See his look? Probably just thought it was a drunk falling on him. Then watch Green moving through the crowd. Everyone is talking to someone, no one is paying him the least bit of attention. Not even the doorman. He\u2019s just holding the door open and watching that brunette with the huge tits, completely oblivious to everything else, even the guy with the knife in his back. Okay, right here he\u2019s picked up on a new camera....\u201d Cheever\u2019s voice trailed off as he flicked the remote control, shifting to a scene in the casino. \u201cHe passed six cameras on his way to the craps table, but all you can see on any of them is him stumbling through the crowd\u2014until he bumps into Miss Sparhawk and they both land on the craps table. And there you are, helping her back up.\u201d</p><p>Cheever was discouraged; his frustration that so many security tapes could yield so few clues was evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to run through them all again, if it\u2019s all right,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest. I\u2019ve been staring at them for the last three hours. I had a video tech in here trying to home in on Green, but it didn\u2019t help. Someone\u2019s head, an arm, whatever, is blocking part of the view every step he took.\u201d</p> <p>Cheever tossed the remote to Dillon, who studied it for a moment, then hit a button to start the tape over. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if someone knew that outer drive was just out of the cameras\u2019 useful range,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cJust like,\u201d Cheever agreed. \u201cSo what do you think it means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it means our killer has to be someone involved with the casino, or who knows someone who is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod only knows how many people that could be,\u201d Cheever muttered.</p><p>Dillon turned in his chair and looked at Cheever, who was perched at the edge of his desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with the knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lab has it. But preliminary reports aren\u2019t giving us a thing. It\u2019s a short-bladed work knife, sold\u2014literally\u2014in the thousands here in town. It\u2019s a popular blade for breaking the plastic bands on stacks of money. Every casino in Vegas has a few of them. And of course there\u2019s not a hint of a fingerprint on the hilt. The killer probably wore gloves. Green was stabbed with considerable force, and the blade was just long enough to pierce the heart, which caused Green to bleed out. Because it was a short blade, he made it through to the craps table before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Dillon said, rewinding the tape. \u201cAny possibility I could get a vid tech in here to look at this with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jerry Cheever stared at him, his eyes narrowing, as if his first instinct was to defensively tell him to go right to hell. But then he shrugged. \u201cSure. If you can find something I didn\u2019t, that will be great. I\u2019ll go grab someone.\u201d</p><p>The minute he left the office, Dillon was out of his seat, looking at the files on Cheever\u2019s desk. Tanner Green\u2019s was right on top. He leafed through it quickly, but Cheever had nothing more than he had said.</p><p>A minute later a young woman from the video department came in and introduced herself as Sarah Clay. She had a controller with her that made the remote look like a kiddie toy. Dillon started with the first tape, and they went through it frame by frame, but Cheever had been telling the truth. It wasn\u2019t that the security equipment wasn\u2019t high quality, because it was the best. But the car from which Tanner Green had been expelled was just far enough out of range, of both the cameras and the neon lights, that making out details was impossible.</p><p>A white limo. That much was obvious, and also useless. As Cheever had said, Vegas was thick with the things, especially white ones. Every casino owned limos, the casino bosses owned limos, the rental companies owned limos, even half the high rollers in town had their own.</p><p>There was no way to tell the make or model, but even once the tapes were enhanced, there didn\u2019t seem to be any markings on it, nothing to indicate where it might have come from, which didn\u2019t help him now but might mean something when they moved on to the process of elimination.</p><p>They went through the other tapes in order, with Dillon asking the tech to freeze certain frames and enhance them, but once again, Jerry Cheever had been dead-on. The crowd in the casino that night had worked heavily against them. The best video tech in the world couldn\u2019t remove a body blocking a body, and even though the different angles caught by the different cameras usually helped with that kind of problem, this time they were shit out of luck.</p><p>\u201cAre we through?\u201d Sarah asked him politely, glancing at her watch.</p><p>He knew she probably had a half-dozen other cases she was supposed to be working on, so he smiled. \u201cJust about, and thank you. The last tape...could I see it one more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, but her voice was faint.</p><p>He let the tape run until he got to Green staggering up to the craps table, then had her home in on Tanner Green falling forward, pinning Jessy Sparhawk beneath him. Even caught in a moment of pure surprise and horror, she was striking. He had to wonder about that last name. She was a redhead, with huge blue eyes, and he found himself fascinated with her all over again.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wolf?\u201d Sarah asked politely.</p><p>He gave himself a mental shake. \u201cZoom in on Green\u2019s face for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>She pushed a button, and in seconds Tanner Green\u2019s bulging eyes filled the screen.</p><p>Hell, the man was dying.</p><p>But his expression was surprised, as if he couldn\u2019t believe it. Believe he was dying? Or how he was dying? Dillon wondered.</p><p>Green\u2019s lips moved slightly. Dillon replayed the moment and leaned in, trying to discern what the man had been saying. Nothing, maybe. Or maybe he had been begging for help. Maybe he had found God at the moment of death and was praying.</p><p>Dillon had Sarah widen the view and surveyed the immediate area. The air had been filled with a cloud of smoke, despite the casino\u2019s expensive air filters. Sometimes it seemed as if even people who didn\u2019t smoke decided they needed to in Vegas.</p><p>He stared intently at the screen for a minute longer.</p><p>Then he sat back. \u201cThanks very much, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>She might have been aggravated at the time she\u2019d been asked to give him, but she smiled. She probably didn\u2019t often get thanked for what was, after all, just her job.</p><p>\u201cSure. Anytime,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d She reached into her shirt pocket and produced a card. Her name and rank were on it, along with a phone number and an e-mail address. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you, about what you do, what you...see. They say you\u2019re the real deal. I meant what I said. Whatever you need\u2014whatever\u2014you can call me.\u201d</p><p>He took her card, nodding gravely. \u201cNow that, I really appreciate.\u201d He left her feeling very grateful indeed.</p><p>She had pretty much just told him that she would work for him on the q.t. That was priceless.</p><p>But right now he had to find Jessy Sparhawk. She was the only one who might know what Tanner Green had said right before he died.</p><p>There had been a recent period in Vegas\u2019s history when\u2014the tourist board had decided to turn Sin City into a family-friendly resort. The plan hadn\u2019t worked, and the city had soon reverted to its old image, but the aftereffects lingered, and some parents still brought their children along when they came to gamble. As a result, a lot of the casinos provided diversions aimed toward the kiddie set, because the problem with Vegas was that parents could be distracted\u2014maybe only momentarily, but still with frightening repercussions\u2014by bright, blinking lights and a sudden insistence that the next dollar shoved into a beckoning slot machine would be the one that hit the jackpot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the Big Easy the problem had been solved by offering an afternoon of pirate-themed entertainment, food and drink for the younger crowd.</p><p>It was glorified babysitting.</p><p>But Jessy had never minded that. She liked kids. Sure, every once in a while they wound up with an obnoxious little twerp who wouldn\u2019t stop tugging on beards, dumping the treasure chest or trying to look up the skirts of the pirate \u201cqueens\u201d or the servers. But all in all, it wasn\u2019t a bad gig. It was actually a lot better than performing at a bachelor party for a bunch of drunks who seemed to think that anyone under thirty and wearing a skimpy costume was for sale.</p> <p>In contrast, working the babysitting detail was usually fun, and that day it was going very well.</p><p>They had almost three hundred kids, some of them there gratis for guests of the casino, others had been enrolled at a steep price tag by parents staying elsewhere, though compared to the hundreds\u2014even thousands\u2014that could be dropped at one of the gaming tables or in slot machines in a matter of minutes, it was still small change.</p><p>The audience ranged from age two up to twenty-one. The older kids were usually there because they had younger siblings\u2014and because eighteen-to twenty-one-year-olds still couldn\u2019t legally step out onto on the casino floor or drink.</p><p>The show itself was mostly improvisational banter punctuated by carefully choreographed dance numbers. The cast played pirates who had somehow wound up stuck on Lake Mead, and they sang traditional pirate songs as they searched for treasure.</p><p>It was when the kids were shouting, trying to point out to her rather ditsy pirate queen that the treasure chest was right beneath her nose, and she was spinning around searching, that she saw him.</p> <p>He was standing just outside the room, leaning against a wall painted with a mural of the high seas and pirate ships flying the Jolly Roger, and he was staring through the glass wall that surrounded the theater space, watching her. He was wearing a suit, and he somehow managed to look both real and not real...</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even a foot away from Grant Willow, one of the four security men\u2014all of them highly skilled but able to relate to the kids without intimidating them\u2014who took turns standing watch in the vestibule, and he seemed totally oblivious to the other man.</p><p>She knew the watcher\u2019s face. She had stared at that face in the most uncomfortable circumstances imaginable. He couldn\u2019t possibly be there\u2014and yet he was.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>And then he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She must have come to a dead halt, stunned, because Aaron Beaton, playing the role of Captain Gray-specked Blackbeard, started prompting her. \u201cBonny Anne, Bonny Anne, have ye found it? Have ye found me treasure?\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him without any idea how to respond as her blood grew cold.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been real.</p><p>She had simply conjured him up in her mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>Or he had been real, just someone else. Someone who only looked like a dead man.</p><p>After all, a man had died on top of her last night; she had a right to be traumatized. To be seeing things. There was nothing odd about it at all.</p><p>\u201cBonny Anne?\u201d Aaron said sharply.</p><p>\u201cYour treasure? My treasure!\u201d she insisted, dragging herself back into character.</p><p>Her declaration started a mock battle that was really a carefully choreographed dance piece. She battled gamely, whirled and jumped, then looked back to the doorway and almost missed a beat.</p> <p>He was back.</p><p>And he was watching her with huge eyes and an expression filled with both tragedy and remorse.</p><p>Since the promo poster Dillon had seen the night before pictured Jessy Sparhawk, it was a reasonable assumption that if he headed to the Big Easy she was likely to be working.</p><p>She was.</p><p>The pirate party was scheduled daily from one to six, giving the parents a full afternoon of worry-free gambling. Dillon wondered how many of them forgot to come back at closing time, but he assumed the casino had a plan for dealing with that.</p><p>The theater was surrounded by glass walls, and the outer vestibule was decorated with pirate paraphernalia and wall paintings. Inside the room, the stage held an impressive pirate ship that seemed to float above shimmering blue water, an effect caused by lighting under a glass stage floor. There were interactive areas for the kids, and each seating section sported a different-colored pirate flag, dividing the kids into teams so they could root for their color-matched \u201cchampions\u201d onstage. There were huge treasure chests around the room that held soda, candy and chips, along with healthier soy snacks and natural iced teas. It was a top-quality production, designed to appeal to kids of all ages\u2014along with the occasional adult he saw in the audience. He noted that the smaller children were together in one area, and there seemed to be at least three employees wearing pirate-themed casino uniforms to attend to every nine or ten children.</p><p>Onstage, the pirates were going at it.</p><p>He recognized Jessy right away, despite her wig and makeup and pirate attire. The kids were shouting to her, laughing, and even the almost adults in the room were having fun and shouting right along with everyone else for her to find the treasure.</p><p>Then she froze. Just...froze, staring at the doorway.</p><p>It was only for the blink of an eye; then she jerked her gaze away and responded to one of the male actors. A sword battle ensued, then somehow turned into a dance.</p><p>Then, once again, Jessy Sparhawk froze.</p><p>Dillon felt a tap on his shoulder and thought it might be the big security guard who was keeping an eagle eye on the room.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. Ringo was at his side.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d Ringo said quietly.</p><p>Across the lobby, standing near the guard, stood another man. A big man in a suit.</p><p>Tanner Green.</p><p>Dillon started toward him, moving quickly but casually, keeping his eyes focused on the guard, as if he was just going over to ask him a question about the show.</p><p>But Tanner Green sensed him, and he was having none of it. He turned and stared hard at Dillon.</p><p>And then he disappeared, fading like mist taken by a sudden wind.</p><p>\u201cYou scared him!\u201d Ringo said accusingly.</p><p>Inwardly, Dillon cursed himself. He should have watched the man a while longer. He should have been patient. But if Tanner Green was walking around in some spiritual limbo, it was imperative for Dillon to reach him. Speak with him.</p><p>And he had moved without menace. This was one spooked ghost\u2014no pun intended, he thought with a grin.</p><p>The guard looked at him and nodded, mistaking him for a parent. \u201cKids will be out in a little while, maybe twenty minutes or so. A lot of them hang around to get their pictures taken with the cast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dillon said, turning away from the guard and putting his hand up to his face as if rubbing his chin, so he could speak softly to Ringo without being overheard.</p><p>\u201cWhy was he so frightened of me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDuh. The man was murdered,\u201d Ringo pointed out, as if pointing out the obvious to a three-year-old.</p><p>Irritated, Dillon chose not to respond to his ghostly companion\u2019s sarcasm. Ringo might be from the Old West, but he had adopted the modern vernacular with enthusiasm, as if that somehow made him more a part of the earthly world.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was afraid of you, then,\u201d Dillon asked. \u201cYou\u2019re the one carrying a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat actually makes sense,\u201d Ringo admitted. \u201cHe probably hasn\u2019t seen many other ghosts, and, if he has...well, I guess an old gunslinger might be a bit too much for him to handle. And he probably doesn\u2019t want to believe that he\u2019s dead, either. Probably hasn\u2019t accepted it yet.\u201d</p><p>Whatever the cause, Tanner Green was scared.</p><p>Even so, he had come out in the open to stare at Jessy Sparhawk, the woman he had been lying on top of as he breathed his last.</p><p>And she had seen him. Dillon would swear to it.</p><p>The play finished and the kids rushed the stage. The performers posed for pictures, laughing, talking, signing miniposters that seemed to come out of nowhere. He watched Jessy pick up a toddler for a photo, then talk to the little girl and sign a poster. She seemed totally at ease\u2014until she glanced back toward the door and an uneasy look crossed her face.</p><p>Then she saw Dillon and was visibly startled. After that she looked...frightened, rattled, though she continued to smile as she interacted with the kids.</p><p>He waved to her at one point, and she waved back.</p><p>The security guard with the broad shoulders and pleasant smile walked over to him. \u201cYou a friend of Jessy\u2019s?\u201d the man asked. \u201cNot just a waiting parent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dillon told him, shaking his head. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m a...friend of Jessy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go on in if you want,\u201d the guard said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dillon said and headed toward the stage, Ringo still at his side.</p><p>He noticed a woman turn around as they passed, a puzzled look on her face. She drew her sweater more closely around her, as if she had suddenly felt a chill. That was the way it was for most people. They didn\u2019t see the dead, couldn\u2019t communicate with them, but something inside told them that someone was there.</p><p>Dillon smiled at the woman and kept going, hoping Ringo wasn\u2019t feeling mischievous and wouldn\u2019t tease her with a tap on the shoulder or a tug at her skirt. He moved quickly, because if you weren\u2019t looking, Ringo wasn\u2019t as prone to act up.</p><p>Jessy was still onstage, posing with the last of the kids.</p><p>She looked at him over the head of a toddler, and he sensed she wasn\u2019t all that pleased to see him. But she was in performance mode, so she forced a smile to her lips.</p><p>\u201cVery impressive,\u201d he told her, reaching the stage. He saw her fellow cast members glancing his way and whispering to one another. He was being assessed, he knew.</p><p>\u201cWhat a surprise to see you here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He decided not to mince words. \u201cI need to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? This isn\u2019t a great time. I have to get out of costume, check my schedule for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>She glanced away, biting her lip. She might be a good performer, but she was a lousy liar. She didn\u2019t have a good excuse for refusing to talk to him, and she wasn\u2019t going to invent one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not having a great day,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take much of your time. And you have to eat, right? Why not let me take you to the fast-food establishment of your choice, and then I\u2019ll leave you alone, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She let out an uneasy sigh and gave in. \u201cSure. I need about half an hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I really appreciate it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She nodded curtly, and he couldn\u2019t help thinking that she made a gorgeous pirate. Her costume wasn\u2019t risqu\u00e9, but her breasts rode appealingly in the cotton blouse above the top of a leather corset. Her skirt was long, but slit up one side for dancing. Her stage makeup was heavy and came complete with false eyelashes, but even so, up close, she was stunning.</p><p>And she was afraid.</p><p>He forced himself to take a step back. She was a bit too appealing, and he had to concentrate if he wanted to get to the truth behind Tanner Green\u2019s death. And he just knew she wasn\u2019t going to be receptive to anything he had to say. Most likely, given that he had been there last night, his very presence was probably anathema to her already.</p><p>And things weren\u2019t going to get better.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at Chen\u2019s. It\u2019s just down the Strip,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he told her again. \u201cI\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>He watched her head backstage. Right before she left, she looked back\u2014and not at him.</p><p>Then she shuddered\u2014as if she\u2019d seen a ghost\u2014and disappeared behind a black velvet drape.</p><p>4</p><p>There was an incredibly simple answer to what was plaguing her, of course. She was simply seeing someone who looked like Tanner Green. It wasn\u2019t as if she actually knew the man and could be sure it was him.</p> <p>Bull.</p><p>She knew his face, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>That face was etched in her mind. She would never forget it. She had been looking into his eyes as he died.</p><p>Key words. He had died.</p><p>Maybe she had been listening to Timothy too much, and now she was seeing dead people just as he saw ghost dancers in the sky.</p><p>She winced as she sat down at her dressing table. Why on earth had she agreed to see Dillon Wolf? She didn\u2019t want to, and she didn\u2019t really understand why. The man was attractive, courteous, charming and, well, hot, as Sandra would have put it.</p><p>But...</p><p>He was somehow connected to the extremely odd visions she was having. How or why, she didn\u2019t know. Everything was tied up in feelings of fear and unease, and she didn\u2019t like feeling this way at all. At least the cops were leaving her alone; they evidently knew that she\u2019d had nothing to do with Tanner Green\u2019s death other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p> <p>She reached for a makeup-remover pad and set to work. With her makeup gone, she looked young. And afraid. Hell, she was afraid. And she really hated that.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the hottie?\u201d April Brandon, one of her fellow pirates, asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall, dark and super cool,\u201d April said, sliding into her own chair in front of the long mirror.</p><p>\u201cOh, just a friend. No, not a friend. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn enemy?\u201d April teased.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I mean, I just met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, if you decide not to be his friend, introduce him to me, huh?\u201d April winked at her, pulling her plumed hat from her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a boyfriend, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019m not blind,\u201d April said. She pulled off her earrings, then turned around suddenly to survey the room.</p><p>Jessy felt as if a million goose bumps broke out over her body and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootsteps on my grave, I guess,\u201d April said, shrugging. \u201cSorry. I just had this creepy feeling. Ice along the spine or something.\u201d</p><p>Jessy looked around, as well. She didn\u2019t see anyone, but she felt uncomfortable even so. She had to get herself under control. How was she ever going to lead a normal life if she was suddenly afraid of invisible danger at every turn?</p><p>April gave a shrug and reached for her makeup remover. \u201cAnyway, friend to friend? I\u2019d go after him if I were you, if only just for the sex. And I\u2019ll be wanting details when you do.\u201d</p><p>Jessy groaned. \u201cI prefer not to kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an Indian, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe correct terminology these days is Native American.\u201d</p><p>April rolled her eyes. \u201cI call you an Indian all the time. People think I\u2019m crazy, cuz you\u2019re so light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy\u2019s half Lakota,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cSo there you go. You are an Indian. Sorry, Native American.\u201d</p><p>Jessy shed her boots and put them in the box under the table, then shimmied out of her pirate apparel, and quickly slid into her own sandals and knit sheath. \u201cGotta go,\u201d she told April, giving her friend a pat on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTake Mr. Creepy with you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jessy froze, turning around to stare at April.</p><p>April laughed. \u201cJust kidding. That feeling of being watched, you know?\u201d She shuddered. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of the newspaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe newspaper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe front page is all about that guy who was killed last night.\u201d She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cHe worked for our boss, you know. Emil Landon, the guy who owns this place. So in a way, it was a coworker who was killed. He died right on top of some poor woman.\u201d She looked more closely at Jessy and gasped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re white as a ghost. Hadn\u2019t you heard about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I knew about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it has nothing to do with us. It was probably someone he used to know before he took up the bodyguard business. Still, I guess none of us should go walking to our cars alone these days. Vegas has never been number one in the low-crime sweepstakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jessy agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not walking to your car alone now, are you?\u201d April asked her, concerned.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m meeting\u2014I\u2019m going to the Strip. You have someone to walk you to your car, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the Strip, too. Now get out of here. I\u2019ll be right behind you!\u201d</p><p>Jessy left the dressing room, unnerved. As she closed the door behind her, she guiltily hoped she was shutting \u201cMr. Creepy\u201d in with April. She hurried past the empty theater, anxious to get to the casino floor, where there would be bells, lights and lots of people.</p><p>Dillon wondered if she was really going to show, or if she would find a way to avoid him.</p><p>But it was almost exactly half an hour from the time she had left him that she walked through the front door of Chen\u2019s.</p><p>Vegas was filled with beautiful women. Most of them not only had killer bodies but glorious faces and legs that went on forever. And in this city, where a good showgirl was pretty much guaranteed a high-paying job, most of them came with enhanced breasts, as well.</p><p>As he watched Jessy Sparhawk come through the door and pause to look around the restaurant, he tried to analyze her appeal. Long sleek hair cascaded like a sunset down her back. Her eyes were large and expressive. Her figure was perfectly curved, but natural in every way. Her legs seemed long enough to stretch to China, and the symmetry of her features made her look simultaneously elegant, confident\u2014and sweetly vulnerable. Nothing about her had grown hard yet, as so often happened to women out here.</p><p>He tried to figure out what made her so special, but an answer escaped him. It might have been her voice, the way she could speak so quietly yet be heard so clearly.</p><p>Hell, it might have been her ears or her kneecaps, for God\u2019s sake. It was impossible to fathom what made her so appealing. She just was.</p><p>She was casual now. Her face was scrubbed clean of makeup, and she had donned a cobalt-blue dress that echoed the color of her eyes. There was nothing showy about the way it fell to her knees and bared her arms, but when she moved, the outfit became a thing of beauty.</p><p>Ringo gave a low whistle.</p><p>Ignoring him, Dillon stood as she approached the booth and extended a hand. She accepted and sat, though she was actually perching on the edge of the seat, rather than actually sitting.</p><p>\u201cMiss Jessy,\u201d their waitress said, hurrying over before Dillon could say anything. Evidently Jessy had chosen a place she frequented. Was that a good sign? Or just the first thing that had come to her mind?</p><p>\u201cHi, Mai,\u201d Jessy said, smiling broadly at the pretty, young Chinese woman. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good, I bring Michael on Saturday?\u201d Mai asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cPlease do. I promise we\u2019ll see that he has a great time,\u201d Jessy assured her.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I pour your tea,\u201d Mai told her, suiting her action to her words and picking up the pot of tea in front of Dillon. He\u2019d been pleased to discover that they brewed some of the most delicious green tea he\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>\u201cSo our waitress is Mai and she has a son?\u201d Dillon said after Mai left them to decide on their order.</p><p>\u201cShe and her husband own the restaurant,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cAnd they have a four-year-old. He\u2019s the cutest little thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the food is as good as the tea, this is going to be a great dinner.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head toward him and almost smiled. Apparently she appreciated a man who knew good tea, he thought.</p><p>But not that much, he added silently as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want. I don\u2019t understand what you think I can tell you. You were there last night. I never saw that man before he died on top of me,\u201d she said, cutting to the chase.</p><p>\u201cI just thought that, if we spent a little time talking, something might occur to you,\u201d he said, watching her eyes.</p><p>She stared across the table at him and shook her head. \u201cYou work for Emil Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019ve worked for him longer than I have. I\u2019ve only just been hired by the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he thinks he\u2019s in danger,\u201d Jessy said flatly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think yet,\u201d Dillon told her truthfully. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find out more about the man. There are a lot of rumors, but if you go through public documents and legal records, you can get a feel for someone. He\u2019s rich. He owns a casino. Whether he\u2019s really played it rough and created a few financial corpses along the way, or gotten in with the wrong connections, who knows? He doesn\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound as if you like him much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know him. I\u2019ve seen him on the news, but I\u2019ve never actually seen him in person. It\u2019s unlikely I would have any cause to meet him, unless he suddenly decided to bring in a pack of little kids.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his tea, not wanting her to see him smile at the thought of how well she dealt with children. It was nice. Although, admittedly, he found himself so entranced by her that she might have said that lap dances were her thing and he would have found a way to find that nice, too.</p><p>Mai returned to the table, and to Dillon\u2019s pleased surprise, Jessy looked at him hesitantly and asked if it would be all right if she and Mai decided on their order. He grinned and told her to go right ahead.</p> <p>Jessy seemed to be relaxing. She was at least sitting all the way back in the booth now.</p><p>\u201cIt must be difficult for you,\u201d she mused, sipping her tea after Mai had left again. \u201cEmil Landon certainly has a past, maybe a lot of enemies. And Tanner Green\u2014from what I saw on the news, he had a past, as well. It does seem strange that a man as big as he was went down without a fight. You have to get close to use a knife.\u201d</p><p>She looked thoughtful as she spoke. Dillon wondered if she was disturbed or just stating facts.</p><p>\u201cIt suggests that he was with someone he trusted,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cAlso, in a place as densely populated as a casino, it\u2019s easy to get close to someone without them noticing. But he might have been stabbed before he even got to the casino. Not enough evidence yet to be certain of much.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little shudder and offered him a rueful smile. \u201cI feel guilty saying this, but it\u2019s reassuring to think that someone wanted Tanner Green dead. It\u2019s better than thinking there\u2019s a killer out there, seeking victims at random.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more comforting, yes,\u201d Dillon agreed.</p> <p>The meal arrived, and Dillon thought he had passed muster, because Jessy introduced him to Mai as a friend. Jessy had ordered two dishes, one chicken and one beef dish, one Cantonese and one Mandarin, and both were delicious. There were a few precious moments when the food first arrived that felt almost like being on a regular date. But she hadn\u2019t agreed to go on a date with him; she\u2019d agreed\u2014reluctantly\u2014to see him because he needed to talk to her. She didn\u2019t dislike him, he was pretty sure, but she seemed determined to create a wall between them, and she apparently hoped that he would stopped banging on the gate.</p><p>But they couldn\u2019t talk about food forever, and finally he brought the subject back to Green\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think I can tell you,\u201d she said, staring at him while he chewed a piece of beef.</p><p>\u201cI think that there\u2019s something. Maybe in your subconscious. Something you don\u2019t think is important or even realize you know, but it might just be the clue that changes everything.\u201d</p><p>She set down her fork and leaned toward him. \u201cI can\u2019t help you. A man I had never seen before stumbled through the crowd, fell on me and died on top of a craps table. You know I didn\u2019t know him, that it happened just the way I\u2019ve described it, and just that quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spoke to you,\u201d Dillon said quietly.</p><p>Her instant frown of surprise and confusion was definitely real. Had she forgotten? Was the information he needed actually buried in her subconscious? She sat back, thinking. \u201cWe didn\u2019t carry on a conversation,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI saw the security tapes. His lips moved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe might have whispered something,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know. He was dying. He could have said anything. I don\u2019t remember. All I remember is the feeling of being trapped, the horror of realizing that he was bleeding to death on top of me. And those are images I would just as soon forget.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let it go at that, even though he sensed that this wasn\u2019t the time to push her. She knew what Tanner Green had said, either consciously or subconsciously, but for now, he had lost her. Time to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cHow was your grandfather last night? Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you very much.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cTimothy is...slipping,\u201d she said, as if she thought the idea might frighten him away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Is it Alzheimer\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just slipping...that\u2019s all. He\u2019s fine, he takes care of himself, he just...he just needs to be watched. He has his moments. He\u2019s functioning. He knows me, and he knows the people who care for him.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHe actually lives in a home, but he loves it because he has a wonderful doctor, and the people there are terrific.\u201d Once again she hesitated, as if saying more than she wanted, but spilling it out anyway. Maybe it was still an involuntary attempt to scare him away. \u201cMy folks died when I was young. Timothy raised me. I love him to death, but I can\u2019t work and keep him at home. He forgets things on the stove, and he talks to friends in the walls and in the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they\u2019re friends, it sounds as if it\u2019s all right to me,\u201d Dillon said lightly.</p><p>\u201cI have friends who can help me out when he\u2019s home,\u201d she said, toying with the food on her plate.</p><p>\u201cYou were gambling last night to pay for his home, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot over to him, and she shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely expensive to get old in this country, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know. I\u2019ve seen it many times. I\u2019m glad the numbers came in for you. I didn\u2019t get the impression that you gamble that often.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI pretty much never do. I grew up here, went to school here, and now I work here. Timothy is the only family I have left. I have friends, of course, and I love working with kids. There you have it. My life. Let\u2019s hear about yours. Rumor has it you\u2019re a secret agent of some sort. So what\u2019s the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly a secret agent,\u201d he said, hiding his surprise that she\u2019d been talking to someone about him. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly no secret that I\u2019ve been hired by Emil Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what you usually do,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m basically a free agent\u2014licensed, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days I work for a business called Harrison Investigations, headed by a man named Adam Harrison who hires people from around the country\u2014around the world, actually. My roots are here, though. My folks are gone, but I have family who live not too far away. The case came up, Adam suggested I take it, so here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Dillon hesitated. Why? Because the ghost who hangs around with me wanted me to take it, and Adam thinks if a ghost has a feeling about something, it needs to be looked into.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure,\u201d he said. That much, at least, was honest.</p><p>\u201cDoes your family live on reservation land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them, and some on private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is your employer so secretive, and what are all the jobs he supposedly does for the government?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2019s been called in over the years to investigate various crimes, some of them federal, and he\u2019s cultivated a lot of contacts in the various law enforcement agencies around the country. I don\u2019t know everything about him, or even about my fellow agents or the cases they\u2019ve worked. Sometimes a few of us work a case together, and sometimes things are handled on a smaller and more personal scale, and they\u2019re settled. There\u2019s nothing undercover about us, though Adam doesn\u2019t seek publicity. And he chooses our cases carefully, or sometimes a particular investigator chooses a case, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Adam Harrison suggested you take Emil Landon\u2019s case. And I think that\u2019s interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you suppose he chose the case of a powerful man who has lots of money but, from what I hear, few scruples?\u201d The question was a challenge, he thought. She sounded as if she wanted to find out that there was something not quite legit about him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Hopefully, by the time I get to the bottom of things, I will. So far, I\u2019ve met Emil Landon and his retinue, and now one of his bodyguards is dead\u2014a death you were involved in through no fault of your own. That\u2019s why I can use all the help I can get.\u201d He watched her eyes, her face, hoping for a sign of trust. The slightest possibility that she might admit to seeing a ghost.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Instead, she stood suddenly. \u201cForgive me, but I\u2019m exhausted right now. I\u2019ll think about it. I\u2019ll try to remember if he said anything, but as I said...I never saw the man before. Technically I work for Emil Landon, too, but I\u2019ve never met him, either. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk away, then returned, blushing. \u201cI forgot. The check\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I asked you to meet me.\u201d She blushed harder, as if she didn\u2019t want him to get the impression they were on a date. \u201cConsider it a business expense. Our mutual boss will pay it.\u201d</p><p>He watched her go, torn. He wanted to follow her through to the garage and make sure she got into her car okay. Whether she knew it or not, she was being followed by Tanner Green, and though Dillon was certain the specter had no intention of doing her harm, someone had murdered the man, she had been there when he died, and that meant she could be in danger, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it, sagebrush,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>Dillon had actually forgotten about the ghost\u2019s presence. But now Ringo followed Jessy Sparhawk from the restaurant, the barely perceptible jingle of his spurs and the slight breeze of his passing causing frowns of confusion as he passed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessy walked quickly through the bustling casino toward the garage elevators. The place was full of activity, even though things wouldn\u2019t really be in full swing until later. Still, bells were ringing, people were laughing and talking loudly to be heard over the machines, and hawkers were advertising certain games.</p><p>She stepped into the elevator along with a musician in Mexican attire carrying an acoustic guitar, a couple who clung to one another and giggled constantly and a man from a pizza-delivery company. The door started to shut, then opened again, as if a latecomer had triggered the sensor.</p><p>Except no one was there.</p> <p>\u201cGhosts in the machine,\u201d the deliveryman offered with a laugh.</p><p>The giggling couple giggled louder, and even the musician smiled. The door slid closed again, and Jessy felt as if a cold draft was wafting around her.</p><p>She had to get a grip, she told herself. Every little shift in the air around her made her feel as if she was being watched, followed, and it was ridiculous. She had to stop being so paranoid or she wouldn\u2019t be any good to anyone.</p><p>She was glad when the musician got off on her level, and glad that he wasn\u2019t far away as she headed toward her car. She deactivated the alarm, slid into the driver\u2019s seat and immediately locked the doors. Then she turned around to investigate the backseat, assuring herself that she was alone in the car, even while ridiculing herself for having seen too many movies where the killer waited in the back of a car to attack his unwary victim.</p><p>But she was alone.</p> <p>She turned on the stereo\u2014loudly. Music was a good way to drown out any sounds she might not want to hear. But it was Seventies Night on the local station, and the minute the DJ introduced Blue Oyster Cult\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Fear the Reaper\u201d she switched the frequency. She drove out the back way, avoiding the Strip, and headed for Henderson, all the while reminding herself that she was safe. She had locked the doors. She had checked the back.</p><p>And still she felt as if she wasn\u2019t alone. As if someone she couldn\u2019t see had followed her. Was right there with her.</p><p>But she reached home without incident, then forced herself to walk at a normal pace up the front walk. She quickly closed and locked the door behind her, then reset the newly installed alarm. But even inside, she couldn\u2019t escape the uncomfortable sensation of being watched, of not being alone.</p><p>She went first to the kitchen and picked up her heaviest frying pan. She wished that she golfed\u2014a nice strong golf club would have made an excellent weapon, though she was sure that, if need be, she could wield a mean frying pan.</p><p>But a walk through her house convinced her that she was entirely alone. She was also desperately in need of sleep, and she thought about taking a nighttime pain-killer, but they left her feeling drowsy in the morning, so she poured herself a large Baileys instead. She was standing in the kitchen, glass in hand, when the phone rang and she jumped a foot off the floor. Laughing at her own foolishness, she picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d came Sandra\u2019s cheerful voice in her ear.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jessy said, realizing she didn\u2019t sound entirely convincing.</p><p>\u201cSo everything\u2019s all right with Timothy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great, actually. Hoskins was so sure I couldn\u2019t come up with the money that he promised Timothy\u2019s room to someone else. I\u2019m sure they weren\u2019t very happy to find out they couldn\u2019t move in after all, but Hoskins is a jerk and deserves to get reamed out. But Timothy\u2019s just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that. And how about you?\u201d Sandra asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t seen the news, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing more actually happened. But you\u2019re famous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Sandra laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re calling you \u2018the mystery woman.\u2019 Hang on\u2014Reggie wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so cool,\u201d Reggie said. \u201cNo one has used your name, but they all say he fell down and died on top of a mystery woman. A beautiful mystery woman. I\u2019d like to be a mystery woman someday,\u201d Reggie finished with a dramatic sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to forget it ever happened,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>Sandra came back on the line. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It will all die down in time. I\u2019m sure the cops will figure it out. It probably had something to do with drugs or revenge or some such thing. Or maybe it was mob related. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a cop. I don\u2019t know how they sort through it all. Anyway, I just wanted to check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve got a show tomorrow, so I\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019ll check in on Timothy in the morning, then head to work\u2014and hope no one there has heard about the mystery woman,\u201d Jessy told her. \u201cThey\u2019ll never stop teasing me if they have.\u201d</p><p>They said good-night, with Sandra telling her to call if she needed anything. Jessy hung up, half her glass of Baileys gone, resolved that she was going to get some sleep. As she stood, she thought that she heard a jingling sound but decided it was just the phone giving a little hiccup.</p><p>She quickly drank the rest of the Baileys and headed to her room.</p><p>She got ready for bed quickly, then surprised herself by pausing before she lay down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired, and I\u2019m begging you to leave me alone,\u201d she said loudly to the empty room.</p><p>Naturally, there was no response.</p><p>A few minutes later\u2014and contrary to her own expectations\u2014she was asleep.</p><p>Dillon was tempted to call Jessy just to reassure himself that she had made it home safely, but he refrained. Anyway, it was ridiculous to think she was in any real danger. She\u2019d happened to be there when a man had died, but she had no connection to him. Okay, the man\u2019s ghost was following her for some reason, but that didn\u2019t mean she was in any real danger.</p><p>Besides, Ringo had followed her, and he had over a hundred years\u2019 experience learning to deal with life after death and the rules of spectral existence. He was a real pro, as ghosts went. He could move things\u2014like those dice\u2014even knock them over, if necessary. He could probably even manage to call 911 if necessary.</p><p>To keep himself from thinking about Jessy, he decided to head over to the Sun and interview some of the workers there, especially the bellmen and valet-parking attendants, who might have seen something the night Green was stabbed.</p><p>It was Thursday night. The crime-scene tape had been taken down and the casino reopened sometime that morning, which had been an invitation for the place to go wild. It was hugely busy, but Dillon was good at getting people to talk\u2014in this case, that consisted of handing out a lot of tips. The manager of the valet service had been inside his glass box and hadn\u2019t seen anything. Three of the bellmen had been inside at the time, and none of them had seen anything useful. The parking attendants were no help, either.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d one of them told him, \u201cwe\u2019re so used to seeing people wander in drunk that if someone was staggering, we wouldn\u2019t have paid any attention. We\u2019ve all been questioned by the police, and I wish we could help. It feels almost ridiculous that we can\u2019t, but you know how it is. Dozens of limos come through here every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Dillon persisted, \u201cthis limo managed to be just out of range of the cameras. As if someone knew where security cameras could reach and where they couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, in the far lane, the cops said. Check with Rudy Yorba\u2014I remember seeing him out there that night, waiting to park the next car in line.\u201d</p><p>Dillon tracked down the young man named Rudy Yorba and found a tall, thin thirty-five-year-old with a lot of nervous energy.</p><p>Rudy was pleased to accept a tip for his time and gave Dillon his full attention. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I saw, to tell you the truth,\u201d he told Dillon. \u201cThat homicide guy was such a jerk, I was kind of afraid to talk to him. He said he wanted facts, not theories, that he didn\u2019t want to know what anyone thought they saw, only what they really did see, and I couldn\u2019t give him any facts. Said he didn\u2019t want to be chasing his tail following up a bunch of false leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cop, I\u2019m an investigator, and I don\u2019t mind chasing my tail,\u201d Dillon assured him. \u201cNothing else for me to do right now anyway, right?\u201d</p><p>Rudy looked at him and nodded. \u201cOkay, well, here\u2019s what I think. I think that guy came out of a white stretch Caddy. I\u2019d looked up cuz I was waiting for a guy to get out and hand over his car, and I saw someone getting out of the Caddy, but I don\u2019t know who. But the next thing I know, there\u2019s this huge hulk of a guy blundering through the crowd. He looked rude, like he was pushing people around. Then I looked down to say something to my guy, and by the time I looked back up, the big guy was gone. So, like I said, I think he came out of that Caddy, but I don\u2019t know it for a fact. I can tell you for a fact that it came in fast, and it went out fast. I mean, it\u2019s hard for a Caddy that big to burn rubber, but if you ask me, that limo did just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rudy, thanks very much,\u201d Dillon told him, and handed the younger man one of his cards. \u201cIf you think of anything else, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Rudy said, and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d\u2019a thought someone would have noticed the knife.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut, hey, this is Vegas. What gets stabbed in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?\u201d He laughed weakly at his own grim joke.</p><p>\u201cSad but true,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Privately, Dillon was certain Rudy was right about the Caddy, which meant whoever had killed Green had plenty of money, enough to hire a pricey limo, and was savvy enough to know just where the security cameras\u2019 reach ended.</p><p>Dillon headed back home at that point and turned on his computer, putting the Internet to use to figure out which casinos were currently making use of which limo services. There were six that touted the availability of limos for a price, or gratis for their high rollers.</p><p>There were also three agencies that specialized in limo rentals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was mulling over the information he had garnered when his cell phone rang. \u201cWolf here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wolf? It\u2019s Rudy Yorba.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello. Did you think of something else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I did. I know the year of that limo. I just remembered it, cuz you got me thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this year\u2019s model. I know because of the design of the mirrors. After you left, some of us guys were talking about how things don\u2019t really change much, that sometimes you can\u2019t tell one year from the other, and then I thought about the mirrors. Maybe it\u2019s nothing, but I thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something. Thanks, Rudy, thanks a lot.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and turned back to his computer. None of the rental agencies advertised the latest model, but two casinos did: the Sun, and the newest entry on the Strip\u2014the Big Easy.</p> <p>5</p><p>Rudy Yorba left work at two in the morning. Most of the time, things at the casino began to wind down around then. The partiers were drunk enough that, whether they thought it was time to go to bed or not, their eyes were closing as their alcohol-infused bodies longed for a bed.</p><p>Rock stars and their retinues had a tendency to come in late, of course, but there hadn\u2019t been any rock stars that night. So though he often hung around until three or four in hopes of picking up a job, he was off that night by two.</p><p>He said goodbye to his friends and coworkers, and headed to the parking lot. Employees had to use the open-air top floor, but that was no big deal. He just took the service elevator and rode up to where his little Bug was waiting. He loved his car. In a world where gas prices kept skyrocketing, he could go forever on a single tank.</p><p>He paused and looked out at the night, the moon and stars hidden by thick cloud cover. Good God, it was black. He imagined that, out in the desert, beyond the neon lights, it would be darker than eternity. Dark as hell. And cold, too. Freezing. That was the desert for you. Hotter than hell by day, cold as a witch\u2019s tit by night. And Vegas itself nothing but a pile of neon and money in the middle of that desert.</p><p>He hit the remote and heard the alarm chirp cheerfully. Friends made fun of him for his car, but he loved her. He called her Mary. Mary for both his mom and his daughter. His mother had been gone for years, and he pretty much never saw his daughter. She lived in New Hampshire with his ex. He got out there once a year if he was lucky, and Mary was allowed to spend two weeks with him in summer. He didn\u2019t hate his ex-wife for that, and he didn\u2019t resent her new husband, either.</p> <p>When Mary had been born, he\u2019d thought he was a hotshot. He\u2019d been working on Wall Street, making big money, and he\u2019d driven a Hummer.</p><p>Then he\u2019d gotten hooked on cocaine and gone through everything he\u2019d ever made\u2014and nearly dropped Mary off the balcony of his high-priced condo when he was high out of his mind one night. Now he didn\u2019t touch drugs or so much as a drop of alcohol, and he was making his way back to humanity. He knew he had to prove himself to his daughter, and he wasn\u2019t sure that she loved him as much as she loved her stepfather or ever would, but he didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>As he headed toward the car, he saw someone heading away from it, making their way through the lot. He didn\u2019t think anything of it. Employees came and went all night.</p><p>Then he heard footsteps behind him and swung around, inexplicably edgy.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rudy!\u201d The woman who called out to him was Amber Olsen, a cocktail waitress.</p><p>\u201cHey, Amber. Quiet night, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, too quiet. Nothing like a man dying to drive away business,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t sweat it. Maybe they\u2019ll put us on the ghost tour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHope so,\u201d Amber said, and waved as she headed down another aisle to her car.</p><p>Rudy reached his Bug and got inside, then thought to look in the backseat. He grinned ruefully to himself. It was empty. Of course.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he was out on the highway and felt the first little chug of his engine that he frowned and looked at his instrument panel.</p><p>What the...? He was out of gas\u2014which was impossible. He had filled the tank just that morning.</p><p>A moment\u2019s uncertainty filled him. Had he had one of his little blackouts and only thought he\u2019d filled his tank? No, he never blacked out in the car. Never. It only happened when he was standing around doing nothing while he was waiting for his turn to park a car or go retrieve one. He wouldn\u2019t drive if he had any fear of blacking out when he was actually concentrating. He was trying to rebuild his life, not kill someone.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t change the fact that he was out of gas. He knew he should have invested in an AAA membership, but it was one of those things he hadn\u2019t gotten around to yet.</p><p>Swearing, he pulled over to the side of the road before the engine sputtered out completely. Luckily, he was only a couple of miles from the next exit and a gas station.</p><p>Dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb. He swore at himself as he got out of the car, careful to lock the door behind himself. He loved his Mary, and he didn\u2019t want anyone stealing her.</p><p>He thought about hitchhiking, then decided he might as well just walk, seeing as there weren\u2019t many other cars on the highway anyway. A quiet night all around, he supposed.</p><p>He walked for half a mile, humming to himself to keep from cursing aloud at his own stupidity.</p><p>There were lights behind him, but hell, this was a highway. He paused and turned, thinking about trying to flag down the driver and bum a ride after all.</p><p>He knew he was still on the shoulder, but it seemed as if the car was coming straight toward him. He raised his hands against the blinding glare, wondering what kind of idiot was driving.</p><p>The lights grew brighter as the car drew closer. It must have been doing at least eighty.</p><p>And it was coming right at him.</p><p>He never screamed.</p><p>And he never suffered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even have time for a dying thought.</p><p>Morning.</p><p>Light seeping into her bedroom woke Jessy, and she opened her eyes slowly, afraid of what she might see.</p><p>The clock ticked away time on the bedside table. The dream catcher that Timothy had bought her when she was a child, beautifully crafted and dotted with beads and crystals, hung from the dressing-table mirror, just catching the first glints of day.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>And still...</p><p>It was eerie, waking up with the sensation of being observed.</p><p>\u201cYou are not being watched,\u201d she told herself firmly. \u201cYou are in danger of becoming paranoid.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been dreaming, she knew, though she couldn\u2019t remember the specifics. She did know that people had been watching her in the dream.</p><p>No, not people.</p><p>Tanner Green.</p><p>She needed to get a life and quit obsessing, she told herself. Sex. That was what Sandra would tell her she needed. A red-hot relationship with a real-life man. She actually laughed as she got out of bed, wondering if a bout of good old-fashioned sex could make her stop seeing a ghost.</p><p>If so, she might have to jump the first stranger she ran into on the street.</p><p>God, no, her situation wasn\u2019t that bad, was it?</p><p>She was, she admitted, actually attracted, both physically and mentally, to Dillon Wolf. Maybe if she...</p><p>No, she would not go there. Eyes straight ahead, that was the ticket. No thoughts of Dillon Wolf\u2014and no ghosts, either.</p><p>She got ready early and left the house, suddenly anxious to be around other people. Her first stop, as it almost always was, would be breakfast with Timothy.</p><p>He greeted her as if he was totally in control of all his faculties, which in fact he was at times. The news was on, and the anchor was talking about the murder at the Sun, then cut away to an interview with a couple who had been in the casino at the time. Jessy was surprised to see her favorite gambler on camera, Coot Calhoun, accompanied by his silver-haired wife, Minnie.</p><p>\u201cIt was like nothing I ever saw before,\u201d Coot said, his Texas accent as broad as always. \u201cFeller just plowed in out of nowhere and fell flat on the table, taking that pretty young thing down with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see where he came from?\u201d the interviewer asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Nothing at all. Feller just plowed through the crowd and died right there on top of that poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she a friend of his? Maybe a girlfriend?\u201d the interviewer pressed.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know about,\u201d Coot said.</p><p>\u201cSo you know the woman?\u201d</p><p>Jessy felt her muscles tense, fear clamping around her throat. But Coot was a gentleman, to the bone.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I never met her before that night. I just told you how it happened, and that\u2019s that. Came after one of the longest runs I\u2019ve ever seen at a craps table, though.\u201d</p><p>The interview ended there, and the anchor announced that she would return after the commercial break.</p><p>\u201cDarnedest thing I ever did hear,\u201d Timothy said, a teasing light entering his bright blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of casinos sending in new folks, hoping to turn the tide when a winning streak goes on too long, but I can\u2019t think of a casino out there that would stoop to killing a man just to stop the game.\u201d</p><p>Jessy gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible. And the winning streak had already ended when it happened.\u201d</p><p>Timothy\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd how would you know that, young lady?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him knowing that she had been desperately playing the last of her reserves to keep him here in the home. She pointed to the television. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said. The man being interviewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still odd as hell. A man with a knife in his back stumbles through a casino\u2014and no one sees where he came from, not even the cameras. Like an inside job of some kind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOr coincidence,\u201d Jessy suggested.</p><p>\u201cCoincidence?\u201d Timothy shook his head. \u201cSomehow, it was all rigged. How or why, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police will find the killer,\u201d Jessy said with far more conviction than she felt. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re looking great, Timothy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, pleased. \u201cI feel great. We\u2019ll go on an adventure soon, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave him a big hug, thrilled with how fully in control of his thoughts he was.</p><p>\u201cSure. A day trip. We\u2019ll plan something fun.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he frowned and wagged a finger at her. \u201cYou be careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d she asked, frowning back at him.</p><p>\u201cThe ghosts,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cThe ghost dancers.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, unnerved. \u201cTimothy, I don\u2019t think any ghost dancers can hurt me, I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Timothy shook his head. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hurt you, they want to help you. The ghost dancers saw their ancestors and spoke with the dead because the dead brought important messages, to those who listened.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cTimothy, listen to me. You know I have tremendous respect for your father\u2019s people and their traditions, but the ghost dancers are a thing of the past, so I wouldn\u2019t suggest putting a lot of faith in them now.\u201d</p> <p>She was surprised when he smiled patiently at her, as if she were a child again. \u201cFaith is the most important thing in the world, Jessy. Faith in oneself, faith in the world, in God, in the Great Spirit. We don\u2019t see everything that happens, but the ghost dancers do.\u201d</p><p>She walked over and kissed him on the forehead, trying not to let him see how much he was upsetting her. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m grateful for my heritage and very proud of it. For now, though, I have to live in the real world and get to work. I love you, and if I get any messages, I know you\u2019ll help me understand them.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, his expression grave. \u201cThere\u2019s danger when the ghost dancers speak, granddaughter, that\u2019s why you have to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Timothy, of course,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>And then she fled.</p><p>Dillon arrived at the executive penthouse at the Big Easy at ten, after calling to make an appointment with Emil Landon. He never slept late, but today, for some inexplicable reason, he had. He\u2019d barely had time to feed the dog and let her out before he had to leave the house.</p> <p>And he didn\u2019t know where the hell Ringo was, other than nowhere nearby, because Ringo definitely would have woken him up.</p><p>He\u2019d been having strange dreams of the maiden again, and he wasn\u2019t sure why. Long ago, when he had first seen her, he\u2019d been convinced that she had come to save his life. He\u2019d been so bitter in those days. Ready for any fight that came along, aching at the loss of his parents\u2014a jailbird about to happen.</p><p>He had no idea what she was trying to tell him now. His dreams were just bits and pieces of confusion, adding up to nothing. Traditionally, the maiden appeared when the tribe had need of her, or when a Native American was in trouble. But Tanner Green had been a Euro-mutt, without a trace of Indian blood.</p><p>Whatever the cause\u2014assuming there even was one\u2014his restless night had imbued the morning with a strange groggy fog of hurrying. He never turned on the television, didn\u2019t even check his e-mail, before he left the house.</p><p>When he was shown into the office promptly at ten, he told Landon he wanted to speak with him alone, then waited patiently while the man made a show of protesting, then gave in and asked his retinue of leggy beauties, along with Hugo Blythe, to wait outside.</p><p>\u201cI think you have a big problem, and I think it\u2019s someone close to you,\u201d Dillon told him bluntly when they were alone at last. There were undoubtedly hidden cameras in the room, and for all he knew it was bugged, as well, but that was a risk he had to take. The cameras were Landon\u2019s choice, and if the man didn\u2019t sweep for bugs...well, there was only so far he could go in getting information to the man.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Landon demanded. It was ten o\u2019clock, but he was still in a dressing gown\u2014cheetah-print silk. He was fit and tanned, a man who had a gym in his penthouse, along with the time to sit out in the sun just the right amount of time to acquire just the right amount of color. His hair was dark\u2014aided by an expensive dye job, Dillon thought\u2014but his face, despite expensive work, was showing signs of wear and tear. He could don the aura of a rich and attractive man, but time and stress were taking their toll.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been questioning the valets, and I\u2019ve interviewed the bellmen and anyone else I could find who was outside when it happened. I\u2019ll start on the inside staff next. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve ID\u2019d the car as a current model white Cadillac limo, and there are only two casinos that use those right now\u2014yours and the Sun. None of the rental companies in the area have one. That suggests to me that you need to watch your associates and employees,\u201d Dillon told him.</p> <p>Landon stared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s it? For what I\u2019m paying you, you come back to me with something like that? A fifty percent possibility at best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said before, feel free to stop paying for my services at any time,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>\u201cI need results. I need to know what the hell got Tanner Green killed. Especially if he found out something about who\u2019s after me. Hell, I need to know anything. Someone out there knows something, and I want you to find out what it is,\u201d Landon said angrily.</p><p>\u201cBe careful in your own house, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got for you so far. What you do with that is your concern,\u201d Dillon told him, standing. \u201cIf you want more, then you damn well need to give me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell more can I give you? Someone is after me. I know it. I don\u2019t know who, but I know I\u2019ve been followed. And now Green is dead. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve got, and if I had more, I\u2019d damn well give it to you, because this is my life I\u2019m trying to preserve,\u201d Emil Landon growled. \u201cFind out what happened to Tanner Green and why, then maybe we\u2019ll know where to look and what the hell is happening. Now get out of here and go do something useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dillon snapped. \u201cI\u2019d like to get your limo to the crime lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy limo!\u201d Emil Landon exploded. \u201cYou\u2019re working for me, remember? Go to the Sun. Check out their fucking limo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that very curious, Mr. Landon. I\u2019d think you\u2019d want to know what was happening in your own backyard,\u201d Dillon commented dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re fired. Your sorry ass is fired,\u201d Landon screeched. \u201cGet out! Get out of my office now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Dillon told him, and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Landon called to him.</p><p>Dillon turned.</p><p>\u201cJust check out their damn limo first, will you?\u201d Landon demanded. \u201cThen...come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a warrant for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a cop. I\u2019m a P.I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, you can get whatever you want, and you damn well know it.\u201d Landon waved a hand in the air in dismissal.</p><p>Had Landon hired him with a hidden agenda? To help him in setting up someone else?</p><p>Dillon walked over to the desk and leaned on it, staring Landon in the eyes. For a moment the casino owner looked afraid. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cBut don\u2019t let me find out that you\u2019re jerking me around. Because when\u2014not if\u2014I find out the truth, if you\u2019re guilty in any way, I\u2019ll make sure you pay the price.\u201d</p><p>He left before Emil Landon could respond to his threat.</p><p>Jessy loved kids. They were so quick to suspend disbelief, and they were delighted with simple things, like chocolates wrapped in gold foil. The pirate show was probably her favorite of all the shows she\u2019d ever done. It never felt old or routine to her.</p><p>But today, while she was once again in the midst of a battle of words, she found herself looking out and seeing the man. Tanner Green.</p><p>Staring at her through the glass.</p><p>She turned away, insisting to herself that he wasn\u2019t there. He couldn\u2019t be there. Tanner Green was dead.</p><p>She focused on her lines and on her fellow actors. She avoided looking past the audience to where she had seen him.</p><p>But she could still feel him watching her.</p><p>She tried hard not to look, but in the end she couldn\u2019t stop herself. Being careful not to lose a beat, she turned to look and was relieved to see that he was gone. So maybe that was the answer. Ignore him. Pretend that she didn\u2019t see him, because, of course, she couldn\u2019t be seeing him.</p><p>Ghosts weren\u2019t real. And if they weren\u2019t real, they couldn\u2019t walk around in human form, staring through glass with a melancholy expression.</p><p>Anyone who thought they saw ghosts was crazy.</p><p>And she was completely and totally sane.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>And totally.</p><p>She forced herself to concentrate on the children\u2019s reactions, on the story she and the rest of the cast were telling, and on the ad-libbing that was so much a part of the show.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t look toward the glass.</p><p>A little girl in the front row held a foil-wrapped chocolate coin, one of the \u201cpieces of eight\u201d the cast gave out. Now Jessy strode toward the girl, saying, \u201cI see treasure, and there\u2019s more to be had!\u201d</p><p>The little girl offered her the chocolate. \u201cAh, no, lassie! That\u2019s your treasure. I be wanting me own!\u201d The kids all laughed, and Jessy smiled and returned to the stage, determined to keep her eyes on the kids and nowhere else.</p><p>\u201cHey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Jim Martin asked, sliding into the booth across from Dillon at the coffee shop just off Paiute land. Like Dillon, he had Paiute in his background; in fact, his brother was an officer with the local tribal police.</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks, and thanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. I don\u2019t work today. Actually, I had to drag myself out of bed to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I needed to get moving. And I\u2019m happy to help out\u2014if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were working, overseeing the croupiers, when Tanner Green died,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was.\u201d Jim shook his head. \u201cI was there, and I didn\u2019t see a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably should have seen him stumbling through the crowd. It was weird, though. I mean, wouldn\u2019t you think he\u2019d have been trying to get help? I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t grab someone outside, or in the crowd. But he made it all the way over to the table. The thing is, I had just come on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had just come on duty. Darrell Frye was on before me. He went on break, and I came on just as things were going down, and I didn\u2019t notice because I was busy getting a feel for what was going on. There\u2019s huge money out there on those tables, you know. And we\u2019re responsible for making sure everything runs smoothly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for coming to talk to me,\u201d Dillon told him a few minutes later, after they\u2019d run through the events of Green\u2019s death again, just to be sure they hadn\u2019t missed something. \u201cI appreciate it. I\u2019ll find Darrell Frye and see if he can remember anything about what happened before you got there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. You\u2019d think someone would have noticed something. Green sure took one hell of a long walk with a knife in his back. Maybe he was stoned or something and didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d been stabbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was,\u201d Dillon said. Not only would that explain why he had stumbled through the crowd, half-dead, without stopping someone and begging for help, it could explain his confusion and fear as a ghost.</p><p>The minute James left, Dillon put in a call to Cheever, cursing the fact that he needed to go through the proper channels if he wanted to remain in the loop.</p><p>He was given the runaround for several minutes, but if there was one stereotype he rather liked, it had to do with the belief that men of Indian blood were stoic. Determined. He kept that thought in mind as he waited, and eventually Jerry Cheever came on the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the cop asked, and Dillon wasn\u2019t sure if the question held annoyance or curiosity.</p> <p>\u201cI was anxious to see if the autopsy report was in on Tanner Green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAutopsy report? You were there\u2014the man had a knife in his back,\u201d Cheever said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dillon said with an edge. \u201cAnd a man with a knife in his back would want it out, I imagine. Wouldn\u2019t you think he\u2019d approach the nearest person and ask for help? Unless he was disoriented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA knife in his back would make him disoriented\u2014wouldn\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stumbled like a drunk man. Or someone who had been drugged,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you. I\u2019m sure the morgue ran a basic tox screen. If not, I\u2019ll see that they do,\u201d Cheever said.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Dillon was pretty sure Cheever muttered something as he hung up. Whether he was irritated for not having figured out himself that Green might have been drugged, or if he was just annoyed that his superiors had told him he had to work with a private investigator, Dillon couldn\u2019t tell. And he didn\u2019t really care, as long as the man followed through.</p><p>There had been other witnesses that night, of course, and it would be interesting to find out what they had to say. Especially Darrell Frye, the pit boss who had been in charge, only to disappear just when Tanner Green had stumbled in. Not that there was necessarily anything suspicious about that. People went on break all the time.</p><p>But it was possible that the limo had belonged to the Sun, and that might make Frye\u2019s whereabouts relevant. He took a stroll over to the casino, and was told that Darrell Frye wasn\u2019t working, that in fact he was taking some vacation time.</p><p>Back out front, Dillon asked for Rudy Yorba.</p><p>He was startled when the woman at valet parking sucked in her breath and stared at him in horror. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I guess you haven\u2019t heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRudy\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dillon said, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead. Hit-and-run last night. It\u2019s so terrible! It\u2019s been all over the news the last few hours. He was walking along the shoulder of the highway when he was hit and thrown down an embankment.... No one even found the body until a few hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Dillon winced inwardly. He always listened to the news, but he\u2019d woken up so late this morning that he hadn\u2019t even turned on the TV. And Cheever might have heard about it, but he wouldn\u2019t have thought about saying anything because he wouldn\u2019t have seen the connection.</p><p>\u201cMy God. No, I\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t seen the news today.\u201d</p><p>The woman shook her head sadly. \u201cHe was killed not five miles from his home. It\u2019s just so sad. They think he was struck on his way home last night. A guy driving out to Lake Mead saw the vultures, so he went to see what they were so interested in, found the body and called the police out. It\u2019s just so awful, everything that\u2019s going on around here. First that bodyguard, and now Rudy...it\u2019s just tragic.\u201d</p><p>Dillon thanked her and turned away.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just tragic. It was criminal.</p><p>6</p><p>Backstage, before she even got out of her costume and makeup, Jessy called Sandra and arranged to go to the movies. Anything to take her mind off what was going on. Not only that, she didn\u2019t want to drive, because she was afraid of what she would do if she looked out the window and saw Tanner Green. Luckily Sandra had no objection to picking her up, and she sang to herself all the way home, thinking that might keep any ghosts at bay. Whatever the reason, she made it home without incident.</p><p>She and Sandra pulled up at almost the same moment.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d Sandra told her with the comfortable bluntness that came from years of close friendship.</p><p>\u201cI know. I didn\u2019t sleep well,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrightened? Of what?\u201d Jessy asked warily.</p><p>\u201cWell, of whoever killed Tanner Green thinking you could recognize him and coming after you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jessy responded immediately, glad the possibility hadn\u2019t occurred to her earlier. \u201cI mean, if I knew anything, I would have told the police, and the person would already have been arrested. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. If the police could figure out who he was from your description.\u201d</p><p>Jessy stared at her. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sandra said, then forced a reassuring smile and asked, \u201cHey, what happened to tall, dark and very handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly who I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dillon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Oh-Dillon. What\u2019s up? What happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what happened to him? To the best of my knowledge, he\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to him again?\u201d Sandra sounded dismayed.</p><p>\u201cActually, I have. He took me to dinner last night after the show.\u201d</p><p>Sandra stared at her in total exasperation. \u201cHonestly, Jessy, if for no reason other than self-preservation, you should be hanging with that hunk of lean, mean security right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra, I am not going to hang with a guy just for protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have done worse,\u201d Sandra said with a shrug. \u201cWait, I have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason you\u2019re steering clear of him. Of all men. Because I know you\u2019re attracted to him,\u201d Sandra accused. \u201cThe thing is, you\u2019re chicken, and you have been for as long as I\u2019ve known you. You\u2019re afraid of being hurt, so you push guys away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have responsibilities,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses. You have a grandfather who loves you. He suffers from being old, but so do lots of people. The whole human race comes with baggage, Jessy, but if you let yourself be scared of every guy out there because you\u2019re defensive about Timothy, you\u2019re turning him into a brick around your neck, which he\u2019s not\u2014and I know you don\u2019t really think he is, either. You\u2019re afraid someone else wouldn\u2019t love him the way you do, and that\u2019s not fair to Mr. Oh-Dillon or anyone else, or to Timothy himself. So start trusting someone, or else you\u2019re actually hurting Timothy yourself.\u201d</p><p>To Sandra\u2019s credit, Jessy saw the truth in her friend\u2019s words and was appalled at herself. \u201cIt\u2019s not Timothy. I know he\u2019s a gift in my life. And it isn\u2019t a lack of trust in humanity, or not only that. It\u2019s also a lack of time. Only it isn\u2019t any of those things with Dillon Wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do think he\u2019s hot,\u201d Sandra said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an attractive man,\u201d Jessy said evasively.</p><p>\u201cYes, so...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, honestly? First off, he hasn\u2019t asked me on a date. He wants information, that\u2019s all. Second, I\u2019m still not sure about his job and who he works for. It seems as if he answers me honestly, that he likes and respects the man he works for, and that everything\u2019s on the up-and-up, but...I still don\u2019t understand exactly what he does, what he has done, why he\u2019s here.... I mean, Dillon claims there\u2019s nothing shady about what\u2019s going on, but what is Harrison Investigations, exactly? How is that no one seems to know anything about it even though he says it\u2019s all out in the open, but somehow he has access to cops who don\u2019t really want him butting in? I don\u2019t get it. Who are these people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sounding panicky,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not panicky, I\u2019m concerned. I just want to know who he really is and understand what\u2019s going on. So...what are they? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhost hunters. Real ones,\u201d Sandra said soberly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jessy demanded. \u201cGhost hunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s not what they call themselves. But it\u2019s what they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I read,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>Jessy frowned. \u201cHey, I read all the time.\u201d</p><p>Sandra laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not casting aspersions. I read People cover to cover, too. But I did some research when the whole Harrison Investigations thing was first mentioned, and what I found was pretty interesting. Adam Harrison declines interviews, and says he and his people are just like any other investigators. But...hang on. I had a feeling you\u2019d be interested, so I brought a few things with me.\u201d Sandra reached into her huge tote and pulled out several magazines. \u201cRead these.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first magazine was a sensationalist rag. The headline read, Elvis never died. He was just recalled to his ship!</p><p>Jessy stared at Sandra, arching a brow.</p><p>\u201cOh, ignore that,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cGo to page four.\u201d</p> <p>Jessy flipped through to an article about a ghost in the D.C. house of one of North Dakota\u2019s state senators. Harrison Investigations had been called in, only to report that the \u201ceerie noises\u201d and weird happenings in the historic home were being caused by a nest of squirrels\u2014and an unhappy constituent who had managed to get a job as a housekeeper for the senator. The reporter claimed to know, however, that the house had been haunted by a man shot in a quarrel after the Lincoln assassination for insisting that Dr. Samuel Mudd had treated John Wilkes Booth\u2019s leg as he would have any patient\u2019s, unaware that Booth had just killed the president. The reporter was certain that a member of Harrison Investigations had assured the ghost that Mudd\u2014and he\u2014had been vindicated, and the ghost had moved on.</p><p>Jessy stared at Sandra. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck this one out, then.\u201d</p><p>She handed Jessy another magazine, a respected news weekly, which carried an article about the same incident and mentioned several others, finishing by saying, Whatever the problem\u2014wildlife, pranksters or even revenants with a grudge\u2014Harrison Investigations seems capable of solving the problem, quietly and without fanfare.</p><p>\u201cSo they investigate squirrels,\u201d Jessy said irritably.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re ghost busters,\u201d Sandra said firmly.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, it just proves my point exactly. Do I really want to get involved with a whack job who thinks investigating ghosts is the way to solve a crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hopeless,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cDon\u2019t get involved with him, then. Have sex. Maybe even let him be a friend\u2014with benefits. But stop spending your life in a funk, doing nothing but working, eating a TV dinner, going to bed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never eat TV dinners,\u201d Jessy protested.</p><p>Sandra ignored her. \u201cAnd visiting Timothy. And frankly, hanging out with a nice strong guy would be a pretty good idea, if you ask me, because I think you should be afraid. That guy didn\u2019t die from having too much fun. He was murdered. Knifed in the back. And like it or not, you\u2019re connected to his death. The more I think about it, the scarier I think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you, trying to scare me like this?\u201d Jessy demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out for your welfare,\u201d Sandra told her.</p><p>\u201cBy scaring me to death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dead, so apparently my evil plan didn\u2019t work. But I still think you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Sandra said, nodding to show how serious she was.</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to get...involved with a man who might be crazy,\u201d Jessy accused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you want, and you know it,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>Jessy groaned and changed the subject. \u201cAre we seeing a movie or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a new horror\u2014\u201d Sandra began.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Jessy said.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sandra teased. \u201cHow about that new cops film?\u201d</p><p>They agreed, then moved on to wrangling over what restaurant to go to as they left.</p><p>Dillon arrived at the crime lab just as the shift was changing, was hoping to find an old friend, Wally Valdez.</p><p>The first thing he had done after hearing about Rudy Yorba\u2019s death to was call Jerry Cheever and suggest it was too much of a coincidence not to be connected, even revealing the fact that he had talked to Rudy shortly before he was killed. Cheever told him that they had already checked out Rudy\u2019s car, which had been found parked on the side of the highway. It had been out of gas, plain and simple. Some cowardly drunk was probably busy, even now, praying that he wasn\u2019t somehow traced.</p><p>\u201cYou got anything to go on?\u201d Dillon had demanded.</p><p>Cheever had grown impatient at that point, stressing that it wasn\u2019t his case and was being handled as accidental vehicular homicide. His own hackles had been raised by Cheever\u2019s attitude, keeping him from being totally forthcoming when Cheever demanded to know what Yorba had told him.</p><p>As soon as they\u2019d hung up, he\u2019d come here.</p><p>As he was asking after Wally, Sarah Clay, the woman who had helped him with the video the day before, appeared in the reception area.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cJust looking for a friend, Wally Valdez. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cActually, what are you doing here? I thought you worked over at the station.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled. \u201cActually, I\u2019m usually here. I was just called in to work with the casino tapes. Anyway, Wally is off tonight, but he\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d She paused and looked thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cWally says you\u2019re one of the good guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIf I can help you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer. It\u2019s nothing to do with the casino tapes, actually. I\u2019m here because of the hit-and-run last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rudy Yorba case,\u201d she said somberly.</p><p>\u201cRight. It just seems odd to me that Rudy Yorba, who happened to be parking cars at the Sun when Green was killed, managed to run out of gas and end up struck by a hit-and-run driver in the middle of the night. Even in Vegas, that\u2019s a quiet time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are always lots of drunks behind the wheel in this town, though,\u201d Sarah told him.</p><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s quite a coincidence, don\u2019t you think? Two dead in two days, and both deaths connected to the same casino?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say our non-natural death rate was so low that that seemed weird to me,\u201d Sarah told him gravely, \u201cbut it\u2019s not. One murder, one accident. A pretty normal ratio around here, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...I questioned Rudy about what had happened the night Green died just hours before he was killed. Have the investigators come up with anything yet? Any clue at all?\u201d</p><p>She studied him gravely for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything yet, and it\u2019s not my case. But I can try to find out what\u2019s going on, and I\u2019ll be able to give you what we get on paint evidence, if nothing else. I think they were able to find a few chips on the body,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I have something. Just give me a number. I did hear that the cop on the case has been calling body shops, and no one has come in with a damaged car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate it.\u201d He gave her one of his cards, then turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cHe was struck really hard,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He turned back to look at her. She had large brown eyes and a heart-shaped faced, and, despite the scrubs she was now wearing over her uniform, she was a beautiful young woman, one who right now looked not just sad but worried.</p><p>\u201cAs if there was something personal? As if he was struck on purpose?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn my mind, yes,\u201d she said decisively. \u201cHow do you hit a man hard enough to break just about every bone in his body\u2014and not crash into the guardrail or go over the embankment yourself? Especially if you\u2019re a drunk, so your reflexes are slow?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not high enough in the force for anyone to want my opinion, but that\u2019s my take on the situation. If you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. And thank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>He was pretty sure she was actually flirting with him then. And she was certainly attractive, bright and intriguing.</p><p>He was working, he reminded himself.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what caused him to ignore the signals and courteously extend his thanks one last time, then walk away.</p><p>It was the memory of a woman with deep cobalt eyes and a mane of sunset hair.</p><p>Sandra was quiet as they drove back to Jessy\u2019s house after their night out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jessy asked her.</p><p>\u201cWant to come and stay with me?\u201d Sandra asked.</p><p>Yes, I do, Jessy thought, surprising herself.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t going to abandon her home. If she did, she might never have the nerve to go back.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d She frowned. Sandra was actually looking worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit I was trying to get to you before. But now...I think I\u2019ve managed to actually scare myself over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an alarm,\u201d Jessy reminded her. \u201cAnd if someone was really afraid I knew something, they\u2019d have to know I\u2019d have spilled it by now, right? Haven\u2019t we already figured all that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But if you need anything, call me.\u201d Sandra paused, then added, \u201cHell, if you\u2019re really scared, dial 911. Fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I will,\u201d Jessy assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in with you,\u201d Sandra volunteered.</p><p>They walked through the house together, Sandra brandishing one of her spiked heels like a weapon, just in case they surprised an intruder.</p><p>But the house was empty. Not that Jessy had ever thought there was actually someone there.</p><p>Not a living someone, anyway.</p><p>She told Sandra good-night, then silently repeated her new mantra. Look straight ahead. No peripheral vision allowed. Do not make eye contact.</p><p>She hummed loudly, and blasted her television as she made a cup of tea and got ready for bed.</p><p>Even in bed, she kept humming.</p><p>Like any private detective, Dillon had picked up a few tricks in his day.</p><p>And since Cheever had informed him that he didn\u2019t have enough to go to the ADA and ask for a search warrant, Dillon had decided that he had to take matters into his own hands. In fact, Cheever had said, \u201cIt\u2019s nuts. Cops have to follow certain rules and the public doesn\u2019t. Some things just suck.\u201d</p><p>Dillon had taken that to mean that Cheever was all for him doing a few things that skirted the wrong side of the law.</p><p>Limos were often sitting just outside the entrances of the various hotels and casinos, awaiting the pleasure of some newly flush high roller. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But a walk along the Strip showed him that neither the Sun nor the Big Easy currently had its latest-model white super-stretch out front. A few casual questions to the right people elicited the information that both limos were at a garage for maintenance. Interesting coincidence, that.</p><p>A few more questions gave him the name of the garage each casino used. The same name both times. Another interesting coincidence.</p><p>The garage wasn\u2019t open when he swung by, not that he had expected it to be. It was surrounded by a high fence with a barbed-wire coil along the top, but it wasn\u2019t electrified.</p> <p>Two Dobermans guarded the premises instead.</p><p>After a quick stop at a nearby supermarket, he headed back to the garage. He opted to park on the road that ran behind the property, then dodged the traffic and crossed the median to reach the rear of the establishment. There, he waited for the dogs to appear. It wasn\u2019t a long wait. He spoke to them as they approached, concentrating on the tone of his voice as he lured them over for the meat he\u2019d purchased. He hadn\u2019t drugged it; he was counting on his ability to befriend the dogs. He was patient, feeding them, talking to them. He slipped his hand through the wire, touching them, still reassuring them. Finally, he climbed the fence, crossing carefully over the barbed wire. One of the dogs started to snarl, but he spoke to it firmly, and the snarl became a whine. He patted both dogs as he walked slowly through the lot toward the garage itself, encouraging the animals to accompany him.</p><p>There was no alarm on the door to the garage itself, and the lock was easy to pick. The owners apparently had a lot of faith in their dogs. Then again, a garage wasn\u2019t usually a prime target for thieves.</p><p>It took a while for his eyes to adjust to the dim light, but after that it was easy to find the two super-stretches. He was dismayed to see that both had just received new paint jobs. It was easy enough to identify which limo went to which casino, though, thanks to the vanity plates. Sun 1 and Big E were pretty damn obvious.</p><p>He wore thin plastic gloves, to keep his own prints out of the equation, just in case the limos become part of an investigation.</p> <p>Neither one appeared to have been involved in the kind of accident that would have killed someone. The paint was fresh, but neither vehicle appeared to have had any bodywork done, not that he thought the murderer would have been sloppy enough to use the same vehicle twice.</p><p>A thorough inspection of the Sun\u2019s limo yielded nothing. He was sure no obvious blood spill would have been left behind for the cops or anyone else to find, but he\u2019d come prepared. A spray of Luminol and a small black light showed no signs of bloodshed, either.</p><p>It was possible, though, that the knife itself would have temporarily sealed the wound, but he searched thoroughly anyway. In the end, he found nothing, not only no blood, but no sign of bleaching to remove blood, either.</p><p>Lots of semen, though.</p><p>He moved on to the limo from the Big Easy.</p><p>Once again, both his first inspection and then a spray of Luminol showed nothing. Not a speck of blood, and no hint of bleaching. But as he ran his fingers along the upholstery next to the right-hand passenger door, he found something else, maybe something just as good.</p> <p>It looked like a button from a designer shirt. He studied it in the narrow beam of his small flashlight and wondered if Tanner Green had been missing a button when he died. That would be easy enough to ascertain. He pulled out his phone and took a quick picture of the button, then returned it to where he had found it.</p><p>One of the Dobermans was starting to whine.</p><p>Dillon quickly flicked off his light, then quietly stepped out of the limo and closed the door softly behind himself, as both dogs raced toward the door, which he had left slightly ajar.</p><p>Someone was coming in. He cursed himself for not having heard signs of movement earlier, but it seemed that whoever was arriving had come in as stealthily as he had himself.</p><p>He rolled under the BMW parked beside the limo, and did his best to look and sound like a slab of cement floor.</p><p>\u201cIdiots left the door open,\u201d a man noted irritably. \u201cFat lot of good you friggin\u2019 dogs were doing, sleeping in here.\u201d</p><p>Hugo Blythe, Emil Landon\u2019s surviving bodyguard.</p><p>Dillon rolled again, moving from car to car, making his way toward the door\u2014which, luckily, Blythe had also left open\u2014as the other man made his way straight to the limo Dillon had just exited.</p> <p>The dogs, thankfully, were following Blythe, tails tucked as they whined nervously. Apparently they knew the man. Maybe Emil Landon did business with the garage that went beyond having his vehicles serviced here. The dogs knew Hugo Blythe. And they didn\u2019t love him, they feared him.</p><p>Mulling over the possible meanings of that knowledge, Dillon slipped under the car parked closest to the rear door and watched as Blythe entered the limo.</p><p>Then he made his escape.</p><p>He raced for the fence, scaled it quickly and had just leaped free of the barbed wire and landed hard, rolling to mitigate the impact, when he heard the first shot.</p><p>It was followed quickly by a second.</p><p>Blythe was running in his direction as he fired again.</p><p>Dillon sprang to a crouch and ran.</p><p>Luckily Blythe was lumbering and slow. Dillon made it to the road and crossed the flow of traffic. He was in his own car and rejoining the stream of traffic before Blythe ever made it to the fence.</p><p>Jessy became aware that she was dreaming somewhere in the middle of her dream.</p><p>She was back at the Sun, which was as crowded as always, and she was being chased. She was weaving through the crowd and between the tables, craps tables, poker tables, roulette tables. She was inside, but there was a low ground fog, which she knew was ridiculous. Fog didn\u2019t rise inside. Fog was for outside.</p><p>Suddenly she\u2014and the fog\u2014were outside. Now she was being chased around a cemetery. But it wasn\u2019t an ordinary cemetery. It was like Boot Hill. Old West cemeteries didn\u2019t have fine marble markers. The crosses were wooden and primitively made, the graves surrounded by stones.</p><p>Sagebrush danced by in a breeze she couldn\u2019t feel. The dust of the desert seemed to choke her, then die away in a fog that couldn\u2019t\u2014shouldn\u2019t\u2014be in such a dry place.</p><p>And from the distance, she could hear the buzzers and bells of the casino. She could see a poker table....</p><p>There were men around it, but something wasn\u2019t right about them. They weren\u2019t real. They were part of the fog. And they were dressed in old railway frock coats and dusty old hats. She could hear the faint sound of a tinkly old-time piano.</p><p>She needed to stay away from the poker players; somehow she knew that. So she veered away, and then, though she was still in a cemetery, it wasn\u2019t the one she had just run through but a Native American burial ground, where the dead had been placed high above the ground on wooden platforms, wrapped in their best furs, with their spears, arrows, quivers and buffalo-skin shields left to hang at their sides. The rows of scaffolds that marked the graves seemed to stretch on forever, but she was sure it was better to run between them than toward the poker players.</p><p>The mist rose around her, but it was thin enough that she could peer through it and see Dillon Wolf standing there, wearing a long black frock coat and somehow seeming to be one with the burial ground, the dead and the past.</p><p>She shook her head, because she didn\u2019t want to be part of that world.</p><p>But she did want to touch him. She wanted to reach out and touch him, see the heated gaze of his eyes and feel the slow stroke of his hands on her skin. Despite the situation, the location, he wasn\u2019t afraid, and she sensed that if she could find the courage to run to him, she wouldn\u2019t be afraid, either. She would find security and more, because the light in his eyes was like a promise. Even then, even in a dream and surrounded by mist, she wanted to join him, to know his touch. She almost literally burned to move closer.</p><p>Yet something in her was still afraid. She didn\u2019t quite have the courage to breach the chasm\u2014of age, experience, power\u2014that lay between them.</p><p>He was one with the mist, knew the souls that rested there.</p><p>And she was still being pursued.</p><p>She could hear men behind her, their voices growing louder as they drew closer, and though she didn\u2019t know what they were saying, she knew that they represented a real and imminent danger.</p><p>They wanted her dead.</p><p>She turned away, too afraid to go forward, and angled to the west. She had to escape both the promise and the fear.</p><p>She heard a jingling, like spurs....</p><p>But when she looked back, the men coming after her were wearing suits and could have stepped off the floor of any of the casinos, except that their faces were shrouded by the eerie fog that continued to rise and thickened strangely to hide their features....</p><p>She turned in absolute terror to run again.</p><p>And then Timothy was standing right in front of her. \u201cTrust in the ghost dancers!\u201d he cried. His arms were open, as if to catch her in his safe embrace, and he looked as young and strong as he had been for so much of her life. He was a bastion of safety against the danger that was nipping at her heels. \u201cThe ghost dancers speak with the dead, and the dead will give them the answers they need. They see what was, and they can help stop what must never come to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy, there are no ghost dancers anymore,\u201d she told him. \u201cThey failed. The words they heard weren\u2019t true, and they died as they tried to restore tribal control to their former lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must listen, and listen well,\u201d he went on, ignoring her outburst. \u201cYou must let yourself hear the truth. We must all hear what they are saying, not drown them out because of what we want to hear.\u201d</p><p>She woke up abruptly.</p><p>Or did she?</p><p>Was she really awake? Or was she still trapped in her nightmare?</p><p>For there, sitting at the end of her bed, was a man.</p><p>A dead man.</p><p>Tanner Green.</p><p>She drew a gasping breath...and screamed.</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right; I got rid of him.\u201d</p><p>Startled awake, Dillon blinked into the first pink stages of early-morning sunlight to see Ringo standing over him.</p><p>Dillon jerked to a sitting position. \u201cWhere the hell have you been? And...got rid of whom? What happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ringo perched at the foot of the bed, dusting off his hat on his knee and shaking his head in disgust. \u201cTanner Green. Was that guy really supposed to be some kind of scary bodyguard? Because he\u2019s a pussy, a wuss, as you guys say these days. All I have to do is jingle my spurs and he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to go away\u2014I want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Before or after he gives Jessy Sparhawk a heart attack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hell. What happened, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s following her like some lovesick calf. He was just sitting in her room, and when she woke up and saw him, I thought she might have a coronary on the spot. So I stepped up. He disappeared. She blinked. Got up, made coffee, and sat in the living room staring at the television, only the television wasn\u2019t on. After a while, the sun started coming up, and it seemed like she was all right, so I came back over here to tell you what was going on. Hey, did you hear about the guy who was killed in a hit-and-run? He worked at the Sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I know where the car Tanner Green might have been pushed out of might have come from because of the guy who was killed in that hit-and-run.\u201d</p><p>Ringo swore softly. \u201cSo he was murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe told you about the car\u2014and then he was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. And I know you. It\u2019s eating you alive, right?\u201d</p><p>Dillon nodded. \u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know whether the fact that he spoke to me had anything to do with it, or whether the killer already suspected he had seen something and might mention it to someone.\u201d He sighed deeply and repeated, \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he gave you a clue on the car? At least there\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a limo. And I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve been in it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you still seem to be all in one piece,\u201d Ringo commented. \u201cSo\u2014who killed Tanner Green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know, but it might have been someone from the Big Easy. I need to find out more before I bring the cops in, or the evidence will be gone, and I won\u2019t have enough so someone can be charged with a crime and hauled in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you found blood?\u201d Ringo asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I found a button.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA button. Wow,\u201d Ringo said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly\u2014I need more. And you need to get back over to Jessy\u2019s place,\u201d Dillon said, frowning. He wanted to get to the crime lab and find out if Tanner Green had been missing a button from his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a ghost,\u201d Ringo reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes, and...?\u201d Dillon said dryly, returning the sarcasm.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to get over to Jessy\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRingo, I\u2019m worried about her, but I can\u2019t go where I\u2019m not wanted,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cOr at least not invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get that woman to talk to you,\u201d Ringo said, looking at him seriously. \u201cShe\u2019s...she could wind up in trouble. She could wind up being hurt.\u201d</p><p>She could wind up being dead.</p><p>The thought rose silently between them.</p><p>A strong sense of unease swept through Dillon. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know Tanner Green. She has nothing to do with what\u2019s going on. And there would have been no reason for her to know Rudy Yorba, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019re convinced that Tanner Green said something to her before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he did. I saw the tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther people have seen that tape,\u201d Ringo pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOther people? Cops. Jerry Cheever can be a jerk, but I\u2019d swear he\u2019s an honest cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he is. But it\u2019s a big police force. Someone else could be on the take. And there\u2019s big money floating around this town. Most men have a price they\u2019re willing to do just about anything for.\u201d</p><p>Dillon was feeling worried enough about Jessy. He didn\u2019t need Ringo giving him this guilt trip, especially when there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do. He couldn\u2019t force Jessy Sparhawk to see him. She\u2019d only agreed to talk to him the first time to be polite. If he was too persistent, he might never get close to her.</p><p>\u201cCall her,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>\u201cRingo, it isn\u2019t 7:00 a.m. yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would practically be lunchtime out on a ranch,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t a ranch, this is Vegas, and I need you to get back over to her place. Now. Watch over her, Ringo. Somehow\u2014today\u2014I\u2019ll find a way to see her. To make her trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a dead man. She\u2019s going to need flesh and blood to help her against the danger that\u2019s out there now.\u201d</p><p>Jessy sat in front of the television, shivering. She was even too afraid to go and take a shower.</p><p>She turned on the news, but she hardly paid any attention to the national news.</p><p>She was too busy wondering if she could somehow manage to get dressed, or if she would see another ghostly image and end up fleeing out the front door in her nightshirt and bare feet.</p><p>The local news drew her attention, though, when the picture of a gaunt young man filled the screen. She didn\u2019t recognize him, but according to the newscaster his name was Rudy Yorba, and he was dead, the victim of a hit-and-run after he had left work two nights ago.</p><p>The news anchor went on to say that this particular crime was particularly troubling because the victim had been working for the Sun, the casino that had been the site of the murder of Tanner Green just one night earlier. The police were asking anyone with information that might pertain to the accident to call their local precinct.</p><p>There were no ghosts on the screen, just an anchor-man. And there didn\u2019t seem to be any ghosts hanging around the house, either. Even so, she wanted to scream and go running from the house.</p><p>She stood up decisively. She had to get ready and get out. Get close to people. Lots of them.</p><p>She kept her eyes straight ahead as she hurried into her bedroom, gathered her clothing and locked herself in the bathroom. She soaped and rinsed in record time, then dried herself off furiously, brushed her hair and teeth, and managed a minimum of makeup.</p><p>Then she left the house in a rush.</p><p>She burst into Timothy\u2019s building, then stopped to give herself a firm mental shake. Maybe she should have gone for therapy after what had happened. Maybe she was suffering from some kind of civilian post-traumatic stress disorder and that was why she kept seeing the dead man.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here early,\u201d Jimmy, the orderly, said, smiling, looking normal and reassuring in his scrubs. Seeing him, Jessy instantly felt as if the world was returning to normal.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I woke up early,\u201d she said, \u201cso I thought I\u2019d have breakfast with Timothy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on ahead. He\u2019s in the breakfast room, sitting with Mrs. Teasdale.\u201d Jimmy winked playfully.</p><p>She had to laugh. Her grandfather was quite the ladies\u2019 man when he chose. \u201cThanks, I\u2019ll go up.\u201d</p><p>The television was on in the breakfast room, and the 8:00 a.m. news was on. She saw Rudy Yorba\u2019s face on the screen again, with the anchor repeating the police request for anyone with information to call them.</p><p>Timothy saw Jessy as she approached the table and rose with a surprised smile. \u201cGranddaughter. So early. It\u2019s a delight to see you. You know Mrs. Teasdale, of course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. How are you, Mrs. Teasdale?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mrs. Teasdale had suffered a stroke, followed by a heart attack, but she\u2019d worked like a trouper to walk and talk again, and she had done very well. She was immensely wealthy, but her family lived on the East Coast. They had tried to get her to move East to be nearer to them, but she had decided that she was never leaving the home. She and Timothy were great friends, and Jessy was pretty sure that \u201cfriendship\u201d was behind the older woman\u2019s decision.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, dear, but the news is just so distressing these days. That gangster or bodyguard, the other night...that was one thing. Live by the sword, die by the sword.\u201d She waved a jeweled hand toward the TV. \u201cBut now this poor young fellow...He lived by parking cars, and he died after being hit by a car. It\u2019s not a totally accurate analogy, I suppose, but still, it\u2019s awfully ironic. And sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d Jessy agreed. \u201cThe police try very hard to crack down on drunk driving, but they can\u2019t catch everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t listen,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cThey don\u2019t listen to the wind. There are signs, but no one pays attention.\u201d</p><p>Jessy almost groaned aloud. If there was one day when she didn\u2019t want to hear Timothy talk about ghost dancers or people in the walls or talking in the wind, it was today.</p><p>It would be better if her ghost were in the wall or drifting in the wind. But no, her ghost had to sit at the foot of her bed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not dwell on sad thoughts,\u201d Mrs. Teasdale said. \u201cHow are you, Jessy? How\u2019s that pirate show of yours going? Did Timothy ever tell you? I was a showgirl once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Timothy told me,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cI had a twin sister back then,\u201d Mrs. Teasdale said wistfully, a sad smile curving her lips. \u201cSerena. We were identical, but, oh, what fire she had! I went on to marry Roger\u2014though, sadly, we had no children. Serena burned up the Strip all by her lonesome for another decade, then went on to marry and have four boys. I\u2019m blessed, though. With Roger gone, the boys are very good to me.\u201d</p><p>That was it! Jessy thought suddenly. Tanner Green had been a twin. She had seen his twin walking around town, and maybe the twin had even been drawn to keep an eye on her because of her involvement with his brother\u2019s death. Stranger things had happened. Twins had a special bond, or so she had always heard.</p><p>Of course the twin hadn\u2019t been in her house. That had been a trick of her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have Jessy. And the ghost dancers, of course,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cJessy, one of these days, I want to go out to Mallaluca and see the family. Maybe we could go out for a festival, and show Sally here the Ghost Dance?\u201d Timothy said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jessy said. Mallaluca, the town where some of his distant relatives still lived, was only a few hours away. \u201cThat would be lovely. I\u2019ll look into some dates.\u201d She stood, her intention of staying for breakfast forgotten now, suddenly anxious to drive down to the police station and find someone who could tell her more about Tanner Green. She kissed Timothy on the cheek and offered Mrs. Teasdale a broad smile. \u201cYou two have a nice day. Timothy, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>She barely said goodbye to Jimmy, she was so anxious to leave. And yet, even as she drove, she felt her heart sinking.</p> <p>Surely if Tanner Green had a twin someone would have mentioned it. She had to know for sure, though. Because if Tanner Green did have a twin, then maybe she could begin to be...</p><p>Sane.</p><p>Dressed and ready to leave the house, Dillon paused when the newscaster started talking about Rudy Yorba.</p><p>He tried to tell himself that the younger man\u2019s death was nothing but coincidence. Even after more than twenty-four hours, the police still had no leads, and they were asking the public to notify them if they saw a newly damaged vehicle or had any other information that might aid the investigation into the accident in any way.</p><p>Accident, hell. He\u2019d been questioning Rudy, and now he was dead. The victim of a mysterious hit-and-run. That was no coincidence.</p> <p>He left his house and headed to the police station, where he found Jerry Cheever in his office. The detective seemed both disturbed and surprised when Dillon started asking what was going on with the Rudy Yorba case.</p><p>\u201cWe went through this yesterday,\u201d Cheever reminded him.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>Jerry groaned. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s not my case,\u201d Jerry told him. \u201cI know you have a bug up your ass about this case, but it makes no sense. What could his death have to do with Tanner Green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, I questioned Rudy Yorba about Green right before he was killed,\u201d Dillon told him. He had no intention of telling Cheever yet that he\u2019d also broken into a garage based on the information Rudy had given him, even if Cheever had basically suggested it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jerry, what would the man have been doing walking along the highway that late?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe ran out of gas, sweet and simple. He was probably walking to the off-ramp, looking for a gas station,\u201d Jerry explained.</p><p>\u201cNo AAA?\u201d Dillon demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, not in his wallet, anyway. There\u2019s just no mystery here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I think there is. These days, everyone has a cell phone, and cars come with roadside assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drove an old car. And without AAA, who was he going to call? A drunk hit him, got scared and drove away. Come on, Dillon, not everything is a conspiracy.\u201d Jerry ran his fingers through his hair, shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t I wish this was all related, that somewhere there\u2019s a clue that would give me some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything?\u201d Dillon demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my case. I\u2019ve told you that. Go check with vehicular homicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheever, what the hell kind of a cop are you?\u201d Dillon demanded.</p> <p>For a moment Jerry Cheever seemed about to explode in turn, but then he looked down, gritted his teeth, then looked up again. \u201cIt\u2019s departmental organization, and that\u2019s just the way it is. But go and talk to Len Durso. He and his partner got the call. They\u2019re top-notch, and so are the crime-scene team, who\u2019ve inspected the body, his clothing, the road, you name it. If there is a connection, I sure as hell pray they\u2014we\u2014find it.\u201d</p><p>Dillon realized that Cheever was looking past him, frowning slightly as he peered through the glass windows of his office.</p><p>Dillon swung around and groaned softly. Jessy Sparhawk was standing just outside. Her eyes widened as she saw him, and for a moment he thought she was going to turn around and leave. But she didn\u2019t. Blue eyes wide and captivatingly innocent, she stood her ground. Dillon felt his heart surge and silently cursed himself, wondering again just what it was about this woman that he found so compelling.</p><p>He stood as Jerry strode across the room and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t mean to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon was just leaving,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>Dillon thought about finding a way to stay, then opted not to. She was going to have to decide that she needed to open up to him. She was going to have to trust him.</p><p>Besides, if she wanted to speak privately to Cheever, well...</p><p>Ringo could listen in and tell him if there was anything he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cJessy,\u201d he acknowledged politely, and left, deciding he might as well make good use of the time. He headed down the hall to ask the desk sergeant where he could find Detective Durso.</p><p>\u201cSit down, sit down, how can I help you?\u201d Jerry Cheever asked.</p><p>Jessy took the chair in front of the desk, while he perched on the edge of it.</p><p>\u201cHave you discovered anything more about the murder of Tanner Green?\u201d she asked him without preamble.</p><p>He arched a brow and answered slowly. \u201cYou know, investigations take time. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t usually solve things as easily as the crime shows would have you believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I was just anxious, I guess,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re investigating several leads, though,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our best, and, I\u2019m certain, in the end, that we will discover the truth. Have you thought of anything that might help with the case?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually...I\u2019m just curious about Mr. Green himself,\u201d Jessy told him.</p><p>\u201cOh? Why?\u201d Cheever asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to know if he had a twin, or maybe a brother who looks a lot like him,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cheever seemed surprised, but he stood and walked around behind his desk, hit a few keys on his computer, then met her eyes. \u201cNope. No siblings. He was the only child of Mathew and Virginia Green, both deceased many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. Great. She had asked, the question had been just as ridiculous as she\u2019d feared, and now Cheever was staring at her as if he was about to grill her once again.</p><p>She stood quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have taken your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the concern about siblings?\u201d Cheever asked, getting up to see her out.</p><p>\u201cI just thought that...well, I haven\u2019t seen anything in the paper about a funeral,\u201d she said, amazed that the lie came to her tongue so easily, even though it wouldn\u2019t stand up to close investigation.</p><p>\u201cThe body is still being held in the morgue. But there\u2019s a note here that Emil Landon called to say that he\u2019ll handle the arrangements once it\u2019s released.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eye on the papers. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a notice when the time comes,\u201d Jerry suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. And thank you.\u201d She started out of the office, then hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange, isn\u2019t it? That poor guy who worked for the Sun is dead, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We intend to find out who was responsible.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and left at last.</p><p>Dillon hadn\u2019t met Len Durso before, but the cop seemed to be a decent guy. He was a big-enough man that he could have been intimidating, but his response was open and friendly when Dillon introduced himself and presented his card, with the Harrison Investigations logo on it, then explained why he\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just started investigating,\u201d Durso said, shaking Dillon\u2019s hand and studying him from under heavy lids, as if he\u2019d heard about him and was intrigued.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it was an accident,\u201d Dillon said flatly.</p><p>\u201cIt was a hard impact, killing the guy instantly, I can tell you that. The body is at the morgue\u2014probably in autopsy right now. The M.E. hasn\u2019t signed off yet, but she\u2019s already told me that whoever hit him was going a good sixty miles an hour. There are no tire marks on the highway, so the driver didn\u2019t try to stop,\u201d Durso told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll know more when we get the full forensic and autopsy reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you call me to let me know what you learn?\u201d Dillon pointed to the card in Durso\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d Durso told him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your interest in this?\u201d</p><p>Durso was being honest with him, more forthcoming than Dillon had any right to expect, so he replied in kind.</p><p>\u201cI think it was murder. I think Yorba might have been able to ID whoever killed Tanner Green, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou working for Emil Landon?\u201d Durso demanded, seeming to retreat slightly.</p><p>\u201cMy boss\u2019s call,\u201d Dillon told him. \u201cLandon thinks he\u2019s a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, Landon is walking around just fine, and if you\u2019re right, two other men have died in his stead,\u201d Durso said. Dillon decided he\u2019d made the right call, telling the cop that he\u2019d been instructed to take the case.</p><p>Dillon said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking it might be some kind of an inside job, with someone from the Big Easy working with somebody from the Sun. Because if it\u2019s not, the Tanner Green murder is the most coincidence-filled case I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Durso studied him gravely. \u201cI\u2019ll look into anything you give me. I met Adam Harrison when he was here on a case a few years back. No one ever talked about the details, but he\u2019s clearly an amazing guy, so anything I can do...For now, tell me how you think this might have gone down. What makes you think it was an inside job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe limo that dropped Tanner Green off at the casino was just out of range of several security cameras. That\u2019s almost impossible to accomplish\u2014unless you know the exact range and angle of view of those cameras,\u201d Dillon explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA tech guru might be able to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be very tough and not very likely,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cAnd like I said, the reason I think the two deaths are connected is that Rudy was parking cars at the Sun that night, and I think he got a look at what the cameras missed. So thanks. I appreciate the offer of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll appreciate yours, too, if you get anything,\u201d Durso told him.</p> <p>The two men shook hands goodbye, and as Dillon walked slowly back toward the exit, he keyed in the phone number Sarah had given him the night before.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d she said, once he identified himself.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself. I have a question for you. Do you know anything about what Tanner Green was wearing the night he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTop of the line,\u201d she told him. \u201cDesigner all the way. His shoes must have cost more than I make in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there any damage to his clothing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, there was the hole made by the knife,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the bloodstains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d He could hear her rustling papers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, his shirt was missing two buttons,\u201d she read off a report.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as I\u2019m closer to really knowing something, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Passing the squad room on her way out, Jessy looked over at the sea of desks and the officers who were hurrying from place to place, almost as if they were ants busying themselves around their hill.</p><p>She still felt tense, and she didn\u2019t know why. Looking around again, she found herself half expecting Tanner Green to be seated at one of the desks, staring at her. But he was nowhere in sight, a fact that should have filled her with more relief than it did.</p><p>One piece of information sat dully in her mind. Tanner Green had been an only child.</p><p>She was also curious about the fact that Dillon Wolf had been in with Cheever. She supposed it was because they were both investigating Green\u2019s death, so they undoubtedly needed to work with one another, even if they didn\u2019t necessarily like one another.</p><p>And why hadn\u2019t she told Cheever what she hadn\u2019t been willing to tell Dillon, either: that just before dying, Tanner Green had whispered a single word to her?</p><p>Indigo.</p><p>\u201cJessy?\u201d</p> <p>The sound of her own name startled her, and she jumped. Dillon Wolf was walking down the hall toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d he said.</p><p>He was tall, solid. Certainly attractive. And it wasn\u2019t just his looks, either. It was the confident way he moved. The way he spoke. Even in a dream, she had felt the attraction, the longing to be with him. The need to be held. And touched. Was this strange attraction all because she was seeing a ghost, or was she genuinely attracted to him? She was very much afraid it was the latter.</p><p>She was edgy around him, and she wasn\u2019t sure why. She wasn\u2019t afraid of him, exactly, it was more that she was afraid of...how much he seemed to know about her, the way he saw through to the vulnerability she longed to deny.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, looking at her skeptically.</p><p>\u201cFine, thank you.\u201d Oh, God, she was such a liar. And he could see it, of course. He didn\u2019t ask another question, he just studied her with his dark, intense eyes, and she found herself babbling. \u201cI just came in to see what was going on with the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cYou working today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same show?\u201d When she nodded, he asked, \u201cDoes that mean you have time for a late breakfast or an early lunch...or just a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say no. She wanted to run away.</p><p>Which was just crazy. And seriously, did she want to be alone right now?</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he added.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he be so obnoxious that she would have a good reason to say no?</p><p>\u201cI guess brunch would be a good thing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he told her, then laid his hand against the base of her back to usher her from the station. Outside, he suggested that they take his car, offering to drive her back afterward for hers, and she reluctantly agreed.</p><p>He drove a small hybrid. Vegas might be a city of extravagance, but thinking about the man, she decided she wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>He chose a charming mom-and-pop place she\u2019d never been to before. At first she was surprised by that, and then she realized that Las Vegas was filled with restaurants, many of which came and went in the blink of an eye, so perhaps it wasn\u2019t so strange after all.</p><p>The restaurant was sparkling clean; the little vases of flowers on the table were fresh. The room itself was sunny and airy, but despite that, as they sat down, she looked around, afraid she was going to see the mournful eyes of Tanner Green staring at her. Pleading with her. But for what?</p><p>\u201cThe eggs Benedict are excellent,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAnd the soups are homemade.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t really interested in the food. \u201cEggs Benedict sounds fine,\u201d she told him.</p><p>The waitress turned out to be one of the owners. Dillon chatted pleasantly with her for a few minutes as he ordered.</p><p>Once cups of steaming coffee had been set before them, he looked at her and smiled. \u201cWhy have you been avoiding me?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I think you need me,\u201d he told her soberly.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a line, and she knew it. Still, she tossed back a lock of hair and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a new come-on,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, didn\u2019t even crack a smile.</p><p>\u201cI think your life might be in danger,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>Her fingers trembled as she held her coffee cup; she decided not to try to take a sip. \u201cWhy?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cTanner Green spoke to you before he died. I saw it on the tapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...only the cops have those tapes, right?\u201d she asked him. \u201cAre you trying to tell me that the police department is crooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many copies of those tapes are out there. As for the police...it\u2019s a huge department. I\u2019m sure not everyone is crooked, but that doesn\u2019t mean someone can\u2019t be. And the casino has the tapes, too. Look, you heard about the guy who was killed in that hit-and-run\u2014un, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s very sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more than sad. I\u2019m almost positive he was killed because he spoke with me,\u201d he told her seriously.</p><p>\u201cOh, great\u2014and now I\u2019m speaking with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessy, you know something, and sooner or later the killer\u2019s going to figure that out,\u201d he said.</p><p>Eggs Benedict, aromatic and enticing, were set before her. She picked up her fork and cut a bite, then couldn\u2019t bring the fork to her lips.</p><p>Tell him, she thought. Just spit out that one word and it will be all over.</p><p>She stared down at her coffee cup, but when she looked up again, about to speak, she went silent in stunned terror instead.</p><p>Tanner Green was sitting at the table behind Dillon Wolf, staring at her morosely.</p><p>Worse. At the table behind him\u2014not with him, just behind him\u2014was another specter.</p><p>She\u2019d never met the man in life, but she\u2019d seen his picture on the news, and she couldn\u2019t mistake the face.</p><p>Rudy Yorba.</p><p>Dillon Wolf saw her expression and swung around to see what she was staring at.</p><p>As Dillon turned, Tanner Green leaped to his feet, jostling the table in the process. The salt and pepper shakers rattled.</p><p>And then he was gone, with Rudy Yorba disappearing seemingly into thin air right along with him.</p><p>Several other diners looked around, aware of something, but seeing nothing.</p><p>Not Dillon Wolf. He leaned toward her and said flatly, \u201cYou saw them.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>She stared at him, blinked, and tried to deny it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>He had seen them, too, she suddenly realized.</p><p>She wanted to scream.</p><p>A part of her heard chatter, laughter, the clink of cups and the sounds of forks on plates. She heard music playing in the background, something country, pleasant and soft.</p><p>She jumped up, forgetting all about her food.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stay away from me,\u201d she told Dillon.</p><p>He had risen when she did. He grimly dropped money on the table, and when she turned to flee the restaurant, he was right behind her.</p><p>In the parking lot, she remembered that they had come in his car.</p><p>She winced, but didn\u2019t jump, when she felt his hand on her arm. When she turned, she saw the light of empathy and concern in his eyes, and she was torn between wanting to laugh and wanting to cry, right there in the parking lot. She was tempted to throw herself into his arms, wishing she could forget all of this\u2014the murder, the ghost\u2014and suggest that she screw work and, well, hell, screw him, as well.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t her. No matter what was going on in her life or how attracted to him she felt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing Tanner Green,\u201d he said without inflection.</p><p>\u201cNo. Tanner Green is dead,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a ghost, and he\u2019s out there,\u201d Dillon assured her. His hand was still on her arm, and she found herself feeling inexplicably grateful. Her knees had gone to water, and her mind kept insisting that none of this could be real, not even the man before her.</p><p>She stared at him, the misery suddenly rising uncontrollably. \u201cWhy? Why is he doing this to me? Why the hell is he haunting me?\u201d</p><p>Dillon leaned toward her, eyes intent. \u201cShort and simple. He needs you.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>It was time to find the treasure. And, as amazing as it seemed, with her going through the entire performance on autopilot, she was managing to do a decent job. Somehow she\u2019d compartmentalized the part of her that was in shock and terror, so she could make the show everything it should be for the kids. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t remember saying much as they\u2019d driven to the casino. She still didn\u2019t have her car. Dillon had suggested that she would be better off not driving, and she had agreed with him. He had hung around in the hall while she got dressed, and her coworkers had teased her about her handsome admirer. He spent a few minutes talking to the guard, and when the show began, he watched from the audience. He was sitting with a bunch of what looked like six-year-olds, and he seemed to be having a good time. He seemed so austere at times, and yet he could also unbend and have fun, and easily elicit trust from those around him.</p><p>Everything was going to be all right, she insisted to herself.</p><p>She was careful not to look toward the back of the room. It was bad enough seeing Tanner Green. It was adding insult to injury, being haunted by Rudy Yorba, a man she\u2019d never even met. Not that she\u2019d ever been formally introduced to Tanner Green, of course.</p> <p>She made it through the show.</p><p>And when it was all over, when the pictures had been taken and the last gold-covered chocolate coin had been given away, Dillon was still there, waiting for her.</p><p>In the dressing room, she scrubbed her face, managed some casual conversation with a few other cast members and changed back into her street clothes. Dillon was in the hall, and when she joined him, she once again resisted the temptation to reach out for him, bury her head against his shoulder and cry. Or maybe just scream. She tried not to look like a doe caught in the headlights as she said, \u201cThanks for waiting.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised to see the admiration in his eyes. \u201cYou were terrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, not many people have to admit that not one, but two, ghosts are following them around, then go out onstage.\u201d</p><p>He should have been joking, she thought, because the words were just that crazy. Instead, he was dead serious.</p><p>\u201cI think you need some company, and I know for sure you need some food,\u201d he said. \u201cHow would you feel about seeing my place? I have a house, a yard, the whole bit, and best of all, it\u2019s not far away. You didn\u2019t eat, and I\u2019m not a great cook, but I can manage a mean frozen lasagna with a fresh salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour house will be fine,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t care where they went\u2014as long as he didn\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>It took only a few minutes to reach his raised ranch\u2013style house, which wasn\u2019t far from the Strip. There was an adobe wall around the yard, which was handsomely landscaped with cacti and stone-bordered gardens. Inside, they were immediately greeted by a huge dog.</p><p>\u201cClancy, be polite. This is Jessy Sparhawk. I know she looks like she should be Swedish, but she\u2019s actually part Lakota. Clancy is Belgian,\u201d he informed Jessy.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Jessy told him awkwardly. It was true; the dog was beautiful\u2014and very friendly. She didn\u2019t jump up or slobber, but she was happy to be petted, though it was apparent that she adored her master.</p><p>\u201cCome on in and have a seat,\u201d Dillon offered.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>She heard a slight jingling sound and looked around nervously, but she couldn\u2019t see anything. At least neither Tanner Green nor Rudy Yorba seemed to have followed her.</p><p>Dillon was studying her as if he was about to say something, but apparently he thought better of it, because he turned and headed through the stone-paved entryway into the living room. Native American art decorated the room, representing a number of different tribes. She recognized some of the pieces as local Paiute art, and some she recognized because they were similar to pieces in Timothy\u2019s collection. Lakota dolls sat on the mantel, several dream catchers hung in the windows, and she recognized a Seminole shirt on one wall, ringed by small Inuit pieces.</p><p>There was a high-def television set opposite a leather sofa and matching chairs, and a cypress coffee table. Steps led up to a counter separating the kitchen from the living room, and beyond that, she could see a family room and French doors that led out to a small pool and patio, with the yard enclosed by an extension of the adobe wall, which was higher there in the back.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, as long as it has alcohol in it,\u201d she said, sinking down onto the sofa. It was definitely a masculine room. She saw no sign that any female\u2014other than Clancy\u2014shared the space.</p><p>\u201cBeer or bourbon, those are your choices\u2014well, other than glass or bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can probably just hand me the bottle of bourbon,\u201d she joked, then said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean that. A beer will be fine.\u201d</p><p>He came out with two, then returned to the kitchen. She sat back with her beer, letting herself appreciate the art and artifacts that gave the room its character. It felt good to be sitting there in silence\u2014and safe.</p><p>He returned in a couple of minutes with a platter holding cheese, sliced pepperoni, fruit and chips. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not a vegetarian or a health-food addict,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him, and suddenly she was starving. She reached for a piece of cheese, which was delicious, and then another. She forced herself to slow down. He had taken one of the nearby chairs, and she smiled over at him. \u201cThanks. This really hits the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You must be starving by now.\u201d</p><p>Clancy came and lay down between them. The dog didn\u2019t beg, even when Dillon reached down and stroked her head.</p><p>\u201cYou still doing okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jessy nodded. Then she stared at him, taking a long swallow of beer. \u201cHarrison Investigations is a...a ghost-busting organization, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThe truth? Sometimes, yes. Other times we go in and find out that there\u2019s a natural explanation for a \u2018haunting\u2019 or whatever is supposedly going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you saw them,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou saw Tanner Green and Rudy Yorba, the same as I did.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she was admitting out loud that she\u2019d seen a ghost. Two ghosts.</p><p>\u201cI saw them, but too briefly to find out anything,\u201d he said regretfully.</p><p>She tried not to let her voice rise to a squeak. \u201cYou want to see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She took another long swallow of her beer. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re only here because they have something to say, something to ask. They need help clearing up the mystery surrounding their own deaths,\u201d Dillon explained.</p><p>\u201cThen they should be following you around,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re the investigator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I agree, and I admit to being perplexed about that myself. I mean, I understand Tanner Green. You were his last contact. But I was one of the last people to speak to Rudy, and you never even met him. I think he\u2019s too green, too new, and that he can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure what out?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes the body dies but the soul, or whatever you want to call it, remains, because it\u2019s looking for justice. For closure, to use the trendy term. But sometimes it takes the soul, the ghost, a while to even figure out what\u2019s happened to him, much less how he can get the help he needs. Neither I, nor anyone I know, has all the answers. What\u2019s clear so far is that Tanner Green seems to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d Jessy repeated skeptically.</p><p>Dillon smiled. \u201cYes. Afraid to accept death. But he seems to trust you and no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I tell him that I\u2019m not trustworthy?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>Dillon laughed at that. Jessy didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cBut you can help me make contact with him, and when that happens, I can try to help him. And once he\u2019s gotten the help he needs, then he won\u2019t haunt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to introduce you to a ghost?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>He offered her a rueful smile. \u201cSomething like that, but not so easy, I\u2019m afraid. You\u2019ll have to let him get close, and let him see that you trust me. Eventually he\u2019ll trust me, too, and let me know how I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually?\u201d she said with dismay.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not trying to hurt you, you know,\u201d Dillon told her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said. \u201cbut what if I\u2019m driving and he suddenly pops up? Doesn\u2019t he realize I might run into a wall or take a few pedestrians out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t always think rationally, and ghosts don\u2019t, either,\u201d he said, then changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another?\u201d he asked, indicating her empty beer bottle.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>This time, when he headed toward the kitchen, she rose and followed him. Clancy pattered along, as well, sitting at her feet when she took a stool at the counter.</p><p>\u201cHave you always seen ghosts?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. \u201cI grew up on one of the Paiute reservations near here, and I was a wiseass kid. My mom was a nurse who was working for the government, vaccinating kids. She met my dad, and they fell in love. They were a couple of dreamers, in love with the whole world. I was an only child, and when they moved onto a government military base\u2014my dad joined the army, and we were sent to North Carolina\u2014I suddenly became an oddity. Kids can be brutal. Not so much when they\u2019re really young. At that point they don\u2019t know Chinese from Indian, black man from Inuit. They see skin color the way most men see the color of someone\u2019s hair, but when they get older...Anyway, I started getting into scrapes when I hit my teens. Nothing really bad, mostly because my parents would have been so disappointed. Then they were killed together in a small-plane crash. I turned into a real asshole then. After their funeral\u2014they were buried back here, in Nevada, because they both loved it here\u2014I was at a bar, drinking pretty heavily, and I picked a fight with a big white burly guy just because he was blond.\u201d His smile twisted into a grim slash. \u201cYou\u2019re Lakota, right? Our tribes share a lot of the same myths and beliefs. You\u2019ve heard the stories about the maiden who wears white, and the great white buffalo, and the magic that comes when they\u2019re seen? Well, I saw the maiden. She was at the funeral. At first I chalked it up to the trauma of my parents\u2019 deaths. Then, at the bar\u2014right when I\u2019d started the fight and the guy was about to rearrange my face\u2014she stepped between us. She spoke to me. I can still hear her words. \u2018No. It\u2019s not the way. You must grow strong. Pain must never cause pain. You must find your peace\u2014for them, for yourself.\u2019 I think some friends dragged me away and apologized for me, told the guy my folks had just died. Anyway, after that day...I started seeing...people. Ghosts. Then I met Adam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdam Harrison,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAdam had a son, Josh, and Adam adored him.

Adam started putting together a team of people to look into cases with a paranormal angle because he always recognized the ability to see ghosts, to talk to them, in others, even though he didn\u2019t have it himself for many years. He\u2019s still not really able to see ghosts the way some of us can, but he\u2019s learned to sense their presence, sometimes even get a sense of what they want. In my family, the ability\u2014which I thought for a long time was just me being crazy\u2014is called nightwalking. It\u2019s being able to see what exists in a slightly different dimension, I guess. But it\u2019s not an evil ability. It\u2019s just frightening to some people, at first. When you think about it, though, the whole thing is actually kind of reassuring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to think I might end up seeing more ghosts?\u201d she asked. She realized that at some point he had come over to the counter, leaned across it and taken her hands. She liked the feeling. It was almost as if his warmth and vitality was passing into her, as if he was giving her strength.</p> <p>He gave her hands a quick final squeeze, then released them, turning back to open the oven. He grabbed pot holders and drew out a foil pan of lasagna, which he set on a trivet on the counter. Then he looked at her. \u201cI was glad to become a nightwalker,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it meant there was another place, another world after this one. That there was a supreme being and the essence of a person lived on.\u201d He smiled and shrugged. \u201cMy mom was a Catholic, so my spiritual ethic has a lot of elements mixed into it. In my mind, there\u2019s one big power, and it doesn\u2019t matter how you recognize it or what you call it. I think a person\u2019s time on earth is best spent learning how to be decent to others. If there is a heaven or a great white prairie in the sky, I know my parents have earned their place there. And that\u2019s something I find reassuring.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him. It was a wonderful thing, belief, she had to admit.</p><p>\u201cWant to set the table?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure.\u201d</p><p>He was already reaching into the refrigerator for the salad makings. She slipped off the stool and started retrieving plates from the cabinet he indicated, then found silverware, napkins and glasses, and set them out in the family room, on a table that looked out over the patio.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very nice house,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you make a decent living as a ghost buster,\u201d she said, hoping her tone was light enough, then thinking maybe she shouldn\u2019t have spoken at all. \u201cSorry, that was nosy and none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. We\u2019re paid pretty much the same rates as any investigators, but we do all right. Adam negotiates the contracts and gives us our assignments. We can turn down any case we don\u2019t feel comfortable with, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmil Landon just doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of guy you\u2019d work for,\u201d she said, and then realized the rudeness of her comment.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHonestly? I loathe the bastard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why did you accept the assignment?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI just figured that if Adam wanted me to, there had to be a reason somewhere. Now, even if Landon fires me, I\u2019ll stay on it. I barely knew Tanner Green, and I knew Rudy Yorba even less, but they deserve justice. I won\u2019t let Yorba\u2019s death go down as an accident. Not when he was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for his death,\u201d she told him.</p><p>A slight heightening of his color told her that she had touched a nerve, and she was suddenly sorry she\u2019d said anything.</p><p>\u201cHe might have been targeted already. I just don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s why solving this is so important.\u201d</p><p>He finished fixing the salad and poured iced tea for them to drink with dinner. While they ate, the conversation flowed easily. She asked questions, he answered them, and then he asked her about her life. He was a comfortable man to be with, she thought as she found herself telling him about the other cast members and about Timothy\u2014even about old Mrs. Teasdale and the other people at the home who made it such a nice place for Timothy to live.</p><p>The frozen lasagna was actually very good, which she hadn\u2019t expected, and the salad was fresh and delicious. Best of all, she was starting to feel as if she had known Dillon Wolf forever.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to leave.</p> <p>But when the dishes were washed, Clancy fed, and they\u2019d even had coffee out back by the pool, she decided it was time to say something before she over-stayed her welcome.</p><p>\u201cI should go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a pet?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHuh? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you worried about leaving?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, my car is still at the police station, for one thing,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI have friends there. Nothing will happen to it,\u201d he told her. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve been scared\u2014nearly frightened to death\u2014tonight. Stay here. There\u2019s a guest room. And a computer\u2014anything you might need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t stay. It wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really right and what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked her. \u201cAre you worried about what people might think? Are you worried about your grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Timothy\u2019s fine. He stays at the home most of the time. I take him out for weekends, sometimes, and I had him the other night because I was afraid they were going to force him out. I don\u2019t usually play a lot of money at the craps table. Not that I\u2019m anti-gambling or anything. It can be fun, if you don\u2019t get carried away. But\u2014\u201d She broke off, looking at him. \u201cI\u2019m babbling, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabble all you want. I still think you should stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you using me as bait?\u201d she asked him. \u201cAre you trying to lure a ghost in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you trying to get rid of a ghost?\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>He stood. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll show you the guest room.\u201d</p><p>He was serious, she realized. Apparently he really wasn\u2019t after her body, and she had to admit, she was somewhat disappointed. He led her to the guest room, which was done in mauve and a sand shade that complemented the desert tones of the house and yard. The guest room even had its own bath.</p><p>And a new wide-screen television.</p><p>He offered her a T-shirt and baggy sweatpants to sleep in, and she thanked him, realizing that this was the first time in what seemed like forever that she hadn\u2019t been afraid.</p><p>That she was even ready to see a ghost.</p><p>He left her, excusing himself to go work on the computer. She showered and changed, and was somewhat dismayed to realize that she liked wearing his clothes, as if they were a touch of the man himself.</p><p>Her cell phone rang, startling her. She made a dive for her purse and answered it quickly. Sandra\u2019s voice came over the line. \u201cAre you all right? Why haven\u2019t you called me? I\u2019ve been waiting for you to call,\u201d she chided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Did I say I was going to call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m worried sick about you. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine. And thanks for caring and checking up, Sandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re home and you\u2019re all locked in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d Jessy repeated, then hesitated before adding, \u201cI\u2019m at Dillon Wolf\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Sandra\u2019s shriek was so loud that Jessy winced. \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down. It\u2019s not a date or anything,\u201d Jessy said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m not even with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at his house without him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s here. He\u2019s in the other room, on his computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to want details. I hope you know that.\u201d Jessy heard Reggie saying something in the background, followed by an excited explosion that matched her mother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jessy demanded.</p><p>\u201cReggie wants details, too. I told her no, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no details,\u201d Jessy insisted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going now. But, Sandra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, kid. I\u2019m going to keep calling, too.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, Jessy closed her phone. It wasn\u2019t such a bad world. She had really good friends. And she didn\u2019t have to be afraid, at least not tonight, because Dillon Wolf was just beyond the door.</p><p>It was probably a little late to be calling anyone, but Dillon had known Dr. Doug Tarleton, one of Las Vegas\u2019s top medical examiners, for many years. Doug either answered his phone or he didn\u2019t. If he saw the caller ID and wasn\u2019t interested, he wouldn\u2019t answer. If he was sleeping, the only number that would ring through was his emergency number.</p><p>Doug answered the phone on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cDillon Wolf,\u201d he said, without even a hello. \u201cI was wondering when the hell I\u2019d be hearing from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was trying to go through proper channels,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Doug laughed. \u201cYou mean Jerry Cheever? He\u2019s a decent cop. He\u2019s just got a chip on his shoulder. And, frankly, he\u2019s not as enamored of Harrison Investigations as a lot of folks are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just acts like he\u2019s got a stick up his ass, is all,\u201d Dillon agreed. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not his fault. Maybe a bully stole his Froot Loops when he was kid. Anyway, I\u2019ve been trying to keep the channels of communication going through him, but it seemed past time to start going straight to the source. Where did I catch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still at the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was just finishing up when the report on that young guy came in\u2014the hit-and-run victim. Man, dead is dead, I know, but the injuries that guy had...hell. Thank God the impact broke his neck\u2014along with crushing his rib cage, and every bone in his chest and pelvis. Anyway, I had just finished reading that\u2014damn thing was as long as a book\u2014when the tox reports on Tanner Green came in. Get this. The guy was tripping.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTripping? You mean acid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, LSD. Some bodyguard\u2014he must have been higher than a kite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t on duty,\u201d Dillon mused. \u201cYou got anything else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d have been dead before fifty, I can tell you that. His liver was going, and judging by his cholesterol, he must have dined on red meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Plus, he was overweight. But the cause of death was a punctured lung. He drowned in his own blood.\u201d</p><p>There had been no sign of blood in either limo, Dillon thought.</p><p>\u201cWould the injury have caused any spatter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was one hard strike. From the back, missing the bone, straight into the lung. The outer blood loss was a slow leak down his back that increased once the knife was jarred by his fall\u2014his shirt was drenched, and the craps table took some of it. I\u2019m assuming the woman he died on would have been covered in blood, too. But he might not have left any kind of a trail, because, until he fell, it was collecting mostly in his lungs. The knife actually worked like a cork at first, keeping seepage to a minimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doug. I appreciate the help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my job. But this case is pretty bizarre, huh? And there\u2019s no way to avoid the fact that Tanner Green was no angel. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re on it, because it\u2019s not as if they\u2019ll be sending out an army to find his killer.\u201d Doug was quiet for a minute. \u201cYou\u2019re involved because you think his death connects to something bigger, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I think the two deaths are connected,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cA murder and a hit-and-run?\u201d Doug asked.</p><p>\u201cA murder and a murder,\u201d Dillon told him, then thanked his friend and hung up. Tomorrow, he decided, he would take a trip down to the morgue.</p><p>Jessy didn\u2019t fall asleep easily, but for the first time since the incident, it wasn\u2019t because she was afraid. She was giddy because she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>The room was comfortable.</p> <p>Dillon was nearby.</p><p>She stayed awake with the television on, flipping through a magazine and reading about different politicians\u2019 plans to improve the state of the country.</p><p>Eventually she fell asleep.</p><p>And dreamed.</p><p>But tonight wasn\u2019t a repeat of the nightmares that had plagued her. There were no visions of dead men, no graveyards, no people who looked like they\u2019d lived long ago. Tonight\u2019s dreams were so erotic that she could feel herself blushing, but they were also so sweet that she had no desire to wake up, even though she knew she was dreaming. Dillon played a starring role, and there was no awkwardness between them. She didn\u2019t know where they were, or who had initiated the encounter, only that their bodies were entangled, his copper-hued flesh strong and vibrant. She could hear their whispers, their laughter and the gasp of her own breath, matched by his. She felt as if they had been together forever, as if she had known him for years. She could feel the force of his kiss, the seductive journey of his lips and tongue along her flesh. She could see his face and feel his body straddling hers, bathing her in liquid fire....</p><p>Suddenly she jolted into wakefulness, seized by inward panic. But when she sat up and looked around, she was alone, no sign of Tanner Green.</p><p>There was a tap on her door, soft, hesitant.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said quickly, fighting the fear that threatened to swamp her.</p> <p>The door opened and Dillon was there, silhouetted against the light from the hall.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Embarrassment swept through her as she thought about what an honest answer would sound like.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m fine, I was just dreaming about having wild sex with you, but don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just the pathetic longings of a woman with no sex life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, and left it at that.</p><p>\u201cYou cried out,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m fine. Honestly. I haven\u2019t been so fine in...a while. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I sleep lightly. Good night,\u201d he said, and started to close the door.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>And then she did, too, suddenly unable to go on.</p><p>It was as if the air itself grew heavy with anticipation, with anxiety, as if fate itself hung on what would happen next. She half rose, thinking that she could suggest they make some tea. Talk. Head to the living room, the kitchen, or just take the dog for a walk....</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He paused in the doorway, then walked slowly into the room. He had thrown on a robe, and she knew\u2014without knowing how she knew\u2014that he had nothing on beneath it. His eyes were sober, and his voice was low and even when he told her, \u201cYou have nothing to fear here, you know. I\u2019m right across the hall. Just yell and I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, the most fascinating man she\u2019d ever encountered, and smoothed a strand of her hair.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he said, with one of the smiles that so charmed her.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cWe could watch a movie,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe could. But that\u2019s not what I had in mind,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His smile broadened, and when he touched her, the jolt was palpable, as if a circuit had been completed. She nearly gasped in awe as what had been a dream became real, because the truth of his hands on her was far more exciting than anything her subconscious could conjure. He slid into bed beside her, fingers twining into her hair, his mouth sure, firm, seductive, and an explosion of arousal followed his first touch. She felt as if they were fused together, and it was easy to overcome the hesitancy of a lifetime and slip her arms around him, to relish the solidity of his muscles and the smooth hot skin beneath the robe. There was urgency in every touch, and yet they both seemed filled with a determination to take their time, to savor the process of getting to know one another.</p><p>The first kiss seemed to go on for aeons, but aeons filled with wonder, where every deep thrust led to a new burst of exploding fire and arousal in which their bodies shifted again, touching anew, hands roving and discovering more and more. His robe was easily dispensed with, and his naked flesh against hers further kindled the frantic rise of heat within her. She had known that he was muscle and sinew wrapped in sleek copper, and now the feel of him against her was as powerful as burning metal. His hands were exactly like the man himself, sure, confident, with a strength that elicited trust and wonder, and swiftly simmering excitement. Their limbs tangled and locked as his fingers brushed her face, stroked her neck and throat. His lips burned through the cotton material of the shirt she had borrowed, and she would never know exactly when or even who removed it at last, so that his tongue could blaze like sunlight across her breasts and abdomen.</p><p>She savored the magic of his embrace, the vibrant bonds of flesh and muscle, and found herself insatiable in her longing to touch and taste in return, to run her fingers into his hair, over his shoulders, down the length of his body. Her lips, too, strayed to his torso, a courtesy of introduction before exploring ever intimately, until she lifted her head their lips locked once more.</p><p>At last she was on her back, staring up into his eyes, ink dark and paradoxically filled with both an ancient wisdom and buoyant youth, as well as vitality, humor and passion. She gasped as he moved between her thighs, slow and sure, and filling the world, her world, with his presence as he took her to a physical extreme she had never known existed. She was caught in an inferno, a massive bonfire burning in the darkness of a desert night. She clung to him, writhed against him, arched to meet every thrust and shift, and relished each gasp and rising thrill as she was tossed in a tempest of need and desire. She raked his shoulders with her nails and was aware of his hands gripping her buttocks as he drove her upward toward the explosion of climax. But then he drew back from the precipice and slowed the pace, before sending her soaring once more. Again and again, accelerating, then braking, until she was frantic, her fingers dancing down his back in a frenzy, her lips against his throat, demanding and voracious. She climaxed at last, the moment violent in its intensity and wild abandon, shaking in his hold, jerking against him again and again, her flesh wet and slick and trembling against him as the world shook and receded and reality finally, slowly, returned.</p><p>Because this was no dream. Everything about him was real and solid.</p><p>He held her, the aftereffects of his own release still rippling through him, his embrace firm. He was a careful lover, easing the weight of his body from hers, yet never releasing her, never allowing her to think for one moment that she was anything less than precious and coveted. Still gasping for breath, she lay spooned against him, the moonlight playing across their bodies, and the shyness that assailed her so often when she wasn\u2019t on a stage returned. She knew that they would have to move eventually, that there would have to be words. Sex was sex; they had done nothing new, nothing that changed the world, no matter how it had felt at the time. Even so, for her, the night hadn\u2019t been casual, and she could only hope that he hadn\u2019t made love to her only to ease her fears or because of a momentary urge.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak at first, only kissed the nape of her neck as her heart kept thundering. And then at last he whispered, \u201cShall I stay? I don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d</p><p>She wound her fingers through his, where they rested on her abdomen, and was both sorry that she couldn\u2019t see the ebony depths of his eyes, yet glad he couldn\u2019t see her own slightly panicked expression.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she managed to say, regretting her own lack of eloquence. She\u2019d sounded as if she were agreeing to sugar in her coffee.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t seem put off, because his arms tightened around her, and she felt the brush of his kiss against her nape again.</p><p>And in a while, after she had dozed, roused and moved against him, she felt the force of his body and they once more made love. The first had been a duel of passion and resistance; this was sleepy and slower, yet still possessed of that sensation of desperate and passionate urgency. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She never wanted to move. Never.</p><p>With his arms around her, she slept at last.</p><p>Even so, she was plagued by dreams.</p> <p>She was running through the old cemetery again, with its crosses of wood and graves encircled with stones. The wind was light and warm, and at first there was sun but then there wasn\u2019t. Always, though, there were people behind her. Chasing her.</p><p>Hunting her.</p><p>They were coming to kill her, and so she ran, tripping over the stones, running against the sagebrush that blew at her as if a tempest was coming. Just as she heard the footsteps coming closer and closer, she saw a light ahead of her, and a man framed in that light.</p><p>It was Dillon.</p><p>As she neared him, the sun came out again and her pursuers vanished, fading to nothing but empty darkness behind her, because in him she found the anger and strength and desire to fight back.</p> <p>She opened her eyes slowly. It was morning, a soft glow filtering through the drapes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone. And for once she was glad of that.</p><p>Dillon lay beside her, just holding her, though she saw that he, too, was awake. When she turned to face him, she saw in his eyes the humor, the kindness and the strength she had expected\u2014along with something more that made her heart leap. There was an intimacy there that made her blood heat, and when he smiled slowly, she felt a little tremor ripple through her as she realized that she wanted him\u2014that look, his touch, everything about him\u2014in her life for much longer than just one night. She had been wary of relationships for so long, like a kid with a chip on her shoulder. She had felt that she needed to defend Timothy from anyone who might pity him or mock her for her devotion to him, but no more. She knew without question that Dillon would understand Timothy\u2019s condition, would honor an elder, and would never expect anything from her but loyalty to the grandfather who had raised her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo nightmares?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly one, but you were there,\u201d she told him gravely.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he murmured dryly.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, you were there in a good way,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI was running away from these people I knew wanted to kill me, but then I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped I rescued you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou did even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me strength, and when they knew they couldn\u2019t scare me anymore, they disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad of that,\u201d he told her, then sat up suddenly, frowning. \u201cFear can be a good thing sometimes, though. Fear can keep you safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid of a ghost,\u201d she said softly. \u201cA ghost who you said needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone made Tanner Green into a ghost,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd someone killed Rudy Yorba. That person is alive, and it\u2019s wise to be afraid of him and what he can do.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her mind suddenly embracing the true importance of what they had shared, and what had\u2014and hadn\u2019t\u2014been said.</p><p>\u201cIndigo,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She was startled by his reaction. It was a color, just a color, and when Tanner Green had whispered the word with his dying breath, it hadn\u2019t meant anything to her, hadn\u2019t struck her as anything that could possibly be important.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>\u201cIndigo. That\u2019s what Tanner Green said right before he died. I\u2019m sorry. I trust you, and I would tell you if he\u2019d said anything more, but that was it. One word. Indigo. Just a color.\u201d</p><p>He rose, lean muscle and sinew, his back to her, tall and straight in the early-morning light.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than a color,\u201d he said tightly, his back still toward her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place. Indigo, Nevada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it. What kind of a place?\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her, his dark eyes grim and worried. \u201cA ghost town.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Dillon was preparing coffee when Ringo made his first appearance of the day.</p><p>Death, apparently, didn\u2019t quell a man\u2019s sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell, my friend, and here I was, thinking I was the dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. Now sit down, will you? I\u2019m pretty sure she hears your spurs. And you sure as hell better not have been hanging around here last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m deeply wounded!\u201d Ringo protested. \u201cAnd I was not hanging around,\u201d he added indignantly. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you going to introduce us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to get her accustomed to the ghosts already haunting her. I thought she needed to get a handle on that before realizing that sometimes someone might be...gifted...with an unearthly presence for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m fun and I\u2019m helpful. It\u2019s thanks to me that her grandfather is a happy man in that hoity-toity place he likes. I\u2019m anxious to get to know the lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t freak her out when the time comes, okay, Ringo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop panicking.\u201d Ringo was quiet for a moment. \u201cYou took this job with that creep Emil Landon because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam asked, too\u2014though there didn\u2019t seem to be a supernatural angle at the time, but I guess he knew something somehow\u2014so...\u201d Dillon trailed off with a shrug. \u201cGet out of here for now, though, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that was my room you guys were hogging last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you my room, so quit complaining.\u201d</p><p>Ringo laughed. \u201cHey, doesn\u2019t much matter to me. Anything is better than being out in the cold. Oh, wait. I don\u2019t feel the cold. Still, it\u2019s a nice feeling, being in the house and all. Even the damn dog finally likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClancy is a good old girl,\u201d Dillon said. She was standing next to him and he scratched her ears. \u201cRingo, listen, I\u2019m going with Jessy to have breakfast with her grandfather. Then you and I are going to take a drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut to Indigo,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cIndigo?\u201d Ringo said, stunned and anything but pleased. \u201cBut that\u2019s where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where you died. Yeah, I know. And where you hooked yourself with my ancestors. I know that, too. It\u2019s also the word that Tanner Green whispered to Jessy before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell and damnation. You\u2019re serious?\u201d Ringo demanded.</p><p>\u201cDead serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Ringo said irritably.</p><p>\u201cBad choice of words. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking for?\u201d Ringo asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But why the hell would a dying man say \u2018Indigo\u2019 unless he had a damn good reason?\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhen you wanted me to take the Emil Landon assignment, did you know anything about this?\u201d Dillon asked him.</p><p>Ringo shook his head with what looked like honesty. \u201cLike I told you then, even for Vegas, that guy is one strange player. I figured there had to be something going on, and the job paid big bucks. I figured it would get you in good with the cops to save one of the local money men.\u201d Ringo shrugged. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m outta here right. I\u2019m going to see if I can find out where Tanner Green hangs out when he\u2019s not haunting Jessy. And I\u2019ll see if I can find Rudy Yorba, too. Maybe I\u2019ll even do some spying on Emil Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that. The spying part could be useful. I\u2019ll be heading to Indigo about one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Jessy have to be at work by noon?\u201d Ringo asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I want to run by the morgue after I drop her off. You can meet me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe morgue?\u201d Ringo said with distaste.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re squeamish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting outside. Just don\u2019t hang around in there too long. You never know what you might pick up. Or who,\u201d Ringo warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll, uh, be careful,\u201d Dillon promised.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about leaving Jessy alone? I thought she wanted you around, even when she was working,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be all right. She isn\u2019t terrified of seeing Tanner Green anymore. She knows now that she\u2019s...sane,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Ringo nodded, and with a little jingle of spurs, he was gone.</p><p>A few minutes later Jessy made her appearance. She had showered but had been forced to put on her outfit from the night before.</p><p>She could have worn cardboard for all Dillon cared. The woman was beautiful. With makeup or without. Whatever made her magic was in the way she spoke, in her eyes, in the way she moved, in the sound of her laughter. In her soul. He saw beautiful women all the time, but what made Jessy unique went beyond looks. The phrase was so overused that it had become a joke, but she really was beautiful inside and out.</p><p>\u201cOoh, coffee,\u201d she said, looking around the room. She was still wary, but she had lost the panic he had seen in her eyes when she had spotted Tanner Green\u2014and then Rudy Yorba\u2014in the caf\u00e9 yesterday. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here, is there?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She jumped up on one of the bar stools at the counter. \u201cGood.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHow do you know when...when someone is around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just...see them,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unusual to be hounded the way you\u2019ve been, but for some reason Tanner Green\u2019s desperate, and he\u2019s decided that he trusts you. Soon we\u2019ve actually got to try to talk to him. But for right now, we\u2019ll have coffee, get your car and drop it off at your place, and then we\u2019ll go have breakfast with your grandfather, and afterward I\u2019ll drop you at the casino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I get home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot alone,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cStay with other people\u2014or call Sandra. Hang with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to change,\u201d she said, indicating her outfit.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d he assured her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had coffee, he fed Clancy, and then they left. He opted to wait in the living room at her house, afraid that neither one of them would be able to resist temptation if he went into the bedroom while she changed, and they didn\u2019t have that kind of time.</p><p>At the home, she directed him straight to Timothy\u2019s building.</p><p>Timothy was waiting for them in the breakfast room, sipping coffee and nibbling on a piece of toast as he read the paper.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Jessy said, dipping down to plant a kiss on his head before taking the chair next to him and gesturing toward Dillon. \u201cI\u2019ve brought a friend to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Timothy stared at Dillon with interest, smiling slowly and reaching out a hand.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would be coming to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Dillon, Timothy. You\u2019re meeting him for the first time,\u201d Jessy explained.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, sit down and join us. The buffet here is simple but good,\u201d Timothy said politely.</p> <p>Jessy had gotten her incredible blue eyes from Timothy, Dillon thought, though the older man\u2019s were fading a bit now. His Indian heritage was visible in his angled cheekbones, he still sported a full head of white hair, and his posture was ramrod straight.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dillon told him, surprised at the strength of the old man\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us some coffee,\u201d Jessy said to Dillon. \u201cWhat else would you like? Toast? Croissant? Bagel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToast, thanks,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Timothy hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off Dillon. \u201cUte?\u201d he asked. \u201cSioux? No, you\u2019re Paiute, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dillon agreed.</p> <p>Jessy returned to the table balancing plates of buttered whole wheat toast and packets of jelly on one arm, and carefully holding two coffee mugs by their handles in the other hand. Dillon rose quickly and took one, thanking her.</p><p>Timothy was still eyeing him, now with what seemed to be approval, Dillon thought. Good. It was important for this man to like him.</p><p>\u201cIt was a Paiute shaman, Wovoka, who first spoke of the ghost dancers. He founded the movement,\u201d Timothy said.</p><p>It was apparent from the look on her face that Jessy was unhappy with her grandfather\u2019s preoccupation with the ghost dancers, and her words only confirmed that impression. \u201cTimothy, I know you want me to be proud of your father\u2019s people, and I am, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like it that I see the dancers,\u201d Timothy explained to Dillon.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so pleased to see them, as if you think they mean something good. Think about it.\u201d She turned to Dillon as if asking for support. \u201cI suppose you know all about them. How they danced themselves into a frenzy and made people believe they could wear special shirts that would protect them from bullets. Wovoka said that he saw his dead ancestors, and that they told him they could wipe the white man from the land. And you know what came of that? Sitting Bull\u2019s death and the massacre at Wounded Knee.\u201d She looked pleadingly at Timothy again. \u201cThe ghost dancers were a resistance movement\u2014a failed resistance movement\u2014and it was a long time...ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime means nothing,\u201d Timothy said, waving a hand dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the point, my dearest granddaughter.\u201d He nodded at Dillon, as if convinced that he understood. \u201cWhat was important was that the western tribes learned to speak to those who had gone before. A new tradition was begun. The Ghost Dance was a gift. In any society there are those who believe and those who don\u2019t. To this day, our people do the Ghost Dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor tourist dollars,\u201d Jessy said.</p> <p>Timothy laughed. \u201cBut it\u2019s all right to dress up like a pirate for those same tourist dollars?\u201d</p><p>Jessy flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to some the Ghost Dance is just a show. But to others it\u2019s as real now as it was in Wovoka\u2019s day. I only wish that you would see, that you would understand. That you would believe.\u201d</p><p>Jessy hesitated. \u201cTimothy, you see a different world than I do.\u201d</p><p>Timothy shook his head and addressed Dillon again. \u201cThe dancers in the wall told me that you would come. That you\u2019re here because Jessy is in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy...\u201d Jessy protested.</p><p>But Timothy was looking at Dillon, who smiled slowly. Timothy had known. Whether he had a sixth sense that informed him of danger or really had spoken to men in the walls, somehow he had known, and he seemed as sane a man as any as he spoke to. \u201cShe will find her strength, but she will need you, too.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he looked away, frowning, as if distracted.</p><p>After a moment he looked up at Jessy. \u201cGranddaughter, will you get me more coffee?\u201d</p><p>She cast a speaking glance at Dillon, but she took Timothy\u2019s mug and headed for the buffet.</p><p>As soon as she left the table, Timothy turned to Dillon. He was more than distracted. He was upset. \u201cThey know. They know she was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Who knows she was there?\u201d Dillon asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know their names. I don\u2019t know what they look like. But Billie Tiger just spoke to me. He was here with Wovoka, then lost his life at Wounded Knee.\u201d</p><p>Dillon hesitated, worried that Timothy had lost touch with reality after all.</p><p>Then the old man\u2019s hand fell over Dillon\u2019s, and his grip was steely. \u201cThey know that she can see spirits, and they will come after her. You are her guardian now. You must take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Jessy heard the last as she approached the table, and she tossed her hair behind her shoulder as a cross look rose to her face. She sat down and took Timothy\u2019s hands, forcing him to look at her.</p><p>\u201cTimothy, no one has to look out for me. I\u2019m always careful.\u201d</p><p>Timothy shook his head. \u201cThey are assembling. And once they are all together, they will recreate what happened long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy, here\u2019s your coffee,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>The look in her eyes was distressed, and Dillon knew she was worried that Timothy\u2019s mind was going. He wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>He offered her a small smile, hoping she would realize he was telling her not to worry.</p><p>\u201cTimothy, who is assembling?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who they are, but Billie Tiger said they were there before the Ghost Dance. The civil war was over, and the white men were looking to the West, to the territories. Many were desperate. Others were getting rich on the backs of others.\u201d</p><p>Jessy touched his cheek soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Timothy. The world hasn\u2019t exactly been fixed, but it\u2019s a whole lot better. And a lot of people say the Indian casinos are the tribes\u2019 way of getting revenge on the white men.\u201d</p><p>Timothy shook his head to dismiss her words, then stared at his coffee. \u201cThere\u2019s no cream,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Jessy said, and got up again.</p><p>\u201cTimothy, you were saying?\u201d Dillon prompted as soon as she was gone.</p><p>Timothy stared at him blankly. \u201cI said there was no cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, before that. What were you saying about the ghost dancers and Billie Tiger and things happening again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the ghost dancers. Sometimes they\u2019re in the walls. Sometimes, if you look hard, you can see them in the sky. I really need cream in my coffee,\u201d he said, sighing.</p><p>Dillon sat back. Whatever Timothy might have had to say, it was lost now, and it was impossible to tell whether he really had some kind of an occult connection or if disease was destroying his mind.</p><p>Jessy returned and Timothy smiled broadly as he poured the cream into his coffee, then waved to an attractive older woman across the room. She joined them, and he introduced her as Mrs. Teasdale. The conversation was light and casual after that. Apparently Jessy had promised to take the older couple on an outing, and Mrs. Teasdale was glad\u2014she simply did not go out alone, not even to the mall, not with \u201cthe way things are these days.\u201d</p><p>A little while later Jessy said that they needed to leave so she could get to the casino and start getting ready to go onstage. She was silent in the car, and when he glanced her way, she flashed him a troubled smile, then turned away to look out the window.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t well today,\u201d she said sadly, still looking out at the scenery.</p><p>\u201cActually, I thought he seemed pretty lucid. Believe me, I\u2019ve seen a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>She turned and met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Do you have relatives who...are elderly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019ve just been around,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with the elderly in my investigations,\u201d he explained. He decided this wasn\u2019t the time to tell her that sometimes, when people thought the elderly were crazy, they were just closer to the door that separated one world from the next.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d he told her, reaching out to pat her knee. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I was scared\u2014okay, terrified\u2014when I kept seeing Tanner Green, and I\u2019m very grateful to you for helping me understand what\u2019s going on, but no one has to watch out for me. It\u2019s very strange. Now that I know I\u2019m not crazy. I\u2019m not terrified of seeing Tanner Green again. In fact, I\u2019m going to tell him\u2014if he gets close enough\u2014that I will try to help him.\u201d She was silent for a long moment. \u201cAnd Rudy, too. Though I never met him, so why he\u2019s appearing to me, I have no clue. Oh, Lord. I sound crazy, don\u2019t I? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so worried about Timothy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be all right,\u201d he assured her. \u201cSo will you still be okay if I drop you off at the casino and then do a few things on my own today?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she assured him, flashing a smile. \u201cI swear. I don\u2019t plan to ruin your life.\u201d</p><p>He looked straight out the window. \u201cTrust me. You aren\u2019t ruining my life.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment. \u201cDo you want to stay at my house tonight? Tanner Green might show up.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to smile too broadly. \u201cSure. Sounds good to me. Hey, if I wind up getting back into town late tonight and can\u2019t\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call my friend Sandra to pick me up. She won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Tanner Green was staring at her through the glass again.</p><p>The minute Jessy had come out onstage, she\u2019d noticed him, his face pressed against the glass. He still looked so sad\u2014and so afraid.</p> <p>She offered him a smile, to assure him that she didn\u2019t mind him being there, but he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>She had no choice but to turn her attention to the show, but every once in a while she looked toward the window.</p><p>And he was always there.</p><p>An assistant met Dillon in reception and took him back to autopsy room number 3 to see Doug Tarleton, who met him at the door wearing green scrubs and a matching green mask that hid everything but his eyes, which were a bright hazel, clear and intelligent, behind flip-up magnifying lenses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had Tanner Green brought back out,\u201d he told Dillon, his words clear despite the mask. \u201cThough my report is so complete that I\u2019m not sure what\u2014if anything\u2014else I\u2019ll find. But since Emil Landon is making burial arrangements and doesn\u2019t seem to be in much of a hurry\u2014no one has called yet to ask when we\u2019re releasing the body\u2014I figure there\u2019s time to take one last look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. I never mind looking for something hinky. I had an old guy come through this morning who\u2019d died of what looked like a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>Tarleton shook his head. \u201cThis can be a dangerous city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did he die of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hit the jackpot a little over a year ago. He was already one of those nuts who hobble in with a walker and an oxygen tank, but apparently someone\u2014my guess is his son\u2014couldn\u2019t wait for natural causes to free up all that money. He had enough morphine in his system to kill a rhino. Thing is, he would have died of cancer soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it was a mercy killing. A morphine OD\u2019s a hell of a lot easier than a slow death from cancer,\u201d Dillon commented.</p><p>\u201cThat will be for the cops and the courts to sort out. I just report what the body tells me. Now grab some scrubs or else you\u2019ll be smelling like chemicals and death all day.\u201d</p><p>Dillon did as directed, then followed Tarleton into the autopsy room and toward a sheet-draped form lying on a stainless-steel autopsy table.</p><p>Tarleton pulled down the sheet. Tanner Green, in his dead and bloated nakedness, was not a pretty picture. The man had been heavily muscled, but he\u2019d also been just plain big. In life, he\u2019d liked food and alcohol, predilections that were very apparent as he lay on the table.</p><p>Other than the Y incision made during the initial autopsy, his torso looked unblemished, and his sex lay limp and tiny between the giant slabs of his thighs. Tanner Green, if he could have seen that, would not have been happy at all.</p><p>But if Tanner Green was hanging around the morgue, Dillon didn\u2019t see him. Maybe he had more sense than that, or maybe he hadn\u2019t accepted his own death yet, so he was still hanging around the same places he\u2019d frequented in life.</p><p>\u201cBurton!\u201d Tarleton called, and an assistant, otherwise known as a dernier, materialized in the doorway. \u201cCome over here and lend me a hand, please.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Burton was by his side, Tarleton resumed talking.</p> <p>\u201cAs you can see, there\u2019s no sign of violence or struggle, and when we turn Mr. Tanner over\u2014\u201d he and Burton suited action to words \u201c\u2014there\u2019s your wound. One strike, swift, sure and hard. The blade went in all the way to the hilt, which was short and explains why none of the drunken idiots milling around the entrance or the tables noticed that the man plowing past had a knife in his back.\u201d</p><p>Someone had either been damn lucky or they had known exactly what they were doing, Dillon mused silently. The knife had penetrated cleanly into the lung, missing the ribs. Only someone with either combat or medical training would have been capable of that kind of precision. A jilted girlfriend or angry coworker was unlikely to have managed it.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we can roll him back over now,\u201d Tarleton told Burton. They were both good-size men, but Tanner Green had been built like the proverbial brick shit house, and moving his dead weight was no easy task.</p><p>Burton gave them a nod after Dillon thanked him, then left to resume whatever he\u2019d been doing before Tarleton summoned him.</p><p>\u201cSo the tests came back positive for LSD?\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told you, and that\u2019s the way it was. He was tripping his ass off,\u201d Tarleton said.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how the drug got into his system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIngested. It usually comes in tablet form.\u201d</p><p>Dillon shook his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t see it. I can\u2019t say I knew him well, but...LSD? I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d he repeated. \u201cHell, it\u2019s such an old-fashioned drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t on the streets, right along with the new designer stuff,\u201d Tarleton told him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see him taking it on purpose. Someone must have slipped it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d had a martini or two,\u201d Tarleton said. \u201cCould someone have slipped the LSD into him that way? Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have been with someone he trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe he was tripping, then stumbled into his killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think he was drugged, then killed, and that everything was perpetrated by someone who knew exactly what he was doing,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cWhat about food? Where did he have his last meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like an entertainment directory? I don\u2019t know where, only what. He had steak and mashed potatoes. Not a single vegetable passed his palate, not in the last twenty-four hours, at any rate. Steak and potatoes, at least three hours before his death, for whatever help that will give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Dillon wasn\u2019t sure that the menu helped, but the martinis...they had been mixed somewhere. As far as he knew, though, none of the bartenders in town had contacted the cops to say they had seen Tanner Green in the hours before his death.</p><p>Not that that meant anything. This was Vegas. No one had noticed the knife in his back, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>But now that his face had shown up in the newspapers and on television, someone should have remembered seeing the man. Unless he\u2019d been drinking in private somewhere. In someone\u2019s room.</p><p>In a penthouse, maybe? Emil Landon\u2019s penthouse?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see the other man?\u201d Tarleton asked him.</p><p>\u201cRudy Yorba?\u201d</p><p>Tarleton nodded.</p><p>Inwardly, Dillon winced. He couldn\u2019t help feeling responsible for Rudy\u2019s death. He nodded back.</p><p>\u201cThis way. He\u2019s in a drawer right now. His ex-wife is having the body shipped back East. She wants a proper funeral. They had a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dillon said beneath his breath. They left the autopsy room and walked down a hallway to the room Tarleton referred to as \u201cthe coolers.\u201d</p><p>There, he glanced over the wall of human-content drawers, selected one and opened it.</p><p>Rudy Yorba was virtually unrecognizable. His face was mottled, cut and scraped in a dozen places, and appeared to have been squeezed between the hands of a yeti.</p><p>The body was in no better shape. He was so bruised and broken that it was difficult to see where the Y incision had been made at autopsy.</p><p>A low whistle escaped Dillon\u2019s lungs.</p><p>Tarleton shook his head regretfully. \u201cThe vehicle impact took him in the legs. Speed and force crushed his thighs and threw him backward, against the windshield. His face and upper body took a beating, and his neck was broken\u2014which was the specific cause of death, by the way\u2014all in a few seconds, I\u2019d guess. That action created an equal reaction, and the body was thrown over the embankment, where it bounced and rolled, hitting boulders, sand and the usual roadside crap before coming to a stop. Thank God the poor bastard was already dead at that point. That\u2019s the only plus I can see here. No drugs in his system, not even a whiff of alcohol. His heart was sound, organs were normal\u2014well, had been normal, before the ripping and tearing. No way he could have survived, even if his neck hadn\u2019t been broken. His spleen, pancreas and liver were all ripped to shreds, and he would have bled to death internally in minutes. His last meal was spaghetti, barely digested, probably consumed at the employee cafeteria. He had a heart like a lion. Probably had fifty good years left. He\u2019d been a junkie at one point, but he\u2019d cleaned himself up. He was lily white the night he died.\u201d</p><p>Dillon stared at the corpse. He had seldom seen the human body turned into such a ruin.</p><p>Sorry, buddy, he said silently. I am so damn sorry.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I talked to him not long before it happened,\u201d he said to Tarleton. \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve they were related, then. Prove this conspiracy theory of yours. I\u2019d love to see someone locked up for life for this one,\u201d Tarleton said. \u201cActually, I\u2019d love to see the killer tarred and feathered and then disemboweled, but unfortunately that\u2019s against the law. Anyway, I\u2019d just like to see you bring someone to justice on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Dillon told him. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep in touch,\u201d Tarleton said. \u201cAnd if I can help, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, and thanks.\u201d Dillon paused as Tarleton closed the drawer. \u201cYou might want to suggest to the ex that she request a closed-coffin service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to suggest cremation, actually. But I\u2019m trying to hold on to both bodies a little while longer. Just in case, you know?\u201d</p><p>Dillon nodded and left, depositing his scrubs in a laundry bin on the way out. When he stepped from the building, he looked around, wondering if Tanner or Rudy might have shown up. But the only ghost he saw was Ringo, who was sitting on a bench at a nearby bus stop, one leg crossed over the other, his hat pulled down low over his eyes to shade them from the Vegas sun. He looked up at Dillon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess you got it right,\u201d Ringo said, \u201cTanner Green was watching your girl, and Miss Sparhawk saw him. Confusing? I spent some time up in the penthouse first, watching Emil Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched him stare at a stack of papers. I watched Hugo Blythe sit outside his office, reading magazines. Then I decided your girl needed my maybe-not-so-helpful presence more and left. That\u2019s when I saw her and Tanner Green watching each other. No sign of Rudy Yorba. And Miss Sparhawk looked like she was managing just fine. Does that mean you can introduce us now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Dillon asked, ignoring Ringo\u2019s question. \u201cShe saw him and she wasn\u2019t freaked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was fine,\u201d Ringo said with assurance. \u201cShe\u2019s got a backbone. She just had to get over the it\u2019s-really-a-ghost thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d</p><p>Ringo gave him a dry stare, then sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching people for over a hundred years now. How\u2019s that for a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. You probably know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>Ringo sniffed. \u201cSo when do we let her know about me? The time will come when I might be able to help on this thing, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. So how was the....\u201d Ringo paused and shuddered. \u201cThe morgue? Hell, when I died, they just threw me into a hole in the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Indigo?\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, in Indigo,\u201d Ringo agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s time. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Dillon told him, and Ringo rose and followed him to the car, along with the ever-present jingling of his spurs.</p> <p>Tanner Green didn\u2019t stay for the entire show, and Jessy actually forgot about the ghost for a while because there were so many children and parents who lingered that day. She signed autographs and posed for a seemingly endless succession of pictures.</p><p>After saying goodbye to a pretty, young woman who had accompanied two five-year-olds, she looked up and realized she was the only one left on set.</p><p>She got up and headed backstage, and was just approaching the curtain that separated the set from the dressing rooms when she heard a sudden whooshing sound. She turned just in time to see one of the giant sails, rigged to fall apart when a fake cannon boomed, swinging toward her. She let out a yelp and fell flat on the floor, rolling away more quickly than she would have thought possible.</p><p>She heard the mast crash as it fell, which it did during every performance, but all the players were safely on the deck of the ship when it happened.</p><p>She scrambled to her feet and shouted up into the rigging, \u201cHey! Idiot! I\u2019m still here! Quit messing with the set until I\u2019m in the clear.\u201d</p><p>There was no answer, though she thought she heard a scrambling in the rigging, and her heart started to pound. Had she heard human footsteps...?</p><p>Or a ghost?</p><p>She walked back to the women\u2019s dressing room to find April just slipping into her dress.</p> <p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d the other woman asked. \u201cGood show today, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014until the sail just almost fell on me,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d April said. \u201cBetter tell the stage manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m outta here, then. Hey, where\u2019s tall, dark and to-die-for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to work,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>April grinned. \u201cBummer. Well, you take care, sweetie. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Before changing, Jessy found the stage manager, Ron Pearl, and told him what had happened. He was perplexed and concerned, though she had a feeling he was more worried about the legal repercussions of someone getting hurt than how she herself was actually feeling. But he swore he would find out what had happened, so she left him to it and headed back to the dressing room.</p><p>She was alone there as she cleaned her face and changed into her street clothes, and though she felt edgy, her senses heightened, as far as she could tell there were no ghosts in sight.</p><p>As soon as she was dressed, she called Sandra, who was delighted with the idea of meeting her for dinner on the Strip.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Jessy had left the casino and was waiting out front for Sandra to show up that she once again had the sense of someone watching her, raising goose pimples on her flesh.</p><p>She paused, looking around. There were people everywhere, some just strolling along sightseeing, others hurrying toward some unknown destination. Some were alone and quiet, while others talked and laughed as they passed in groups. And some of them were weaving as if they were already drunk.</p><p>None of them was Tanner Green or Rudy Yorba.</p><p>Despite her inability to spot anyone, she was sure she was being followed. The thing of it was, she didn\u2019t think her shadow was a ghost.</p><p>She was being stalked.</p><p>By someone who was very much alive.</p><p>10</p><p>Indigo.</p><p>It was a ghost town now, and Dillon parked in the dust alongside what passed for a road, then got out and leaned against the hood, looking around. He knew without even glancing over that Ringo was next to him, just checking out the place, the same as he was doing.</p><p>It might have been a movie set. The facades of the buildings were faded but still mostly intact, facing the barren and godforsaken stretch of road that had once lived up to the name of Main Street. Sand and dust coated everything with a film that only added to the surreal effect. The road itself remained dirt, as it had always been. Time and the elements had left it a rutted mess.</p><p>The remains of the sidewalks that fronted the buildings were wooden, the boards, cracked and broken, at least where they weren\u2019t missing altogether. Peeling, faded paint still proclaimed the names of various buildings: Leif\u2019s Livery, Miners\u2019 Bank of Nevada, even\u2014decipherable despite the missing letters\u2014Martin\u2019s Harness, N w and Repa red. A freestanding house advertised itself as the office of Dr. Benjamin Sully, M.D.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the jail,\u201d Ringo pointed out, and Dillon looked over and made out the words Sheriff\u2019s Office, Town of Indigo, Nevada.</p><p>Dillon had been to Indigo twice before. The second time was after his grandfather had died and Ringo had come to stay. Dillon had learned his story and come here to see the town through Ringo\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d been here once before that because his ancestor John Wolf, a legend to his tribe, had associations with the town. John Wolf had given his own life so that a white girl, a Paiute adoptee, could live, in the process protecting the tribe\u2019s claim to the land beneath the town, as well as a nearby claim. Though the claim hadn\u2019t yielded the riches the tribe had dreamed of, this was still Indian land. A man named Varny\u2014a con artist with a nasty streak\u2014had ruled the town until he and John had shot each other in the same gunfight that had killed Ringo. With Varny\u2019s death, the brothels and bars he ran closed, and that\u2014combined with the fact that the rest of the claim hadn\u2019t yielded the hoped-for gold\u2014had completed the demise of Indigo. Roads and the railroad had gone elsewhere, and the town had become nothing more than a proud but ultimately worthless symbol of one man\u2019s victory over injustice.</p><p>Ringo had attached himself to Dillon because he was a descendant of John Wolf, and he had admired John during their brief acquaintance. The white girl, Mariah, had been Dillon\u2019s many-times great-grand-mother. Mariah had been pregnant with John\u2019s child when he\u2019d died. Ensuing years of inter-racial marriage had created his own mix of white and Indian blood.</p><p>Indigo didn\u2019t look any different now than since he\u2019d been here the first time, much less since the last. A few years back, some Hollywood execs had paid the tribe to rent out the town for a movie. But the desert reclaimed its own quickly, and whatever minor improvements they made had been wiped away quickly.</p><p>\u201cIndigo,\u201d Ringo said, shaking his head. \u201cDo you think that Jessy heard right? Why in hell was that Tanner Green\u2019s dying word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Has to mean something,\u201d Dillon said. He looked at Ringo curiously. \u201cDo you remember yours? Did you have a dying word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, I\u2019m sure they were something like \u2018Fuck you, sucker,\u2019\u201d Ringo told him wryly. \u201cIt was all too fast, though. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell could Tanner Green have to do with Indigo?\u201d Dillon wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cNothing to do but start looking around,\u201d Ringo said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cThink those movie people changed the place much?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks to me like they put all the dust back exactly where it had been,\u201d Ringo told him.</p><p>Dillon laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll start with the livery,\u201d Ringo said, then paused, shaking his head as he pointed farther down the street. \u201cThere she is\u2014the old Crystal Canary. Some of the gals they had there could actually sing. There was one pretty little thing...Oh, well. That was a long time ago. Okay, you take the left side, I\u2019ll take the right.\u201d Then he stood still for a moment, looking around.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dillon asked him.</p><p>\u201cWe can meet in the saloon.\u201d Ringo pointed to the building in question, where one of the swinging doors now hung lopsidedly from a single hinge.</p><p>\u201cWhen the sun goes down, the rays reach right into the saloon. That was when it happened. Right when the sunset began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We can go check it out in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ringo asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because we\u2019re here\u2014for some reason,\u201d Dillon told him. He found himself remembering his discussion with Timothy Sparhawk. Was this what he\u2019d meant when he said they were all coming together again? It made no sense. Ringo had been here, and so had John Wolf, but what did any of that have to do with Tanner Green?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Ringo, spurs clinking, walked off toward the livery stables.</p><p>Dillon started with the bank.</p><p>His eyes had to adjust to the sudden shadow when he stepped through the doorway\u2014an easy maneuver, since the door itself was gone. He almost stepped through a hole in the floor left by a broken floorboard, but he saw it at the last minute and avoided it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The windows facing the street were a dusty, grimy gray. The counter remained, and the bars that had separated the tellers from the customers were still in place. A locked gate separated the outer area from the inner workings, but it was low, and Dillon easily leaped over it. There were drawers at all the tellers\u2019 stations, but whatever adding machines they might have used were long gone. In a back office he came across a desk with a broken swivel chair. Opening one of the drawers, Dillon found a dead scorpion and a pile of rat droppings.</p><p>There was a safe in the back, but the iron door was open, the lock was broken, and the safe itself was completely empty.</p><p>In short, there was nothing in the bank to tie Tanner Green to the place.</p> <p>Next he checked the doctor\u2019s office. The examining room still held a table but nothing else, and the windows were mostly devoid of panes. The wallpaper had once been rose patterned, but the design was almost impossible to discern anymore. Several old photographs were hanging at skewed angles in the entryway. There was one that seemed to be of the doctor, standing unsmilingly next to his equally unsmiling wife.</p><p>After checking out the lower level, which held the doctor\u2019s office, the examining room and a small waiting room, Dillon carefully climbed the stairs, testing each step before he placed his weight on it, and found only empty rooms where the doctor and his wife had once lived.</p><p>Next on his side of the street was the pharmacy, and he found it oddly appealing. Ornate Victorian grillwork framed the counter, and behind it, there was an old blown-glass candy dispenser, although the dead insects in it broke the old-time illusion. Still, if you ignored the insects, it was a pretty piece. Dillon imagined that, long ago, useless tonics as well as prescriptions for laudanum, had once been handed across this counter from seller to buyer. Upstairs\u2014where he decided he probably shouldn\u2019t have ventured, given the rather spongy state of the floor\u2014he found nothing, just as he had at the doctor\u2019s house. No furniture, no photos, nothing. Just three empty rooms.</p><p>He moved on. There were four more buildings to explore before he reached the saloon. One had been the general store, and another appeared to have been a dentist\u2019s office. A reclining leather chair\u2014mostly eaten away by worm rot or other tiny predators\u2014was surprisingly suggestive of the modern-day dental equivalent.</p><p>The third building had been the undertaker\u2019s parlor. Once Dillon\u2019s eyes adjusted to the dim light, he saw that, unlike what he\u2019d seen elsewhere, many of the artifacts of the time still remained. There was an outer office, and right behind it, a large room that was still filled with cheap coffins. They were mostly just plain wooden boxes. One was leaning up against the wall, and closer inspection revealed that it was stained in a number of places with what might have been blood. Dillon wondered if it had been used to display the unsavory characters who had been apprehended and shot for their crimes, a graphic warning to everyone else to behave.</p> <p>The last building, right next to the saloon, was the newspaper office. The faded but still legible sign informed him that, at one time, the Indigo Independent had been quartered there.</p><p>At first glance, there was nothing left in the front room but broken desks, swivel chairs and\u2014Dillon discovered, after gingerly inspecting a mass in one corner\u2014a torn canvas hat, the type a harried typesetter might have worn.</p><p>He was pretty sure that the rotting machinery in back had once been a printing press, and up the stairs, he came across nothing other than two offices. One desk yielded several sheets of yellowed paper, but when he went to touch them, they fell into dust. He made a mental note to get to a local library and see if any past issues of the Indigo Independent had been preserved in any form.</p><p>He looked out a window and saw Ringo coming from the sheriff\u2019s office across the street, and went downstairs and stepped outside to meet him.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he called to Ringo.</p><p>\u201cNope. How about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Let\u2019s go check out the saloon,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Dillon entered ahead of Ringo, and there was something eerie in the clinking of Ringo\u2019s spurs behind him.</p><p>\u201cThe poker table is still here, and the chairs,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cLook, pieces of the broken chair are still piled up by the wall. Hell, they left the old piano, too. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>Dillon narrowed his eyes, trying to imagine what had taken place here a century and a half ago.</p><p>The bar still stretched across one long wall. There were several tables, and then, against the wall, the old piano. At the far end of the room there was a small stage.</p><p>A staircase led to the second story, where a balcony lined most of the second floor, the wooden railing leaning precariously, the handsome carved posts broken in places, completely gone in others. Once, he thought, saloon girls had plied their trade in those rooms up the stairs, decked out in their frilliest\u2014and sexiest\u2014attire as they stared down at the clientele, trying to find the least repulsive cowhand or miner.</p><p>Or the one with the most money.</p><p>He returned his gaze to the poker table, where Ringo was standing and gazing down ruefully.</p> <p>\u201cMy cards sucked,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cThat day, the real competition was all between John Wolf and that fool from the East. Mark Davison, that was his name.\u201d</p><p>There were no longer cards on the table, only a thick layer of Nevada sand and the dust of time.</p><p>\u201cTell me about that day,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the stories, but you were there, and I need to know details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t been out here all that long,\u201d Ringo said, taking a seat. \u201cMilly was singing. She wasn\u2019t great, but she was all right. All-right singer, good barmaid, lousy whore. But with the pickings around here, beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRingo, I need you to tell me what happened, not rate people like they were contestants on American Idol,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Ringo said, leaning back in the old chair until it rested on two rickety legs. \u201cAlthough I have to say that George Turner, the mixed-blood who played the piano, was damn good. Ahead of his time. He should have been born today. He\u2019d have been rich and famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Dillon said dryly. \u201cNow tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the whole thing. I died, remember? I wasn\u2019t afraid of dying. I\u2019d been in the war. I\u2019d seen people die bad. It was just bad in general, in those days, especially in the South. That\u2019s why so many of us came West. That\u2019s the thing with war...they teach you to use a gun and tell you to kill. Then it\u2019s all over, and what the hell do you know but how to use a gun? That\u2019s why Varny took control so easy. Folks were used to the fellow with the biggest gun controlling the situation, you know?\u201d He noticed Dillon\u2019s impatient look and said, \u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019m getting to it. Let\u2019s see...I got here first. I think Grant Percy, the so-called sheriff\u2014though he was really just Varny\u2019s lapdog\u2014came in when I was at the bar, and then that Mark Davison. He was a real wannabe, as you call it these days. He\u2019d thrown his lot in with Varny, but I think Varny knew he was a useless shit. Anyway, then your great-great-grandpa comes in. It was like he was geared up from the minute he got here. You know, you remind me of him a lot. Same eyes. And you could see in his eyes that there was something besides cards on his mind, but he could hold his peace real good. He had patience.</p><p>\u201cSo we all start playing\u2014George is at the piano, Milly is singing, the bartender is dishing out the whiskey. We\u2019re here\u2014I\u2019m in the same chair I\u2019m taking up now, so to speak. We\u2019re all kind of angled, cuz in this town, no man worth his salt ever turned his back on the door. The last hand came down to Davison and Wolf, and the sheriff and I were kind of just waiting to get back into it. Then Varny showed up. Here\u2019s the thing. Wolf intended to see Varny. But I don\u2019t think he was expecting him so soon. John Wolf had a real poker face, and still, cool as he was, I could tell Varny took him by surprise that day.</p><p>\u201cWolf\u2019s clan didn\u2019t live far from here. I\u2019m thinking they were coming in that evening, maybe, so he wouldn\u2019t be taking on Varny and his thugs alone. Who the hell knows now? Anyway, Varny shows up, and he and Wolf get into a thing over the gold. You know. The gold everyone thought was just outside town somewhere. They started arguing over who owned the land. Then the gunfire started. I took out a couple of Varny\u2019s hired guns, but not before one of them got me. I remember dying. I was hit hard and fast, and I was thinking, hell no, I\u2019m too young to die, this can\u2019t be happening. I remember all the guns. All the blood. I was already dying, maybe even already dead, when they dragged the girl in. Mariah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy great-great...however many greats, grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know if I really saw her then, or if I\u2019ve just heard the story so many times that I think I did. You know how it is. We hear things often enough and they turn into memories. Did I really see her as I was dying? I don\u2019t know. But I do know that John Wolf would have died a thousand times over to save her. And that there was something he needed to tell her. I\u2019ve had a long time to think about it, and I think it must have had to do with the gold everyone thought was here. That\u2019s what they were fighting over. Land. Gold. Wolf had made sure this was Paiute land, but no one ever found the gold. So we all pretty much died over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the poker players died that day, right?\u201d Dillon said after giving Ringo a moment for reflection.</p><p>\u201cDead as doornails,\u201d Ringo agreed. \u201cAlong with Varny and a bunch of his henchmen. Mariah lived, though. Of course, you already know that. She was pregnant, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re here now. And that\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d</p><p>Dillon stared at him. \u201cExcept that it\u2019s not\u2014because a twenty-first century man whispered the name of the place right before he died.\u201d</p><p>Ringo looked toward the door. \u201cIt was just like it is now. See the way the sky is turning all bloodred and gold? I remember thinking, before Varny walked in and everything went to hell, that this town might be a stinking disaster of sand and sagebrush, but when you looked out at a sunset like that, it made everything around you all beautiful. And then the shooting started and the blood was real, and pretty soon all I saw was darkness. Not even the fires of hell,\u201d Ringo said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darkness. Dillon felt inexplicably uneasy that night was coming quickly. Night\u2014and darkness. He felt a stirring in his mind, an elusive idea that teased and then disappeared. Was something Ringo had just said a clue of some kind? If so, the word elusive was dead-on. Dillon couldn\u2019t shake the sudden feeling that he needed to get back to town. He dismissed the idea that he had nearly been onto something. After all, he\u2019d already known what happened here; it was clan lore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back out here and explore again another day,\u201d Dillon said suddenly.</p><p>Darkness.</p> <p>The idea haunted him.</p><p>It was time to be getting back. Jessy had finished work hours ago now, and even though she\u2019d sworn she wouldn\u2019t go anywhere alone, that she would call her friend Sandra to pick her up, Dillon didn\u2019t want her out in the dark without him to take care of her.</p><p>He left the saloon, and Ringo rose at last and took a last long look around the place before following him out.</p><p>At the car, Ringo paused before getting in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dillon asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the old cemetery over there. Can\u2019t see much anymore. Looks like the crosses are all broken or long gone. But you can see some of the stones ringing the graves. They carried me over there. Took a look at me and said, \u2018That bastard\u2019s dead, just dump in him the ground.\u2019 No, that\u2019s not fair. Some preacher did say a few words over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring flowers and set up a cross next time we come,\u201d Dillon assured him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I think my pa was half-Jewish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get a star of David and a cross, how\u2019s that?\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cI like it. And you can add whatever mumbo jumbo your people do, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Dillon assured him. \u201cNow get in the damn car, will you? It\u2019s an hour\u2019s drive back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you admit you like him?\u201d Sandra teased, speaking up to be heard over the crowd in the restaurant. \u201cI think that\u2019s great. Now tell me all the details. Well, no, not all the details, but...a few of them, okay? Is he as fantastic as he looks? You know, sometimes the pretty boys aren\u2019t so hot in bed. I mean, they\u2019re so accustomed to being adored that they think it\u2019s all about them. They like the rabbit thing. Wham, wham, wham. I\u2019m done, let\u2019s light up a few cigarettes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a pretty boy,\u201d Jessy protested, laughing, happy to realize that the world seemed right again. Sandra always had that effect on her. The other woman was down to earth and funny, and even when she was serious, it was with a grain of irony. Life was what it was. Ups and downs, the good and bad. Sandra had perspective, and it was one of the things Jessy treasured about her.</p><p>In fact, the minute she had seen Sandra pull up in front of the casino, she had felt better.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>No longer so certain that a living stalker was following in her footsteps, that she might suddenly be whisked away, unnoticed. That she might disappear, with no one to tell her story.</p><p>Now Sandra leaned across the table and said, \u201cOkay, no pressing on the sexual details. As long as he was good. I mean, if you\u2019re only going to break down and have one affair a decade, it at least ought to be hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. So tell me about the ghost-busting thing,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cDoes he find ghosts? And what does he do then? It\u2019s not like he can call the cops and have them arrested. Tell me. I\u2019m an inquiring mind, and I want to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandra, he didn\u2019t go into details with me. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s allowed to talk about his cases.\u201d She hated lying to Sandra, but she just wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready to spit out the fact that, yes, there really were ghosts, and in fact she was being followed by one, and Dillon Wolf was trying to help her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he could tell some amazing stories,\u201d Sandra told her. \u201cI would love, just love, to hear a few of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as he tells me some, I\u2019ll share,\u201d Jessy promised.</p><p>\u201cDo we actually have a waitress here, or what?\u201d Sandra frowned. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a margarita.\u201d She looked around, trying and failing to catch a waitress\u2019s eye, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back. Looks like I need to go to the bar if I\u2019m thirsty. Salt or no salt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me. Salt or no salt?\u201d Sandra asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, might as well go all the way. Salt,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>As Sandra walked through a growing crowd to the bar, Jessy drummed her fingers on the table and looked around. She could see out to the street, where nothing suspicious seemed to be going on, so she took a minute to look around the restaurant. The place was open and airy, but busy, its reasonably priced food and proximity to several major casinos making it popular. It had to be one of the safest places in the world to be.</p><p>Not too many people were sitting at tables this early, though, she realized. Most people seemed to come in and just mill around. She saw Sandra hand a bartender her credit card, then turned back to study the room at large again.</p><p>And there they were.</p><p>Tanner Green.</p><p>And, beyond him, Rudy Yorba.</p><p>It felt as if her heart skipped a beat, but she wasn\u2019t afraid. Tanner Green was seated at a little round-topped table just a few feet away. Rudy Yorba was two tables behind Green. Both of them were just watching her. She wasn\u2019t sure that Green even knew Rudy was there, because the smaller man seemed to be trying not to be noticed.</p><p>This was crazy, she thought. Did one ghost automatically see another? Did some ghosts hide from other ghosts? Dillon seemed to think that Tanner Green hadn\u2019t accepted the fact that he was dead. What about Rudy Yorba?</p><p>She glanced quickly back to the bar. Sandra looked back, smiled and waved, then turned to watch the bartender mix their drinks.</p><p>Jessy rummaged in her purse, and found her address book and a pen. She pretended to accidentally drop the pen. She wasn\u2019t a coward by nature, and it was time to be proactive. She pretended to reach for her dropped pen but instead kicked it closer to Tanner Green\u2019s table, then stood and walked to where he was sitting.</p><p>How the hell did she talk to a ghost without appearing to be stone-cold crazy?</p><p>She ducked down and picked up the pen, speaking softly and swiftly as she did so.</p><p>\u201cI want to help you,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to know what you know. And, by the way, there\u2019s a young man sitting just beyond you who apparently knows something or needs something, too. I\u2019d really like to help you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessy, is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>The voice startled her so badly that she almost slammed her head into the underside of the table as she stood.</p><p>Tanner Green was gone, and once again, Rudy Yorba had apparently followed him.</p><p>The man standing above her was real. She knew him casually because she\u2019d chatted to him around both the Sun and at the Big Easy, where they\u2019d sat and talked once after her show.</p><p>His name was Darrell Frye, and he was a pit boss at the Sun. In fact, he\u2019d been running the craps table the night she\u2019d made her money, though he\u2019d been spelled by another man before Tanner Green had come in.</p><p>He was ambitious, she knew. He might be a pit boss now, but wanted to move up to entertainment manager at the Sun. He had told her as much when he had come to see the pirate show. It had been flattering when he told her that people from the Sun had seen her work, and he\u2019d heard them talking about the idea of her moving over to one of their shows. He\u2019d admitted that if he was the one who brought her over, it would help his own career.</p><p>\u201cDarrell, hi,\u201d she said, rising. \u201cI just dropped my pen, that\u2019s all. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks, and yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He was tall, six feet or even six-one, the kind of man who wore a suit well and was attractive without being drop-dead gorgeous. In fact, with sandy hair and eyes the same color, he wasn\u2019t the kind of man you really remembered. He had always been nice to her, and honest, so she didn\u2019t really mind that he had hoped to lure her over to the Sun at least as much for his own benefit as hers.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked her, concerned. \u201cI heard that guy died right on top of you the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did, but I\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want it to be my usual evening, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the police bugging you about it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo one is bugging me. I didn\u2019t know the man. He walked in and fell on me, and that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you weren\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s been a shitty few days. First, Tanner Green. Then Rudy Yorba. He was a really nice guy. I hope you won\u2019t hold it against the Sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t and I don\u2019t,\u201d Jessy assured him.</p><p>\u201cSo you might still consider coming over to the Sun? I bet they\u2019d let you help develop a project from the ground up,\u201d Darrell told her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I really appreciate the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargarita?\u201d Sandra interrupted. She had two glasses and was standing next to Jessy like a guardian Amazon, tall, beautiful and obviously ready to go to war if Jessy was being harassed in any way.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jessy said, taking her drink from Sandra. \u201cSandra, I\u2019d like you to meet Darrell Frye. Darrell, my very good friend Sandra Nelson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Darrell said formally, smiling and offering his hand with obvious appreciation.</p><p>Only a blind man wouldn\u2019t appreciate Sandra\u2019s appearance, Jessy thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks, nice to meet you,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cDarrell is a pit boss over at the Sun,\u201d Jessy explained.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cIt must be tough there right now.\u201d</p><p>Darrell shrugged. \u201cI began my vacation the day after Tanner Green died, so I haven\u2019t had to deal with any of it. They\u2019ve asked me to come back in, though\u2014they\u2019re extra busy. Seems people are intrigued by everything that\u2019s happened. Sick, huh? Anyway, it\u2019s been a pleasure meeting you, Sandra. And, Jessy, please remember me if you ever want a change of scenery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darrell just stood there, then, as if hoping to be invited to join them. Sandra, however, made it clear that the two of them were enjoying a girls\u2019 night out. She stared challengingly at him, waiting for him to leave.</p><p>\u201cWell, have fun,\u201d he said at last, and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tough!\u201d Jessy said, laughing, as Sandra set her drink down and pulled out her chair, a frown creasing her forehead.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like his vibe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis vibe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants something from you, and you can do much better,\u201d Sandra said. She grinned. \u201cYou have done much better. Can\u2019t forget tall, dark and handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I haven\u2019t. But you don\u2019t need to worry about Darrell. He just wants me to leave the Big Easy and work for the Sun,\u201d Jessy explained.</p><p>Sandra stared out at the street as if she was still watching the man, though of course he was long gone. Finally she shook her head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. Not to take anything away from your talent, honey, because you know I think you\u2019re great, but\u2014this is Vegas. Beautiful, talented women are everywhere here. He doesn\u2019t need to go stealing people to work for his casino. You need to watch out for him. He wants something. And like I said, I don\u2019t like his vibe. Trust me, I\u2019ve been around a few blocks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an opportunist, I\u2019ll admit, but so are lots of people.\u201d</p><p>Sandra shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s something about him. He\u2019s bad news. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Jessy started to reply, but before she could, she heard a familiar voice call her name. \u201cJessy!\u201d</p><p>She turned to see her fellow pirate queen, April, on the arm of a handsome stranger.</p><p>\u201cDenny, meet my friend Jessy and her friend...Sandra, right? Guys, this is Denny,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>Sandra and Jessy smiled and shook hands with April\u2019s new man.</p> <p>\u201cWe were just heading on over to Harrah\u2019s when I saw you two,\u201d April said, \u201cand I just had to stop. I was worried about you, Jessy. Did you report the incident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, and Ron said he\u2019d look into it,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat incident?\u201d Sandra asked sharply.</p><p>Jessy waved a hand in the air. \u201cNothing, a piece of the set came down when it shouldn\u2019t have, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said. \u201cI talked to our stage manager, and he\u2019s going to have it checked out. All\u2019s well that ends well, just like they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good, I just wanted to make sure you were okay. See ya!\u201d April said, and left, waving. They waved back.</p><p>Sandra leaned in. \u201cExactly what fell?\u201d she demanded, frowning fiercely.</p><p>\u201cOne of the big sails that\u2019s supposed to fall during the battle scene. It scared me, but I wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Sandra said firmly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, of course it\u2019s not good. And I reported it,\u201d Jessy said. Before either of them could say anything else, her phone rang. She answered and was glad to hear Dillon\u2019s voice on the other end. She told him where she and Sandra were, and when she hung up, Sandra was watching her excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Sandra sat back then and sipped her drink, still eyeing Jessy. \u201cI\u2019m very worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVibes,\u201d Sandra said knowingly.</p><p>\u201cSandra, listen to me. Darrell\u2019s a perfectly nice guy, and what happen with the set this afternoon was an accident\u2014just an accident.\u201d</p><p>Sandra leaned forward again, her expression intense. \u201cYou\u2019re too trusting. What if it wasn\u2019t an accident? What if someone was trying to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone really was trying to kill me, I doubt his weapon of choice would be a big canvas sail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I heard it falling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have beaned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Sandra. It was an accident, not a murder attempt. I mean, I might have been hurt if I\u2019d been a bit slower, but I wouldn\u2019t have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been a warning, then,\u201d Sandra said sagely. \u201cSomeone wanting you to back off from...something.</p><p>\u201cSandra, any member of the cast could have been out there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t any member of the cast, it was you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThis is scary, very scary.\u201d She stood suddenly, looking past Jessy, smiled and said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Sandra Nelson. And you must be Dillon Wolf.\u201d</p><p>Jessy turned and smiled at Dillon as Sandra continued to talk.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can talk some sense into her, since she thinks I\u2019ve gone off the deep end just because no matter what she says about it being an accident, I think someone tried to kill her this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>The lights were neon and garish, the streets wild and busy, and the bar was doing a bang-up business in cocktails, while the sober, semisober and downright drunk laughed and talked around them.</p><p>Taking a seat at the table, Dillon frowned at Jessy. She should have been safe at work, surrounded by other people.</p><p>If Rudy Yorba hadn\u2019t died in what had clearly been meant to be mistaken for an accident, he might not be so concerned. But Rudy Yorba was dead, smashed almost beyond recognition.</p><p>Other people had seen the security tapes of the night Tanner Green had been murdered. Cops, casino personnel. What if someone\u2014someone complicit in the murder\u2014had noticed that Green had opened his mouth, had said something to Jessy before dying.</p><p>Indigo.</p><p>Would that mean something to the killer? Because it sure as hell didn\u2019t mean anything to him. The place was a ghost town, nothing but a ghost town.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened\u2014exactly what happened,\u201d Dillon said to Jessy.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing. You\u2019ve seen the show. When we attack Port Royal, the guns of the port fire back and we lose a sail. The sail fell again after the show was over and I happened to be walking by, that\u2019s all.\u201d In an effort to change the subject she looked more closely at Dillon and asked, \u201cWhat have you been up to? You\u2019re all dusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a drive out to the desert today,\u201d he told her. \u201cI guess I could use a shower and some clean clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a margarita?\u201d Sandra suggested.</p><p>He shook his head, smiling. \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather have that shower, I think.\u201d</p><p>As they walked Sandra out to her car, she plied Dillon with questions about his job with Harrison Investigations, which he answered politely. There were so many things, he said, that no one could be sure of, but he could assure her that he\u2019d never personally seen any evidence that a ghost had harmed anyone who was innocent of wrongdoing.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean a ghost will harm a bad guy?\u201d Sandra asked him eagerly.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt means exactly what I said. We\u2019re called in when inexplicable things are happening, but there\u2019s usually an explanation that\u2019s completely real-world. I suppose that if a ghost could manage to move objects, it could also manage to hurt someone with them. But we usually find a real perp behind whatever\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached Sandra\u2019s car, which she\u2019d left in a casino garage. Dillon opened the driver\u2019s side door for her and checked out the interior as she settled herself behind the wheel. \u201cDrive safely,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cAnd you\u2014watch out for Jessy. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to,\u201d Dillon assured her.</p><p>They watched her drive away, and he was silent as he slipped an arm around Jessy, leading her back toward the elevator. Finally he said, \u201cI think maybe Sandra\u2019s right to be worried about what happened to you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon, Sandra is a good friend, and I love her for worrying about me, but nothing that happened this afternoon was anything other than an accident.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and let that go unchallenged, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s your work schedule, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually have Mondays and Tuesdays off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you work tomorrow, then you\u2019re off for two days,\u201d he said thoughtfully, feeling an unwelcome sense of urgency. Maybe it was paranoia. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t be so afraid for her. But he was. He had barely spoken to Rudy Yorba, and Rudy had died. He and Jessy...</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to your place,\u201d he said.</p><p>They walked to his car, which he\u2019d parked in a public lot by one of the huge shopping plazas. They were halfway back to her place when she turned to him excitedly. \u201cI forgot to tell you! Tanner Green was back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d she said, surprised. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be happy. Weren\u2019t you hoping he\u2019d come back?\u201d</p><p>Dillon gave himself a mental head-slap as he realized that she didn\u2019t know that Ringo had been watching Tanner Green watch. He really did need to tell her about Ringo.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was sure he would come back. He\u2019s trying to reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he was at the show. And then, when Sandra and I were at the bar, I saw him again, and Rudy Yorba was behind him, acting like maybe he didn\u2019t want to be seen. I tried to talk to Tanner, and I\u2019m pretty sure he heard me, but then we were interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Dillon asked, his attention sharpening. This was news\u2014very interesting news. \u201cWho interrupted you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just Darrell Frye. He\u2019s a pit boss at the Sun. You\u2019ve seen him. He was there the night I won all that money. He wants to get a job in entertainment management, so he talked to me a few weeks ago about going to work over there. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe went off shift right before Green died. I\u2019ve been wanting to speak with him, see if he remembered anything, saw anything. They told me he was on vacation, and I haven\u2019t had a chance to track him down yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when he came up and started talking to me, Tanner Green and Rudy Yorba both disappeared,\u201d she told him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did that mean anything? Dillon wondered. He didn\u2019t know, but now he wanted to talk to the man more than ever.</p><p>Right now, though...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what any of this means,\u201d Dillon told her, looking at her thoughtfully. He was glad she was no longer frightened about seeing the ghosts, had even sounded excited about it. But he was worried that even at work she might have been in danger. The puzzle pieces were starting to connect, but the final picture was still a mystery.</p> <p>They reached her house, where he went through every room before heading into the shower.</p><p>He\u2019d barely been there for ten seconds when she joined him.</p><p>Her presence was a piece of earthly magic that seemed to drive away all thoughts of puzzles and fears, and even the world around him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was the fact that she had entranced him at first sight, or if it had to do with the sleek, lean, beautifully muscled elegance of her body, the blue of her eyes, the tone of her voice, or even the essence of her soul, but she aroused him in a way that went beyond the sexual, beyond the instinctive rise of his libido in an animalistic reaction older than time. He wouldn\u2019t say that he loved her; love took time. But he knew that he was falling in love with her, and that she touched the core of him in a way no other woman ever had.</p><p>The look of mischief in her eyes was his undoing, followed by the sight of the steamy, hot water sluicing over the ivory perfection of her skin, shoulders and breasts, back and buttocks. It was the erotic feel of flesh against flesh as she pressed against him. It was finding her lips beneath the spray and exploring the recesses of her mouth, hotter than the water falling over them.</p> <p>It was touching her. His hands sliding down her naked flesh, cupping her breasts, slipping between her thighs into intimacy.</p><p>She moved against him, the friction of her body irresistibly erotic. All so seductive, driving him to an agony of excitement and arousal. Her hands were on him then, kneading his muscles, her nails scraping teasingly over his skin. His lips broke away from hers, and he forced her back against the tiles, his mouth moving frenziedly against her flesh.</p><p>They made love in the heated steam, with him lifting her as she wrapped her limbs around him in wicked splendor. The roar of the water pounded in his heart and lungs like a tempest, and after they climaxed, he fumbled for the taps, then stumbled out of the shower, still holding her against him as if he wanted to keep her there forever.</p><p>He carried her to her bed, where they fell together onto the mattress and began anew, devouring one another with hands and lips and tongues, taking time, savoring each other\u2019s wet, clean and hot flesh, touching and tasting again and again, and reveling in the complete intimacy they had found with one another. She knew how to move, how to seduce, but it was never calculated, never planned, just an instinctive part of her beauty and being. Even when she wasn\u2019t beneath him or atop him, she was somehow rubbing against him, sliding along him with supple movements that aroused him all over again. She met his mouth with her own at just the right moment, showered his body with kisses, took his sex in her mouth and teased him until he was ready to explode. When he couldn\u2019t take any more, he rolled her beneath him, desire raging inside him again as she responded to his touch, as he caressed her breasts, her belly, her thighs, then moved between them, first with his hands, then with his mouth, until he possessed her, body and soul.</p><p>Sometime in the night, exhausted and spent, they slept at last.</p><p>He woke early. She was still asleep, and like any new lover, he spared a few minutes to watch her. He found himself entranced anew by the fiery cascade of her hair over the pillows, the fine structure of her face, the way her lips were slightly parted as she breathed. He tucked the covers carefully around her and rose, then dressed quickly before heading into the kitchen and started making coffee. He didn\u2019t do anything about food, since he had a feeling she would want to join her grandfather again at the home and eat something there.</p> <p>As the coffee brewed, he took out his cell phone and started making calls. This was no longer a one-man job.</p><p>Dillon could tell that Jessy was both surprised and pleased that he and Timothy got on as if they had known each other forever. When she took advantage of that fact and went to speak with her grandfather\u2019s doctor, he got a chance to talk to Timothy by himself, without having to worry about upsetting her.</p><p>\u201cSo, Timothy,\u201d he began casually, \u201cyou can see the ghost dancers, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>For a moment the old man just looked out the window, as if he hadn\u2019t heard. Then he turned to stare challengingly at Dillon. \u201cI know why you\u2019ve come back. You\u2019re here because the desire for riches never ends. Men are greedy. They don\u2019t care what they do to other people if it makes them richer.\u201d He shook his head sorrowfully. \u201cMan has always been greedy, quick to slay his fellow man if it will bring him material gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d Dillon said carefully, \u201cmany of our people called themselves simply the Human Beings. We wanted to be good, as the Great Spirit asked. To care for the children, the injured, the needy. Yes, greed has existed for as long as man has been here. But we strive for more.\u201d</p><p>Timothy nodded.</p><p>\u201cTimothy, you spoke of Billie Tiger. Is he...your guide? Does he help you understand the messages from the ghost dancers?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>Timothy nodded, and when he spoke, his words seemed to be coming from far away. \u201cBillie Tiger can see what was, and he knows that the world spins, time moves on, and what happened once will come to pass again, unless it is stopped. And now something terrible threatens to return, so it can be relived. It must be stopped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\u2019\u201d Dillon quoted. \u201cGeorge Santayana,\u201d he added. \u201cTimothy, does the name Indigo mean anything to you?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>Timothy nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a town. An evil town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the town was evil, but I do I think evil men lived there,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Timothy nodded. \u201cGreedy men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they were. The other day you told me \u2018they are assembling.\u2019 Timothy, are people from the past assembling somehow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil keeps going unless it is stopped,\u201d Timothy said. He turned and stared out the window again, then looked back at Dillon and smiled. His voice changed and his features relaxed. \u201cDid you mention Indigo, young man? I know Indigo. Sandy old place out in the desert. Some movie company rented it maybe five or six years ago. They filmed a few scenes and then they left. They didn\u2019t like the place. Said things moved around at night, and they went off to film somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dillon said, intrigued. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people said some of our people were sabotaging the shoot because they didn\u2019t think the movie company had paid enough to rent the town. Other people claimed it was because of the old burial ground out there, but nobody really knows. I\u2019ll tell you one thing, though. There\u2019s something wrong with Indigo, always has been. There was an awful shoot-out there. An Indian named Wolf was involved. Kin to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great-great-great-something,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>\u201cJessy and me, we go back to Indigo, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother was related to a mixed-blood who played piano in a saloon there,\u201d Timothy told him. He stared at Dillon, his gaze clear and focused. \u201cThe world can be strange. Life and death are not always what we think. The souls of the ancients slip into the living. Some are good, and some are evil. As to why they come, sometimes it\u2019s because the descendants of those who fought, the winners and the losers, are assembling. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Dillon wasn\u2019t sure that he did. Not entirely, anyway, though certain connections were starting to become clear. An ancestor of Jessy\u2019s had lived in Indigo. His own ancestor had died there. And Ringo was still hanging around to this day.</p><p>But what did all that mean? What the hell did it have to do with the murders of Tanner Green and Rudy Yorba\u2014or the casinos business and Emil Landon, who had been the starting point for everything?</p><p>\u201cTimothy, the ghost dancers\u2014how long have they been talking to you?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really remember when they came. A while ago now. But when I saw the blood,\u201d Timothy said sadly, \u201cthat\u2019s when I knew they were here to warn me. The cycle needs to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy, where did you see blood,\u201d Dillon said, then asked, \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Jessy,\u201d the elderly man said, his eyes bleak. \u201cI saw blood on my granddaughter. But I knew they didn\u2019t want to kill her, they wanted to save her. They told me that you would come. They said she would open the door, but you would come and guide her through it.\u201d Then he winked conspiratorially and inclined his head.</p><p>Dillon turned.</p><p>Jessy was on her way over, and she smiled when she caught his eye, then sat down next to him.</p><p>She looked across the table at Timothy and smiled. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been playing a lot of Scrabble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for the mind. Sally and I play almost every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she all right? I don\u2019t see her,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>Timothy smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s hair day. She\u2019s over in the main building, at the salon. How about you, young lady? Don\u2019t you need to get to work?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch. \u201cI have time.\u201d</p><p>Timothy shook his head and looked at Dillon. \u201cWhatever you do, make sure she eats a real lunch before you drop her off, will you? She burns a lot of energy onstage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cI have an affinity for chocolate shakes. I\u2019m grateful I get to burn all those calories, because I\u2019d hate to have to cut down on the ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her to lunch,\u201d Timothy repeated, staring at Dillon. \u201cI\u2019ll be here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to seeing you,\u201d Dillon said, rising.</p><p>Jessy followed suit. \u201cYou could come with us this morning. We could take you shopping or something, and then Dillon could drop me at work after lunch and then bring you back here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thanks. I appreciate the offer, but I don\u2019t really need anything. I think I\u2019m going to take a nap, so I\u2019ll be ready to go when Sally comes back from getting her hair done,\u201d Timothy said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jessy agreed, and kissed him fondly on the cheek. Dillon shook his hand, and then he and Jessy left.</p><p>She glanced over at him as they drove.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to thank me for,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cHe can seem perfectly fine...and then his mind wanders into another zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s very intelligent and insightful, and I enjoy his company,\u201d Dillon assured her.</p><p>\u201cI wish he could live with me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut once he thought he was in a sweat lodge, and he kept trying to make a fire in the kitchen. The fire department had to come out. I knew then that he couldn\u2019t live with me anymore, not so long as I have to work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a good place. He\u2019s happy, and he\u2019s still pretty independent.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know, but I still can\u2019t help feeling guilty sometimes.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet after that, until Dillon asked her what she wanted to do to kill time before lunch. They settled on a movie, and by the time it let out, they were both ready to eat again.</p><p>He took her to a place he liked not far off the Strip. It was quiet and elegant, and he thought Timothy would have approved. They were seated quickly, and the waiter brought over water for them to drink while they perused the menu. Just as it was served, Ringo entered and stood just behind Jessy.</p><p>Dillon heard the clink of his spurs and saw Jessy frown as she looked up from studying her menu. Obviously she\u2019d heard them, too.</p><p>\u201cJessy,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>She met his eyes, and he cleared his throat. \u201cYou know how you see Tanner Green? And Rudy? Well, they\u2019re not the only ghosts in town. In fact...I have a friend who wants to meet you. I asked him to wait to show himself until I was sure you\u2019d be all right with it.\u201d</p><p>She reached for her water glass and took a long swallow.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she asked, visibly steadying herself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sitting next to you,\u201d he told Jessy as Ringo took the chair beside her.</p><p>She turned and gasped loudly enough that their waiter came running over.</p><p>\u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just...swallowed the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Jessy, what would you like?\u201d Dillon asked, defusing the tension. \u201cThe salmon here is delicious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSalmon it is, then,\u201d she agreed, trying not to stare at Ringo.</p><p>\u201cAnd would you like the rice or the scalloped potatoes?\u201d the waiter inquired.</p><p>\u201cRice,\u201d Jessy managed to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the same, please,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>The waiter left at last.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real jerk!\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Jessy stiffened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you. I\u2019m talking to Ringo. He shouldn\u2019t have scared you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Ringo told Jessy. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you, and I\u2019m delighted to make your acquaintance. At\u2014last,\u201d he added pointedly, staring at Dillon.</p><p>\u201cAt last?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been suggesting a formal introduction for a while now. I think I could have been helpful before now,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>Jessy tried not to look in his direction. Ringo reached for one of the menus, which the waiter had forgotten to pick up. Dillon snatched it out of his hand before someone noticed that a menu was floating in thin air.</p><p>\u201cSalmon,\u201d Ringo said in disgust. \u201cYou\u2019re a wuss. This is Nevada. You should have ordered a nice rare steak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe enjoys being aggravating,\u201d Dillon said, his eyes on Jessy.</p><p>She stared back at him, her own eyes wide. She might have adjusted to seeing Tanner Green and Rudy Yorba materialize right in front of her, but she clearly hadn\u2019t been ready for this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wounded,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cI was just anxious to meet you, Jessy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you let Clancy out?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking a ghost if he let your dog out?\u201d Jessy said, and took another long drink of water. She noticed that her hand was trembling. \u201cBut you said ghosts couldn\u2019t hurt people, so how could he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I didn\u2019t know of any ghosts who hurt people,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say they couldn\u2019t touch objects or move them. Ringo here has been around a very long time, and he\u2019s mastered the art of using his energy to affect the physical world. And, despite your first impression, he\u2019s actually a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, partner,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your partner?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that was just an expression of speech,\u201d Dillon assured her.</p><p>She played with her napkin, not looking at Ringo even though she was addressing him. \u201cSo, Mr. Ringo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Mr. Ringo,\u201d Ringo corrected. \u201cName is Ringo Murphy, just Ringo to my friends, and I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be one of them.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Dillon. \u201cHe\u2019s around\u2014all the time?\u201d she asked faintly.</p><p>\u201cNo, not all the time,\u201d Dillon said firmly, staring at Ringo.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, ma\u2019am. I am a perfect gentleman,\u201d Ringo promised her, then turned to Dillon. \u201cI just want to help. I want this solved.\u201d</p><p>Jessy was about to answer him, but their salads arrived, so she kept quiet.</p><p>\u201cRingo died at Indigo,\u201d Dillon explained once the waiter was gone.</p><p>Jessy, blue eyes narrowing, stared at him. \u201cSo \u2018Indigo\u2019 did mean something to you. It meant a lot to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it means, not yet,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, your grandfather isn\u2019t so crazy,\u201d Ringo told Jessy. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s somehow seeing Indigo in his visions, or whatever you want to call them.\u201d</p><p>She turned to stare at him indignantly. \u201cI never said my grandfather is crazy. And no one really knows what he sees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no offense meant,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cI just meant...well...maybe he does see those ghost dancers he says he talks to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him when you talk to him,\u201d Dillon cautioned her. \u201cIt unnerves people, and Ringo always gets a kick out of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how often is he around?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s needed, usually,\u201d Dillon told her.</p><p>She spoke to Ringo again, this time without turning to look at him. \u201cWhat do you know about my grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s a nice old man,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cAnd that he may be very important to figuring this out.\u201d</p><p>Jessy frowned at Dillon. \u201cWhat is he talking about? What\u2019s \u2018this\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessy, I honestly don\u2019t have all the pieces yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do know something, and you\u2019ve chosen not to share that with me,\u201d she said, trying to keep her growing anger under control.</p><p>\u201cJessy, I know that Emil Landon called Adam for help, afraid that his life was in danger. I met with him, met Tanner Green and Landon\u2019s other bodyguard, Hugo Blythe, and then Tanner Green was killed, but not before saying something to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you hounded me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hound you, but I needed to know what he said. And I was afraid for you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you know?\u201d Jessy demanded.</p><p>\u201cJessy, if I had all the answers, Green\u2019s killer would be awaiting trial right now,\u201d Dillon assured her. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have all the answers. I know that\u2014somehow\u2014your grandfather\u2019s ghost dancers seem to know that you\u2019d have a link with\u2014a link with the dead. And that, because of it, you\u2019d be in danger. They knew that I\u2019d be drawn into the mystery, too. That I\u2019d be here to help you.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes across the table, and it was all she could do to stop herself from leaning in for a kiss.</p><p>Ringo groaned. \u201cGet a room, would you?\u201d he said. \u201cHell, I\u2019m out of here,\u201d he said, and rose, but then he lingered.</p><p>\u201cJessy?\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him then, deciding she didn\u2019t care if the other diners thought she was crazy.</p><p>\u201cI really will do my very best to protect you,\u201d Ringo swore.</p><p>\u201cYou can protect me?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can watch out for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen stop scaring me,\u201d she ordered him. \u201cThe noise of your spurs has been driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but I died with my boots on,\u201d Ringo said indignantly, then walked away.</p><p>Someone cleared his throat, and Dillon looked up, cursing himself for not paying attention.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d the waiter asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dillon said, as the waiter served their salmon, then left.</p><p>\u201cThe other day, at your house...I heard his spurs. When we...did he...?\u201d Jessy asked, and she could feel herself blushing.</p><p>\u201cHe left, I swear,\u201d he told her. \u201cI promise you, Ringo isn\u2019t a voyeur.\u201d</p><p>She flushed even deeper and said, \u201cThe other night, before you came to my room...\u201d Her words trailed off, but then she forced herself to go on. \u201cI\u2019d been dreaming about you\u2014rather erotically. I mean...then...we weren\u2019t being watched, were we?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head, trying quickly to hide his smile.</p><p>\u201cJessy, you were dreaming, nothing more. I swear. Ringo had already left to look into some things on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went back to hang around the casino, see if he could pick up any new info.\u201d</p><p>She still looked unhappy, he thought. He wondered how she was going to react later tonight, at the arrival of the reinforcements he\u2019d called for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJessy, he may be able to get Tanner Green to talk. And if Green talks, maybe we can find out how Indigo is involved in all this.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat is it with that place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not sure, but the pieces are starting to fit. An ancestor of mine was killed there, and so was Ringo\u2013both of them in the same shoot-out. This morning, your grandfather told me that you two had an ancestor who was there at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d she said coolly. \u201cWas he a bad guy or a good guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a piano player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA piano player?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And no, I don\u2019t know how he fits in. I just know that you\u2019re in danger, and that whoever killed Tanner Green is probably the same person who ran down Rudy Yorba, and somehow, everything is tied to Indigo.\u201d</p><p>She eased back in her chair, staring at him. \u201cI think...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI think I\u2019ve lost my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She poked at her salmon with a vengeance. \u201cWhere the hell does Emil Landon fit into all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where do we go from here?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep investigating until I find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo way am I letting you push me out of this investigation. Thanks to you, I\u2019ve had to face the fact that I see ghosts. I may even be making friends with a dead man in a ten-gallon hat and spurs. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re not going to inform me of every move you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening next,\u201d he told her, pushing his own food around on the plate. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Big Easy, where we\u2019re going to go to the stage manager and find out what happened yesterday. Then I\u2019m going to leave Ringo to watch over you, and I\u2019m going to have a discussion with Emil Landon. Next I\u2019m going to head over to the Sun to chase down your friend the pit boss, Darrell Frye, and find out why he conveniently managed to go on break just when a murdered man came stumbling into the building. Then, if there\u2019s time, I\u2019ll call Jerry Cheever and find out if he\u2019s got any new info. And maybe I\u2019ll drop in on Doug Tarleton\u2014he\u2019s the medical examiner. Also, there\u2019s a young woman in the crime lab who has been very helpful, so I can take the opportunity to catch up with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. I never said Darrell was my friend. And I think you\u2019re way off base if you really do suspect him. He just wants to lure me over to the Sun so he can climb the corporate ladder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I hope you\u2019re right. Anyway, while I\u2019m doing all that, Ringo can hang out with you, and maybe see something, hear something...\u201d</p><p>So much for a nice lunch, he thought.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou do know that I\u2019m not entirely incapable, right? I\u2019m smart, and I know how to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that. But, Jessy, everyone is vulnerable, and you haven\u2019t been trained in self-defense nor do you carry a gun. It won\u2019t hurt to have someone\u2014even a ghost\u2014there to help if help should be needed.\u201d</p> <p>She digested that, then nodded stiffly. \u201cAll right. Point taken. But I will be going with you to talk to my stage manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d he told her, and signaled the waiter for the check.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ve already been crushed by a dying man who bled all over me. I\u2019ve seen ghosts. And maybe I am in danger. So I don\u2019t want you keeping anything from me, anything at all. And you don\u2019t have a plan, we\u2019ll have a plan. I\u2019m not a delicate flower. This is my life, and I intend to be just as involved in saving it as anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her, trying not to smile, glad to see her anger and her courage.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t want her so courageous that she forgot to respect her fear\u2014not to mention logic and self-preservation.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He let himself smile then. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan,\u201d he told her.</p><p>They rose, and he rested his hand on her back as they left the restaurant. He heard the jingling of Ringo\u2019s spurs as they neared the car.</p><p>\u201cShotgun, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jessy said to Ringo.</p><p>Ringo laughed, catching Dillon\u2019s eyes, and slid into the back.</p><p>12</p><p>When they got to the Big Easy, Ron Pearl was actually up in the rigging, checking the machinery that controlled the sail that had fallen. He saw Jessy with Dillon and called down to tell them that he would just be a second. A moment later he was on the ground, facing them.</p><p>He was an agile man of about fifty, and he\u2019d been in Vegas working on shows forever. He\u2019d done it all, worked props and sets, even acted on occasion. His delight, however, was in managing a cast and all in the technical details that went into a show. Jessy had worked with him before, and she adored him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Ron Pearl. And you\u2019re...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon Wolf. Jessy told me what happened. What went wrong?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cI actually called the cops about this, because I think we had a prankster up in the rafters. Someone who lost big in the casino and wanted to shut us down, put management out some money themselves,\u201d Ron said, looking at Jessy. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it was a prank, anyway, and they didn\u2019t know anyone was down there. So the cops came and took some prints off a backstage door, but I don\u2019t know how much that will help. There were some weird scuff marks up there, too, and they took some pictures. They\u2019re still checking it out, and I\u2019ve made sure everything\u2019s been resecured and is totally safe. I put a security guy up on the catwalk today, just to make sure nothing goes wrong.\u201d</p><p>Jessy noticed that Dillon didn\u2019t look entirely satisfied. \u201cMind if I take a look for myself?\u201d</p><p>Ron started to frown; the rafters could be dangerous, and Dillon wasn\u2019t one of his own. But Dillon didn\u2019t give him a chance to protest. He leaped on stage and started climbing the rigging as if he\u2019d been trained by Cirque du Soleil.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you find him?\u201d Ron asked Jessy.</p><p>\u201cHe found me,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>A few minutes later Dillon rejoined them on the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s got a safety catch. Someone had to undo it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Ron stared at Dillon, clearly worried.</p><p>\u201cShit. I guess it\u2019s a good thing the cops are on it. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re hanging around for the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d Jessy answered for him. \u201cHe\u2019s busy. He has a lot of things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, see you later, then,\u201d Ron said. \u201cI\u2019ll let the security guy know to be extra vigilant. Jessy, you ought to be back in costume and makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going right now,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d she told Dillon coolly as she passed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d she said. \u201cI can keep myself busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-looking guy,\u201d Ron told her as soon as Dillon was out of sight.</p><p>\u201cHe is that,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Jessy headed backstage to her dressing table. April was already dressed and almost finished with her makeup. \u201cHey, there. Did you hear? Someone really was messing with the rigging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard. But they\u2019ve added security. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo figure,\u201d April said as she powdered her nose. \u201cI was afraid to be a flight attendant. Who would have thought you could be in danger doing a kids\u2019 pirate show?\u201d</p><p>She left, ready to take her position backstage. They would be opening the doors soon.</p><p>Jessy followed her a few minutes later. She shifted the curtain slightly to look out to the audience. She could see kids filing in, along with a number of adults. She looked past them to the glass partition separating the theater from the lobby.</p><p>Grant Willow, one of the security guards, was at the door, watching the last people filing through the door. Next to him, Tanner Green was standing with his face pressed to the glass.</p><p>Behind Green, leaning against the far wall, one leg cocked for support and arms crossed over his chest, stood Ringo Murphy, keeping an eye on the proceedings.</p><p>He saw Jessy peeking out from behind the curtain and lifted his hat to her.</p><p>Oh, Lord, she thought. This was crazy. She was being haunted by one ghost and guarded by another.</p><p>\u201cPlaces!\u201d Ron called, and she stepped back, ready to make her entrance as Bonny Anne, queen of the pirate ship Treasure.</p><p>Once again, Emil Landon was waiting in his office, anxious to see Dillon.</p><p>\u201cWell? Have you found out what\u2019s going on?\u201d Emil asked impatiently. \u201cWhat have the cops found over at the Sun? Someone over there is guilty, has to be,\u201d Emil said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sick of holing up in here, afraid to go out.\u201d</p><p>Hugo Blythe was just outside the door, Dillon knew. He had been surprised to find that other than the big bodyguard and the boss, the penthouse was empty. Not even the huge-breasted secretary had been in sight.</p><p>\u201cThe latest attack took place right here in your own casino,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an incident at the pirate show yesterday,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>Emil Landon stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cYou think that was an attack? It\u2019s a kids\u2019 pirate show. Some joker broke in and messed with the set. Nothing was broken, so what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018big deal\u2019 is that one of your players could have been seriously injured,\u201d Dillon said coldly.</p><p>Landon bristled at Dillon\u2019s comment. \u201cDon\u2019t go mistaking my words for a lack of concern. I had the incident investigated immediately, but that\u2019s all it was\u2014an incident. That actress should have been offstage with everyone else by then, so no one could possibly have meant to hurt her or anyone else. This was probably some bored kid\u2019s prank. What the hell does it have to do with someone being after me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still not sure why you\u2019re so convinced that someone wants to kill you,\u201d Dillon said, drawing a small notebook from his pocket. \u201cWhen we first met, you said you were being followed. Green and Blythe both worked for you for some time, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but...hell, that\u2019s why I finally called Harrison Investigations. I kept feeling I was being watched, even when I knew there was no one around. It was eerie. Even with those guys around, you know? And I figured you guys don\u2019t just prove there are ghosts around, you debunk them, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dillon agreed. \u201cSo what about Green and Blythe? What did you have them doing? And what was Green up to the night he died?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen one was on, the other was off,\u201d Landon agreed. \u201cWhere the hell Tanner Green was before he was murdered, I have no clue. It was his night off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But these men were there to protect you, and you still felt unnerved enough to ask for outside help because your car was followed a few times when you went out to dinner. What else? A man of your position and power...it had to take more than that to convince you that someone was trying to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone shot at me one night,\u201d Landon told him uneasily.</p><p>\u201cSomeone shot at you? And you didn\u2019t inform the police? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were the cops going to do? I was in the parking lot of a restaurant. I heard shots. Blythe threw himself on top of me, and we heard a car speeding away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t see the car, I only heard it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d called the cops, they might have found the bullets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, my bodyguard is dead, and you haven\u2019t found a damn thing. The cops are working on it, you\u2019re working on it, and what the hell do I have? Zilch.\u201d</p><p>Dillon wanted to tell him to go to hell then and there. There had to be something more going on, and Emil Landon just didn\u2019t want to talk about it.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for Jessy, Dillon would have told Landon to stuff it then and there.</p> <p>But Dillon wasn\u2019t going to find himself barred from the casino on some trumped-up charge when he needed to be there to keep an eye on Jessy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head back over to the Sun later today,\u201d he said, rising. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you knew you had trouble in your own casino first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble? This is a casino. We throw angry drunks out on a daily basis, and the cops are in here at least once a week because some asshole gets nasty. This was some prankster messing around where he didn\u2019t belong,\u201d Landon said, but he must have seen something in Dillon\u2019s eyes, because he quickly added, \u201cI value my employees. Trust me, I\u2019ve made sure that the situation has been taken care of. I\u2019m not a great humanitarian, but that pirate show makes money hand over fist\u2014not just on ticket sales, but because it brings people into my casino. What do you think the parents are doing while their kids are being entertained? Losing money, that\u2019s what. My security staff are good. Interview them at your leisure, and you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m telling the truth. It\u2019s me I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019m getting cabin fever, afraid to leave my own penthouse. Get out there and find out who the hell killed Tanner Green\u2014and who the hell is gunning for me.\u201d</p><p>Dillon left, bidding Hugo Blythe a cheerful goodbye as the goon saw him to the outer door.</p><p>But as he rode down in the elevator, he reflected grimly that he didn\u2019t believe Emil Landon, and he didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want a showdown with the man.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>Soon, but not now.</p> <p>The show went smoothly. The entire cast had been a little on edge, she had realized during the performance, which had somehow made her feel calm. The sail fell right on cue, with everyone in proper position, and then it was returned to its original position just as it was every day, seven days a week. When the show was over, Jessy did notice that the techs hurried backstage more quickly than usual, and Ron Pearl himself was there, keeping an eye on everything as the cast posed for pictures and gave autographs to the children. Ron was still there as the last of the audience departed, and when he shooed the cast back to the dressing rooms he seemed both relieved and happy.</p><p>Ringo didn\u2019t follow her back to her dressing room; now that she was aware of his existence, she was certain that she would know if he was there. Although, she realized, now that the show had gone off without a hitch and she\u2019d had some time to calm down, having a hundred-and-something-year-old ghost in her corner might not be a bad thing.</p><p>She found herself actually wanting to have a discussion with him.</p><p>As she had the night before, she gave Sandra a call on her cell, then was surprised when Reggie answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she told Jessy, approval in her tone. \u201cI hear you\u2019re dating Mr. Hottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReggie, please. Your mom has already tortured me enough on that score. And speaking of your mom, where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, and she forgot her phone here when she went out, so I couldn\u2019t call and ask her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be back soon. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just wanted to see what she\u2019s up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I just came in from school. But I\u2019ll tell her you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d She hung up, wondering what she should do. A second later her phone rang and she answered it, even though she didn\u2019t recognize the number.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me calling from a pay phone,\u201d Sandra said quickly in response to Jessy\u2019s cautious, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Jessy asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down the street,\u201d Sandra told her. \u201cI suck as a friend\u2014sorry. I was going to meet you right there at the show, but I stopped in at the Rainbow, and a new slot machine sucked me in. I just realized the time, so don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be there in five minutes, and we can hang out until tall, dark and stunning returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra, you really don\u2019t have to babysit me,\u201d Jessy said, but in fact, she was glad that Sandra was on her way. Just in case she really was in danger, she would rather not be alone.</p><p>Of course, now she had a ghost watching out for her, as well. Or maybe he\u2019d been there all along. Although apparently Ringo went off on his own periodically, and she was pretty sure he could only be in one place at a time. She wondered what rules, exactly, ghosts had to follow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not babysitting to spend time with a friend,\u201d Sandra assured her. \u201cConsider me on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jessy said, suddenly sick of everyone\u2014including herself\u2014seeing her as a potential victim. \u201cYou\u2019re just down the street. I\u2019ll come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Strip is crawling with people. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Besides, I have a cowboy ghost following me, she added silently.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but come right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Jessy hung up, smiling.</p><p>She gathered her personal belongings and left her dressing room.</p><p>Tanner Green had departed somewhere toward the end of the show, but Ringo had remained, so she looked around for him when she got back out front. She was surprised that he was nowhere to be seen and wondered if he had tried to follow the elusive Tanner Green.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. The Strip was crawling with people. She would be just fine.</p><p>It was time to find Darrell Frye, which proved to be easier than Dillon had thought, because the pit boss was back at work. All Dillon had to do was wait fifteen minutes and Frye would be on break. He headed off to the casino\u2019s coffee bar to wait.</p><p>The Strip was crowded with people.</p><p>As she walked down the street, staring at the neon and glitter that defined Vegas, Jessy found herself amazed that someone had come to the desert, started with nothing and ended up with the fantasy playground that was Vegas. Sure, a lot of it was false and plastic, but underneath the facade, it was just like any other place. Lots of people came to play\u2014but others came to work. People built homes, and raised families, and it was a mecca for young entertainers.</p><p>And for her, it was\u2014and always had been\u2014home.</p><p>Suddenly that comfortable thought fled from her mind, driven out by the realization\u2014immediate and absolutely certain\u2014that she was being followed.</p><p>She told herself that it was Ringo, but she knew it wasn\u2019t. She realized that she\u2019d always known when Ringo was around, even when she hadn\u2019t been able to see him, because of his spurs.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t Ringo. This was someone who was stalking her. She hadn\u2019t seen anyone when she left the theater, so this had to be someone who knew when she got off work, someone who had timed her movements and waited in the crowd to pick her up when she left, someone who knew exactly where she was right this second and could easily attack her if he chose.</p><p>She stopped dead in the street. No one would take a chance on attacking her with hundreds of people around, would they?</p><p>Then she remembered that Tanner Green had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, a knife in his back.</p><p>There was a large group of tourists ahead of her. She hurried to join them, looking for safety in numbers.</p><p>\u201cHey, Wolf,\u201d Darrell Frye said, approaching Dillon at the table where he was sitting. He offered Dillon a broad smile and a handshake, looking as if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world. \u201cI heard you\u2019re working on Tanner Green\u2019s murder. Horrible business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. And since you were there that night, I was hoping you might have noticed something that could help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I can help you. Martin was running the table when Green actually died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dillon told him. \u201cCan I get you a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab some\u2014it\u2019s a freebie for me. No alcohol on the job\u2014but we get all the coffee we can drink. Do you want a refill?\u201d he asked, indicating the cup Dillon had in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>When Darrell returned with his coffee he sat down across from Dillon, glanced at his watch and said, \u201cI\u2019m good for nine more minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should do,\u201d Dillon told him.</p> <p>\u201cYou were there, too, so you would have seen everything I did. Although...\u201d Darrell said, frowning with the memory. \u201cWho left first, you or me? Me, I think. I remember the night pretty well. Coot, he\u2019s a regular. There was a skinny woman there who looked like she was on her last legs. There was the drunk who didn\u2019t know if he wanted his chips on or off the table. And...Jessy, of course. Jessy Sparhawk. You must know her\u2014I saw a tape of the two of you leaving the casino together on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just met her that night,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cBut you know her fairly well, I gather.\u201d</p><p>Darrell shrugged, shaking his head. \u201cWish I did. She\u2019s not a gambler. I did talk to her once after I\u2019d seen her show. I want off the floor and into entertainment\u2014everyone who knows me knows that\u2014and I\u2019d heard some of the brass talking about the pirate show at the Big Easy. They liked Jessy, so I figured if I could get her over here...well, that would look good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go when you left the floor that night?\u201d Dillon asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe employee cafeteria,\u201d Darrell replied.</p> <p>That would be easy enough to check out, Dillon thought.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Darrell asked</p><p>\u201cI was hoping maybe you\u2019d stepped outside, maybe seen something you didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d seen. Something important,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I did talk to some of the guys outside, at the door and at valet parking,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>Darrell Frye suddenly looked wary. His smile wavered for a moment, or at least it looked that way to Dillon. No matter how willing to help the man seemed to be, there was still something about him that seemed wrong. As if he was being too willing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cAnyway, one of the guys thought maybe he\u2019d seen Tanner Green stumble out of a white super-stretch limo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Who?\u201d Darrell Frye demanded. \u201cDid you tell the cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the cops know. But it won\u2019t help them much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the guy I talked to is dead. It was Rudy Yorba.\u201d</p><p>Frye let out a whistle. \u201cImagine that. The one person who actually sees something winds up dead in a hit-and-run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, imagine.\u201d</p> <p>Frye glanced at his watch. \u201cI gotta get back. But if I think of anything, I\u2019ll call you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarrell, one more quick question. Does anyone at this casino have access to the security tapes? Other than security, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the tapes went to the cops,\u201d Frye said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThose were copies, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask security. I gotta go,\u201d Darrell said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be happy to talk to you again, though. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Darrell. I appreciate that,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Frye left, Dillon got up to leave himself, wondering what the other man had been lying about. Because he had been lying. A thin sheen of nervous sweat had appeared on his upper lip, and his eyes had kept shifting toward the left.</p><p>The tourists turned en masse, heading down a wide one-way alley alongside one of the casinos to the parking area where buses dropped off and picked up their passengers.</p><p>But Jessy was so sure that she was being followed, she turned along with them.</p><p>Great, she thought. What the hell was she going to do? Board the bus?</p><p>She decided\u2014too late\u2014that she was probably making a big mistake. If she really was being followed by someone who meant to harm her, she should have stayed on the Strip and caught up with some other group to hide in.</p><p>Unable to think of anything else to do, she tried to board the bus, but the tour guide stopped her. \u201cMiss, I\u2019m sorry, you must be lost. This is a chartered bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I think I\u2019m being followed.\u201d</p><p>The young man looked around. There was no one around except the rest of the tour group\u2014who were all wearing name tags, explaining how he had known she didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cCan I call someone for you?\u201d he asked, looking at her as if she were an escapee from a lunatic asylum.</p><p>She had a phone, she realized. She could call someone herself. Like Dillon. Where the hell was he? Why hadn\u2019t she heard from him yet?</p><p>\u201cMiss, you\u2019ll have to step aside. The people behind you need to get on.\u201d</p><p>She stepped aside, hoping they boarded slowly, and dialed Dillon\u2019s cell, praying that he would pick up.</p><p>He did.</p><p>\u201cJessy?\u201d</p><p>The concern in his voice made her take a deep breath. She told herself she was being ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cAbout a block from the Rainbow. I\u2019m walking over to meet Sandra. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Sun. I never got any farther. I\u2019ll come find you. Is Ringo around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was at the show, but I haven\u2019t seen him since,\u201d she said, amazed that she was talking so casually about seeing a ghost.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, I was a little nervous before, but...I\u2019m okay now.\u201d She had panicked, and she didn\u2019t want him knowing just how afraid she had been. She absolutely couldn\u2019t allow herself to become paralyzed by paranoia.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cHow was the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went fine, no problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Okay, I\u2019m on my way. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout three blocks from the Big Easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on foot,\u201d he told her, \u201cbut I\u2019m already on my way.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. The last tourist was about to board the bus, and she needed to get moving.</p><p>She turned and started walking briskly. She heard the driver rev the engine and realized that the last tourist had gotten on and the door had closed.</p><p>The broad alley looked empty. All she had to do was walk quickly and she would be back on the Strip, surrounded by the crowd. It was insane to think that whoever had been following her\u2014if anyone even had\u2014was still out there.</p><p>She neared a clump of bushes the casino must have worked hard to maintain in this desert climate. She hadn\u2019t even noticed it when she had passed it with the group.</p><p>She kept to the far side of the alley as she went by, thinking she was going crazy.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>As she walked by, she saw that the bushes started moving.</p><p>She swore and started walking more quickly.</p><p>She turned back and saw two men emerging from the cover of the bushes. Two men she would never recognize, because even in the warmth of a Vegas spring, they were wearing dark ski masks and were clad in black from head to toe.</p><p>She started to run.</p><p>She had to make it to the Strip before they caught up to her. Had to. If she could just get there, there was no way they could attack her without people noticing.</p><p>She heard footsteps coming up behind her.</p><p>They were moving like lightning, and she was wearing pumps. The heels weren\u2019t high, but they were hardly running shoes.</p><p>She could feel the energy behind her, the force. A hot wind seemed to be reaching out for her as the footsteps drew closer.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>She could see the crowds just ahead, where the shadows of the alley ended.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d she screamed again.</p><p>And that was when she felt someone grab her arm. She screamed again, tearing at the gloved fingers that held her.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d</p><p>The second man reached her then, but she barely saw him because she realized that the first man had something in his hand and was pressing it to her face. A cloth. And it had a sickening-sweet smell. She felt dizziness rising and realized that the cloth was drugged.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d This time her scream was weaker.</p><p>There were people on the sidewalk just ahead.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t they see her?</p><p>She started to fall....</p><p>And that was when something happened. When someone seemed to plow into the man holding her and wrench him from her.</p><p>\u201cRun, Jessy, run!\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>It was Dillon\u2019s voice.</p><p>Run. She had to run.</p><p>But she could barely stumble.</p><p>She tried to move, but she had no strength and the night seemed so black.</p><p>The second man was reaching for her and she...</p><p>She was falling.</p><p>13</p><p>Dillon moved without thinking as he tackled the first man, ripping him away from Jessy. With the element of surprise in his favor, it was an easy feat to bring the man down hard enough to keep him there, fighting for breath. A right hook to the jaw bought him more time.</p><p>Dillon had been a punk as a kid. He\u2019d gotten his eyes blackened a dozen times in idiotic fights he\u2019d started himself, but in the end he\u2019d learned how to take care of himself.</p><p>But though the first man had gone down without much effort, the other now had Jessy, who\u2019d fallen limp to the ground, and was tossing her over his shoulder as easily as if she were a bag of feathers.</p><p>Where would could he be planning on taking her?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t dwell on the question. He disentangled himself from the man on the ground and went straight for the second assailant, using all the force he could muster to chop the edge of his hand against the man\u2019s nape.</p><p>The guy was a gorilla; a smaller man might have gone straight down, but the giant shuddered, then finally started to stumble to his knees, but at least he dropped Jessy, who landed directly between his feet. She roused, blinking rapidly as she tried to escape, but her movements were erratic, her limbs unable to obey the commands her brain was sending. Then her knee jerked hard and high as she flailed in her struggle to rise, and her assailant let out a bellow, rolling to his side and clutching his groin. Dillon dived after him.</p><p>\u201cJessy, get to the street!\u201d Dillon ordered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a moment when her eyes met his and he was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t obey, would try to stay and help him.</p><p>But apparently she knew she was too weak to be any good in a fight. She staggered to her feet and moved toward the street, screaming for help. Her voice was weak, but she was getting away.</p><p>She reached the sidewalk at last, and that changed everything. People heard her, saw her, and someone called 911. In seconds police-car sirens filled the air. Dillon turned to rejoin the fight. The first man had turned to run, heading for the other end of the alley. But the big man remained, glaring at Dillon, before running in the opposite direction. Toward Jessy.</p> <p>Dillon raced after him, but the man ignored Jessy, who was sinking toward the pavement once again, and just tore past her, shoving people out of the way, and disappeared into the traffic. Dillon tried to follow, but it was impossible to break through the crowd of people surrounding Jessy. Frustrated, he gave up and cursed the fact that the attacker was no doubt even now doing a chameleon change, discarding the ski mask as easily as he\u2019d donned it earlier, blending in with everyone around him.</p><p>Dillon dropped down to the sidewalk next to Jessy and put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cCan you breathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he dose me with?\u201d Jessy asked him, inhaling deeply.</p><p>He could smell a hint of the drug. \u201cEther, I think,\u201d he told her. \u201cAre you all right? Did they hurt you?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, no...I\u2019m fine. But I might have been....\u201d She trailed off with a shudder. Neither of them knew what might have happened. Had the men been out to kidnap her\u2014or kill her?</p> <p>A police car wailed as it came to a halt. A uniformed officer made his way through the crowd. \u201cMove back, folks. Let me get to the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a victim,\u201d Jessy protested.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d Dillon corrected her.</p><p>An officer was speaking into his radio, ordering an ambulance for Jessy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an ambulance,\u201d she protested. Using Dillon\u2019s shoulder for support, she rose. \u201cI don\u2019t need an ambulance,\u201d she repeated</p><p>\u201cJessy, you might have been hurt,\u201d Dillon told her.</p> <p>Her blue eyes narrowed mutinously. \u201cI\u2019m not hurt.\u201d She turned to the cops. \u201cThank you. You came along just in time. But I\u2019m an adult and in my right mind, and I\u2019m not going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour knee is bleeding,\u201d Dillon pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have Band-Aids in my purse,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but we need to find out what happened here,\u201d one of the officers said. He turned to face the crowd that was milling closer. \u201cFolks, back off. I need everyone to just move on, unless you saw what happened here.\u201d</p><p>A young man stepped forward. \u201cLisa and I heard her scream, and I called 911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything?\u201d the officer asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone must have seen something. One of the men ran right through the crowd,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>A dozen people started speaking at once.</p> <p>\u201cOne at a time,\u201d the officer said politely. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>A girl pointed toward the street. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u201d meant six lanes of traffic.</p><p>\u201cOfficer, I had the sense that someone was following me as I was walking down the street,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>The cop\u2019s brows hiked. \u201cOn the Strip?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you ran down an alley?\u201d</p><p>Jessy flushed. Dillon looked at her, because that was certainly a question in his mind, too.</p><p>\u201cI was with a bunch of tourists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the officer said.</p><p>\u201cThere were about twenty-five tourists ahead of me when I felt I was being followed, so I tried to blend in with them. But they wouldn\u2019t let me on their bus, so I hoped maybe I had shaken whoever it was, and I headed back to the street. And then they...they came at me out of the bushes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey were dressed in black, and they were wearing ski masks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who they were?\u201d the officer asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was attacked, and you\u2019re grilling her like that?\u201d an older woman demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe have to try to catch the perps,\u201d the officer said. \u201cAnd that means getting all the information we can.\u201d He looked at Dillon. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had just talked to Miss Sparhawk on the phone and I was on my way to meet her. I\u2019m pretty sure it was a kidnap attempt. They tried to drug her,\u201d Dillon explained.</p><p>The crowd in the street was growing. The ambulance, which had been called whether Jessy wanted it or not, was pulling up. A second set of officers arrived and began cordoning off the scene.</p><p>\u201cGet in the ambulance\u2014please,\u201d Dillon whispered to Jessy. \u201cWe can get out of here, the crowd will clear, and the crime-scene team will be able to get to work.\u201d</p><p>Jessy looked at him and then, unwillingly, agreed.</p><p>Her phone rang, and Dillon took it out of her hand and answered it. Sandra was on the other end, and she quickly became hysterical when Dillon explained what had happened and where they were going. He told her to meet them at the hospital and hung up.</p><p>In the ambulance, stretched out on the gurney with a med tech asking her questions and taking her vitals, Jessy complained about how ridiculous it was to send her to the hospital for a scraped knee.</p><p>Ridiculous or not, Dillon still thought it was the right call. As they headed to the hospital with the siren blaring, he called Jerry Cheever. The call went straight to voice mail, but Cheever must have gotten the message right away, because he called back just as the ambulance pulled up to the E.R.</p><p>Dillon tersely told him what had happened. \u201cI\u2019m homicide,\u201d Cheever reminded Dillon. \u201cThis was a mugging, Wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it. They didn\u2019t want her purse\u2014they wanted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll be down,\u201d Cheever agreed.</p><p>Sandra arrived while Jessy was in with a doctor. Sandra had tears streaming down her cheeks, and Dillon tried to calm her down, assuring her that none of it was her fault. She finally calmed down when the doctor came out to say that Jessy had suffered no lasting effects from the attack and was free to leave. As soon as Jessy herself arrived, Sandra hugged her and started apologizing all over again.</p><p>\u201cSandra, stop it. It\u2019s not your fault, and if you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m going to have to beg someone to give you a sedative,\u201d Jessy told her firmly.</p><p>Just as they started to leave, the news came on the waiting-room television with a report on the attack. There were no pictures from the scene; everything had happened too fast.</p><p>But a picture of Jessy did go up on-screen, her promo shot, which Dillon couldn\u2019t help thinking was absolutely stunning. The reporter went on to say that Jessy\u2019s condition was unknown, then added that Miss Sparhawk was certainly having a rough time lately and went on to remind people of her unintentional role in Tanner Green\u2019s death.</p><p>Jerry Cheever came through the emergency doors just as they were preparing to walk out. He looked at Jessy with what seemed to be genuine concern and asked if she was all right.</p><p>\u201cA scrape on one knee, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Jessy told him.</p><p>Cheever stared at Dillon. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet serious, Cheever. She was followed down an alley and attacked. Not robbed. Attacked. I\u2019m assuming they had some way of spiriting her off. They wanted something from her, or they wanted her....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d Jessy said flatly.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Sandra moaned.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this to the station,\u201d Cheever suggested.</p><p>\u201cBetter idea. Let\u2019s take it to my house,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cThat will be a lot easier on Jessy than dragging her down to the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the car,\u201d Cheever agreed with a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>At Dillon\u2019s house, they heard Clancy the minute they reached the house. She might be big and furry and lovable, but she was a guard dog all the way. As he opened the door, Dillon spoke to her, and she wagged her tail, certain not just from his presence and his voice but from his manner that everything was all right.</p><p>\u201cI can make coffee, if you want,\u201d Sandra suggested. \u201cSo you guys can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. That would be great,\u201d Dillon told her.</p><p>Just as Cheever sat down in the living room with Dillon and Jessy, his phone rang. When he got off, he said, \u201cThat was the crime-scene sergeant. They found two separate blood types, so one of you must have nicked one of the guys. If the DNA is in the system, we can find the guy. Otherwise, broken branches and scuff marks, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Dillon nodded. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Cheever. It was a planned attack. I think that whoever killed Tanner Green thinks he said something to Jessy before he died, and that whatever he said is worth...silencing her. Rudy Yorba talked to me, and Rudy wound up dead. You need to get subpoenas on both of those limos. We\u2019ve got to find the killer before people wind up dead.\u201d</p><p>Cheever frowned, looking at Jessy. \u201cIf these events are related, then Wolf is right and you\u2019re in danger. And here\u2019s the thing\u2014I saw the tape. I know Green said something to you, and I\u2019m willing to bet other people know it, too. Care to tell me what it was?\u201d</p><p>Jessy glanced at Dillon, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIndigo,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cIndigo?\u201d Cheever echoed, confused and disappointed.</p><p>\u201cIndigo,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Cheever stared at her blankly. \u201cLike the color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I forgot it at first, because there was so much going on. And then, even after I remembered, it didn\u2019t seem to mean anything,\u201d Jessy explained. \u201cAnd then...I didn\u2019t know it was a town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a town?\u201d Cheever asked, looking at Dillon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t heard about it. It\u2019s kind of a faded legend in these parts, a bump in the timeline of history. There was a shoot-out there, and soon after, the town went down. It\u2019s on Indian land, but it\u2019s just a pit out in the desert now. A movie outfit rented it from the tribe a few years back, and they filmed a few scenes and got out\u2014it was too creepy for them,\u201d Dillon explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he meant the town?\u201d Cheever asked, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure of anything,\u201d Jessy told him.</p><p>\u201cSame here, unfortunately,\u201d Dillon added.</p> <p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d Sandra announced from the doorway. She came in with a tray holding four steaming cups of coffee and all the necessaries.</p><p>It took a minute for them to fix their cups, and then they sat back down and started talking again, with Sandra sitting on the sidelines trying to look invisible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I know what it means, either,\u201d Cheever said, and looked at Dillon. \u201cWhy would anyone commit murder because of a ghost town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dillon said. He certainly wasn\u2019t about to tell Cheever that ghosts\u2014including one with ties to Indigo\u2014were real, or that he and Jessy both had ancestors who\u2019d lived\u2014and presumably died\u2014in Indigo, since what that meant was still a mystery, as well.</p><p>Cheever sighed. \u201cAll right, both of you need to think. Do you remember anything about these guys that might help us find them? Tell us where to look for them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreen,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>Cheever looked at her. \u201cFirst Indigo, now green? I need something more than colors here,\u201d he said wearily.</p><p>\u201cThe big one had green eyes,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>Dillon looked at her, surprised and pleased. He hadn\u2019t noticed either man\u2019s eye color, but then again, he\u2019d been busy pulling them off Jessy, more concerned with how well they fought than what they looked like.</p><p>\u201cThe other guy, I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone out there running all this, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as scary as he\u2019d like to be. This is the second time he\u2019s used drugs. LSD on Green, and ether just now with Jessy. He hires guys with real muscle, but he goes one better and drugs his victims. He doesn\u2019t want to meet with resistance,\u201d Dillon said.</p> <p>\u201cGreat. I need to look for a rich guy with a drug problem in Vegas. That narrows it down,\u201d Cheever said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cBring in those limos,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cAnd do it soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell would I find in one of the limos at this point? Even if Tanner Green was in one of them, any evidence would have been sanitized away by now,\u201d Cheever said.</p><p>\u201cPeople miss things,\u201d Dillon reminded him.</p><p>Cheever stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in at least one of those limos, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dillon started to answer, but Cheever lifted a hand and cut him off. \u201cNever mind. If you did something illegal, I don\u2019t want to know. Which limo am I tearing apart first? And what should I expect to find? In your educated opinion, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA button,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cYou know how easily buttons fall off.\u201d</p><p>Cheever rose, setting his coffee cup down. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said to Sandra, and offered her his hand. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been introduced. I\u2019m Jerry Cheever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sorry. Sandra Nelson. It\u2019s a pleasure\u2014I think,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a car to keep an eye on Miss Sparhawk\u2019s place,\u201d Cheever said, turning to Dillon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be with me,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, I can get a car out here in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. They\u2019re not going to come here, and even if they do, I have a few protective devices of my own.\u201d</p><p>Cheever groaned. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you do. Well, then, if you hear anything, call me...\u201d</p><p>Sandra stood. \u201cI have to get going, too. I have a teenager waiting for me,\u201d she explained to Dillon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get you home,\u201d Dillon assured her.</p><p>\u201cI can take you,\u201d Cheever said. \u201cIf you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sandra looked at Jessy, then walked over and reached for her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay? You know I\u2019d stay, but Reggie will be home alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo. It\u2019s fine, honestly, and thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dillon and Jessy walked with Cheever and Sandra to the door, where Sandra paused to give Jessy a hug and look questioningly into her eyes one more time.</p><p>\u201cSandra!\u201d Jessy laughed. \u201cI\u2019m fine, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Sandra and Cheever left at last, and Jessy and Dillon turned to look expectantly at each other. But before either of them could speak, they heard the clink of spurs.</p><p>Ringo walked into the entryway from the hallway that led to the bedrooms and office.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d they demanded in unison.</p><p>\u201cSorry to be late, but I was following your man Green until I heard what was going on with Jessy,\u201d Ringo said. Hands on his hips, he stared at them for a minute, then shook his head in disgust that was clearly aimed at himself. \u201cI thought it was important to know what he was doing when he wasn\u2019t stalking Jessy. And you\u2014\u201d He looked at Dillon. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me to stick with her like glue. You never said that.\u201d</p><p>Dillon gritted his teeth, seething with anger at himself. He\u2019d known Jessy was in danger. He\u2019d known it in his gut, and he had left her alone anyway.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t happen again.</p><p>Jessy was staring at Ringo. \u201cSo\u2014where did Tanner Green go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s the odd thing,\u201d Ringo said. He walked over to the sofa and sat down comfortably, resting his arms on the back of the couch and resting one booted foot on the opposite knee. He stared at them for a long moment and then said, \u201cThe craps table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...?\u201d Dillon persisted. \u201cWhat did he do at the craps table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe watched it for a while. Didn\u2019t try to touch anything, didn\u2019t interfere. He just stared at it, looking really sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all he did?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>Ringo shook his head. \u201cAfter a while he went to the penthouse elevator. He couldn\u2019t make it work. Eventually one of Landon\u2019s people came down, and he got in when they got out. You need a key card to make it go up, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cTanner Green couldn\u2019t just...um, materialize up there?\u201d</p><p>Ringo shrugged. \u201cGreen\u2019s only a novice ghost. He knows he\u2019s dead by now, but he hasn\u2019t accepted it, and he isn\u2019t dealing with it very well. I don\u2019t know what powers he\u2019s figured out yet. I know I wandered around Indigo for a few years before I even learned to travel any distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Dillon asked, interrupting impatiently. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just stood there in the elevator. I think he sees me but doesn\u2019t trust me. Anyway, I hung with him a while, and then made my way back here. Turned on the television and saw what had happened, then heard you coming, so I turned off the television\u2014and listened while you guys talked to that cop. I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there to help when you needed me, Jessy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have pushed the button and followed him up to Landon\u2019s place,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cI told you. It needs a key card, and I didn\u2019t have one. The only way I\u2019ve ever been up there was on my own power, and that wouldn\u2019t have helped Tanner any. Plus, with him refusing to see me, I couldn\u2019t explain to him how to get up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever Landon is up to, he\u2019s careful. I didn\u2019t see anything but business going on in that suite when I was up there,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cI may not be much of a spy, but I am a damn good ghost.\u201d He looked at Jessy. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll prove it to you. I won\u2019t leave your side again until this whole mess is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Ringo,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cI plan to be with Jessy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be with her all the time,\u201d Ringo said, then looked at them and started laughing. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s not go that route again. I don\u2019t intrude in the bedroom or the outhouse. But I\u2019ll be with you everywhere else, and I won\u2019t fail you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Green was in the suite before he died. Drinking spiked drinks with his boss before going for a ride,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe, maybe\u2014we need something that isn\u2019t maybe!\u201d Jessy said forcefully, then looked at Dillon. \u201cI need fresh clothes and some dinner,\u201d she told him, smiling suddenly, as if she hadn\u2019t been in mortal danger just a few hours earlier.</p><p>She stopped speaking and stared across the room, then said softly, \u201cDillon, look.\u201d</p><p>He turned. Fading in and out as he sat in one of the wingback chairs by the fire was Tanner Green.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mr. Green. Please, don\u2019t leave,\u201d Jessy entreated.</p><p>Dillon kept his own voice low and calm, \u201cTanner, we\u2019re trying to help you. Everyone in this room wants to help you.\u201d</p><p>But Tanner Green faded away, despite their pleas. They all stared at the chair as the seconds ticked by, but Tanner didn\u2019t reappear.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t he stay?\u201d Dillon murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying. It\u2019s just not as easy as you\u2019d think,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>Clancy woofed suddenly, and Dillon frowned, listening. Finally he heard what the dog had already sensed: a car coming down the street and pulling up in front of the house.</p><p>In the police car, Sandra tried to pull herself together, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling as if she\u2019d let Jessy down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Ms. Nelson,\u201d Cheever said when she confessed her guilt to him. \u201cNo one can know ahead of time that this kind of thing is going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have been with her,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Even if you\u2019d been there, what chance would two women have had against two trained thugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just all such a mess. I mean, poor Jessy. First a guy just ups and dies on her, and now she\u2019s in danger herself,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop worrying or you\u2019re going to make yourself sick. Dillon\u2019s with her, and he seems pretty capable of protecting her. Now, how about some directions so I can get you home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked at the cop. He came on as gruff, but he had spoken so gently just now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over in Henderson. Just hop on the highway, and I\u2019ll show you where to get off,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cAnd thank you. My girl is pretty grown-up, but I don\u2019t like to leave her alone at home too late.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou just never know what can happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a good parent,\u201d Cheever said approvingly.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s everything to me,\u201d Sandra told him. \u201cWhat about you? Your job is pretty dangerous, huh.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, and a slight smile crossed his face. \u201cNot so dangerous. Narcotics, now, that\u2019s dangerous. Drug lords and junkies. Those folks are scary. In homicide\u2014well, by the time I get to them, they\u2019re not going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Sandra warned. \u201cThe victims may be dead, but whoever killed them is still out there. Take this case. Whoever killed Tanner Green is still out there and going after Jessy.\u201d</p><p>He cast her a glance. \u201cAre you an entertainer, too, Ms. Nelson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Sandra, please. And I was, but now I\u2019m a writer. Which I guess means I\u2019m still an entertainer, in a way.\u201d She pointed to a sign along the highway. \u201cThere...Take this exit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo are you...still married?\u201d Cheever asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not anymore. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Cheever shook his head. \u201cBelieve it or not, dating is not such a breeze when you\u2019re a homicide cop. Go figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right person will come along for you, Detective. I\u2019m certain,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThere, that\u2019s my house on the right.\u201d</p><p>Cheever pulled up in front of the pleasant little ranch-style dwelling she\u2019d pointed to. \u201cI\u2019ll see you into the house,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>She got out of the car, glad that he was staying until she\u2019d locked the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cReggie?\u201d she called as she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cIn here, Mom, on the computer!\u201d Reggie called.</p><p>Sandra thanked Cheever for the ride, then leaned back against the newly locked door. She was still worried sick about Jessy, but at least Jessy had Dillon now. Reggie was her world. And Reggie was safe. Life was good.</p><p>Timothy lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling. This had been a good day. He enjoyed spending time with Mrs. Teasdale. True, she needed her medications, but she was bright and her mind was still clear, and she made him feel young again. Not this week, but soon, one day when Jessy was free, they would plan their trek out to the reservation.</p><p>For now, he was feeling fine. Usually everyone, even Jessy, did nothing more than humor him when he talked about the people in the wall.</p><p>But today...</p><p>Today Dillon Wolf had come by to see him, looking so much like the man in the image the ghosts in the wall kept showing him.</p> <p>Right now, Billie Tiger was up on the ceiling. At first Timothy had seen only the patterns in the plaster. Then, as they always did, they began to take shape, almost as if there was a movie playing on the ceiling.</p><p>Billie Tiger was a handsome man with his feathered headpiece and clothes in traditional bright Seminole colors. His skin was deep brown, in color, and he had large almond-shaped eyes.</p><p>\u201cBrother Hawk,\u201d he said gravely to Timothy.</p><p>\u201cTiger,\u201d Timothy returned.</p><p>\u201cThe time grows near, the time when times collide,\u201d Tiger said. \u201cThey are gathering, but I have not seen the men at the door, the men who come with evil purpose, driven by greed, who care not what danger they bring to others.\u201d Tiger\u2019s voice faded, and the movie began. Timothy saw the dusty roads of an old ghost town. He saw the buildings, faded almost to the color of the sand. Timothy felt as if he were there, as if he were walking down those streets. He strode along a wooden sidewalk toward the swinging doors of the saloon. He pushed them open, and then he was inside. A man was playing the piano, and when Timothy sat down next to him, it was as if he somehow slid into the body of the other man. The keys felt so real beneath his fingers. There was a woman standing at his side, leaning against the piano. She was pretty, but she would have been prettier if she hadn\u2019t looked so tired and worn. She began to sing, but it was clear that her heart wasn\u2019t in it. Once, when she\u2019d been young and filled hope, she had probably sung in a rich soprano. She might even have smiled back then, and her smile would have lit up a room. But she was tired, he knew, and so was he. They had both been in Indigo too long.</p><p>He turned and saw the bartender wiping down the bar with a rag, while several patrons were pouring whiskey down their gullets, neat.</p><p>He looked around and saw the poker players. John Wolf had a quiet strength that marked him as a leader, though he wasn\u2019t a chief. He was a half-breed, a man who had learned that he would never be accepted in either world and had become stronger from having to make his own way in the world. If anyone could save Indigo, it was John Wolf.</p><p>All this he knew because, in some strange way he was not only himself but the piano player. And as the piano player, he knew he had a Lakota wife and three children, and that his oldest son had a white wife who hadn\u2019t wanted to stay in Indigo. The two of them had set up housekeeping on a patch of land closer to the river. They were near the bigger town of White Rock but still near a reservation, and they were somehow managing to straddle the line between those two worlds, heedless of the slights some cast their way, in love despite them. That was the definition of hope, he thought. Hope also resided in John Wolf because Wolf had returned from the territorial capital earlier that day, and something had happened there, something Wolf wasn\u2019t talking about but that had clearly given himself a sense of power that practically radiated from him. And now Wolf was waiting, waiting for Varny, but also waiting for someone else. Mariah. He had something to tell her, he\u2019d said, and he wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone else. Clearly it was connected to the business he\u2019d transacted in the capital. And as he waited, his guns were always within reach. He was a man of peace, but he knew how to shoot.</p><p>The other players at the table were the sheriff, Grant Percy, who wanted to be brave but had already been cowed by the man whose malignant presence had infected the whole town. Frank Varny ruled Indigo. He\u2019d used money to bribe and to bully until he\u2019d created a gang of men to do his bidding, and from the labor\u2014even the deaths\u2014of others, he had created his own kingdom. But if money had built him up, then money could also bring him down.</p><p>And he knew it.</p><p>The town idiot was at the poker table, too.</p><p>Mark Davison was a buffoon. He had cast his lot with Varny as soon as he came to town. He swaggered and pretended to be brave, but at heart he was a coward.</p><p>Then there was Ringo Murphy. Freewheeling, and too young to know that confidence and a sense of one\u2019s own immortality wasn\u2019t always enough to combat the power of greed and evil. Ringo thought he\u2019d seen it all. He\u2019d fought in the war. He\u2019d watched everything he\u2019d known and loved go up in ashes. He thought his weariness was a bulletproof cloak, but it was not.</p><p>The saloon doors suddenly burst open. A man stood in the doorway, silhouetted by the setting sun. Just the dark figure of a man, nothing more, and still he was somehow the epitome of evil.</p><p>Varny had shown up before Mariah. The timing was off. Out of kilter. And it would change everything.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out,\u201d he told Milly. And in the dream he was the piano player as he spoke to her.</p><p>And then he rose from the piano and slipped out the back.</p><p>As he did so, the movie began to fade away and Timothy felt himself sinking back into his own body, his own consciousness. The swirls in the plaster were once again nothing more than swirls in the plaster. Not even Billie Tiger, who was trying so hard to find the truth and reveal it to him, remained.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, Tiger, my brother Tiger,\u201d Timothy asked.</p><p>He thought he heard the whisper of an answer.</p><p>\u201cI am trying very hard to see, brother,\u201d Tiger told him. \u201cTime shifts, the years pass, and what happened once happens again, but what was is hidden by what is, and still I seek the truth.\u201d</p><p>Then even Tiger was gone and there was nothing but the ticking of the bedside clock.</p><p>But one certainty remained. Timothy knew he had to keep seeking the truth. With Billie Tiger\u2019s help or alone, he needed to find the truth.</p><p>Because they were assembling....</p><p>And the bloodbath was coming again.</p><p>14</p><p>Clancy suddenly passed them and raced to the front door, where she set up a racket. Jessy looked instantly to Dillon, alarmed and alert.</p><p>He offered her a smile. \u201cRight on time,\u201d he told Jessy. \u201cDown, girl, it\u2019s all right,\u201d he added, addressing the dog as he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right?\u201d Jessy asked, rising. \u201cHow do you know...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Adam Harrison,\u201d Dillon told her.</p><p>Jessy stared, her brows rising. He hadn\u2019t told her that the Adam Harrison was on the way, but then again, she couldn\u2019t really fault him for that because he hadn\u2019t had much of a chance.</p><p>\u201cAdam? That\u2019s great,\u201d Ringo said.</p><p>Jessy looked at Ringo. \u201cYou know Adam, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And no,\u201d Ringo told her. He sighed and rose. \u201cAdam isn\u2019t a nightwalker like Dillon here. He can see things sometimes. But he can\u2019t really see me, though he hears my spurs pretty clearly. We talk sometimes, through Dillon.\u201d</p><p>Dillon had opened the door, and Jessy could see Clancy wagging her tail. \u201cLeave it to you, Adam,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cEvery other plane in the sky may be late, but you always land right on time. And it\u2019s good to see the rest of you, too.\u201d</p><p>The rest of them? Jessy looked toward the door and saw that three people were entering.</p><p>The first was clearly Adam Harrison. He was around Timothy\u2019s age and had snow-white hair and beautiful light eyes, a lean face and, again like Timothy, he stood ramrod straight and was a tall man, though shorter than Dillon.</p><p>He was followed by an extremely beautiful young woman, lithe and slim, with long golden hair and brilliant aqua eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessy was surprised when Dillon picked her up and hugged her.</p><p>A spasm of jealousy flooded through Jessy and she deplored herself for it. Of course Dillon had friends, and some of them were bound to be women.</p><p>She kicked herself for being even momentarily ridiculous when the woman was followed by a man who warned, \u201cDillon, go gently there, I prefer my wife unbroken.\u201d</p> <p>Dillon grinned and unabashedly greeted the tall man with an embrace, as well. \u201cCome in, come in....\u201d He turned to smile at Jessy, and that smile warmed her all over, conveying as it did that she was important, important enough to be introduced to his guests right away.</p><p>\u201cJessy Sparhawk, Nikki and Brent Blackhawk\u2014and Adam Harrison, of course,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cBrent, Nikki, Adam, this is Jessy.\u201d</p><p>Adam took her hand first. \u201cOf course?\u201d he asked teasingly. \u201cDoes everyone know me right away because I\u2019m old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever old, Adam, just distinguished,\u201d Nikki assured him, taking Jessy\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to meet you. And I hope you\u2019ll forgive the intrusion. After Dillon called Adam, Adam called us.\u201d</p><p>Her husband stepped up next. He had long black hair, but his eyes were light, indicating that there was probably some white blood somewhere in his heritage. \u201cJessy,\u201d he said, taking her hand and studying her openly. \u201cSparhawk, huh? With that hair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLakota Sioux, just a little further back,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to meet Timothy, my grandfather. He\u2019s half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent is Lakota Sioux, too,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s you and me against the assembled tribes,\u201d Nikki said to Adam, but her grin made it obvious that she was teasing.</p><p>Jessy laughed along with everyone else and realized that she already felt comfortable with the newcomers, and she hadn\u2019t known any of them for more than a few minutes.</p><p>Clancy started barking for attention then, and Brent hunkered down to pet her. \u201cClancy, old girl. What\u2019s up? I heard you need some help around here, but the house looks in good shape to me.\u201d</p><p>Clancy barked happily, then bounded over to Nikki for more petting.</p> <p>\u201cRingo, you can come out now,\u201d Brent called over his shoulder.</p><p>Ringo made his appearance from the hallway. He ignored Brent and walked straight to Nikki, giving her an ethereal kiss upon the cheek. \u201cHello there, beautiful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cRingo, behave,\u201d Dillon warned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cSo, cowboy, how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a cowboy,\u201d Ringo said indignantly. \u201cI was a decorated war hero and a gunslinger, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, this is frustrating,\u201d Adam said, and turned to Jessy. \u201cSo you see Ringo, too?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWould someone mind telling me what\u2019s being said?\u201d Adam asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe just wants us to know that he was a civil war hero and a gunslinger, not a cowboy.\u201d</p><p>Jessy looked at Adam curiously. He was looking in the right direction, but she had a feeling that was only because he saw where everyone else was looking.</p><p>\u201cYou never...see? Is that frustrating?\u201d she asked him quietly, wondering whether seeing ghosts was really much of a gift anyway. It was simply a...phenomenon, one that came to you. You couldn\u2019t buy it, steal it or simply wish it into existence.</p><p>Adam smiled serenely. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to see Josh, my son. That\u2019s what matters to my heart. When I can\u2019t help others because I can\u2019t see them, that\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You always know how to find us,\u201d Nikki told him affectionately.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s a nightwalker, too?\u201d Brent asked Dillon, inclining his head in Jessy\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYes, but only very recently. Her ability seems to be connected to Tanner Green\u2019s death,\u201d Dillon explained.</p><p>She was a nightwalker. The word was terrifying, in a way, and yet it also filled her with a strange sense of pride and belonging.</p><p>\u201cYou guys will have to fill us in on exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d Nikki said, then looked probingly at Dillon and Jessy. \u201cYou two look like you\u2019ve been in a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessy was attacked earlier tonight,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>All eyes turned to her with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she assured them quickly.</p><p>\u201cTell us about it,\u201d Adam said, walking into the living room and taking a seat.</p><p>As soon as everyone else was comfortably settled, too, Ringo groaned. \u201cIt was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat wasn\u2019t what?\u201d Adam asked, and Dillon told him what Ringo had said.</p><p>Then, between Dillon and Jessy, they explained the events of the evening.</p><p>\u201cTwo men, obviously a planned assault, using ski masks. I\u2019d say someone out there is getting scared,\u201d Adam commented. He looked at Dillon. \u201cThe police are investigating the obvious leads, right?\u201d</p><p>Dillon nodded. \u201cAnd I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re all here to help with the...less obvious angle. There are things I need to do, but now that we know Jessy is in danger, I want someone with her every minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing about work?\u201d Nikki asked her.</p><p>\u201cI have two days off,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Brent said. \u201cIt will help us if we have fewer fronts to cover and fewer crowds to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Dillon looked at Adam and said, \u201cEmil Landon is involved somehow. I know it.\u201d He went on to recount the story of Tanner Green dying on the craps table, then counted off the people involved in the case. \u201cAs soon as possible, I questioned all the workers who had been out front that night. A guy named Rudy Yorba thought Tanner Green had come out of a current-model super-stretch white limo, but he was killed in a supposed hit-and-run before I had a chance to talk to him again. I\u2019m certain he was killed because someone realized he\u2019d talked to me and didn\u2019t want him saying anything more. Anyway, I checked, and there are two limos fitting that description in use right now\u2014one belonging to the Sun and one to the Big Easy. Strangely, they both ended up in the garage. The same garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke in to that garage, I take it?\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Dillon nodded.</p><p>\u201cI found a button in the one belonging to the Big Easy\u2014Landon\u2019s casino\u2014and I think it could have come from Green\u2019s shirt. I left it where I found it, though, and planted a bug in Cheever\u2019s ear, so I suspect it will be rediscovered any time now. Anyway, Landon\u2019s remaining goon, Hugo Blythe, showed up at that point, so I got out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he see you?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m certain he didn\u2019t know it was me. He chased me, but he\u2019s as big as an ox, and that makes him slow,\u201d Dillon explained. \u201cI got away clean. And then there\u2019s Indigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndigo,\u201d Brent repeated. \u201cWe went out there years ago.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a ghost town. In fact, it was a ghost town almost from the moment it was conceived. It\u2019s too far from water, and even then, it was a long, dry haul back from there to anywhere worth being. It served the miners who were working the claims owned by a nasty piece of work named Frank Varny. He went down in a rain of gunfire, along with some of the locals, and the town didn\u2019t last long after that. You think something\u2019s going on out in Indigo that\u2019s connected to this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. And I also think it\u2019s connected to something Timothy, Jessy\u2019s grandfather, warned me about. He said that \u2018they\u2019 are assembling,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>Jessy turned to him, startled. She realized that Dillon hadn\u2019t been pretending to listen to Timothy; he honestly believed Timothy had an ability to divine information from the people in the walls or...somewhere. She felt a little tremor in her stomach. Had she been too quick to think her grandfather was slipping? No, his ramblings had seemed genuinely bizarre. Then again, she was seeing dead men, and most people would call that crazy, too.</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that we\u2019re looking at a number of things,\u201d Adam said. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s Indigo. We need to find out what we can about the town. Next, there\u2019s Jessy. We have to keep her safe. Then there are the two casinos, and I\u2019d like to take a closer look at the Sun to start with. So first thing tomorrow, I\u2019d like to spend some time with Timothy, then play some craps over at the Sun. Dillon, you keep researching Indigo. Dig deep. Find all the old records you can and see what we don\u2019t know about the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I say we need to decide what to have for supper,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Jessy admitted, smiling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awfully late. Will anything be open?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>Brent, Adam and Dillon looked at her, and simultaneously said, \u201cThis is Vegas!\u201d</p><p>Nikki laughed. \u201cGood point. So should we go out or order in?\u201d</p><p>While the others were debating their options, Jessy turned to Adam. \u201cEmil Landon is anything but a poster boy for ethical behavior,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhy did you suggest that Dillon take on this case?\u201d</p><p>Adam was silent for a moment, then said, \u201cEmil Landon called me and asked specifically for Dillon. He said someone on the police force had told him that Dillon could find out what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jessy argued, \u201cbut don\u2019t a lot of people ask for your help? I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t take on every case, so why this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was curious, for one,\u201d Adam said. \u201cRingo told Dillon that he should take the case, too. Even so, I was going to turn him down, but then, I had a...well, a gut feeling that we should pursue it.\u201d</p><p>Jessy swung on Ringo. \u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Ringo lifted his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it was the same thing, a gut feeling. I just had a sense that there was something going on here and we needed to be involved in it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly turning out to be intriguing,\u201d Adam said, his eyes lightly sparkling. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s going to be important, too. Just because I\u2019m not a nightwalker, that doesn\u2019t mean my intuition isn\u2019t reliable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour intuition certainly seems just fine to me,\u201d Jessy told him.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Adam said. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see what the ravening horde has decided to do about dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Brent had rented a car, and since Dillon\u2019s was still on the Strip, they decided to squeeze into Brent\u2019s to retrieve Dillon\u2019s, then grab something to eat. After dinner, Brent and Nikki would head out to stay at Jessy\u2019s house, keeping an eye on things there, while Jessy and Adam would stay at Dillon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room for everyone to stay here, you know,\u201d Dillon pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut Tanner Green might come looking for Jessy at her place, and he just might decide he likes Nikki or me better than he apparently likes you,\u201d Brent pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Dillon admitted, grinning ruefully.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good plan,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI can keep an eye on Jessy when you\u2019re not around, Dillon, and this house is safe.\u201d He grinned. \u201cRingo can bunk with me if he wants to. After all, if he kicks or snores, it won\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI resent that,\u201d Ringo commented.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Dillon translated, shooting a warning look at Ringo, who snorted disdainfully.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Nikki begged. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>They were settled at an all-night buffet and it was nearing 2:00 a.m. when Dillon\u2019s phone rang. The cops? he wondered.</p><p>It was a cop\u2014-but not one Dillon would have expected.</p><p>\u201cDillon?\u201d The voice was feminine.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sarah. Sarah Clay, from forensics.\u201d</p><p>He sat straighter. \u201cSarah. Thanks for calling me. Have you found something out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019ve just brought in a corpse, and.... I saw the news tonight that you were there when Jessy Sparhawk was attacked by a couple of guys wearing black. I could be way off base on this, but they\u2019ve just brought in an apparent suicide. A guy took a dive off the roof of the Rainbow. He\u2019s about thirty-five, no ID, but we\u2019re running his prints through the system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said an apparent suicide,\u201d Dillon said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like, and I\u2019d even believe that\u2019s what it was, if he weren\u2019t dressed all in black. I thought you might want to know. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m way off base, but the black clothing made me think there might be a connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there right now?\u201d Dillon asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cThe place is pretty quiet. I think Tarleton is around somewhere, doing the autopsy. I can meet you at the entry and let you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d Dillon told her.</p> <p>Even though Adam would be with Jessy\u2014and Clancy was guarding the house, plus he had a few homemade alarms\u2014Dillon didn\u2019t want Jessy and Adam going back to his place without Brent and Nikki. No one minded.</p><p>Dillon left them with the rental and took his own car out to the morgue. He saw Sarah Clay waiting just inside as he parked.</p><p>She opened the door and let him in, then told him that since a few people were still around working, it would be smart if he put on scrubs, which would make him less noticeable.</p><p>As soon as he was dressed, she led him to one of the freezers and pulled out a drawer.</p><p>She explained that the M.E. hadn\u2019t done more than a cursory inspection of the body as of yet. It had probably been photographed, and probed to determine lividity and time of death, but otherwise it was pretty much in its original state.</p><p>The man\u2019s own mother wouldn\u2019t have recognized him. He had apparently landed facedown, so there was no face left.</p><p>Not that that really mattered from Dillon\u2019s point of view, since he hadn\u2019t seen the attacker\u2019s face, because of the ski mask. The man\u2019s build seemed to be the same as the slighter attacker\u2019s, though, and when Sarah showed him the man\u2019s shirt, which she pulled from a pile of neatly folded clothes on a nearby table, the style appeared to be the same.</p><p>He stared at the corpse, then at Sarah. \u201cAnything on the prints yet?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him, then picked up a file folder and began to read. \u201cHarold Miffins, alias Nigel Tombs, alias Burt Tolken. He\u2019s got a record a mile long, but mostly for petty theft and breaking and entering. Thirty-five. No known family. He\u2019s moved around a bit. Hailed from Flagstaff, started on his petty-crime spree in Los Angeles, came to Vegas, went to New York, returned to California, then came back to Vegas. No drug arrests. Looks as if he just couldn\u2019t hold down a job, so he kept returning to a life of crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything about what he\u2019d been doing in Vegas before he took his plunge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, if the cops have gotten anything, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He looked at the body for a moment longer. It was a twisted mass of blood and bruising. Whatever his past crimes, he had just paid a hefty price.</p><p>Dillon thanked Sarah, and as she led him back to the front door, she promised to call him if she heard anything. \u201cI\u2019d really like to know who he was working for,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think they hand out social-security forms when they hire you for a hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was connected to someone here in Vegas. You don\u2019t plan a coordinated hit like tonight\u2019s on your own, not when your past crimes are pretty much limited to knocking over convenience stores. He was no master criminal.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really burning the midnight oil,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going places,\u201d she told him confidently. \u201cThe more tech knowledge I can master, the better a detective I\u2019m going to be. I\u2019m aiming for homicide detective, then I\u2019m going to be a lieutenant in homicide, and from there I\u2019m going to make my way to the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d he said.</p><p>She let him out. \u201cI\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sarah. Thank you a lot.\u201d</p><p>Jessy was glad that Clancy was friends with Brent. She barely barked when they arrived, then went over to both Brent and Nikki looking for attention. Brent left Jessy with Nikki, then took Adam, and together they went through every room in the house. They declared the house clean. \u201cStill, I think we\u2019ll hang around a while,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>It was well past 3:00 a.m., and Jessy could hardly keep her eyes open. They had stopped by her house on the way to dinner so she could show Brent and Nikki how to work her alarm, and she had picked up a bunch of her own things, so there was really nothing to keep her from going to bed.</p><p>She yawned, and Nikki laughed and said, \u201cYou should get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certainly going to bed. I\u2019m too old to stay up this late,\u201d Adam said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have a cup of tea, and if Dillon isn\u2019t back by then, I\u2019ll call it a night, too,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cI brew a great pot of tea,\u201d Brent said, and shrugged. \u201cMy father was Sioux, but my mother was off-the-boat Irish. I come by my talent honestly.\u201d</p><p>So Adam went off to bed, and Jessy and Nikki sat down in the living room to wait while Brent did his thing. Ringo joined them, his spurs jingling as he rested his feet on the coffee table.</p><p>Jessy turned to Nikki. \u201cWere you...born with the ability to see the dead?\u201d</p><p>Nikki shook her head and leaned back, closing her eyes for a minute. \u201cNo. One of my best friends was murdered, but I saw her standing at the foot of my bed just after it happened. I went through all the usual. I thought I\u2019d been dreaming, that I\u2019d had a nightmare. Anyway, that was a while ago now, but I still don\u2019t have all the answers.\u201d She glanced at her husband, who was in the kitchen. \u201cBrent was very young when he first saw...\u201d She paused, looking at Ringo, who appeared to be sleeping, his hat pulled low over his brow. \u201cThe past,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cGhosts,\u201d Ringo corrected, clearly not asleep after all.</p><p>\u201cBrent was just a kid, on a trip through the Dakotas with his parents, when he saw the Battle of the Little Bighorn being played out all over again right in front of him. After that, it became a natural occurrence for him. But it\u2019s not easy. Just because you can see a ghost, that doesn\u2019t mean the ghost wants to interact, which, I imagine, is part of the problem here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies, ladies,\u201d Ringo said, rising. \u201cThink about it. What did you know when you were born? Or when you were a toddler? Some ghosts are quick learners, some struggle. Some are afraid because they can\u2019t accept what\u2019s happened to them. Some play out their lives over and over again, some move on and others stick around and make new friends.\u201d</p><p>Brent came out of the kitchen with the tea, but it was Ringo he addressed. \u201cAdam said that Dillon thinks the strangest thing about this case is that Rudy Yorba seems to be following Tanner Green. When Green takes off, Yorba takes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid,\u201d Ringo said firmly. \u201cI think they both are. I\u2019ve been careful to stay out of sight when I\u2019m following Green. He may not even be disappearing on purpose. He may not even know how to communicate yet. We\u2019ll have to keep hoping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rudy Yorba?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cHe might be afraid of Tanner Green, or he might not know the ropes of being dead yet. Hard to say,\u201d Ringo mused, then leaned toward the teapot and tried to inhale. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t miss whiskey, but I sure do wish I could taste that tea.\u201d He stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to bed and snore as loud as I can, see if I can bug Adam,\u201d he said.</p><p>He clinked his way to the hall.</p><p>Jessy stared after him. \u201cIt\u2019s as if he\u2019s really here,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHe is here\u2014somewhere. He\u2019s made of energy, and one of the few things scientists agree on is that energy can\u2019t be destroyed,\u201d Brent explained. \u201cSo where does a person\u2019s energy go after death? Maybe heaven and hell really exist and that\u2019s where it ends up. I\u2019ve never met a ghost who knows the truth of it, so...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSome of them choose to stay to help,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a form of karma.

It was hard to believe she could sleep after the events of the day\u2014and night\u2014but she was quite certain she could. She rose and said, \u201cThank you both for everything, but I think I have to get some sleep now. I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate not having to be afraid when I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019re doing pretty damn good learning to deal with the whole ghost thing,\u201d Nikki said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cBecause now I know it\u2019s the living I need to fear,\u201d Jessy told her, then headed for the hallway and the comfort of a soft mattress.</p><p>It felt wonderful to take a shower, as if she was washing away the horror of the attack.</p><p>Afterward, even though she had her own things, she found one of Dillon\u2019s T-shirts and crawled into it, towel dried her hair and curled up in bed.</p><p>It took only seconds for her to fall asleep.</p><p>Dillon knew he didn\u2019t need to worry about his house. He didn\u2019t have a high-tech alarm, but he had Clancy. Of course, she was flesh and blood, and she was a dog, dogs had to go out\u2014and he never let himself forget the fact that dogs could be poisoned. He watched her carefully, but he counted on more than just Clancy to provide protection.</p> <p>His windows were all discreetly rigged in his own adaptation of the old Paiute hunting style. If anyone tried to break in through a window, they would trigger a nylon net, which would fall over him, then tighten if the intruder tried to struggle free. At the same time, a buzzer sounded in the kitchen, loud enough to be heard throughout the entire house. On top of that, he was licensed to carry a firearm, and he did: a small, specially equipped Glock with one extra shot, giving him ten bullets.</p><p>Even so, it was good to find Brent and Nikki waiting up for him when he got home. He immediately told them about the latest body and his theories.</p><p>\u201cSo because this guy was in the system, and his boss was afraid he\u2019d left blood at the scene and we would find him, he took him down before he could talk?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way I see it,\u201d Dillon told him. \u201cWe have to move on this. Jessy loves her job. I don\u2019t want it to end her life.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Brent and Nikki were gone, Dillon locked the door and secured the dead bolt, then headed to his room, yawning. No one was going to have more than a few hours\u2019 sleep before they started fresh in the morning.</p><p>He found Jessy sleeping, and a wealth of emotion swept through him. He wasn\u2019t sure how it was possible to care about someone so much so quickly. Even if this ended well, there was no guarantee that she wouldn\u2019t walk right out of his life.</p> <p>He turned away and headed toward the bathroom for a shower. He glanced in the mirror as he passed and saw that his hair was in disarray, and there was a smudge on his cheek, and thought that it would have been nice if someone had told him about that.</p><p>Then he stripped down and stepped into the shower, closed his eyes and let the water rush down on him.</p><p>He heard a noise and instinctively turned off the water, tension filling him, then stepped silently out of the shower, reaching automatically for the first weapon he could find: the towel rack. If he needed to, he could rip it off the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d Jessy said quickly, her hypnotically blue eyes huge.</p><p>\u201cYou were sleeping,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I heard you come in,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am\u2014but not that exhausted.\u201d</p> <p>Heedless of the fact that he was dripping wet, he took her into his arms. The water on his heated skin quickly soaked the T-shirt, which seemed incredibly erotic. He kissed her, tugging off the shirt, which was only an irritating barrier between them. In a matter of seconds her eyes were on his again as her breasts rose and fell, and then she was back in his arms.</p><p>They kissed, the steam filling the air around them and adding to the rising heat in their bodies. Then he lifted her until she straddled his hips, and they both laughed as he carried her from the bathroom to the bed, where together they fell to the mattress. Their laughter faded then, and he shifted, moving into her, exhaustion fading away in his urgency to be with her.</p><p>They moved swiftly, climaxed violently, then drifted down and made love slowly. Eventually, they fell asleep, tangled in one another\u2019s arms.</p><p>To Jessy\u2019s astonishment, Dillon was still asleep when she woke up.</p><p>She tried very hard to slip out from beneath him without waking him up. It was early\u2014especially considering that they hadn\u2019t actually gone to sleep until around eight-thirty\u2014but she was a creature of habit, and she had been meeting Timothy for breakfast for so long that she was pretty sure it would be impossible for her to sleep late in the morning anymore, no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>She slipped on a simple T-shirt and jeans for the time being, thinking that she could shower and dress in something more presentable once Dillon was awake.</p><p>Clancy was waiting for a chance to go outside, so Jessy let her out, and then put on a pot of coffee. While the coffee brewed, she checked in the living room, but Adam was nowhere in sight, either. Feeling hungry, she made herself some whole wheat toast and realized that she hadn\u2019t eaten much the night before. She\u2019d been starving when they got to the buffet, but her appetite had waned once Dillon received the call from the woman in forensics.</p><p>She realized that she hadn\u2019t even asked him anything about that when he had come in. She had needed to touch him, to be with him, and nothing else had mattered.</p><p>Her toast popped, and she found some butter and jam. With her plate in one hand and coffee cup in the other, she rounded the counter toward the living room, figuring she would watch the news.</p><p>But as she came around the counter, she froze.</p><p>The living room had been empty. Empty, and as quiet as the dead.</p><p>No longer.</p><p>Tanner Green was sitting in a comfortably upholstered chair.</p><p>Behind him, standing as if he was ready to run at any minute, was Rudy Yorba.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave, please,\u201d Jessy said quietly, reassuringly. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. You\u2019ve been trying to reach me for days, and now I\u2019m here\u2014just me, no else\u2014so don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>She had to admit that she was a little bit afraid herself. Yes, she was, just a little. She had gotten accustomed to Ringo, but now, faced with two of the newly dead, she felt herself begin to tremble.</p><p>She tried to remain perfectly calm as she took a seat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d She spoke softly, and carefully set down her breakfast, then reached for her coffee cup, needing a sip, as if it were alcohol and might bolster her courage.</p><p>\u201cMr. Green,\u201d she said politely. \u201cI apologize for being afraid of you at first, but I\u2019m not afraid now. I want to help you. The people who killed you are trying to hurt other people.\u201d Her voice cracked for a minute. \u201cThey killed Rudy, and they\u2019re going to kill again if you won\u2019t help me. Please, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Tanner Green\u2019s mouth worked as if he was trying to talk; then he started to fade away.</p><p>Suddenly she heard Ringo\u2019s impatient voice.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you big coward. Be a man and talk to the lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle this,\u201d Jessy objected firmly.</p><p>But Ringo\u2019s approach had the desired effect.</p><p>Tanner Green seemed to stabilize in his chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to stay,\u201d Jessy said, at a loss for anything else. \u201cNow, please, tell who ki\u2014who did this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to find out.\u201d He seemed surprised that he had actually managed to speak. He almost smiled, then spoke again, his confidence seeming to grow. \u201cI keep trying to remember the day, where I was. I keep trying to retrace my footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Jessy told him encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Yorba, you could sit down,\u201d she added quietly.</p><p>Rudy Yorba seemed startled to be addressed so directly, and Tanner Green stared at him curiously. She reminded herself that they hadn\u2019t known one another in life.</p><p>She took a long drink of coffee, set the cup back down and asked, \u201cRudy, why do you keep hiding from Mr. Green?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching him. I think whoever killed him killed me, too, so I thought if I followed him, I could find out who that was. But I was afraid for him to see me. He\u2019s...huge.\u201d</p><p>Jessy nodded. \u201cHe is, but I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Tanner look at Rudy quizzically. \u201cWhy the hell would I hurt you? I don\u2019t even know you!\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t part of this, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, we think Rudy was killed by the same people who killed you,\u201d Jessy said quickly, then cleared her throat. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure Rudy was killed because someone knew he had talked to Dillon\u2014Dillon Wolf,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking for the same answers, and we all need to help each other.\u201d</p><p>Rudy didn\u2019t speak, but Tanner Green frowned and said, \u201cI remember...having a drink, and then...then it changed. Everything changed. There was so much neon. I saw the playground from when I was a kid in Philly...I saw...I saw lights. I saw you. You...Someone attacked me, and then I fell down and died on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s not like you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRudy, what about you? Did you see anything?\u201d Jessy asked him.</p><p>\u201cLights. I saw lights. The bastard came at me like a bat out of hell. He meant to kill me, not just to hit me. It was murder, and I want the bastard who did it,\u201d Rudy said.</p><p>\u201cRudy, how did you run out of gas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run out of gas,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone siphoned my tank. They left me enough to get out on the highway, and they knew exactly where I\u2019d have to start walking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessy looked over at Tanner Green. \u201cMr. Green, how about you? Can you think of anything that might help?\u201d</p><p>The big man shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m trying. I knew someone was after Emil Landon, and I was ready to defend him. But who the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cYou said you knew that someone was after Emil. How did you know? Because he told you so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Green said. \u201cSomeone shot at him one night. I wanted to call the cops, but Mr. Landon took care of it himself. He called some cop he\u2019s kind of friends with, and after, that\u2019s when he called Adam Harrison. He insisted on getting Dillon Wolf to find out what was going on. His friend at the station had him convinced he needed Wolf. So Wolf came on the job, but he was just investigating, we were protecting\u2014Hugo Blythe and me. But I was off work when it happened. Was I killed so I couldn\u2019t protect Mr. Landon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I suppose it\u2019s possible,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>Green let out an aggrieved sigh.</p><p>\u201cMr. Green, there\u2019s something else. We need to know why you whispered \u2018Indigo\u2019 to me before you died.\u201d</p><p>15</p> <p>Dillon awoke with a start. Despite the heavy drapes, he knew that day had come.</p><p>He reached out in anticipation, then realized that Jessy wasn\u2019t beside him. He jumped up and started toward the door, then realized he was naked and Adam was in the house, and went back for a robe.</p><p>He almost called her name, but it was always better to seek someone in silence, so he hurried down the hall as quickly and quietly as he could.</p><p>He reached the living room and stopped short in shock.</p><p>There was Jessy, all that long red hair streaming around her face in a red halo, a stunning contrast to her navy blue T-shirt. She was holding a cup of coffee, one of her legs crossed over the other, and she was engaged in what looked to be the most casual conversation in the world.</p><p>With three ghosts.</p> <p>Ringo, a given, was at her side. But Tanner Green was there, too, sitting in a wingback chair, his expression one of intense concentration.</p><p>Rudy Yorba was there, too. He looked tense, standing behind Green, watching the others.</p><p>Ringo sensed Dillon\u2019s presence first. He interrupted Tanner Green just as he was about to speak and said, \u201cGreen, don\u2019t you go turning into a girlie-man again and disappearing. Dillon is a longtime nightwalker, and he\u2019s the one person here who can really help you. Stay, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Green looked up at Dillon and began to fade. Dillon silently cursed himself and spoke quickly and very softly. \u201cPlease, Green, I need you. We need your help.\u201d</p><p>Tanner Green took what looked for all the world like a deep breath and his image stabilized.</p><p>Next, Dillon looked across the room at Rudy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rudy, to his surprise, seemed to release some of the tension that had held him so stiffly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be. Not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to help,\u201d Dillon reminded him.</p> <p>\u201cI was all over those tapes. Hell, if that cop hadn\u2019t been such a jerk, I might have talked to him right away, and then I probably would have been killed sooner. What is, is. But I want to know the truth. I want to know who did this to me, and then I want to watch the bastard fry. At the least, I want him locked up for the rest of his life, and when he is, I\u2019m going to see to it that he doesn\u2019t have a minute of peace for as long as he lives.\u201d</p><p>Jessy cleared her throat, looking at Dillon. Her eyes were bottomless pools of blue, but she was clearly doing amazingly well.</p><p>\u201cDillon, I was just asking Mr. Green about Indigo,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dillon walked over to the couch, and Ringo moved to accommodate him as he took a seat next to Jessy.</p><p>\u201cIndigo might be the key to everything,\u201d Dillon explained to Green. \u201cWe need to know what\u2019s so important about the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s gold there,\u201d Tanner Green said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Dillon asked. \u201cThere\u2019s been a legend about the gold for over a century, but are you telling me it\u2019s real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Green said, frowning as if the answer was just out of reach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this. Let\u2019s start with the beginning of your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what were you doing on your day off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping late. I have a room up in the penthouse. Landon, he acts like a prick, but he\u2019s pretty decent to the people who work for him. I slept until noon. Blythe was on guard duty. I don\u2019t think he was that concerned. He didn\u2019t really think anyone was after the boss. The shots that were fired...they might have been fired at anyone in that parking lot. Most people thought it was just a backfire, you know?\u201d</p><p>Dillon kept a rein on his temper. They finally had Tanner Green talking. He had to tell his story in his own time.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but when you know the sound of a bullet, you can tell it isn\u2019t a backfire,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cSo then...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then...\u201d Green paused for thought. He seemed pleased when he spoke again. \u201cI was hungry, so I went and got something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteak and potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Green said. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>Autopsy reports, Dillon thought, but he didn\u2019t say so. \u201cYou just look like a meat-and-potatoes man,\u201d he fudged.</p><p>Green nodded again. \u201cThen I went gambling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit a few places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you gamble at the Big Easy?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>Green shook his head. \u201cNo. Can\u2019t work there and gamble there. It\u2019s not allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so where?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, I hit some of the big ones. Bally\u2019s, Wynn, MGM.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stayed on the Strip?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think I gambled at the Sun, too,\u201d he said, musing over his own answer. \u201cYeah, I was there.\u201d</p><p>Dillon made a mental note to check that out on the security tapes. Even if Green had been there, did it mean anything?</p><p>\u201cAnd were you drinking in the course of the day?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, here and there. I\u2019m not a lush. But I did have something, and that\u2019s when the lights I was telling Miss Sparhawk about started up and...I was playing kickball in Philly again,\u201d Green said.</p><p>Rudy Yorba snorted.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault. Someone slipped him some LSD,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d Rudy asked.</p><p>\u201cFor real,\u201d Dillon repeated.</p><p>\u201cMr. Green, can we talk about Indigo again?\u201d Jessy said, slipping back into the conversation.</p><p>Dillon could feel the tension in her. He gently set a hand on her knee, a warning that they needed to be patient.</p><p>\u201cI was in a car\u2014a limo, maybe\u2014and I heard people talking about it, saying there had to be a way to find the gold, that it was really there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Dillon asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was there, and at the same time I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Green said.</p><p>Dillon rubbed his forehead in frustration. Green had overheard the conversation, but he\u2019d been tripping and had no memory of the specifics.</p><p>\u201cPlease, try to think. This is important,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cDo you remember being in a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nice car. A limo, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good. Who else was in the car?\u201d</p><p>Tanner Green frowned in concentration. \u201cFriends. I think. The kids I played kickball with.\u201d</p><p>Dillon leaned forward. \u201cTanner, you weren\u2019t really with your friends from the old days back in Philly. It had to be someone you know from here. Think hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d Green said.</p><p>They were all startled by a cheerful whistle coming from the hall. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Adam Harrison said as he walked into the room, showered and dressed and ready to tackle the day.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay!\u201d Dillon said when Tanner looked as if he was about to disappear again. \u201cIt\u2019s Adam, my boss, and he can\u2019t even see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen. You all keep talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to think,\u201d Tanner said, his image solidifying. \u201cI need to think.\u201d</p><p>Dillon rose. He needed to do some thinking himself. \u201cRudy, go hang around the Sun and see what you can pick up. Tanner, you go back to the Big Easy and see what you can find out over there. Jessy, we need to go see your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Rudy said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off, then,\u201d Green said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d Jessy said to Dillon. \u201cYou can go fill Adam in.\u201d</p><p>Nikki and Brent met them at the home, and Timothy was delighted with the extra company. He and Brent talked for several minutes about the old ways, and it made Jessy smile to see Timothy so happy.</p><p>She was embarrassed when Sandra called and she realized that she had forgotten to call her friend that morning to assure her that everything was all right. She stepped out into the hall and told Sandra that some friends of Dillon\u2019s were in town, and said maybe they could all meet up that night.</p><p>Sandra was relieved to hear that Jessy was now surrounded by people who could be trusted. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be with someone every second of the day,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Jessy assured her.</p><p>Sandra hung up, and Jessy wandered back to Timothy\u2019s room, where he was happily holding court. A little while later Dillon said he had to leave to do some work at the library. Adam excused himself, too, and said he was going to take the rental car and head over to the Sun to see if he could overhear anything useful, maybe even find someone likely to know something and get him talking. The others seemed happy enough to spend time at the home with Timothy until someone was free to pick them up.</p><p>Once they were gone, Brent Blackhawk faced Timothy. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear more about the ghost dancers,\u201d he said gravely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Timothy, seeming totally lucid, nodded, looking anxious, and glanced at Jessy. She went to his side and put her arms around him. \u201cTimothy, it\u2019s okay. The rest of us see things that others don\u2019t, too. Brent has been seeing...ghosts for many years, and he believes in your visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are assembling,\u201d Timothy said.</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d Brent asked him.</p> <p>\u201cMy ancestor, Dillon\u2019s ancestor. The others...I know their names. The singer is Milly, and there is a man named Ringo Murphy and another named Mark Davison. No one likes him. The sheriff is there, too. His name is Grant Percy. Or Percy Grant,\u201d Timothy said, frowning and shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. But they\u2019re waiting. Something evil lives there. The posse is on the way, and Wolf is waiting, but he\u2019s been betrayed. Someone told the evil man that he was there, because otherwise he couldn\u2019t have known so quickly that Wolf had returned. And now they\u2019re assembling again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Timothy?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the gold,\u201d Timothy said.</p><p>\u201cBut there is no gold. The veins they found were tapped out, and no one ever found the mother lode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s there,\u201d Timothy said gravely. \u201cIt\u2019s there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>Timothy ignored the question or maybe didn\u2019t even hear it, and said, \u201cThey\u2019ll assemble because they\u2019re searching for the gold.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t theirs, and that\u2019s why they want to find it first. So they can steal it.\u201d</p><p>For the second time that day, Jessy wanted to scream in frustration. Half of what he was saying made sense, and the rest sounded like nothing but nonsense.</p><p>Were all these people really dying because of gold that might not even exist?</p><p>The Henderson Library not only offered state-of-the-art facilities but a coffee shop and, best of all, librarians who were helpful, knowledgeable and willing to tackle any challenge.</p><p>Dillon started out by researching the town itself.</p> <p>Indigo had been incorporated in 1857 by miners working a nearby goldfield that, sadly, didn\u2019t pan out as they\u2019d hoped. Still, for years men kept looking for the vein that was rumored to be bigger than any other find. Frank Varny owned the mining rights on as much of the nearby land as he could grab and worked relentlessly to control the area. There were a few struggling ranches closer to the river, and the town had enough going on to support a bank, a doctor and a weekly newspaper. Every now and then a preacher even came to town and set up shop, but the preachers never lasted. The single church had pretty much crumbled into the dust, and it had never been repaired. The land the town stood on had not, oddly enough, actually belonged to Varny, but to an old miner who had moved on to the San Francisco goldfields. In 1876, a purchase, duly registered in the territorial offices, showed that one John Wolf had paid the measly sum requested by the old owner, and a deed had been written out, making the Paiute nation the actual owners of the land.</p><p>Dillon looked up and shook his head. He hadn\u2019t learned anything new. He started looking for articles on the gunfight that had killed John Wolf and Frank Varny, along with a number of others.</p><p>Blood Bath in Indigo, read one headline.</p><p>Dillon began to scan the accompanying article, Timothy\u2019s words running through his head as he read.</p><p>They are assembling.</p><p>The account of the incident said that there had been a history of bad blood between John Wolf and Frank Varny. It was a pretty good article, Dillon thought, filled with facts. Killed: Frank Varny, John Wolf, Ringo Murphy, Mark Davison, Sheriff Grant Percy and five hired guns who had worked for Frank Varny: Austin Makepiece, Riley Hornsby, Seth Bigelow, Drew Miffins and Tobias Wilson. Those who had survived the massacre and lived to describe it had been Mariah Wolf, Milly Taylor and the piano player, George Turner, who had left before the gunfire to raise a citizens\u2019 posse. Despite being afraid and armed with only a motley array of weapons, they had come as quickly as they could, but arrived only after the bloodbath. Since John Wolf had purchased and registered the claim to the land on behalf of the Paiute nation, the land underneath Indigo, as well as the nearby claim, had belonged to the tribe, and a later act of Congress had given it to them in perpetuity as reservation land. Any gold discovered would belong to the tribe. But the gold hadn\u2019t been discovered, and Indigo had become a town of dust and tumbledown buildings, soon to be abandoned completely.</p><p>They are assembling.</p><p>Dillon shook his head. He was a Wolf, Jessy was descended from the piano player and Ringo was still here. There were already three dead men\u2014did they count for three of Varny\u2019s gunslingers? If so, it meant there were two remaining\u2014one gunslinger and Davison\u2014along with Varny himself. And what about Rudy? Was he connected somehow?</p> <p>He gritted his teeth, wondering if he was crazy. If he was right, Emil Landon was Varny. Two more henchmen would round it out. No, he was forgetting the sheriff, the bartender and the singer. But they hadn\u2019t taken sides in the deadly confrontation, nor had Mariah.</p><p>It still didn\u2019t make sense that the whole thing was connected to the search for gold. Men had searched the entire area, and no one had ever found the gold that legend claimed was there.</p><p>He read the article again, wondering what he wasn\u2019t seeing. And why in hell would Emil Landon hire Tanner Green as a bodyguard, then kill him himself?</p><p>On a hunch, he asked a librarian for local birth and death records. Emil Landon had claimed Paiute blood in his ancestry, which meant his lineage could be traced.</p><p>The librarian led him to a separate room, where he started to pore over long-ago records, some seemingly as dusty as the town of Indigo itself.</p><p>Finally he found exactly what he was seeking. Emil Landon could trace his bloodline back to a Paiute on his paternal side\u2014and to Frank Varny on his maternal side. Did he believe that there really was gold in Indigo? That he could finesse it away from the tribe because of his ancestry?</p><p>Dillon closed his eyes and was rubbing them in exhaustion when his phone started vibrating in his pocket. He answered it quietly.</p><p>\u201cWolf here.\u201d</p><p>It was Jerry Cheever, and Dillon realized he should have expected the call. Cheever didn\u2019t know he\u2019d already seen the latest corpse to wind up in the morgue.</p><p>\u201cOne of those guys you chased off last night is dead. At least, I think it\u2019s one of the men who attacked Jessy Sparhawk last night. Corpse came into the morgue last night, a jumper\u2014or that\u2019s what it looked like, anyway. But you\u2019ll never guess what Tarleton found in his system when he ran the tox screen today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cLSD. The fellow took a nice trip before he went for his flight straight to hell. Oh, he had a record, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s something else to factor into the equation. We\u2019re bringing Emil Landon in for questioning. Go figure,\u201d Jerry said sarcastically. \u201cWe found a button in his limo. A button off Tanner Green\u2019s shirt. Imagine that.\u201d</p><p>Dillon smiled at Cheever\u2019s sarcasm. \u201cCan you charge him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can keep him around a while. Charge him? I can try\u2014but he\u2019ll walk. Tanner Green worked for him, and whether it\u2019s true or not, Landon will say that Green sometimes drove the car. There\u2019s no way a button from Landon\u2019s employee\u2019s shirt in Landon\u2019s own casino\u2019s limo will be enough evidence to satisfy anyone that the man\u2019s a murderer. A good defense attorney\u2014hell, even a crap one\u2014could tear apart a flimsy piece of evidence like that. But I\u2019ll hold him as long as I can. See if he\u2019ll inadvertently spill some info. I could be wrong, but he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s that bright, certainly not bright enough to be behind this whole thing, so maybe we\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d</p><p>Mean, yes. Bright? Maybe not. Maybe Cheever was right.</p><p>\u201cJust because he\u2019s not brilliant doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not in on it,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cI agree. But we need evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and thanks. Jerry, mind if I come in and study the tapes again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Give me an hour or so. I\u2019ll get you set up with a decent monitor and a tech.\u201d</p><p>Jessy was glad to answer her phone and hear Dillon\u2019s voice. When he suggested that they all have lunch together, she agreed, and he said he would be by shortly.</p><p>\u201cI think we ought to take Timothy with us, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be great,\u201d he told her.</p><p>When they got to the restaurant, she and Nikki wound up at one end of the table\u2014with Ringo\u2014while Brent, Timothy and Dillon confabbed at the other. Before long, she and Nikki\u2014and Ringo\u2014found themselves eavesdropping, and from there it was just a short step to joining the conversation.</p><p>\u201cTimothy, you say there\u2019s gold out there?\u201d Dillon asked. He was frowning, but he wasn\u2019t acting as if he thought Timothy was delusional in any way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cI saw what happened when I was there. Well, George Turner was there, and I saw it through his eyes. Wolf knew where the gold was, I\u2019m sure of it. And then Varny came in, and...well, you know what happened after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, and all these deaths really have something to do with Indigo,\u201d Jessy said, \u201cit means that someone out there believes in the gold, too. But he doesn\u2019t know how to find it. He thinks Dillon will figure it out for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s why he was looking for a paranormal investigator? Because he knows things are building toward a reenactment? You think it was all a scam, his life being in danger?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to look that way,\u201d Dillon admitted.</p><p>They had barely finished eating at that point, and already he was looking anxious.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go,\u201d he said, standing and reaching into his pocket for a piece of paper, which he handed to Brent. \u201cCheck out these names for me, will you? Start with the top name in the left-hand column. On the right I\u2019ve listed the names of everyone in the saloon the day of the gunfight. I want to see if they all connect somehow, if each name from the past lines up with a descendant in the present. I\u2019m going over to the police station. I want to see the security tapes again. I swear I\u2019m missing something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They left, and Dillon dropped them all at Jessy\u2019s house so they could pick up her car, since Adam had the rental. Dillon started to drive off, then stopped and called out to Jessy.</p><p>She walked over to the car and saw that he was smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...\u201d He reached out and pulled her close, then planted a gently passionate kiss on her lips. \u201cBe careful. Stay at the home until you hear from me. Stick with Timothy or Nikki once you\u2019re there. I\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t spend a moment alone. By the way, who\u2019s on the list?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cEveryone I\u2019ve come across in the course of this investigation,\u201d he told her. \u201cCops\u2014Jerry Cheever, Len Durso. Emil Landon and Hugo Blythe. Darrell Frye. I even threw in an M.E., my friend, Doc Tarleton, along with Sarah Clay, who works in forensics. And your stage manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRon?\u201d she said with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sandra,\u201d he admitted.</p> <p>\u201cSandra?\u201d She felt her temper rising.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, she\u2019s not a suspect,\u201d he assured her. \u201cHumor me, huh?\u201d Then he kissed her lips again and drove away.</p><p>\u201cJessy?\u201d Nikki called, and Jessy turned around to see that Brent was already settled behind the wheel, with Timothy next to him. It was her car, but she decided it wasn\u2019t really the time for a feminist statement.</p><p>Jessy got into the backseat with Nikki, and in a few minutes, they were back at the home. Brent walked them in, and Timothy greeted Jimmy and a nurse named Liz, who he really liked. He admitted he was ready for a nap, but first he took them to the TV room and introduced them to Mrs. Teasdale, who took one look at Nikki and Brent and informed Nikki that she was going to have beautiful children.</p><p>Timothy and Mrs. Teasdale agreed on a Scrabble date for later, and then Jessy, Nikki and Timothy retired to his room. Brent left them at last, heading for the library where Dillon had spent the morning. To be on the safe side, Brent ordered Ringo, who\u2019d tagged along, to stay with the women. \u201cAnd call if anything\u2014\u201d he began. He shook his head. \u201cHell, Ringo, you\u2019re such a damn good ghost, I forgot you can\u2019t use a cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows, maybe I can,\u201d Ringo said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a new challenge, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>They left Timothy to his nap and retired to a table in the empty breakfast room, where Jessy started doodling, and Ringo was standing off to the side, trying to dial Nikki\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jessy said to Nikki.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018They\u2019re all assembling,\u2019\u201d Jessy quoted. She looked over at Ringo, who had managed to flip open the phone. \u201cRingo, tell me about the shoot-out that day.\u201d</p><p>He set the phone down and walked over to her. \u201cThe circumstances of my own death are beginning to bore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ringo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. There was a bartender\u2014and some townsfolk, but they had cleared out. At the poker table, there were John Wolf, myself, Sheriff Percy and Mark Davison. When Varny came in, he had four men with him. Now this I\u2019ve only read, mind you, because I was dead at the time, but Varny had another of his goons, a particularly distasteful fellow named Tobias, with him, and he dragged in John Wolf\u2019s wife. They\u2019d been married in some kind of an Indian ceremony, and I guess the law recognized it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen people,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cFour poker players, Varny, five goons. Wait, and Mrs. Wolf. That makes eleven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, there were really thirteen,\u201d Ringo pointed out. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the piano player, and the singer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you\u2019re you,\u201d Jessy said to Ringo. \u201cDillon would be John.\u201d</p><p>Ringo laughed. \u201cOr Mariah. She was the one who carried on the line. She was pregnant at the shoot-out, or the Wolf line would have ended right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I play any part in this?\u201d Jessy murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe piano player,\u201d Timothy said from the doorway, surprising them all.</p><p>In fact, Jessy was so startled by the sound of his voice that she jumped. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe piano player. George Turner. He was a distant relative.\u201d</p><p>Adam Harrison spent his time at one table.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the craps table where Tanner Green had died, because that had been removed, but he played at the table that had taken its place.</p><p>The pit boss had a name tag that read Darrell Frye, and he kept looking at his watch as he walked around keeping his eye on the various tables. Interesting, Adam thought.</p><p>Adam waited until things were relatively quiet and then got Frye talking.</p><p>\u201cHear you had some excitement in here the other night,\u201d he said to the croupier closest to him. \u201cA man died or something?\u201d</p><p>The croupier looked around and saw that Darrell Frye was hanging around by another table, then grinned conspiratorially and said, \u201cYeah, a fellow bought it right here, right where we\u2019re standing. Hell of a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you working?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>The other man nodded gravely. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything till the guy collapsed on some poor woman, though. Too bad about the cameras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What happened to the cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal up in the executive offices, but they were glitching and not catching everything or something like that. It was supposed to be a big secret, but everyone working here knew it.\u201d</p><p>Adam filed that away to tell Dillon later and played for a few more minutes, then tipped the croupier and wandered away. He noted that Darrell Frye had finally gotten the break he\u2019d obviously been waiting for. Adam spotted him in the coffee shop and went in himself, ordered a cup of coffee and took a seat, and then he waited.</p><p>His vigilance was rewarded when a pretty brunette in a clingy knit dress came up to Darrell Frye. She had a nice figure, long red-tinted hair that was poufed up like something from the sixties and huge sunglasses. Adam found her more than a little suspicious and wondered if the hair was real, or if she was wearing a wig.</p><p>She sat down across from Darrell Frye, and at first they spoke too softly for him to overhear their conversation. But in a minute their voices grew heated and their words were clear. \u201cToday. Today, do you hear me?\u201d the woman said, and then she rose and stormed away, stiletto heels clicking sharply on the terrazzo floor.</p><p>Dillon was surprised to see Doug Tarleton when he arrived at the station. Doug was wearing civilian clothing and sipping coffee in a chair in the conference room where Jerry Cheever had set up the screen and player so they could study the tapes.</p><p>\u201cDoc, what are you doing here?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>Tarleton grinned. \u201cTaking a break. I\u2019ve been up to my arms in blood and guts for too many hours in a row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an M.E.,\u201d Dillon reminded him.</p><p>Tarleton laughed. \u201cYeah, I know. But Detective Cheever here decided to humor me, so here I am. Okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>The technician today was another rookie officer, this one named Drake Barton.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sarah Clay?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cOver at the morgue, working trace evidence,\u201d Tarleton said. \u201cThat girl has ambition, and she\u2019s one hard worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Dillon agreed. He studied the young tech, hoping that this guy was just as good. \u201cCan you show the craps area for the time before the murder took place?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Cheever asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that maybe Tanner had been playing at the Sun earlier,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll roll it back,\u201d the tech told him. \u201cHow far? There are hours and hours of footage here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back about three hours, but fast-forward until I tell you to slow down,\u201d Dillon told him.</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Barton said.</p><p>The tape began to roll. Dillon watched the croupiers and clientele running around like something out of a cartoon but saw no sign of Tanner Green.</p><p>Then, suddenly, there he was, playing at the same table where he had died.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Cheever said.</p><p>\u201cHey, they say the man is good for a reason,\u201d Tarleton commented.</p><p>Dillon shrugged. \u201cAll we\u2019ve done so far is see that Tanner Green was there before he was killed,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cBack it up, please,\u201d he asked the tech.</p><p>This time Dillon kept his eyes on Darrell Frye. He went through the motions of his job competently, but he seemed nervous. Hell, he looked like a ferret, Dillon thought.</p><p>And he was constantly watching the time.</p><p>But Dillon knew that he just didn\u2019t like the guy, and that could be behind his impression of what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said again. \u201cBack up again, then play it again, but slowly this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ordered a drink. Not exactly unusual at a casino,\u201d Cheever said.</p><p>\u201cPlay it again,\u201d Dillon insisted.</p><p>\u201cThere is something odd there. I see it, too,\u201d Tarleton said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cheever asked, apparently annoyed that he wasn\u2019t seeing what the other two did.</p><p>Barton, the tech, said slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s like one of those pictures where you see something different depending on how you look at it, or one of those \u2018what\u2019s different in picture B from picture A?\u2019 things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay it one more time, please,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>The tape began to roll.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Dillon said. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Even Tarleton looked confused this time.</p><p>\u201cThe cocktail waitress,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her? She\u2019s cute\u2014they try to hire cute girls,\u201d Cheever said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. There\u2019s another woman in the background. They\u2019re both wearing little sarong things, but look at the difference.\u201d</p><p>The two outfits looked the same at first. On second glance, though, the waitress serving Tanner Green was wearing a slightly different version. On one, the parrots in the pattern were dark green and in perfect alignment with one another. On the other, they were more of a lime color and arranged at odd angles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPicture A and picture B,\u201d the tech murmured.</p><p>\u201cDoes it mean anything?\u201d Tarleton asked.</p><p>Dillon looked at Jerry Cheever. \u201cCan you get someone in personnel to let us know if there are any variations in the uniforms for the waitstaff?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d Cheever said, reaching for the phone.</p><p>Tarleton had risen and was standing right next to the screen, staring at it pointedly and blocking Dillon\u2019s view.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dillon asked him.</p><p>Tarleton stared a while longer. \u201cHell if I know. But there\u2019s something else. It\u2019s right on the edge of my mind. Maybe....\u201d He sat down but kept staring. \u201cAh, hell. I can\u2019t figure it out, and I\u2019ve got to get back. Thanks for letting me play cop for the hour, guys. And I know I saw something. I\u2019ll call if I ever figure it out.\u201d</p><p>16</p> <p>Jessy didn\u2019t remember crawling up on the bed with her grandfather, but she felt as if she were lying with him the way she had as a kid when they went to the lake. They would lie on the ground on big beach towels, looking up at the clouds and turning the rare wisps of white magic in the Nevada sky into fairy-tale creatures.</p><p>Today, the clouds were strange. They seemed to fill the sky. Timothy pointed up and told her, \u201cThere. Do you see him? That\u2019s Billie Tiger. Don\u2019t be afraid of him. He\u2019s a Seminole, but he was captured and forced West, where he escaped and joined up with Sitting Bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, Mr. Tiger,\u201d she asked politely, because, now that Timothy had pointed him out, she could see him, of course.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend,\u201d Timothy told her.</p><p>Something in her felt sad that he found his friends in the clouds and on the walls, but she wouldn\u2019t say so; she loved him too much to hurt his feelings.</p><p>\u201cBillie Tiger shows me what happened,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cHe\u2019ll show you, too.\u201d</p> <p>The clouds shifted as Timothy described a town with one long street that was all rutted sand. A breeze blew, but it had only hot air and desert sand to toss around. A tumbleweed danced across the road now and then. She saw a big sign on one building identifying it as the Crystal Canary. Another building was a bank. There were horses and a livery stable. People wore old-fashioned clothes, the women in long dresses, often in pastel flower patterns, and bonnets to protect their complexions against the sun.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the newspaper office,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cAnd there...\u201d He pointed up to the sky. \u201cThere\u2019s the saloon.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if she walked with him through the swinging doors into the saloon, where she saw a piano player. He was a handsome man, more brown than copper, with beautiful green eyes, and might have been a deeply tanned white man, an Indian or even a black man.</p><p>She was suddenly sitting on his lap, but it was all right, because somehow the man had become Timothy. A young woman was standing next to them, singing.</p><p>There were four men at the poker table. She recognized two of them: Ringo\u2014and Dillon. Except that it wasn\u2019t Dillon, only someone who looked a lot like him. The other two men weren\u2019t familiar to her. One had a goofy smile, and the other one looked mean, the sour and gaunt kind of mean. She didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>Then the doors burst open, and tall and dark and looming, and seeming to cover the sun, he was just there. The clouds turned dark when he arrived and seemed to roil with anger.</p><p>She was afraid.</p><p>\u201cHide,\u201d Timothy said. Except that he wasn\u2019t Timothy anymore, he was the piano player again. \u201cI have to rouse the townfolk.\u201d</p> <p>She crawled under the piano.</p><p>The man in the doorway entered and walked to the poker table, followed by four of the biggest men Jessy had ever seen. Then, suddenly, everyone was standing and guns were blazing. She wanted to scream, but she was hiding and was afraid to give away her presence...</p><p>Only two men were still standing at that point.</p><p>And then...</p><p>The swinging doors opened again. A huge man came in, dragging a beautiful woman in deerskin. But she wasn\u2019t an Indian, she was a blond-haired white woman.</p><p>Jessy looked at the man who was so like Dillon. His mouth was moving as he looked at the beautiful woman, and Jessy strained to hear what he was saying. She could see that the blonde didn\u2019t understand him, unable to hear his words over the bullets.</p><p>But Jessy could hear him.</p><p>And the word he said was here.</p><p>The guns stopped firing, and she looked around to see that both the men were dead, and the beautiful blond woman was standing alone, weeping.</p><p>Jessy woke abruptly. She wasn\u2019t lying on the bed next to Timothy but was sitting in a chair in the breakfast room. She must have fallen asleep with her head on the table, just as Nikki\u2019s was.</p><p>Jessy closed her eyes and groaned. Timothy wasn\u2019t crazy at all.</p><p>Billie Tiger had just shown her Indigo.</p><p>Had she really heard John Wolf speak? Great. Another cryptic one-word message that might mean nothing at all. Here.</p><p>Brent Blackhawk was coming up with some interesting connections. One of the most surprising was that Jessy\u2019s friend Sandra was a descendant of Milly Taylor, the singer in the saloon at the time of the shoot-out. He wondered if Sandra was aware of her heritage.</p><p>He kept searching, and another correlation fell into place. Tanner Green.</p><p>His father\u2019s side of the family might have come from Philadelphia, but his mother\u2019s family had been from the West, and their surname had been Hornsby. There were a number of Riley Hornsbys listed in the Nevada census, surely one of them could have been the goon who had accompanied Frank Varny and an ancestor of Green\u2019s.</p><p>Brent was growing more and more amazed. The hapless parking attendant, Rudy Yorba, could be traced, through the maternal line once again, to the gambler Mark Davison. Odd, though, that a bad guy in the past was connected to a good guy in the present.</p><p>An hour later he sat back and considered the amazing web of names and connections he\u2019d discovered. Virtually all the names Dillon had given him had ancestors who\u2019d been in the area at the time, including Darrell Frye, Hugo Blythe and Detective Jerry Cheever, whose genealogy could be traced back to the ineffectual sheriff of Indigo, Grant Percy.</p><p>The real jackpot was Emil Landon, though. He could claim a direct line right back to Frank Varny.</p><p>Brent kept searching and found something odd, so odd that he wasn\u2019t even be sure it was relevant. It looked as if Emil Landon had more than the one child he acknowledged, who lived with an ex-wife back East. He\u2019d accompanied a pregnant hooker to the hospital in Reno twenty-some years ago, when he had been just a kid of twenty himself.</p><p>Brent peered at the computer screen, reread the article he\u2019d found and cursed. There was no mention as to whether Landon had been in the delivery room with the prostitute or had only been playing Good Samaritan, but he jotted down the hooker\u2019s name and quickly turned back to his search.</p><p>The hooker was named Celia Smithfield, and her maternal great-grandmother had been named Varny. Brent pulled out his cell phone and put a call through to Dillon.</p><p>Jessy left Nikki sleeping and went out into the hall to stretch her legs. She was startled to run into Sandra there, and stunned to see that her friend\u2019s eyes were red, as if she had been crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jessy asked, worried.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to see this! Come on, hurry. It\u2019s just outside,\u201d Sandra said, tugging on Jessy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, calm down, Sandra.\u201d</p><p>Since she was just going down to the parking lot\u2014and with Sandra, not some stranger\u2014Jessy decided against waking Nikki. She put a comforting arm around Sandra\u2019s shoulders and was shocked to realize that Sandra was trembling.</p><p>\u201cSandra, please, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014come,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Jessy followed Sandra downstairs and waved cheerfully to Jimmy. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cMy car is right there,\u201d Sandra said when they reached the lot, and she threw open the door to the backseat.</p><p>Jessy leaned forward to see what Sandra wanted to show her and was stunned when Sandra suddenly shoved her forward, into the car. Her head struck the handle of the far door, and she felt a searing pain. She heard Sandra gasp and say, \u201cOh, shit!\u201d</p><p>And then the pain in her head exploded and the world went black.</p><p>Dillon was still thinking about the cocktail waitress uniform that wasn\u2019t quite right. In fact, there was something not quite right about the cocktail waitress herself. Her hair was strange, for one thing. Too big and tilting oddly to one side. It had to be a wig.</p><p>And, according to Jerry Cheever, who\u2019d talked to the personnel manager, all the waitstaff uniforms were made from identical fabric.</p><p>As he drove away from the station, Dillon realized that the woman was familiar. It was something about the way she stood, the way she moved.</p><p>His phone rang.</p><p>It was Adam. \u201cI think your man Darrell Frye is in on it. I heard him in the coffee shop, talking to a strange-looking woman in a bouffant wig. She was angry, told him that \u2018it\u2019 had to be this afternoon. If you can get hold of your buddy Cheever, tell him he needs to find some excuse to pick up Darrell Frye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. And I think I saw the same woman on the security tape from the night Green was killed. She was the one who slipped the LSD to him,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cI\u2019ll call Cheever right now.\u201d</p><p>He had to leave a message, because apparently Cheever was in the men\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cTell him he needs to find an excuse to pick up Darrell Frye\u2014pronto. And he has to get back to me right away,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>His phone rang the moment he hung up with the cops. Brent was on the line. \u201cGet this. Just about all of your guys collide, just like you thought, even that Darrell Frye you weren\u2019t sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left a message for Cheever to trump up some excuse to pick him up right away,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cAnyway, sorry for interrupting. What else have you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the wildest. I think Emil Landon had a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he has a kid back East.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, in Nevada. Illegitimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA son?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, the kid just disappears. But guess who the mother\u2019s family line goes back to?\u201d Brent asked him.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank Varny. Bizarre, huh? Landon goes back to Varny himself. So he had an affair with a woman to whom he was distantly related.\u201d</p><p>Dillon finally remembered where he had seen the woman in the tapes before, and why she had looked familiar.</p><p>\u201cIt was a girl,\u201d Dillon said, cursing his own stupidity. He\u2019d been led around by the nose like an idiot. \u201cGet back over to the home and get Jessy and Nikki. And Timothy, too. I\u2019m afraid something is going down right now. I\u2019m going to call Cheever back and get out to the morgue. Brent, I\u2019m scared as hell. Get over there quickly. Please.\u201d</p><p>When Jessy came to, her head was killing her. It took her a moment to realize that she hadn\u2019t been dreaming, that Sandra really had shoved her into the car and abducted her.</p> <p>\u201cSandra, what the hell is wrong with you?\u201d she demanded, trying to sit up, then failing in the face of the pain.</p><p>\u201cReggie!\u201d Sandra cried.</p><p>\u201cReggie?\u201d Jessy said, baffled.</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t get to you because you were with Dillon, so they kidnapped Reggie and told me to get you. They\u2019re waiting in Indigo, and if I don\u2019t hand you over to them in half an hour, they\u2019re going to kill Reggie.\u201d</p><p>Jessy swallowed hard. She understood, but she had to find a way to talk Sandra into doing the smart thing. The right thing.</p><p>\u201cDid you call the cops?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t call the cops!\u201d Sandra cried hysterically. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill her, don\u2019t you understand? She\u2019s nothing to them. Once they have you, they\u2019ll let Reggie go. And they swore they wouldn\u2019t hurt you, either. They just want you as leverage so they can get Dillon to tell them where the gold is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane. Dillon doesn\u2019t know where the gold is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think he does.\u201d</p><p>Jessy\u2019s head was spinning. Why would anyone think Dillon knew where the gold was? She thought back to Dillon\u2019s theory about the connection between past and present, and then she remembered Timothy\u2019s words. They are assembling. Did someone believe that by putting together the descendants of those who had died and recreating the bloodbath, that would somehow reveal the location of the gold? That Dillon would somehow channel his ancestor\u2019s memory of the past and lead them straight to the treasure?</p><p>Jessy blinked, trying hard to clear her head and make sense of what was going on. \u201cHave you got any aspirin or anything up there? You really hurt me\u2014you bitch.\u201d</p><p>She was almost sorry for the last when she saw the tears streaming down Sandra\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I had to,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cSandra, we have to tell the police what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust the police!\u201d Sandra insisted vehemently.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheever took me home last night. He knows where I live,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cHow can I be sure he didn\u2019t tell them where to find Reggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...Sandra, you\u2019re listed in the phone book, anyone could have found you,\u201d Jessy protested.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because they said that if they saw the police, they\u2019d kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down and tell me about the whole thing,\u201d Jessy said, knowing even as she spoke that she was asking the impossible. Calm down? These people had already killed three times. What would Reggie\u2019s life matter to them?</p><p>Sandra drew a long shaky breath. \u201cI went to the grocery store. When I came back, I could tell Reggie had come from school because\u2014I found her knapsack. Then I got the phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it from a man or a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! They used one of those things that disguise your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure they really have Reggie? That they\u2019re not bluffing?\u201d</p><p>Sandra started sobbing even harder. \u201cThey put her on the phone. She was crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so they have Reggie,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut, Sandra, we have to call the police. Don\u2019t you see? Even once they have me, they won\u2019t let Reggie go. They can\u2019t. She knows too much. They\u2019ll kill all of us. Indigo\u2019s a ghost town in the middle of nowhere. If you don\u2019t trust Cheever, we can call the state police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t call the police,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot my cell phone again.\u201d</p><p>Dillon put through a call to Tarleton\u2019s cell, but the M.E. didn\u2019t pick up. He called the main number at the morgue, figuring Doug might be wrist deep in a corpse and unable to pick up his phone. Instead, he discovered that Tarleton was out but due back shortly, and Sarah Clay had taken the afternoon off.</p><p>The minute he hung up, his phone rang.</p><p>\u201cDillon, it\u2019s Brent. Jessy is gone, and so are Timothy and Ringo. Nikki\u2019s frantic. That orderly, Jimmy, said Jessy left with her friend Sandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra?\u201d Dillon said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the man said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the cops\u2014I\u2019m on my way out there,\u201d Dillon said, pulling a U-turn and ignoring the horns blaring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s \u2018there\u2019?\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cIndigo.\u201d</p><p>It had been a hell of a long time since Timothy had driven, but it really was like riding a bike. He was sorry that he\u2019d sneaked out and left without them, but his time was coming to a close. He\u2019d had a long full life, and he was comfortable with whatever came his way.</p><p>Billie Tiger had warned him that it was happening, that Jessy was in danger, and Timothy had known then that he had to get to Indigo. If it was going to play out again, it was going to do so with him, not with Jessy.</p><p>Driving was fun. He would never have predicted that an ambulance could be so much fun to drive\u2014or that it could go so fast. It was good to be on the road. They would come after him soon enough, the minute they realized they had a vehicle missing.</p><p>Before long he could make out the town of Indigo just ahead, though it was so weatherworn it blended right into the desert, like a mirage.</p><p>He heard a voice in his mind and recognized it as Billie Tiger\u2019s. Billie warned him not to take the main road all the way into town and not to leave the ambulance where it would be seen\u2014although if anyone was looking, they would have to see him. You couldn\u2019t hide something as big as an ambulance in the vast flat expanse of the Nevada desert.</p><p>He heard an annoying clinking sound. It had been plaguing him for the entire trip, and sounded like the constant jingle of a pair of old spurs.</p><p>It was time to slow down if he was going to make a quiet entry this way.</p><p>He veered off the road, and the ambulance shuddered across the uneven ground.</p><p>If they were looking, they would definitely see him.</p><p>But they probably weren\u2019t looking, he thought as he pulled up to the rear of the buildings on Main Street and was surprised to see that their vehicles were all parked back here, too. Three of them, so far.</p><p>They were assembling.</p><p>Sandra finally slowed the car as they neared the town; if she hadn\u2019t, Jessy thought dryly, they would have shot right through it.</p><p>Sandra brought the car to a halt in the middle of Main Street and leaped out, screaming her daughter\u2019s name.</p><p>Jessy was stunned when a woman came out of the building whose peeling sign identified it as a bank.</p><p>\u201cYou made it!\u201d she cried cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter?\u201d Sandra demanded. \u201cJessy is here. Now where\u2019s my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Sandra started to rush the woman in a frenzy, but Jessy dragged her back when she saw that the woman was holding a small gun. Despite everything, she wasn\u2019t going to let Sandra get herself killed.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d the woman said to Sandra, all the while looking Jessy up and down. \u201cSo you\u2019re Jessy Sparhawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014who are you?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>\u201cSarah Clay,\u201d the woman told her.</p><p>The name meant nothing to her.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is behind this?\u201d Jessy demanded. \u201cEmil Landon?\u201d</p><p>Sarah started to laugh. \u201cEmil Landon? The son of a bitch who won\u2019t accept me as his child? Who claims my mother fooled around with so many people that half of Las Vegas could be my father? The guy who won\u2019t take a paternity test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmil Landon is your father?\u201d Jessy said in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter?\u201d Sandra demanded.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d The cry came from the bank. Reggie came out then. She would have run, except that she was being held.</p><p>By Hugo Blythe.</p><p>He was followed out of the bank by Darrell Frye.</p><p>\u201cHiya, Jessy,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was too dumbfounded to say anything, and she felt like throwing up.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you let my daughter go now\u2014please?\u201d Sandra begged.</p><p>\u201cGo to Mommy, kid,\u201d Blythe said, letting go of Reggie.</p><p>Reggie seemed to fly off the raised sidewalk and down to her mother. Sobbing, Sandra wrapped her into her arms.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you will kindly move this way...\u201d Sarah Clay said to Jessy.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Jessy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m Sarah Clay,\u201d the woman said, frowning. \u201cHasn\u2019t Dillon ever mentioned me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d Jessy said, surprised that the fact seemed to upset the other woman.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, he\u2019s just being a man,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI mean, if he\u2019s got a thing going with you, he wouldn\u2019t mention the fact that he\u2019s got a thing for me, too.\u201d</p><p>It had to be a lie, Jessy thought, but she felt her temper soaring nonetheless. She forced herself to rein it in and looked at the woman with as much contempt as she could summon. \u201cFrankly, I just think he\u2019s never thought of you as anyone important\u2014or sexy, for that matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She might have pushed it too far, she thought. It was one thing to aggravate the woman, another entirely to rile her to violence.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Sarah Clay strode over to Jessy and slapped her so hard that her vision blurred, on top of the splitting headache she already had from being shoved into the car.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jessy said. \u201cYou have me, so now let her go. Let Reggie and Sandra get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to give Dillon a ring first. And tell him to lose that old man and his friends before he comes. I want to know where the gold is,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. There isn\u2019t any gold,\u201d Jessy told her.</p><p>\u201cThere is. And it\u2019s here somewhere,\u201d Sarah insisted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Darrell said. \u201cShe found a letter that John Wolf wrote to some woman named Mariah saying he\u2019d found it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up, Frye. Get the phone down here so she can call Dillon, and tell him to get out here or I\u2019ll shoot her,\u201d Sarah ordered.</p><p>Darrell handed her a cell phone, and Jessy found herself wondering what service even worked out here.</p><p>Sarah punched in a number, then swore, and Jessy tried not to smile. Apparently the call had gone straight to voice mail.</p><p>Where was Dillon? Jessy wondered. Nikki would have awakened by now and raised the alarm. Jimmy knew she had left with Sandra. That wouldn\u2019t normally raise anyone\u2019s suspicions, but these hadn\u2019t been normal days.</p><p>Suddenly the sound of an old piano playing an even older tune came from the saloon, and they all jumped.</p><p>\u201cBring them and follow me,\u201d Sarah commanded, already hurrying toward the saloon. Blythe took charge of Sandra and Reggie, while Darrell grabbed Jessy by the arm and started dragging her with him. She bit down hard on her lower lip, forcing herself not to show any emotion.</p> <p>So Emil Landon wasn\u2019t involved after all. Had his own daughter been trying to kill him?</p><p>They entered the saloon via swinging doors that didn\u2019t actually swing anymore. In fact, they seemed in danger of falling completely off their hinges at any second.</p><p>It took Jessy a minute to adjust to the dim light, and then she gasped aloud, unable to help herself.</p><p>Timothy was sitting at the old piano, his fingers resting on the keys.</p><p>\u201cMilly, you made it,\u201d he said to Sandra. \u201cCome on over here and sing us a tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is the old bastard and how did he get here?\u201d Sarah demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy, ma\u2019am, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Timothy asked, stroking the keys again. \u201cI\u2019m Turner. George Turner. That there is Milly and her young\u2019un. Some folks won\u2019t be joining us, on account of they\u2019re dead, like that fellow you\u2019ve got stashed over in the bank. But they\u2019re here, the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>Even in the dim light, Jessy could see Sarah\u2019s face darken in anger. So there was a dead man over in the bank.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the second thug who attacked me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jessy asked.</p><p>Darrell gave her arm a painful twist.</p><p>\u201cLook, if you\u2019re planning on me talking to Dillon for you, you\u2019d better let me go. Now. You\u2019ve all got the guns, and as I\u2019m sure you can see, I haven\u2019t got a gun or any other weapon.\u201d</p><p>To her amazement, Darrell, uncertain, let her go, and apparently Sarah wasn\u2019t in the mood to fight him over it.</p><p>\u201cAll right, get them to the bank, all of them, for now,\u201d she said. \u201cGeezer, get up!\u201d she commanded Timothy.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, that\u2019s just foolish,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cIf you\u2019d let Milly come on over here, we could regale you with some old tunes.\u201d</p><p>Sandra stood there shaking, with Reggie in her arms, Timothy wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>\u201cGet that old bastard out of here,\u201d Sarah snapped at Hugo Blythe.</p><p>They would hurt Timothy, Jessy knew, and she had to stop them somehow. \u201cWait. I\u2019ll get him,\u201d she said, and walked over to the piano. Timothy looked up at her as she reached out a hand to him. \u201cGrandpa, we have to go join the townspeople in the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, child, all right,\u201d Timothy said, and stood.</p><p>Sarah pointed toward the street, and they preceded her out the door and over to the bank.</p><p>They crossed the dusty road and stepped up onto the wooden sidewalk level again and stopped in front of the bank. \u201cTold you that you should have come to work for me, Jessy.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t get is why you threw Tanner out of a limo\u2014with a knife in his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat touch, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Sarah said. \u201cMy father has a limo identical to the one the Sun owns.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re all so stupid. Darrell got hold of the Sun\u2019s limo, and then I got the button off Green\u2019s shirt and flirted with a guy at the Big Easy so I could get into their limo and plant the evidence, in case someone figured out to check the limos. And someone did\u2014Dillon, to be precise. We timed things so Darrell would be in plain view on the casino floor, and who in hell would suspect me or know I have any connection to this town or the gold or anything else? I drugged him, and then I killed him. He never knew what hit him. Darrell was great\u2014he ran out and met us on his break, and he knew right where we needed to stop so we could push Green out into the crowd and not be caught on camera.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHugo was driving, but Landon would have sworn he was with him the whole time, because Hugo slipped a nice roofie into my dear old dad\u2019s drink, so he slept like a babe in arms and never knew that his loyal Hugo had ever left his side. It was brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jessy asked. \u201cWhy kill Tanner Green if all you wanted was the gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand anything? I shot at that lame bastard who refuses to admit he\u2019s my father. Tanner had to die so my father would keep on thinking he was in danger. I even got Dillon this job because I saw the message that Daddy Dearest had called my boss, Lieutenant Brown, looking for a recommendation, so I pretended Brown had asked me to call him back and convinced him that he\u2019d only be safe if he hired Dillon Wolf. Because I need Dillon so I can find the gold, but I also had this wonderful opportunity to make life miserable for my father. It was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you find it\u2014what good will it do you? It\u2019s on Paiute land,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>Sarah started to laugh. \u201cExactly, it\u2019s Paiute land, and my father is trying to use his Indian heritage to get the rights to build a casino here. And if they come in to bulldoze and dig, they\u2019ll find the gold, so he has to die before he gets that far. That gold is mine, and I intend to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so certain that Dillon can find it?\u201d Jessy demanded. The other woman was clearly insane and this whole elaborate scheme based on a crazy dream, but even so, she could leave them all dead. \u201cI\u2019m in forensics, in research,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Jessy told her. \u201cWhy would you believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Wolf died here, and he was Dillon\u2019s ancestor. And I clawed my way through every word ever written about Adam Harrison, Harrison Investigations and Dillon Wolf. He has a power that science hasn\u2019t explained yet. He knows where the gold is, or if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll find it,\u201d she finished stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Jessy began.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d Sarah said, and shoved her into the bank. As the door started to close behind her, cutting off the light, she realized that the others were all still outside.</p><p>Furious, Jessy screamed, \u201cI want my grandfather and my friends\u2014now! Dillon won\u2019t do anything for you unless I ask him to\u2014nothing. And I won\u2019t ask him a thing unless I know my friends are safe.\u201d</p><p>As she waited for an answer, she stumbled over something and leaned down to see what it was. It was stiff and sticky...yet it gave. It felt as if it was growing cold....</p><p>It was a body</p><p>She jerked her hand away, remembering that they had killed someone else\u2014probably the hired thug who had been working for them. Apparently this was supposed to be a three-way split.</p><p>She gathered all her resources, swallowing a scream, and was ready to repeat her demand when the door opened and Sandra stumbled in, followed by Reggie and then Timothy.</p><p>\u201cJessy?\u201d Sandra said. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. We\u2019ll think of something. And Dillon will come,\u201d Jessy said, fervently hoping she was right.</p><p>His caller ID recognized the number as Sarah\u2019s, and Dillon knew without answering that she was calling to use Jessy\u2019s life as a bargaining chip. It took every ounce of willpower he had, but he didn\u2019t answer, because so long as they still needed her, Jessy\u2019s life was safe. She had to be terrified, but he couldn\u2019t answer. He\u2019d been so blind. He\u2019d suspected some of the right people, but not Sarah. Not until now, when he prayed that knowledge hadn\u2019t come too late.</p><p>How much longer until he reached Indigo? And then, how much longer than that before help came?</p><p>And even if help came, was there going to be another bloodbath?</p><p>Sarah was insane. A brilliant woman, but scorned by her father and driven mad by her demons. She had manipulated the action and the players\u2014himself included\u2014every step of the way. The limo-slash-murder scene had been the Sun\u2019s, and to his great humiliation, he had fallen for her planted evidence. Darrell Frye had to be part of it. And since Emil Landon wasn\u2019t involved, that meant that Hugo Blythe was. Anyone else in their conspiracy? Probably not. Sarah would know that the more people you involved, the more chance there was of someone slipping. The men who attacked Jessy had just been hired goons. They would never even have seen Sarah\u2019s face, and one of them was definitely dead, and if the second was still alive, it wouldn\u2019t be for long.</p><p>His cell rang again where it sat on the passenger seat. He debated whether he should answer or not just as he saw the first faint signs of Indigo rising from the sand.</p><p>Sarah was calling again. He hit the button, but he didn\u2019t speak. Maybe Sarah thought she\u2019d gotten dead air, because she didn\u2019t hang up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He heard voices, but not directed to him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to kill the other three now,\u201d Sarah was saying.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know Jessy. I do.\u201d That was Darrell Frye. \u201cIf you kill them, she won\u2019t help us. She\u2019s stubborn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow the hell did the old bugger get out here?\u201d That was Hugo Blythe.</p><p>\u201cHe stole a car, how the hell else?\u201d Sarah demanded. \u201cYou assholes are going to fuck this up, just like you\u2019ve fucked up everything else. At least the idiots you hired to kidnap the girl are dead now. And you, you fool,\u201d she said to Darrell. \u201cMaybe we were out of camera range, but couldn\u2019t you see that Rudy Yorba character staring right at the limo and Tanner Green? I studied the damn tapes, and I could tell what they\u2019d see eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re fuck-ups, are we?\u201d Darrell challenged her. \u201cOnce you get Dillon out here, he\u2019d damn well better know where the gold is so we\u2019ve got the money to get out of here. Because someone will put the pieces together sooner or later and figure out that we were working as a team. Your stupid father is going to miss Hugo, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. We have dead men who can take the blame,\u201d Sarah reminded him.</p><p>The line went dead then, so Dillon hit his own end call button. He was close enough to the town now that if the phone rang again, he would answer it. Because he knew how he wanted to play out the scene when he arrived.</p> <p>With a little help from the dead.</p><p>17</p><p>The door opened, and a flashlight blazed into the bank. Beyond the blinding light, Jessy could see that the sky was turning bloodred as the sun began to set.</p><p>\u201cJessy, get out here,\u201d Darrell ordered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cJessy Sparhawk, get your ass out here or we\u2019ll start shooting,\u201d Sarah warned.</p> <p>\u201cJessy,\u201d Sandra said, touching her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sandra. You just have to stay calm.\u201d</p><p>Jessy turned, trying to see Timothy in the darkness that shadowed the bank.</p><p>He must have sensed her movement, because he said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, granddaughter. We are assembled.\u201d</p><p>Timothy\u2019s words and his preternatural calm were almost more unnerving than trying to figure out how to deal with Sarah so she didn\u2019t risk all their lives. Because she knew that Sarah really would start shooting, she walked to the door of the bank and stepped outside.</p><p>Sarah thrust a cell phone into her hand. \u201cCall Dillon and pray he answers this time. Make sure he knows that if he doesn\u2019t show up alone, I\u2019ll put a bullet through your head myself. I may go down, but I\u2019ll take you with me.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Jessy took the phone from her and keyed in Dillon\u2019s number.</p><p>She half hoped to get his answering machine because that might buy them more time. But Dillon answered. \u201cDillon,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cJessy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at Indigo with a woman named Sarah Clay who says you know her. And Darrell Frye and Hugo Blythe,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he told her quietly.</p><p>\u201cShe says that if you don\u2019t come alone and tell her where the gold is, she\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cTell him again\u2014he comes alone. And he gives me the location of the gold,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I heard her. Listen to me, Jessy. Tell her that I\u2019ll be happy to let her have the gold. But I know that she also has Timothy, Sandra and Reggie, and they had better be all safe and in one piece when I get there. Tell her that she has to bring all of you into the saloon. Tell her that I can only figure out exactly where the gold is if we reenact the shoot-out. Tell her that I need all of you in the saloon.\u201d</p><p>Sarah ripped the phone from Jessy\u2019s hands. \u201cHello, Dillon,\u201d she said pleasantly.</p><p>Jessy couldn\u2019t hear his reply, but she saw Sarah frown.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do. I have the guns\u2014and your friends\u2014and this redheaded slut you apparently find so attractive,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dillon answered with something that brought a furious \u201cWhat?\u201d from Sarah, whose eyes shot to Darrell Frye. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to talk to Darrell. I\u2019m the one in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Darrell said, his own eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cWho was the brain to put this all together?\u201d Sarah responded furiously.</p><p>Then she stared at the phone incredulously. Dillon had hung up on her.</p><p>Sarah spun around. \u201cGet the rest of them. He wants them all in the saloon. Move it!\u201d</p><p>She shoved Jessy in front of her, pushing so hard that Jessy almost fell, but an unseen hand seemed to help her find her balance.</p><p>She heard the jingle of a spur, and she lowered her head and allowed herself a little smile. Ringo must have come with Timothy. He was here, and there was something oddly comforting in that fact.</p><p>She walked toward the saloon, aware that Darrell and Hugo had gone to get Sandra, Reggie and Timothy.</p><p>Sarah shoved her inside first, and to Jessy\u2019s amazement, Dillon was already there. He was seated at the poker table, one foot resting on it, as if he had grown weary waiting for them to arrive.</p><p>Sarah, coming in behind Jessy, gasped with surprise, but she collected herself quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re here. And you\u2019re an idiot. You might have taken one of us by surprise and improved your odds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re going to give me my friends back, and I\u2019m going to give you the gold,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do this right, though. You\u2019ve obviously researched your past, you know you\u2019re Varny\u2019s descendant\u2014sorry, double descendant. What kills me is, you could have made it to the top. You aced the academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no money!\u201d she lashed out. \u201cOh, yeah. I researched my past. My idiot mother was in love with my father. She let him pay her off, then absolved him of any financial responsibility for my welfare. He refuses to recognize me. But he\u2019s a fool\u2014he\u2019s going to lose every asset he has. I\u2019ll see to that. He\u2019s in debt, deeply in debt, and once I get the gold and set myself up, I can actually call in his banknotes. Then I can throw him out to the wolves\u2014before I kill him. I\u2019ve played this very carefully. My father is a jerk. He believed in Hugo, and Hugo has been with me for years. Hugo doesn\u2019t want to kiss my father\u2019s ass, he wants his share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Darrell?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cShe...she knew about\u2014\u201d Darrell began.</p><p>\u201cShut your idiot mouth!\u201d Sarah warned him, then sighed. \u201cWhat the hell. He was skimming casino profits, and I had him dead to rights. But he had the knowledge we needed to effectively stage Green\u2019s death. He knows the Sun inside out\u2014including where all the cameras are. And I knew that once Green was killed, you\u2019d stick with the case no matter what. I was brilliant, I really was. I convinced my father to hire you, then killed Tanner. And I could feed you information, and you believed in me, too. Now, if you want anyone to live, you\u2019d better find my gold for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cWe need to reenact that night so I can get into John Wolf\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>Sarah looked at him skeptically, then nodded just as the others entered.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cLet\u2019s see, Timothy\u2014sorry, George\u2014you go over by the piano. And you, too, Milly.\u201d He cleared his throat when no one moved. \u201cThat\u2019s you, Sandra. Reggie, you stay with your mom, and I need Jessy with Timothy. I can\u2019t be two people at once, so when we get to that point, we\u2019ll have to imagine Mariah standing at the door. Ringo, take your place at the table. Tanner, you were with Varny\u2019s men, I\u2019m afraid. Rudy, you were at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you talking to?\u201d Darrell demanded irritably, looking around nervously.</p><p>\u201cHumor me. I\u2019m talking to dead men,\u201d Dillon said cheerfully.</p><p>Ringo let Jessy see him then. He shrugged to show her that he didn\u2019t know what Dillon intended, either. But he took a chair, scraping it against the wooden floor and making the others jump.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you pulling, Wolf?\u201d Hugo demanded, an edge of fear in his voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you want the gold?\u201d Dillon demanded. \u201cThen let me work through this. All right, we\u2019ll pretend that Cheever is here at the table\u2014he\u2019d be the sheriff. And you, Sarah, you\u2019d be Varny, of course. Then there were the four thugs who died right away. I\u2019m sorry, Tanner, that would be you, along with the two men you killed, the ones who tried to kidnap Jessy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only saw one body,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were just so helpful, calling me about that so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess they haven\u2019t found the other body yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d Jessy told him.</p><p>\u201cI should have figured as much,\u201d Dillon said thoughtfully. \u201cWe really should get Cheever out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, no cops, or she dies,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cAll of you die, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>She was going to kill them all anyway, Jessy thought, and Dillon had to know that.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call Cheever, so you can cut out the threats,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cOkay, one of you is Tobias, and one of you is just another henchman.\u201d He studied Darrell and Hugo. \u201cWhich is which? I didn\u2019t get to talk to Brent long enough earlier, and I\u2019m not even sure he figured it all out, anyway. But no matter, we\u2019re all here except for the sheriff. Maybe Billie Tiger can take his place for now,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>Jessy barely contained a gasp when someone walked by her. It was the tall Seminole she had seen in her dream, the man Timothy talked to. And there they were, four men\u2014well, three ghosts and one man\u2014sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cEnough already,\u201d Sarah snapped. \u201cGet on with it, Dillon. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>Jessy stared at Dillon, who was looking at her with an expression that offered strength...and something more. She remembered the word John Wolf had whispered in her dream, and suddenly, she understood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Here, she mouthed silently to Dillon.</p><p>He nodded to show he understood.</p><p>Here. The gold was right here.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a tune, George,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cAnd a song, Milly.\u201d</p><p>Timothy began to play \u201cA Bird in a Gilded Cage,\u201d and Sandra choked out the words.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dillon said approvingly. \u201cJohn Wolf had the winning hand. He and Mark Davison\u2014that\u2019s you, Rudy\u2014were the only ones still in the game. Ringo was bored, and Percy...he knew you were coming, Varny. He knew because he had warned you that I was heading back to town. He suspected that I knew where the gold was, and that you had to get to it fast, before I could. You terrorized him into doing your bidding. Sad, because deep down, I think he wanted to be a good guy. He just wasn\u2019t quite there yet. You know, a lot of religions believe that we\u2019re reincarnated, and that we grow with each life. I think Percy\u2019s finally found his courage, and that in this life, he\u2019s going to be a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is all this?\u201d Darrell Frye demanded. \u201cShut up already and get to the gold!\u201d</p><p>Timothy suddenly pulled Jessy down to the piano. He smiled at her and put her fingers on the keys. She kept playing, kept singing in a low soft voice. She turned and her heart froze; Timothy was gone.</p> <p>\u201cNow you arrive, Varny,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cYou come up to me and get in my face about the gold. Come on, Sarah. If you want it, play it out.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Jessy found herself holding back a gasp. Sandra let out a low moan and stopped singing, and Reggie clutched her mother tightly.</p><p>Suddenly, everything seemed real. There were four men at the poker table. There was cigar smoke in the air. Beyond the swinging doors, the sun was falling lower, a bloodred blossom in the sky.</p><p>The men around the table suddenly rose. Hugo screamed, and Jessy knew that he could see them, too: Ringo, Tanner and Rudy, all in period attire and armed with six-guns. He screamed again, drew his own gun and fired, but his shot went wild.</p><p>Dillon, too, had come to the gunfight\u2014with a gun. He fired, dropping Hugo, then spun on a dime, and Darrell Frye, his hands shaking as he tried to aim, went down next. Then Dillon turned to Sarah.</p><p>But she had her gun leveled on him. \u201cNot yet, cowboy,\u201d she said smoothly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what visions you\u2019ve conjured. They\u2019re not real. And I still want my gold.\u201d</p> <p>The saloon doors suddenly swung open with a vengeance, drawing Sarah\u2019s attention. She shot wildly at the doors, but there was no one there.</p><p>Ringo took a step forward, and Sarah\u2019s eyes darted in the direction of his clinking spurs.</p><p>Dillon took advantage of the moment, but he didn\u2019t shoot her. He slammed his fist into her gut, and she cried out in agony, dropping her gun as she crashed to the floor.</p><p>Suddenly there was a silhouette in the doorway, and an authoritative voice said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it from here, Dillon. Good thing Mr. Sparhawk slipped out the back to warn me not to come charging in or I\u2019d be shot full of holes now. The shooting\u2019s all over for the night, folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon!\u201d Jessy screamed. It wasn\u2019t over. Sarah had reclaimed her gun and taken aim at Dillon again, a crazed glint in her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re not real!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Gunfire exploded. Dillon had no chance to take aim and fire, but Sarah made a shocked, gurgling sound, and a pool of blood was staining her shirt.</p><p>Ringo Murphy was standing a few feet away, a small trail of smoke rising from the barrel of the Colt he had leveled at Sarah Clay. She stared at him, seeing him and finally believing in him, as the glare of fury, hatred and bitterness faded from her eyes until there was nothing there at all. Ringo might be a ghost, but he had taken a real gun from the fallen body of Hugo Blythe, and with it and the legacy of the past, he had dealt justice with it in the present.</p><p>Sandra started to sob, hugging Reggie. Timothy went over to her, taking her into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sandra, it\u2019s over now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat...the hell just happened?\u201d Cheever asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a trick of light and energy\u2014and time,\u201d Dillon told him. Cheever would know, if he thought about it, that it couldn\u2019t have been so simple, but he would accept the explanation, because the reality would be just too hard to acknowledge.</p><p>As Jessy stood and walked unsteadily over to the table, she heard the sounds of sirens, car doors slamming and the voices of Adam, Brent and Nikki, as well as a number that she didn\u2019t recognize. People would be all over them in a minute. She threw herself into Dillon\u2019s arms, and he held her tightly, whispering against her hair before pulling away and kissing her lips.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Dillon, you did it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWith help,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cRingo was brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was. But I meant you. You kept everyone alive until I could get here.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOnly because she believed you could find the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I think I have a pretty good idea where it is,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She drew away, smiling. \u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked with Timothy\u2019s ghost dancers in a dream, and I saw John Wolf. It\u2019s here. He looked at his Mariah, and that\u2019s what he said, \u2018Here.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s it. The exact answer. Here in the saloon. We\u2019re standing on it.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>A month later, Jessy was fiddling with her bouquet when Dillon came over and stood next to her. The organist was getting ready, the crowd had assembled and the service was about to start.</p><p>\u201cThey found it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho found what?\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cThe excavators found the gold. The vein was right there, running under the saloon. Now the Paiute nation will have the gold, and the town will come back to life.\u201d</p><p>She rose on her toes and kissed him. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Now, please, get out of my way. I have somewhere to be.\u201d</p><p>It was a simple ceremony, but Jessy wanted everything to be right. When the music began, she looked back. Sally Teasdale, hiding behind the door, gave her a wink and a wave. Jessy started down the aisle, tossing flower petals as she went, until she reached the make-shift altar. The music changed, and to the traditional strains of \u201cHere Comes the Bride,\u201d Mrs. Teasdale, in simple but elegant pale blue with a matching veil, came walking down the aisle, smiling radiantly.</p><p>Timothy, tall and handsome, was waiting for her.</p><p>The ceremony was presided over by a minister and a shaman. Words were spoken in English and in Sioux, and Jessy was certain that the guests understood everything that was said, no matter what language. The ending was traditional, as the minister and shaman spoke together and said, \u201cYou may now kiss the bride.\u201d</p><p>Timothy kissed the new Mrs. Sparhawk, and the assembled group of fifty or so\u2014friends and anyone from the home who wanted to attend\u2014applauded mightily.</p><p>It was time for the meal. Jessy took her seat next to Dillon, and Adam, Brent, Nikki, Jerry Cheever, Doug Tarleton, Sandra and Reggie all joined them at the table.</p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful wedding,\u201d Jerry Cheever said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sandra agreed. They\u2019d been on two dates already; this was their third.</p><p>\u201cI should have been the flower girl,\u201d Reggie said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI was the maid of honor,\u201d Jessy told her. \u201cI just happened to throw flowers, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re too old to be a flower girl,\u201d Sandra said.</p><p>\u201cYou can be a bridesmaid at my wedding,\u201d Jessy told Reggie.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting married?\u201d Reggie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, if I ever do,\u201d Jessy said.</p><p>\u201cIf you want us to stick around for that wedding,\u201d Nikki said, \u201cit had better be soon. We can\u2019t stay here in Vegas forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, if Jessy agrees, you might still be here for our wedding,\u201d Dillon said. His dark eyes flashed as he looked at Jessy.</p><p>\u201cIs that a proposal?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very good one.\u201d</p><p>Dillon laughed and slipped to his knees by her side. \u201cJessy, will you marry me? I know we haven\u2019t been together long, but I also know I\u2019ll never love anyone as much as I love you or want to spend my life with anyone else.\u201d He paused. \u201cWas that better?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes, yes, you can get off your knees. Why the hurry?\u201d she whispered for his ears alone, but he just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be Jessy Sparhawk Wolf. Sounds like a zoo,\u201d Reggie said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going with you to pick out the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. I do not wear pink or anything ridiculously frilly.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed, and the talk turned to planning and guest list.</p><p>That night, as they lay in bed together, she finally found out why Dillon was in such a rush.</p><p>\u201cRingo is leaving,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d she asked, distressed.</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s a third wheel. But the truth is, he\u2019s finished what he\u2019s tried to do for over a hundred years. He told me he can feel the light calling to him, says he can see it in a way he never did before. And he\u2019s longing to go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She was sad, but she understood.</p><p>Six weeks later they were married. It ended up being a huge affair, with all the entertainers and casino friends Jessy had ever worked with in attendance, along with friends of Dillon\u2019s from Nevada, and beyond. Sandra and Nikki had gotten together to do most of the planning, and the end result was both traditional and contemporary. None of the trimmings that came with a wedding meant much to Jessy, though. She was in love with a man who was also her best friend and her strength.</p><p>Two days after the wedding, Jessy and Dillon made another drive out to Indigo. Ringo was with them, squishing Jessy in the middle between himself and Dillon. She tried not to cry, but the tears came anyway.</p><p>He tried to comfort her. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad. It\u2019s just time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Construction equipment was everywhere around town. The old ghost town was coming into a life it had never known before. Whatever was being dug or built, however, the cemetery wasn\u2019t to be touched. The Paiute had a great respect for the dead.</p><p>At the cemetery, Ringo directed them to his grave. He gave Dillon a solemn handshake, then said, \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d and hugged him. He kissed Jessy one last time. \u201cBe happy,\u201d he told her. \u201cKeep strong, and be brave, just as you are. And never forget kindness. Be generous and kind to all around you, nightwalker,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and set flowers on his grave as he turned away. The sun was setting, but the evening was suddenly ablaze with a beam of light. Ringo walked toward the light as Dillon and Jessy watched him.</p> <p>Then the light faded and Ringo was gone.</p><p>Dillon tilted Jessy\u2019s chin and brushed her lips with a kiss. \u201cWe\u2019ll do as he asked,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll live bravely and generously, and remember the lessons of the past.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLive, learn and love,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He smiled and brushed her lips with his again. Then, hand in hand, they walked away and left Indigo behind them. </p>  </body></html>"]
