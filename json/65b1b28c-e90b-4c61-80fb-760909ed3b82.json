The window rolls down and the thumping of the stereo\u2019s bass assaults me. I grin, recognizing the song immediately.</p> <p>Logan Taylor pokes his head out to meet my stare. \u201cHey, dude, where you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man. Good to see you. I\u2019ve been here and there. You?\u201d</p><p>He hangs his arm out the open window. \u201cSame. It\u2019s been weird not jamming with you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Talk to your aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look suicidal?\u201d he says, then blows the hair out of his eyes.</p> <p>I just shake my head because there\u2019s nothing else I can say. Not wanting to discuss Mrs. Taylor, I check out the curves he\u2019s sitting in. \u201cNew car?\u201d I ask as my eyes sweep the sleek, shiny body in front of me.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI wish. It\u2019s my dad\u2019s, and anyway you know I\u2019d never pick a yuppie-mobile if I had my choice. I\u2019d much rather have a car like yours any day, but no chance of that.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I do love my car. It used to belong to my father\u2014it was his sixteenth birthday present from my grandparents and he kept it all these years. When I was little I always admired it even if it only sat in my grandparents\u2019 garage. My dad never drove it anymore. He said it wasn\u2019t a family car. So when my dad gave me his shiny red Corvette for my own sixteenth birthday, I couldn\u2019t have been more excited.</p><p>\u201cYou here to see my cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d I say with a grin.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be glad to see you, man. She\u2019s been in a funk. Her mother has her going out on auditions almost every day.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes and sigh at the same time. I can\u2019t wait to get her out of this town. I take a deep breath before responding. \u201cShe told me you\u2019ve been getting her where she needs to go. Thanks for looking out for my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, she\u2019s family and I love her. I\u2019d do anything for my cousin. . . . You know that. Listen, I have to jet, but call me and let\u2019s get together,\u201d he says, then speeds off.</p><p>I shuffle onward with a slight smile on my face from knowing I finally get to see her. I take the short walk over to our meeting spot and the bell rings just as I arrive. The doors open and she walks my way. Her earrings glitter where they dangle from her ears\u2014the sun reflecting off the star-shaped sapphire stones that are the exact same color as her eyes. Watching the way she moves, I can\u2019t help but think she\u2019s the total package . . . looks, personality, brains, and a rocking body. There\u2019s a mysterious allure about her that I can never explain\u2014she has an innocence that I\u2019d do anything to protect. She\u2019s confident yet shy, strong but not, a rebel and a conformist all in one. And I f**king love her.</p><p>A huge smile breaks across her angelic face when she sees me standing near the basketball court and my heart goes crazy. Her small frame whisks in my direction and her long, platinum blond hair blows in the wind. She lifts her hand to her mouth and forms a perfect O as she blows me a kiss. She looks beautiful, and all I can do is grin. My gaze quickly drifts to her chest and then down to her narrow hips. She\u2019s wearing a white button-down that\u2019s a tad too tight and a navy skirt that\u2019s a little too short. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014my body reacts to hers with just a single glance. That\u2019s how much I love the way she looks. But I hate the thought of all the other guys seeing what\u2019s mine, especially when I\u2019m not around to put them in their place.</p><p>Pulling off my red Brent Academy polo and tossing it on the bench behind me, I slide my shades on and stand in my khakis and white T-shirt waiting for my girl, Ivy Taylor, to get closer. I keep my eyes fixed on her, ignoring all the other students around me. Sure, some of the guys walking by give me crooked looks, but that\u2019s as far as they take it anymore. They\u2019re used to seeing me by now\u2014I\u2019ve been waiting for her most days after school since I started driving. At first they didn\u2019t like me on their school grounds, but after a few fights they learned to leave me alone or get the shit kicked out of them. Just because I dress like a preppy ass doesn\u2019t mean I am one.</p><p>Today I skipped out of school early\u2014leaving my brother at the pristine private school we attend so I could see my girlfriend. Ivy attends a magnet school in the heart of LA. She lives nearby in a rent-controlled apartment building with her mother and three much younger sisters. Their father took off on them long ago and Kelly Taylor, Ivy\u2019s mother, is nothing if not resentful about it. In fact, her spiteful attitude is sometimes directed at me, and lately she\u2019s restricted our time together. She says she got a new job with later hours, so now Ivy has to go home right after school and I\u2019m no longer allowed over when she\u2019s not there. Coincidental? I doubt it. I can see through her\u2014she views me as a threat to her golden ticket.</p><p>There\u2019s no one to blame except myself for not keeping my big mouth shut, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Her vendetta against me started when she overheard Ivy and me planning our rehearsal schedule. She made the idiotic statement that her daughter was a born actress and she should be spending her time rehearsing for parts and preparing for auditions, not playing in a band. She even went so far as to ask me, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree, Xander, that with Ivy\u2019s looks she should be an actress, not a singer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even know Ivy?\u201d I asked with a dry laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know my daughter. And I know that with her beauty, she\u2019ll be an instant superstar. She just needs a push in the right direction. She needs to put herself out there more is all. Did she tell you an agent contacted me?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, dumbfounded, shaking my head. Because no, Ivy hadn\u2019t told me.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWell, one did\u2014last week. He spotted Ivy when the band was playing at that school in Anaheim and thought she\u2019d be perfect for a TV show airing in the fall. She auditions for it next week.\u201d</p><p>Ivy\u2019s head dropped as she spoke. \u201cMom, I told you, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m wearing a bathing suit on camera.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Taylor snapped, \u201cIvy, maybe the lifeguard part isn\u2019t right for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t another role you\u2019d like in the series. You need to go for the exposure, if not for the practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I don\u2019t want to act,\u201d Ivy reluctantly told her mother.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this. Singing in a band will take you nowhere. The money is in acting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about where the money is,\u201d I retorted, glaring at her mother. I mean, come on, Ivy\u2019s a modest, shy girl. It took forever for her to feel comfortable around me. Traipsing around a movie set half-dressed isn\u2019t exactly her thing, and honestly, I don\u2019t think I could handle it anyway. I didn\u2019t even bother to address where the money is. That was just a ridiculous statement. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Taylor, but everything isn\u2019t about money. Ivy\u2019s never even expressed the slightest bit of interest in acting\u2014it\u2019s always been you making her go on auditions that she doesn\u2019t want to go on. I think Ivy needs to decide what she wants to do herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say. Money has never been an issue for you or your family,\u201d Mrs. Taylor said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond. She was wrong. Yes, my grandfather had money, but my mother had been living paycheck to paycheck over the last couple of years. My father\u2019s erratic work schedule never guaranteed enough to even pay the mortgage, and if it weren\u2019t for my grandparents we\u2019d have lost our house. But that wasn\u2019t something I was going to get into with her. I may have had a smug look on my face, I don\u2019t know, because she stared at me for the longest time and so did Ivy. The difference? Ivy\u2019s stare said, \u201cThank you.\u201d Mrs. Taylor\u2019s stare said, \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>The truth is, I know Ivy very well. We\u2019ve been together for four years. We met through Logan. He and I were playing on the same basketball team when he told me he was looking to put a band together. I asked who he had lined up. He told me he played the drums and he had a cousin who sang, played guitar, and wrote songs. When I asked what his cousin was like, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s a talented girl whose voice draws you in the minute you hear it, and the beautiful tone of her guitar playing only sucks you in further.\u201d</p><p>His description of her intrigued me enough to make me consider joining. When I met Ivy, I could tell right away that she was a soulful artist who sang about what she knew, what she experienced. Once I heard her sing, I definitely wanted to hear more, and before I knew it, I was playing guitar with Logan and his cousin, Ivy Taylor. We called ourselves Poison Ivy and modeled our band after No Doubt. Which is fitting, because Ivy looks like a young Gwen Stefani. For the record, I agreed to play in the band because I was hot for Ivy, but I stayed because she really could write a song, sing a note, and rock a rhythm guitar like no other girl I knew. It didn\u2019t hurt that I fell in love with her the minute her fingers hit the chords. That smile she gave me when she played and sang was one I knew I couldn\u2019t live without.</p><p>Now it\u2019s been almost a week since we last saw each other, and my train of thought is instantly derailed the minute she jumps into my arms. \u201cYou made it! I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>I fall back onto the bench with her on my lap, my hands gliding up her warm thighs, and I tug her skirt down. \u201cHi, gorgeous. I told you I\u2019d be here. I just couldn\u2019t skip out of school early this week until today. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I get it, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. I hate not seeing you. It sucks.\u201d</p><p>Circling my hands around to her fine ass, I push her closer to me and grin. \u201cI think what you mean to say is you love me so much you can\u2019t bear to be without me that long.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers travel to my hair and she yanks on it and says softly, \u201cStop putting words in my mouth, even if they are true.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, I take her hands in mine and stare into the depths of her blue eyes. Today they are the darkest of blues\u2014stormy. \u201cFuck, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d I breathe out. Then after another moment I whisper, \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>A quiet sigh escapes her lips and the look in her eyes tells me everything I already know but still love to hear. She nuzzles her nose close to my ear and the warmth of her breath on my skin instantly excites me. \u201cI love you, too, Xander. And I can\u2019t wait until the fall so we can see each other every day without our family issues getting in our way.\u201d</p><p>I attach my lips to hers and kiss her with the passion that always ignites between us whenever we touch. I think about the freedom we\u2019ll have to be together, and I get lost in just the idea of it. Pulling away, I brush my tongue across her lower lip. \u201cI can\u2019t wait either,\u201d I murmur. The thought of us on our own together has my body going into overdrive. The muscles in her thighs tighten and the sound of her breathing becomes louder. I hold her face in my hands and just look at her\u2014she takes my breath away. She always does . . . she always has and she always will.</p><p>She leans in and kisses me slowly. It\u2019s not the same as the way I kissed her. Her kiss is one of need, not want, and I can feel it. I respond with slow, steady flicks of my tongue, but before I\u2019m done letting her know I\u2019ll always be here for her, someone is tapping me on the shoulder. I twist around to see a short, gray-haired woman in a yellow suit pointing her finger at me. \u201cExcuse me, young man, but that kind of behavior is not allowed on school grounds. I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Ivy scurries off my lap, smoothing her skirt. \u201cSorry, Vice Principal Myers. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d She forces a smile at the woman, who has scolded us a few too many times over the years.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ivy, I know it won\u2019t, my dear,\u201d the iron-faced lady says while shooting daggers at me with her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It happens every damn time, and I wonder if she remembers me or thinks Ivy\u2019s kissing a different guy each time she catches us. I try to apologize, but like usual she turns around in a huff and marches toward the other end of the basketball court to break up another couple heading in the same direction we were. Standing up, I wrap my arm around Ivy\u2019s waist and lead her to my car. Leaning over, I whisper in her ear, \u201cYour skirt is a little short, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She looks down as if she forgot what she\u2019s wearing. She shrugs her shoulders. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is bend over and every guy will think your ass is just begging to be spanked.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. Before I can comment further she snakes her arm around my waist. She looks up at me trying to stifle her laughter. \u201cXander, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re the only guy that thinks that way when he looks at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, baby, I\u2019m not. But keep it up and I\u2019ll be doing more than just thinking it.\u201d</p><p>She giggles again. She thinks I\u2019m kidding\u2014but I\u2019m not.</p><p>The hot sun beats down on us and reflects off the paint of the cars in the parking lot, nearly blinding Ivy. I turn to face her. I walk backward and remove my sunglasses to place them on her pretty face. Twisting back, I slap her ass and clutch her by the hand, then sprint for my car, about fifty yards away. We are both panting when we reach it. After I open the door for her, she pushes the seat forward and throws her red sack on the floor, but fails in her attempt to swat me with it first. I shake my head and grin. When her eyes adjust to the shade, she removes my sunglasses. Her face is a vision as she props herself back on her elbows and pulls her red combat boots into the car. With love written all over her face, I decide to drop the clothing issue. \u201cYou all set?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She nods and I quickly close the door and dart around to the driver\u2019s side. By the time I slide in, she\u2019s buckled up and grinning at me. As I start the engine, the throaty roar of the 5.4-liter V-8 comes to life. I turn to her, barely able to speak with thoughts of what I hope to have time for shifting through my mind, and ask, \u201cWhat time do you have to be home?\u201d</p><p>She leans over and slides her tongue around the shell of my ear. \u201cI have at least two hours. I was hoping you\u2019d make it today, so I told my mom I had a study session and to ask Mrs. Cooper to babysit if she couldn\u2019t get home before the girls\u2019 bus.\u201d</p> <p>Turning my Corvette around the corner a little too fast, I drag my mind back to the road, but my dick twitches as I try to decide where we should go. My grandparents are in the process of moving from their house in Brentwood to a condominium in Beverly Hills and I\u2019m pretty sure yesterday was moving day, so the house should be empty today. I know they have until the end of the summer to fully vacate, but I think we\u2019re safe going there now. I glance at her as she settles back in her seat and fumbles through her bag with a look of concern on her face.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Her eyes flutter as we turn the corner and the sun makes them sparkle. \u201cOf course,\u201d she says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go? Pool house or pier?\u201d I ask. Of course, getting her n*ked is what I really want to do, but I\u2019d be cool with just hanging out and talking if that\u2019s what she\u2019s up for. I know she has a lot going on with her mother.</p><p>Pulling a CD out of her bag, she ejects my Nirvana disc and tucks it into the sleeve above her visor, alongside the many others. Then she inserts hers into the player and kicks her feet up. Staring at her legs has me wishing I hadn\u2019t given her a choice of where to go. She doesn\u2019t answer right away. Instead she reaches for the sunglasses she threw on the dash and puts them on. Then she looks my way, raises her head, and quietly says, \u201cThe pool house is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>My mouth goes dry and my breathing becomes forced. I\u2019m a little more than excited with her choice. I try to deflect my anticipation by pointing to the player. \u201cWhat CD is this?\u201d</p> <p>Dropping her feet, she turns toward me and just a glance has me looking at her tits overflowing from her pushup bra. Fuck, a week has been a long time. How am I going to make the two months this summer? I hope my mom will let me make calls from France.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at my chest,\u201d she chastises me, not even attempting to pull the puckered fabric of her shirt together.</p><p>\u201cHow can I be staring when I\u2019m driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you are,\u201d she says, turning bright red.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she says shyly and searches in her bag again. She offers me a piece of gum and I decline as she sticks one in her mouth. She blows a bubble and pops it before hitting PLAY. \u201cI made you a mix tape so that when you\u2019re thinking of me you can listen to it and know I\u2019m thinking of you. I also made you a photo album,\u201d she says, pulling a black canvas album out of her backpack. Glancing at it, I can see it has a picture of us inserted in the front. It\u2019s a photo from last summer when we went with my family to Niagara Falls to see Third Eye Blind perform. Ivy and I are standing on the Maid of the Mist in yellow ponchos\u2014both of us have a look of awe on our faces as the water rushes all around us and the sound of the falls roars above us.</p><p>\u201cThe pictures aren\u2019t to share. And don\u2019t look at them until you\u2019re in France. This is to keep you away from all those hot French babes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m only interested in you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo months is a long time, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. But all it means is a lot of hand action,\u201d I joke.</p><p>Her face blazes with color. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m giving you a few pictures.\u201d</p><p>I glance back at the album with what I know must be a shit-eating grin.</p><p>\u201cCaution\u201d plays through the speakers, and the song pulls me back in time. It was the first song she wrote that we played together and the only song I ever had a vocal spot in. Both of us seem to lose ourselves in our memories. We\u2019ve been dreading the time we\u2019ll be apart this summer. I thought I was taking it harder than she was, but I\u2019m no longer so sure. Sometimes I forget that underneath her seemingly hard exterior is that fragile, sensitive girl who captured my heart. She always seems undaunted, unmoved\u2014but I know she\u2019s not.</p><p>Taking her hand, I pull it to my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy with those thoughts. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs her shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been apart for two months.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate, trying to find the right words, but I\u2019m not sure what they are, so I settle on, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s not that long. But thank you.\u201d I pause, then chuckle. \u201cHow did I get so lucky to snag a girl like you?\u201d</p><p>She leans over the console and kisses the corner of my mouth, then whispers in my ear, \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re so good in bed.\u201d</p><p>She quickly sits back in her seat, but I capture her hand first and look over at her. \u201cYou know it, baby,\u201d I joke. Her cheeks blaze and I laugh. We were both virgins when we met and have only been with each other, so really there are no comparisons, and I like it that way. \u201cCaution\u201d ends and so does the playful mood in the car when Keane\u2019s \u201cShe Has No Time\u201d starts playing. The lyrics of the song cast a wave of sadness over me and I swallow the huge lump in my throat as it plays on. Ivy isn\u2019t one for openly expressing her feelings, but sometimes she tells me things that make me want to snatch her and just run away. And this song triggers that protective instinct I have for her. It reminds me of her life so much that I have to press STOP. I think it\u2019s better for me to listen to this CD when I\u2019m alone.</p><p>This is one of our last days together for a while, so I want to keep things light and fun. I always tell her our relationship is so entangled with our messed-up family lives, but really it\u2019s hers that is the sadder. My father might have turned into a drunk, but my family is close\u2014something she doesn\u2019t have. She loves her sisters, but they are so much younger than she is\u2014she\u2019s more like their mother than their sister. And her mother\u2014I don\u2019t even want to think about her.</p><p>As the CD ejects, I turn to her and mouth, \u201cThank you.\u201d Then I tell her, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to it later,\u201d and place the CD in the console.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, do people really make mix tapes anymore? Or are they called mix CDs?\u201d</p><p>Laughing at her attempt to lighten the mood, I say, \u201cI have no f**king idea, but great question.\u201d</p><p>She twists sideways to pick up the photo album again and freezes. \u201cWhose pink bag is that?\u201d</p><p>I quickly glance back. \u201cTessa\u2019s I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are Tessa Bloom\u2019s things here?\u201d she asks. Her voice is harsh.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cShe must have left it in here when I gave her a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you giving her rides home? Doesn\u2019t she have her own car?\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on the bare skin of her leg. \u201cBaby, not rides. A ride. And her car was in the shop, so she needed a lift.\u201d</p><p>She leans back in her seat and fidgets with the seat belt. She turns away but replies, \u201cI don\u2019t really like her or her friend Amy hanging out with you when I\u2019m not around.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze her thigh and inch my fingers under her skirt. \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous. We\u2019re just friends. You know that.\u201d</p><p>She pouts. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. I know she likes you, Xander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t. But even if she did\u2014I love you.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me uncertainly. I reach my hand over and catch the back of her neck, pulling her in my direction. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She nods and I let the silence sweep the car. Again, I want to keep today light, not argue about a girl who doesn\u2019t matter. I finally pull into my grandparents\u2019 driveway, and as I park my car, I see that she\u2019s looking straight ahead, ignoring me. I lean over and kiss her cheek, then nip her ear. \u201cCome on\u2014we don\u2019t have much time. Don\u2019t be mad at me over a stupid ride.\u201d She turns her head and I tug on her lip.</p><p>She finally smiles and playfully tries to tug mine back. Then, knuckling me in the side and wrinkling her nose, she says, \u201cNo more rides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply. \u201cNo more rides. Now stay put.\u201d I push open my door and head over to her side of the car.</p><p>We walk quickly, straight to the pool house. It\u2019s where we\u2019ve spent most of our alone time over the past four years. Lately, I\u2019ve had to share it with my brother, but when I found out my grandparents sold their house, I told him in no uncertain terms that the pool house was mine for the time we had left.</p><p>I swing open the unlocked opaque glass door. Ivy walks in first and I follow. The built-in window seat, ceiling fan, light blue walls, and bamboo wooden floor are all that remain. The furniture and pool table are gone, but I don\u2019t think either of us cares. Once I close the door we become two silhouettes in a darkened room. She turns around and stands on her tiptoes. With the blinds closed, there is barely enough light to illuminate anything, but I can see the gleam in her eyes. I bury my face in her neck. \u201cFuck, I missed you,\u201d I say again.</p><p>My hands roam her body, and her fingers skim mine right down to the front of my pants. Her fingertips trace up the length of my zipper and when she finds the tab, she slowly pulls it down.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I say, and let my head fall back\u2014her gentle touch only excites me further. When I can\u2019t take it another minute, I circle my arms around her waist and suck on her earlobe. \u201cUmmm . . . that feels so good.\u201d</p><p>She drops her hands and leans into me\u2014and the strain in my pants actually becomes painful. I quickly pull her shirt over her head and feel my way to the inside of her bra. \u201cUnsnap it,\u201d I tell her and when she does I feel the full weight of her br**sts in my hands and then with my mouth. Heat blazes through me and I can\u2019t help but think about the looming summer separation that\u2019s just a few days away\u2014it\u2019s really going to suck. I\u2019m going to spend the next two months in Paris with my aunt, and Ivy will be taking her sisters to their grandparents\u2019 place in Indiana. I hope those pictures she gave me help me get through it. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be doing a lot of fantasizing, so I try to capture every second of right now to use then as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When my lips return to hers, she\u2019s trembling. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she responds, her eyelids fluttering.</p><p>In the next moment, with our breathing loud and heartbeats louder, she pulls my shirt over my head. Running one hand along my abdomen, she teases, \u201cWow, have you been working out more?\u201d</p><p>I catch her hand in mine and her smile lights up the room. I yank her to me and cover her mouth with mine in a hungry kiss. She responds immediately. My mouth caresses her soft lips and I want to taste every inch of her sweetness with my tongue.</p> <p>Once I feel like I have thoroughly kissed her, I pull away, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been working out every day, trying to exhaust myself to keep from climbing in your bedroom window and f**king you. And if I didn\u2019t think your mom would have me arrested, I would have.\u201d</p><p>She laughs halfheartedly. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long and we won\u2019t have to worry about my mom.\u201d I can hear a sadness in her voice and I hope it\u2019s only that she\u2019ll miss her sisters when she\u2019s away at college She kisses the very corner of my lips and runs her hands back down my stomach.</p><p>I hold her tightly and claim her mouth. With her eager return, my breathing quickens and my pulse races. It doesn\u2019t take long for me to lean back and crook my finger, leading her over to the window seat. Feeling a sense of uncertainty in her that isn\u2019t usually there, I take my time. I want her to feel how much I love her . . . to know she doesn\u2019t have to worry about us being apart. I unbutton her skirt at the waist and then tug the zipper down, and the skirt falls to the floor.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs,\u201d I command.</p><p>When she does as I ask, I cover her pu**y with my hand and slip my fingers inside her panties. She is so wet. I suck in a breath, wanting to savor the feeling. It\u2019s hard to believe two people could ever want each other as much as we do.</p> <p>The room transforms around me. I see nothing but her as I quickly remove my pants. She watches me, and then I clutch her h*ps so I can lower us to the cushion, where I plan to spend all of the hour we have left making love to her. This time the sex won\u2019t be frenzied, the f**king won\u2019t be hurried\u2014no, it will be a reflection of how we feel about each other. I wish we had more time . . . I wish we had all the time in the world. However, right now we don\u2019t. I know I have to get her home and then head back to school to pick up River. But I push those thoughts aside and sink into her. As I thrust in and out, the world as I know it fades away and pleasure is all that remains.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>The Wire</p><p>Xander, 30 Years Old</p><p>The magic of rock and roll\u2014it casts a spell on you. And I\u2019m no exception. I\u2019m a band manager and I\u2019m living the dream, touring with the Wilde Ones, helping them secure their well-deserved place in the music industry. I love being a part of it all, especially watching the band perform live\u2014the crowds, the cheers, the music. It\u2019s a high and a low all at once, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. Every step of the way with this band has been fun, exciting, stressful\u2014every possible emotion. Obviously we\u2019ve had some breaks, but mostly we all put in a lot of hard work\u2014myself, Garrett Flynn the drummer, Phoenix Harper the bassist, River Wilde the former lead singer, and now Zane Perry the new lead.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d Zane bellows.</p> <p>I nod my head as my heart pounds in my chest. My hands feel cold and clammy and a nervousness that makes me weak and shaky takes over. Doubts race through my head and I\u2019m questioning if he\u2019s going to make it through this. A vague awareness that something bad could happen has been kicking around in my mind, and I can\u2019t shake it. The Wilde Ones are doing a sound check onstage and Zane\u2019s not on his game.</p><p>It\u2019s July and the weather has been brutally hot. But today it seems cooler. Maybe it\u2019s the California weather. Maybe it\u2019s the excitement of being home. The Beautiful Lies tour bus finally rolled back into our home state of California after six months away. While we\u2019re in town, I have a laundry list of shit to do\u2014meet with the accountant for the band, catch my assistant, Ena, up on changes to upcoming stops, and stoke some fires in the publicity department at the label to ease the questions about the lead singer transition. I\u2019m actually thinking some of the more mundane tasks of my job are suddenly looking better and better. On the road my day is always the same, but never the same\u2014posting dailies and arranging rehearsals are automatic, but the rest evolves with the location, the people, and the needs of the band.</p><p>When the bus eased into the amphitheater, we could see tanned kids in board shorts and bikini tops already lined up at the will-call window. Security guards in polo shirts directed us to the artist parking lot, and we were officially home. Tonight we\u2019ll be headlining our biggest show to date. We\u2019re on tour without my brother, and still more than half of the shows are sold out, including tonight\u2019s. River quit the band\u2014touring just wasn\u2019t for him\u2014but even so, the album is on its way up the charts. Who knows\u2014it may even hit gold status. The songs on the album were written and sung by River, but are performed in concert by Zane. Having him as my brother\u2019s replacement has been the key to our successful transition in a world where replacing leads is normally unsuccessful\u2014simply put, we\u2019re lucky as hell to have him. However, River did promise to make a surprise appearance at our next stop. It\u2019s going to be epic.</p><p>But tonight is all about the arena\u2014Mountain View and the Shoreline. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d I yell to the band and call rehearsal. This place is the biggest outdoor venue we\u2019ve played, and I couldn\u2019t be more stoked\u2014or more nervous. A sold-out show and a rocking opening band\u2014what a combination. But a lead singer with another cold and a weakened voice that can\u2019t be heard throughout an amphitheater scares the shit out of me.</p><p>I head straight for the bus and spend the next few hours hashing out a song with Nix that he calls a jumbled mess of muscular sense and big-riff sunshine\u2014whatever the hell that means. All I know is that it needs help and that\u2019s why he\u2019s turning to me. I hadn\u2019t played guitar since I was eighteen, but for some reason, I\u2019ve picked it back up over the course of this tour. At first I played on whichever guitar was lying around, but last month I had my mother mail my old one to me, and it feels like home. It\u2019s a light blue and brown Gibson\u2014it\u2019s the same guitar that Slash uses. Playing again seems to help pass the time and brings a sense of calm to me that I haven\u2019t felt in a while.</p><p>Hours pass, and before I know it, it\u2019s almost showtime. We make our way over to the amphitheater, do the typical festival schmooze fest, and then settle back until it\u2019s our turn. Waiting for the band to take the stage is always the most nerve-racking time. I\u2019m sitting in the practically vacant makeshift meet-and-greet area backstage and sipping a beer in a worthless effort to calm my nerves when a voice travels through the sound system. It\u2019s a powerful and emotive mezzo-soprano range that is nothing short of explosive. She sounds unlike any singer I\u2019ve ever heard before\u2014with only one exception: Ivy Taylor. I push back the memories and emotions that her name evokes; they are just too painful. I can\u2019t see her onstage, but I know that the voice belongs to Jane Mommsen. Her band, Breathless, is playing right before the Wilde Ones.</p><p>A hand on my shoulder startles me. I twist and glance up as Amy sits down beside me, crossing her legs. \u201cHi, Xander. I thought I saw you earlier at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s a beautiful woman\u2014long, wavy dark hair, petite figure, very natural-looking. She\u2019s wearing jeans, a blue shirt with some kind of foil design, and silver sandals. Grinning at her, I say, \u201cFinally we catch up. Can I get you a drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love that. How\u2019s life on the road been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it has its ups and downs, but actually not bad. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s been going full force for a while now. But the tour ends with the summer and I\u2019ll be glad to be back in LA.\u201d</p><p>Standing up, I laugh. \u201cI know the feeling. Let me get us that drink\u2014I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Tossing my empty bottle, I make my way to the coolers lined up under the tent and grab two beers. I know she\u2019d rather have a glass of Chardonnay, but beer it is. Amy is Jane\u2019s assistant, and I\u2019ve taken her out more than a few times. We went to high school together, and we know most of the same people, so whenever I need a date, I ask her. Last time I saw her was almost nine months ago when I took her to River and Dahlia\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Heading back to the table, I hear Jane yell out to the crowd, \u201cAre you ready for three of the hottest guys in music?\u201d The audience starts screaming and the overhead lights dim, cuing the guys that it\u2019s the fifteen-minute countdown until they take the stage. I can see the band members huddle together in their typical pre-performance stance. I\u2019ll have a quick drink with Amy and then join them. As I hand her the bottle, my fingers touch hers and we both grin, knowing that we\u2019ll end up alone by the end of the night.</p><p>\u201cYou sticking around for the whole show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might.\u201d She smiles.</p><p>\u201cHow about we ride back to the hotel together and have a real drink at the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Time for me to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>She rises from the table, and I do the same. She stands up on her toes and kisses me quickly on the lips. \u201cSee you tonight,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I give her an expectant look and cross the room to join the band.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Nix says with a snicker. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you two anyway?\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. \u201cNothing. We see each other casually once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Garrett raises an eyebrow. \u201cChicks are never cool with casual.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head at him, I don\u2019t bother to disagree. Amy and I have been doing this for years. It works for her and for me. We like each other\u2019s company but see each other only sporadically. I\u2019ll call her every now and then and we\u2019ll go out, but we are in no way exclusive. I don\u2019t ask her about other men and she doesn\u2019t ask me about other women.</p><p>I grab the bottle and pour the amber liquid into the shot glasses stacked beside it. It\u2019s our preshow routine. A shot and a prayer, so to say. It\u2019s Garrett\u2019s turn tonight to \u201cpray\u201d\u2014this should be good.</p><p>He raises his glass. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping Xander gets laid so he\u2019ll get off our backs.\u201d</p><p>Tipping my glass back, I quickly down the liquid. It burns as it makes its way down my throat. Once we\u2019ve all drunk our two-shot maximum before a show, Garrett follows his toast up with, \u201cSeriously, man, you need to get laid.\u201d</p><p>The guys laugh and I actually join in. Jerking off in the small bathroom on the bus is definitely one of the downsides of touring. I\u2019ve slept with a few girls at some of our stops, but screwing groupies isn\u2019t really my thing. I\u2019m not one to have time for a girlfriend, but I\u2019m also not about to pull my dick out backstage. So it\u2019s been a long six months.</p><p>Zane coughs after he slings back the shot and I look at him with concern. \u201cYou\u2019re going to a doctor tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cYes, Mom, if you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Your voice sounds like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a f**king cold. I took some medicine. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor. Tomorrow. I mean it. I\u2019ll have Ena set it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can always sing,\u201d Garrett chimes in, and I smack the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cHey. I can,\u201d he responds, offended.</p><p>The lights start to flicker and I look at Zane with that feeling of uneasiness again. Second time this tour he\u2019s coughing and hacking. We\u2019re screwed if he really gets sick. He nods at me as I pat him on the back. Slinging his guitar over his shoulder, he heads out first, raising his arm in the air. The crowd goes crazy. The six-foot-tall guy is a chick magnet and no one is missing my brother tonight. Garrett heads out next, yelling, \u201cGreat to be here, Mountain View!\u201d and Nix follows with his trademark nod. Zane skips his normal charming banter, and I know he must be saving his voice. Again I think about how f**ked we are if he gets really sick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stand at the edge of the stage all night, until they finally come to their last song. \u201cIt Wasn\u2019t Days Ago\u201d is a simple but crowd-affecting ballad, and Zane belts it out. Shouts from nearly thirty thousand fans call for an encore. Turning away from the microphone, Zane coughs again. He bites his thumbnail, looks over at me, and I slice my finger across my neck.</p><p>\u201cOne more song for tonight,\u201d he tells the screaming fans, and my blood pressure rises. \u201cThis one is a cover, an \u2018ode to\u2019 I\u2019ll call it. It\u2019s for Xander Wilde, the band\u2019s manager, and it\u2019s his favorite song. Everyone ready?\u201d As he starts to sing Linkin Park\u2019s \u201cIridescent,\u201d I close my eyes and listen. When he hits the chorus, his voice gets so low my eyes snap open. Zane turns to grab a bottle of water while the guys continue to play, but I can tell something isn\u2019t right.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Something Beautiful</p> <p>Last night definitely didn\u2019t go as planned\u2014a visit to the ER, then sleeping in a chair next to Zane all night on the bus because the steroids he was given freaked him out wasn\u2019t what I had expected. It\u2019s noon and Amy and I are just arriving at Pelican Hill Resort. She invited me to join her at some party being thrown tonight by her band\u2019s label. I would rather have skipped, but since we are here anyway, Ellie, the tour manager, insisted we all go for the good PR.</p><p>I\u2019m exhausted and really need some sleep before dealing with the press and tomorrow night\u2019s show. The paparazzi have been everywhere\u2014by the bus as we exited to the waiting car in LA, outside the doctor\u2019s office, at the gates of Zeak Perry, Zane\u2019s father\u2019s house, and now they\u2019re here in Irvine at the hotel.</p><p>To avoid the chaos awaiting us in the lobby, I called Ellie and asked her to check me in and meet me at the pool bar with the room key. I drape my arm around Amy, and we head that way. I\u2019ve been here a few times, so I know my way around. Cutting through the grotto and over to the pool and cabanas, I steer Amy to the right and stop in my tracks as all the air rushes from my lungs.</p><p>My body floods with adrenaline and my gut twists. I don\u2019t even have to do a double take, since I\u2019d know her anywhere. There\u2019s no mistaking her. She\u2019s just so beautiful\u2014the elegant planes of her face, those high cheekbones, the red lipstick, and her platinum hair, which may be shorter than it used to be but is still tucked behind her ear like it always was. She looks the same. No, she looks better. Her skin glistens in the sun and my gaze automatically follows the shape of her long legs. They look smooth and tan against her white bathing suit. An ache forms in my chest as I think about running my fingers up them. She still looks like that eighteen-year-old girl I once knew, but now she has the body of a woman\u2014lean and toned and full of curves. The sight of her is so familiar it doesn\u2019t seem like a day has passed since I last saw her\u2014and everything I ever felt for her, it\u2019s all still inside me.</p><p>My pulse races at the mere memory of us. She\u2019s reclining in the cushioned lounge chair, reading a magazine just outside a cabana. My heart slams harder in my chest when she sticks her earphones in her ears and it transports me back to the last time I saw her do the very same thing. We\u2019d skipped school and were at my grandparents\u2019 house\u2014their pool. She was lying on the lounge chair listening to music and singing along\u2014her voice so full of soul. I\u2019d moved to sit with her under the guise of putting lotion on her back. She sat up and smiled that shy smile she didn\u2019t need to have when she was with me. I squeezed the tube into my hands. And after rubbing them together, I slowly applied it to her back, kneading my way up and down, touching every inch of her that I could.</p> <p>Suddenly she sits up and looks over at me. Her eyes pin me in place, bringing me back to the here and now. She looks at me as if she remembers me for who I was, what we were. Not what I did to her. With my chest pounding, memories of us keep flashing through my mind. Fighting a smile, I wonder if she\u2019s thinking the same thing\u2014remembering what we were, what we shared, how we loved.</p><p>She quickly breaks our connection when she averts her eyes and turns toward the man handing her a drink. I suck in a deep breath, trying not to feel sick at the sight. He\u2019s nearing fifty, wearing a terry-cloth robe. He\u2019s about my height, dark brown hair, meticulously groomed facial hair, and not exactly ripped, but fit. I\u2019ve never actually met him, but I hate him all the same. Damon Wolf. I\u2019ve seen his picture on TV and in magazines. He\u2019s her agent, her fianc\u00e9, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the reason she\u2019s not singing anymore.</p><p>She looks up at him with that same forced smile she used to give people she just wanted to appease and mouths \u201cthank you.\u201d I have a sudden urge to go over and deck him, but then her gaze shifts back to mine. After a few moments, he pulls her chin back to make her look at him, and I can sense some discomfort between them. We could always sense each other\u2019s feelings even when we weren\u2019t near each other.</p><p>Amy\u2019s hand slides down my arm and I have to blink a few times before I can hear what she\u2019s saying. Glancing one last time at Ivy, I see that she\u2019s staring at me again. Then suddenly her mouth forms a scowl and she flicks her attention away from me. Hooking her arm around Damon\u2019s neck, she pulls him down for a kiss and I think I might throw up.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, not able to say a word.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Ivy Taylor over there? The girl you used to date in high school?\u201d Amy asks. There\u2019s an irritated tone to her voice I\u2019m not used to hearing, and it makes me agitated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d I try to sound casual. She\u2019s not just a girl I used to date . . . she\u2019s the only girl I ever really loved. She\u2019s also the girl whose heart I broke. Seeing her now brings back all those feelings I blocked, ignored, cast away. So many times over the years I wanted to go after her and tell her the truth\u2014but I never did. Why, I don\u2019t know. Then one day it was too late\u2014she had gotten engaged.</p><p>Amy chatters on. \u201cI think that\u2019s Damon Wolf with her. We should go say hi.\u201d</p><p>My body goes cold at the thought. I straighten and just as I\u2019m about to say, \u201cNo f**king way,\u201d my phone vibrates in my pocket. Squinting at the screen, I see that it\u2019s my brother. I look over to Amy and motion toward the bar. \u201cHey, this is River. I need to take it. I\u2019ll meet you over there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We can catch up with them later. I\u2019ll go order us a drink.\u201d She smiles and starts toward the bar.</p><p>Turning around to avoid staring at Ivy, I answer the phone. \u201cIt took you long enough to call me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a meeting and stepped out as soon as I could, so don\u2019t start. What did the doctor say about Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out for the rest of the tour and we\u2019re f**ked.\u201d I hated the sound of the harsh truth in my own words.</p> <p>\u201cYou sure? You\u2019re back in LA for almost two weeks after tomorrow night, right? Isn\u2019t that enough time for him to heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, yes. But his old man wants him out. The doctor said that he couldn\u2019t be sure as to how long the blood that had accumulated under Zane\u2019s vocal cords had been there, but obviously last night, the degree of ruptured vessels was severe enough to cause his voice to freeze. The doctor advised at least two weeks of rest before another evaluation to see if surgery is necessary. Zeak wants his son to take a longer period of time off. He\u2019s afraid that if Zane keeps singing and it keeps happening, scar tissue will build up and cause his voice to change forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you blame him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d I feel like shit that I have to put River in a position to do what he didn\u2019t want to do in the first place. But I also know that if I don\u2019t, the band won\u2019t survive. If I have to cancel this tour, the Wilde Ones are done. So I ask, \u201cDid you talk to Dahlia?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cYeah, I did. She\u2019s cool with it, Xander. I\u2019m just trying to figure it all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll do whatever you need me to do, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, why can\u2019t you just be an ass and make it easy for me to say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have no idea what this means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I do, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to make it happen. But, Xander, remember I can\u2019t play a twelve-string.\u201d</p><p>Laughter and relief take hold of me. I feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. \u201cRight now I wouldn\u2019t care if you only played the mandolin,\u201d I joke.</p><p>He laughs and I add, \u201cYou\u2019ll be here tonight?\u201d</p><p>Now he sounds slightly annoyed. \u201cI said I would. We might be a little late, so don\u2019t get your panties in a wad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. Thanks for everything. Hey, one more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy Taylor\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Have you spoken to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, no. You know she won\u2019t talk to me. And besides, she\u2019s with that ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to her. Tell her the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that going to do now? She\u2019ll just think I\u2019m lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to talk to her? I can explain everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t need my little brother to fight my battles. I\u2019ll talk to her if I feel the time is right. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say. Look, I have to run, but I want to discuss this later. And, Xander . . . you don\u2019t know he\u2019s an ass**le. Just because Dad said his name once doesn\u2019t mean shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Okay, see you tonight,\u201d I say and end the call. My head is spinning from knowing that after all these years I\u2019m actually in the same place she is. I want to talk to her, tell her everything, but I can\u2019t see how that would change anything anyway. Glancing behind me, I catch another glimpse of the two of them that turns my stomach. He\u2019s such a slimeball. Since his father was hospitalized and he took over the business, he\u2019s been scooping up labels, tearing them apart, and rebuilding them with bands he thinks are better fits. My guess is he picked up Jane\u2019s label\u2014that\u2019s why he\u2019s here. I heard they were having some financial difficulty, and he\u2019s just the kind of bottom-feeder that would want to capitalize on being not only Jane\u2019s agent but now also her producer. The sight of him touching Ivy makes my skin crawl.</p><p>Damon Wolf, now turned music mogul, is the agent to a select few stars. Damon Wolf\u2014two of the last words my father spoke to me before killing himself, and I never knew why. Of all the guys in the world Ivy had to end up with\u2014why him? I look up and they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m anything but relieved, though. Rubbing my chin, I\u2019m antsy, agitated, pissed as hell, but I feel more alive than I have in years.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Our breakup is permanently etched in my mind\u2014it\u2019s something that, although done, was left unfinished. What matters the most is that she didn\u2019t stay in LA for college. She got away from her mother\u2019s influence and didn\u2019t go into acting. She ended up right where she belongs\u2014in the music industry. I felt at peace with what I did when her career started to take off. I was even okay with the fact that somewhere along the way she traded the alt-rock edge for the pop culture route\u2014following in the path of Britney Spears instead of Alanis Morissette. However, whenever I watched her perform I did notice she seemed uncomfortable, unsure, and uneasy with the show she was putting on. Perhaps if she had taken the other route her comfort level would have been there, but who knows? I have to admit, though, that Damon Wolf did help create Ivy Taylor the vocalist, as the world knows her today. She may not have been at the top of the charts but she certainly wasn\u2019t at the bottom. She was made for the spotlight\u2014and I really want to know why she stopped performing.</p><p>The resort club is filled with staffers, managers, agents, musicians, and reporters sipping their drinks and talking\u2014all waiting to hear the news from the label about the fate of Next Records. I\u2019m on my second Jack and Coke when I notice Ivy enter the room. Damon surprisingly isn\u2019t by her side. Gorgeous and alone\u2014she looks incredible. At five seven, she is perfectly proportioned from head to toe. She joins a group of people on the dance floor. Her pin-straight hair moves across her bare shoulders as she sways among the guests. Her short black dress shimmers under the lights and accentuates her curves in the best possible way. It\u2019s tight\u2014longer in the back than the front, showing an edge only she could pull off. And my rebel girl has turned in her combat boots for thigh highs\u2014flashing a bit of leg that is sexy as hell, but maybe just a little too much skin. No matter what she wears, I\u2019ve never been able to take my eyes off her. And now, my mind can\u2019t turn off how I once felt about her. But the large diamond on the fourth finger of her left hand signals a reminder that she\u2019s not mine anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I make my way around the room, networking, talking about the band, but somehow I never lose track of where she is. She catches my gaze at one point, but I\u2019m unsure what she\u2019s thinking. I wonder if what I did killed what she once felt for me. Just seeing her has made me want her all the more, and I know I have to talk to her. When I\u2019m standing next to Amy and the guys, I notice Jane pat her on the shoulder. They move off the dance floor and close enough to where I\u2019m standing that I can just barely hear their conversation. I can\u2019t help but eavesdrop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you. I\u2019ve heard nothing but great things about that successful whirlwind tour of yours!\u201d Ivy tells Jane. Hearing her voice puts a smile on my face. Her tone is still soft, but she seems more confident. It makes me feel somewhat proud.</p><p>\u201cWell, you could be the next major tour to hit the road, but I heard you and Damon are actually thinking of starting a family,\u201d Jane responds.</p><p>Hearing those words cripples me.</p> <p>I turn to Amy. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>My feet are already moving. I have to get away. I don\u2019t want to hear Ivy\u2019s response. I dart outside, needing some air. I wonder if she\u2019s already expecting a baby. Fuck. His baby. My head spins. I haven\u2019t seen her in so long and now everything I\u2019ve pushed away, locked away, is back. So many emotions I never wanted to feel again. When I thought we\u2019d be together, there was a life I envisioned I\u2019d have with her. I\u2019ve never thought about that life with anyone else since then. I haven\u2019t let myself\u2014I let her go and my dreams went with her.</p><p>Wrenching my mind from the past, I reenter the room and look around at everyone shooting the shit, dancing, and flirting. I look for Ivy, but Amy finds me first.</p><p>\u201cHow about a drink?\u201d she asks, unfazed as to where I\u2019ve been.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I answer and lead her to the bar\u2014I need another drink.</p><p>Soon I\u2019m leaning against the bar facing the crowd and Amy is sitting on the stool next to me. Ellie is on the other side of her, talking to Garrett.</p><p>We\u2019re talking about Lou Reed and Metallica cutting a new studio album and the buzz that the artists\u2019 collaboration is perfection, but when I glance up and see my brother and his wife walking in, I smile for the first time all day. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve missed that pain in my ass and the muse, too. I haven\u2019t seen Dahlia in a few months and I have to say River was right\u2014she looks amazing. Seeing his happiness means everything to me. Years ago I promised my grandfather I\u2019d look out for him and not let the same things that happened to our dad happen to him. I did the best I could and then I had to let him make his own decisions, and I\u2019m glad to say I think he\u2019s much happier because of it. I know my grandpa would understand, and I think he\u2019d be proud.</p><p>Amy must see me staring because she turns around on her stool. Twisting back, she\u2019s smiling too. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me Dahlia was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. With everything that happened last night, I never even thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far along is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree or four months, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got the cutest baby bump. She really makes pregnancy look good.\u201d</p><p>I have no clue about pregnant women, so I just nod my head in agreement. River sees me and heads toward the bar with what I swear is a protective shield around Dahlia. Honestly, I feel sorry for Dahlia, because his overprotectiveness will probably reach a level of insanity. Ivy crosses his path before he reaches me and I can tell she recognizes him right away. He seems to play it cool. Giving her that same look he always gave her\u2014the half smirk that seems to put girls in a frenzy, the one I used to think meant he was hot for my girl and the millions of other girls who were on the receiving end of the look. It actually wasn\u2019t until River brought Dahlia around that I figured out the look didn\u2019t mean anything. The look my brother gives his wife, the one with a full smile that brings out his dimples, is the one that matters. I realize now it\u2019s the same look I used to give Ivy. He introduces her to Dahlia, who appears to be gushing. I watch as the two ladies seem to hit it off. Ivy points to Dahlia\u2019s stomach and then Ivy is the one gushing.</p><p>\u201cSo are they both going?\u201d Amy asks, and suddenly I feel like I must have missed half of the conversation. My phone vibrates in my pocket. Pulling it out, I glance at the screen and put a finger up before I answer it. \u201cHey, Zeak, everything okay with Zane?\u201d The music is so loud I can\u2019t hear him, so I step outside. After a ten-minute phone conversation with Zeak trying to persuade me that I should postpone the tour, I finally head back inside.</p><p>The lights dim and the music gets louder as the DJ invites people to the dance floor. Making my way through the crowd, I come face-to-face with pale arched eyebrows delicately framing the most perfect feline eyes. However, their stormy blue color offers up a hint of her unease at seeing me. Only inches from me, she takes my breath away with just one look. Her normally colorless cheeks are flushed and her breathing is shallow, telling me she\u2019s affected by my presence as well. \u201cIvy,\u201d I breathe softly, almost not believing that she\u2019s right here in front of me.</p><p>She quickly diverts her gaze, looking anywhere but at me, and it doesn\u2019t take long for her pouty red lips to form a frown. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she says a little too politely as she tries to step around me. The tone of her voice is so soft, so feminine, that my body hums just from the sound alone.</p><p>I clutch her elbow, my fingers tingling from the touch of her warm skin against mine. I pull her closer to me. The feel of her body is so familiar. I whisper in her ear, \u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know me. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She stiffens the moment physical contact is made. Her breath quickens and when her eyes shoot to mine they seem to sparkle. For a moment I think their hardness is fading. But just as she opens her mouth to speak, the room brightens, the music quiets, and a voice comes over the microphone.</p> <p>\u201cHello, everyone. Thank you so much for coming tonight. For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m Damon Wolf, head of Sheep Industries,\u201d he says from the front of the room, flashing a fake smile. He\u2019s wearing an expensive suit with a tie and has swapped his sunglasses for matching glasses with clear lenses. The crowd claps as he pauses, and Ivy holds her arms up high, clapping with a pride that guts me. I scan the room and see River and Dahlia talking to Garrett. Ivy\u2019s eyes flick between the stage and the parquet floor beneath us. Her eyes go dull\u2014there\u2019s not an ounce of admiration in them as she looks at him. But when she also doesn\u2019t look back toward me, I walk away.</p><p>The announcement was just as I thought\u2014his father\u2019s company had bought Jane\u2019s label. At least, by the looks of it, her label is one company he doesn\u2019t plan to dismantle. Most of the bands it holds are solid and their dynamics seem to work the charts well together. River, Dahlia, Amy, and I leave shortly after the announcement and head to my brother\u2019s suite to discuss the tour, but there\u2019s more than just the tour on my mind. I can\u2019t wrap my head around Ivy being with Damon. Watching them function as a couple killed me. I knew they were engaged, but seeing them together is like one of my worst nightmares and just makes it all the more real. Every time I saw him touch her today it set my insides on fire\u2014it was unbearable, intolerable, and I knew that if I stayed, I was going to have to drop him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It\u2019s five eleven a.m. and before I brush my teeth or take a leak, I roll over and snag my laptop from the nightstand to read what everyone on Facebook and Twitter has to say about the band and its lead singer. Surprisingly, not much, and I\u2019m thankful. I want to wait to announce anything until after tonight. Before I close out, I search Ivy\u2019s name. Why, I don\u2019t know. She has a Twitter account but hasn\u2019t tweeted since her engagement announcement. Hmmm . . . I wonder why.</p><p>Amy wakes up and sleepily looks over at me. The computer screen\u2019s glow is the only light in the room. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, go back to sleep. I just need to send a few e-mails to Ena so she can get River and Dahlia set up for the tour.\u201d I lie because I don\u2019t want to tell her I\u2019m stalking my ex-girlfriend and because I shouldn\u2019t be thinking of Ivy when Amy is lying in bed next to me.</p><p>She rolls over and I set my laptop down and get out of bed. Once I\u2019ve done a quick workout in the hotel gym, I head back to my room and hit the shower. I turn on only the hot water and let the steam fill the bathroom. Rubbing my eyes, I lean against the cool marble and think about Ivy\u2014about how I didn\u2019t realize how much a part of my life she was and how much I have really missed her. When I\u2019m done, I head out to the living area and turn the TV on to find something mindless to watch. I\u2019m slurping down my coffee when Amy joins me.</p><p>\u201cDid they win?\u201d she asks, pointing at the replay of the Brooklyn Nets game on the screen.</p><p>I nod. \u201cNinety-eight to eighty-five over the Lakers. It sucks, but I have to say the Nets have the best music sound bites in their game, so I watch them over and over.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cOnly you would notice something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might even consider trading teams just to get one of our songs boomed over the PA as Johnson races toward the basket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? That music isn\u2019t just prerecorded crap on replay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at a Nets game, anyway. A guy named Period sits on the platform and punctuates games with amped remixes. It\u2019s like he\u2019s deejaying every game. It\u2019s genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you sold me,\u201d she says, flopping down in a chair and pouring a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for the day?\u201d I ask her. Today is pretty much a down day. I want to avoid the calls about Zane until after tonight\u2019s show, and the guys are doing their own thing during the day. We\u2019ll meet up for a short rehearsal before the show later tonight, so I\u2019m up for whatever until then.</p><p>\u201cI have to shower first. I tried to join you earlier, but the door was locked.\u201d</p><p>I blow off her comment with a partial truth. \u201cSorry, a bus habit. I didn\u2019t even realize I locked it. So, thoughts for after your shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to cut out by noon, but I wouldn\u2019t mind lounging by the pool for a few hours first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan. We\u2019ll eat some breakfast and head out there when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPancakes?\u201d she asks with a grin.</p><p>I shake my head no. That\u2019s the one food I never eat\u2014Ivy always made me pancakes. \u201cWaffles sound great,\u201d I respond.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved that she\u2019s leaving soon but feeling guilty that my mind has been consumed with Ivy. What the hell is wrong with me? I need to stop overthinking this. Amy and I have always been casual. Everything is cool between us.</p><p>After breakfast we\u2019re sitting by the pool when Ivy and Damon set up a few cabanas over. I glance at Ivy, then study her. I know I shouldn\u2019t, especially with Amy lying next to me in her skimpy green polka-dot bathing suit, but I can\u2019t help it. Ivy looks amazing in a red bikini\u2014seeing her makes my body ache. Her hair\u2019s down and falls freely around her chin, making the angles of her heart-shaped face less pronounced\u2014softer, not harder, even more beautiful. As she sits down, her head snaps in my direction. She squints and must see that I\u2019m staring. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Damon follows Ivy\u2019s glare and my eyes cut from hers to his. His expression goes dark, as he seems to recognize me. Does he know me? Or does he sense what Ivy and I have\u2014had? He sneers at her, and I swear if I could bury him with just a look I would. He sits down on her chaise longue and pulls her to him, kissing her. Tension flows through my veins until she pulls away. He moves closer, speaking with animated gestures. Her facial expression signals that she\u2019s not happy. My body goes rigid as I\u2019m forced to watch this arrogant son of a bitch\u2019s attempt to tame a girl who should never be tamed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He practically f**ks her with his eyes, and I squeeze my fists at my sides, resisting the urge to smash his face in. Ivy pulls her robe out of her bag and wraps it around herself. For some reason this helps ease my rage. Then suddenly he stands up and snatches hold of her elbow, pulling her out of the chair. I stand up as well. She snaps at him and steps back, but he grasps her shoulders. A smirk spreads across his face as he presses himself against her. The vulgarity of his actions hits me like a punch. She whispers something in his ear, and he drops his hold but doesn\u2019t surrender. He touches his fingers to her cheek and tilts her head toward him. As if to make a point, he slides his hands down and unties her robe, his gaze lazily scanning her body before shifting over to me. I know what the ass**le is doing\u2014he\u2019s demonstrating to me that she\u2019s his. He obviously feels the need to antagonize me further by running his hands down her h*ps and slipping his fingers inside her bathing suit bottom. My stomach twists. She flinches, then gathers her things and walks away. But he quickly catches up to her.</p><p>At the sight of his seemingly aggressive behavior, I have to fight the urge to go over there and sock him, but my chance is lost when they both exit the pool area. My frustration and aggravation are surpassed only by my concern. I try to hold back my rage\u2014how dare he touch her like that, look at her like that? With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I slip on my T-shirt.</p><p>Amy glances at me. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back. I\u2019m going to run up and see why my brother isn\u2019t down here yet.\u201d</p> <p>She giggles. \u201cHave fun with that.\u201d I just shake my head. I know why he\u2019s not down here, and I\u2019m not really going to his room. I promised myself that if he did this for me\u2014made the decision to help us out\u2014I\u2019d cut him some slack.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, but my anger toward that arrogant ass**le has already taken hold. She might not be mine, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything right now. I follow their path through the grotto and try to talk myself down, because I know where this is leading. With my fists balling at my sides, I can hardly control myself. When I turn the corner at a rapid pace, her stormy blue eyes slam into mine. For the briefest of moments, I stop in my tracks. My stomach lurches at the sight of what he did. There she is\u2014my angel\u2014with blood dripping from her lip and tears streaming down her face.</p><p>I rush over to her. \u201cIvy\u2014\u201d I whisper, my voice catching on her name. I take her face in my hands. Pulling my T-shirt up, I wipe the blood from her lip and blot the tears from her cheeks. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I ask finally, filling the silence of the last twelve years between us.</p><p>For a few moments she lets me take care of her\u2014like she used to. Then she blinks as if remembering that this is not then. She presses her lips together, but her scrutiny doesn\u2019t waver from me as she pushes me back. I reach to help her, but she shrugs my hand away. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help,\u201d she says forcefully. Her voice getting higher with every word, she unleashes what I can only assume to be years of pent-up anger at me. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t blink. \u201cDid he hit you? Does he hit you?\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head, sadness mingling with determination on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business. Leave it alone, Xander. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>I reach for her face, my fingers brushing her cheek. \u201cTell me the truth. Does he hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. Do you think I\u2019d be with someone who does? Men with loose fists and men who cheat\u2014they\u2019re grown from the same mold and they can both go f**k themselves.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me for the longest time and without another word she storms away\u2014cold, guarded, and angry. The girl I knew with the hard exterior, but so fragile and sensitive, appears to be gone. Now she\u2019s all hard edges, and she\u2019s pissed as hell\u2014at that ass**le, and at me.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Under the Water</p> <p>Listening to the beat, I can feel the strum of each chord in my chest, and my ears ring and my heart pounds as the green, yellow, and red fluorescent lights illuminate the stage and the darkness cascades above us. A feeling of relief takes hold of me. They\u2019re almost done\u2014they did it. My throat might be dry, and I\u2019m out of breath from yelling, but I don\u2019t care. Tonight they did it old-school and they killed it. No opening act, no fire, no smoke, no extras\u2014just the Wilde Ones onstage at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.</p><p>River\u2019s certainly not planning on jumping back into doing another nine months in the studio, but my brother is in top form right now as he sings the last song of the night. In an \u201cI\u2019m in love croon,\u201d with his six-string standing in for the synths and bludgeoning rhythms of the produced track, River gives \u201cOnce in a Lifetime\u201d all he has. His raspy, soulful tone stands out as he sings the ballad acoustic style to his wife. The unplugged version is making the fans go crazy. Cheers and yells come from behind me and I feel like I\u2019m part of the audience tonight.</p><p>I\u2019m not backstage like I usually am. Instead I\u2019m standing with Dahlia in the VIP section. She and River are staring straight at each other. Their connection seems to be pulling out all he has. And I have to say, her good mood has definitely rubbed off on me. Despite the events of the last two days, I\u2019m having the best time I\u2019ve had since the tour began. It\u2019s just her and me and a select dozen or so other people in the roped-off orchestra section, and it\u2019s been a blast. My cousin Jagger and his girl, Aerie, are here somewhere. Jagger arrived in town after I hit the road, so I never got to catch up with him. But I\u2019ve talked to him on the phone a number of times and finally got to meet him before the show. So strange having a cousin you\u2019ve never met, but when you live so many miles apart for most of your lives, I guess it happens. Jagger and Aerie together, though\u2014that still makes me laugh. She\u2019s so uptight and he, well, I don\u2019t know him that well, but I\u2019d say he\u2019s anything but. He seems to be a lot like River. I invited them to join us up here, but Aerie was in full-on work mode and wanted to be out in the crowd, interviewing people. She said she\u2019d catch up with us after the show. Unfortunately, my mother and stepfather, Jack, are in Paris, so they couldn\u2019t be here. And my sister, Bell, had to work. She just recently started her own event-planning business in addition to keeping her day job, so catching up with her lately has been hard. But she seems to have found her place in this world. She\u2019s happier and more put together.</p><p>Dahlia nudges me. \u201cHey, you watching? You seem someplace else.\u201d</p><p>The show ends with crazed fans screaming at the top of their lungs for an encore. \u201cMore! We want more! Give us more!\u201d</p><p>I give her a look as if to say, \u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d but her attention is riveted on the stage again at the sound of my brother\u2019s voice. River smiles at the crowd and catches us in his vision as he slips the microphone out of the stand. \u201cMore? You want more?\u201d</p><p>Their response comes in unison. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He hits the edge of the stage and drags his fingertips along Dahlia\u2019s outstretched hands. \u201cI think we can do that.\u201d He finds the microphone stand again and clips it in place.</p> <p>Dahlia leans over to me. \u201cI really have to use the restroom. I don\u2019t think I can wait.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and nod my head. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll take you backstage now.\u201d It\u2019s my job to be her personal bodyguard tonight, and actually I don\u2019t mind it. It obviously puts my brother at ease, and my sister-in-law and I get along really well now, after a bumpy start. Turns out she is exactly four months pregnant. She and River have decided not to find out the sex of the baby, but she showed me an ultrasound picture and the baby was sucking his thumb. I have to believe it\u2019s a boy, for River\u2019s sake, because another girl in his life to watch over just might push him over the edge. The thought makes me laugh, though.</p><p>I\u2019m standing at the perimeter of the stage, watching the end of the spectacular show, when I feel a tap on my shoulder and an unfamiliar voice asks, \u201cAre you Xander?\u201d</p><p>Without turning around, I give a cursory nod, not sure why she\u2019s asking until she says, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman in the bathroom who has asked me to tell you to get her husband and come right away.\u201d</p><p>I whirl around and see the woman in uniform. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say. I\u2019m sorry. I have to get back to work.\u201d The woman then turns and walks away, pushing her cleaning cart in front of her as she goes.</p><p>I look out onstage and River glances over, looking for Dahlia, I\u2019m sure. I slice my finger across my neck, giving him the \u201ccut it now\u201d signal, and his smile instantly fades. His panicked voice trembles over the mic.</p><p>\u201cThanks, everyone!\u201d He darts toward me. His eyes search mine on the way, but I don\u2019t wait for him to cross the stage.</p><p>Heading toward the bathroom, I knock and open the door. \u201cDahlia?\u201d</p><p>River pushes past me into the long rectangular room. \u201cDahlia, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she cries as she swings one of the stall doors open. He rushes in and disappears behind it.</p><p>\u201cXander, call nine-one-one,\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I need an ambulance. It seems to have stopped. Let\u2019s call my doctor first,\u201d Dahlia nervously tells River.</p><p>His breath coming fast and hard, he does as she asks. I can\u2019t quite make out what he\u2019s saying because the toilet is flushing over and over. My pulse pounds louder than the sound of the running water as I wait to see what the hell is the matter. When I see his feet moving, I yell, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s fumbling behind the door, and then it opens and he carries her out. In a shaky voice he says, \u201cWe need to take her to the hospital. She\u2019s bleeding. Take my keys and get the car.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in the family care area waiting to hear how Dahlia and the baby are doing. My thoughts are drifting to seeing Ivy after so many years and how things could have been so different. When you believe a lie for so long . . . does it become the truth?</p><p>Behind my closed lids flashes a memory from twelve years ago. Looking back on it now, I think we were more like adults and less like sex-crazed teenagers. We had crossed the line from lust to love, from adolescent to adult. When we left my grandparents\u2019 place that last day we spent there before graduation, the fractured afternoon light peeked through the clouds and I drove her home. I pulled over a good distance from where she lived. Dropping her off on the corner was something I really hated. But I understood. I had my own home issues, so who was I to talk? I\u2019d had to bring my brother home and pick up my sister every day since my mother went back to work because my drunk of a dad couldn\u2019t get a job. I couldn\u2019t wait for the fall when Ivy and I would head to the University of Chicago together. Ivy got a free ride, my grandparents were paying for me, and we both got to get the hell out of LA.</p><p>As soon as I put the car in PARK, she bolted out. She didn\u2019t even wait for me to open her door, which was a habit she knew I really hated, but I didn\u2019t say anything. She leaned against the large black stripe of the hood as I approached her. Some kids were sitting on their stoops playing games, others were yelling and screaming, but I blocked all of that out as I caged her with my arms on either side of her and rested my forehead against hers. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to meet you after school again at all the rest of the week. Tomorrow I have to pick up my cap and gown, Thursday is graduation rehearsal, and Friday is some kind of senior dinner.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around my neck. \u201cI know you\u2019re busy. I can\u2019t believe our ceremonies are both on Saturday. At least my mom said I could go to dinner with you and your family after graduation.\u201d</p><p>Leaning into her, I circled my arms around her waist and kissed her lightly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be our last day together before our summer trips, so I\u2019ll pick you up as early as possible. Make sure your mom thinks you\u2019re sleeping at Jody\u2019s house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kissed me and I leaned back to look at her. Her blond hair fell past her shoulders and she was smiling shyly at me. \u201cIt\u2019s already arranged,\u201d she said, flushing. A nervousness that I\u2019d seen many times presented itself in her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, gorgeous?\u201d</p><p>She broke away and in the quietest voice said, \u201cI\u2019m really going to miss you this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, too. But, hey, we talked about this. It won\u2019t be that long. The summer will be over before you know it and then we\u2019ll be together.\u201d I hugged her tightly, reassuring her.</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re right,\u201d she whispered, and the sadness in her eyes broke my heart.</p><p>I had tried my best to get my mother to cancel or at least shorten my trip to my aunt\u2019s. Since she called it my graduation present, I really thought I should have gotten to choose if I wanted to go or at least for how long. She hadn\u2019t said I couldn\u2019t, but she hadn\u2019t said I could, either. I knew I would continue to work on her.</p><p>I kissed Ivy one last time and trapped her fingers in mine before she twisted away and broke the connection. She walked backward for a beat, then turned around and sashayed down the sidewalk toward her apartment building.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tonight, sexy thing,\u201d I yelled to her.</p><p>She turned, gave me one last heart-stopping smile, and blew me a kiss. She wouldn\u2019t even let me walk her to her apartment building because she was afraid her mother would see her with me when she was supposed to be studying. So I waited on the corner until she reached her door. As soon as she did, she came rushing back. She threw her arms around my neck and whispered in my ear, \u201cI hope you can call me because if you can I\u2019ll practice what we\u2019ve talked about.\u201d</p> <p>I stepped back and looked at her with what I knew was a sly, wicked grin. She was flushed on every exposed body part. \u201cReally . . . ?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she mouthed, her cheeks changing color from pink to red with that one unspoken word.</p><p>\u201cChrist, just you saying it is so f**king hot.\u201d</p><p>She kissed me, softly at first, then harder. \u201cYou better get out of here or you\u2019re going to be late,\u201d she said, and just as quickly as she had turned and come back to me, she was gone. Once she disappeared through the doorway, I got in my car and grinned for the longest time. Finally, I drove away and headed back to school to pick up River. I had to drop him off before picking up my sister, since my car didn\u2019t have a backseat. I was late, and I already assumed I\u2019d probably catch shit for it. As we walked into the house, I knew immediately something was wrong\u2014Bell\u2019s backpack and shoes were in the foyer. She was already home.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I can\u2019t do it,\u201d a small voice cried from the landing\u2014it was Bell.</p> <p>I began ascending the stairs. \u201cStay here,\u201d I called over my shoulder to my brother.</p><p>I stayed silent as the wooden stairs beneath me squeaked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say you can\u2019t. You can. You\u2019re just not playing the right chords. Do it again,\u201d my father said.</p><p>I bolted up the remaining stairs two at a time to the wide-open loft that acted as his music studio. Bell was sobbing and her fingers were bleeding. They were f**king bleeding. Seeing my little sister sitting there on a stool while my shaggy-haired, unshaven, drunken father barked orders at her triggered a rage I\u2019d never felt before. I couldn\u2019t take another minute of his drunken insanity\u2014he wasn\u2019t only ruining his own life, he was tearing ours apart.</p><p>He gave me a passing glance as he pointed to the chord he wanted my sister to strum. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you doing?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cTeaching your sister how to play correctly.\u201d</p><p>My jaw clenched tightly. \u201cThe hell you are. Bell, go downstairs with River.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at me, sobbing.</p><p>\u201cNo, Bell. Stay here,\u201d he ordered, glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cGo. Now!\u201d I yelled to her as River came racing up the stairs. \u201cTake her now and get her out of here,\u201d I told him.</p><p>My hands were shaking as I took another step toward my father. It was strange, because he looked at me with vacant eyes, but I could have sworn I saw a flicker of fear in them. I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that I couldn\u2019t explain. It made its way through me as an urge to kill him. I lunged at him. He went flying backward and hit his head against the wall. A few of his framed Sound Music Magazine covers came crashing down. He scooted away from me, but my fists moved toward him in a hard, thrusting motion. He didn\u2019t duck, he didn\u2019t move. Hit after hit, my father just took it.</p><p>\u201cI hate you! You\u2019re a worthless excuse of a man!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he cried. \u201cI tried, I did. I tried to protect you all. But now with Damon Wolf, he . . .\u201d The rest of his response was incoherent. I had no idea what the pathetic man in front of me was trying to say.</p><p>\u201cXander, stop it!\u201d my mother screamed. She wrapped her arms around my waist and pulled me back.</p><p>She leaned down to him but looked toward me. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What happened?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened and took a deep breath, but he blurted out what had happened himself. Through his incoherent mumblings, he finally managed to make my mother see him for the worthless piece of shit he really was.</p><p>Without tears, she stood tall and told my father, her husband, the almost famous Nick Wilde, that it was time for him to leave.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even plead for forgiveness. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just stood and weaved down the stairs with his head down\u2014a drunken mess. My mother pulled me to the kitchen and put ice on my hand. She finally broke down and cried. She asked me questions I couldn\u2019t answer because my mind was jumbled with all kinds of thoughts\u2014good, bad, love, but mostly hate.</p><p>Then out of nowhere an earsplitting bang rang through the air for a good thirty seconds. I knew immediately what it was. Running to the bedroom, I saw him lying unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood with his gun next to him. The sight filled me with as much rage as sorrow. He was dead\u2014I knew he was. I could hear my mother\u2019s shoes in the hallway and I ran over to the door, slamming it closed and locking it.</p><p>\u201cCall nine-one-one now!\u201d I screamed to her.</p><p>She beat on the door, tormented screams coming from her mouth. I heard River\u2019s voice in the background and yelled to him to make the call and to call Grandpa too. I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014I couldn\u2019t let her see him like that. I scrambled to pull a sheet off the bed and that\u2019s when I saw it\u2014his suicide note.</p><p>It read, \u201cI love you all. Boys, take care of Mom and Bell and don\u2019t ever settle for not being at the top, because I know you can do what I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As I covered him, both pain and contempt rushed through me. I slid down the wall and cradled my head in my hands. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d I sat there with him for what felt like forever, blocking out my mother\u2019s cries. When the fire department arrived, I was forced to unlock the door. The police and the coroner arrived at different times, asking the same questions, making us tell the story over and over again. The medics gave my mother something to calm her hysterics. My grandfather showed up and, even grief-stricken, he took charge. He always did; that was who he was\u2014a man in control. He made my brother go back to the neighbors\u2019 to stay with Bell until my grandmother got there to take them to their house. He talked to the police, the coroner, made a million other calls, and then finally he took my mother and me back to his house.</p><p>The next few days passed in a blur\u2014the arrangements, the wake, the funeral. River, Bell, and I didn\u2019t finish the last few days of the school year. I skipped graduation, much to my mother\u2019s and grandparents\u2019 dismay. But the funeral was the day before, and I couldn\u2019t face anybody or even attempt to act normal. I was too broken. We were all broken\u2014even my strong grandparents.</p><p>I remember the last night I talked to Ivy. The conversation was short. She wanted to see me, but I said no. I couldn\u2019t do anything but think about what I\u2019d done, what I\u2019d caused. She begged to come see me, but I said no. She\u2019d offered to take her mother\u2019s car once her mother fell asleep, but again, I said no. She didn\u2019t need to piss that witch off. I couldn\u2019t deal with that shit. As it was, my \u201cI\u201d trip to Paris became a \u201cWe\u201d trip to Paris\u2014the family was going. So because I couldn\u2019t pull myself out of my own sorrow, Ivy and I said goodbye over the phone, and her sadness ripped me apart.</p><p>I look up at the dim lights through the window in the grim waiting room, and a shiver sweeps through me as I remember how it happened. Our summer trips were both over and it was the night we had planned to meet again. I hadn\u2019t yet told her I wasn\u2019t going to the University of Chicago with her, and I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it. I couldn\u2019t go that far\u2014I couldn\u2019t leave my family when they needed me most. But it never mattered anyway, because instead of being the night we reunited, it was the night we ended. We never formally broke up. We were just no longer together. I loved her, and that was it\u2014I loved her enough to do what was best for her. So even though we were a part of each other, when I got the opportunity to set her free\u2014I did.</p><p>My eyes fly open when the overhead lights come on and pull me out of my own darkness. The only person who knows the truth is standing in the doorway of the waiting room. To everyone else I was a cheater, but I didn\u2019t care what people thought because leaving LA made her who she is today\u2014I know it without a doubt. Standing up, I approach my brother. He looks exhausted. Clapping my hand on his shoulder, I ask, \u201cIs she okay?\u201d I want to ask if the baby is okay as well, but I\u2019m afraid.</p><p>\u201cDahlia and the baby are fine.\u201d The relief in his expression can\u2019t be denied, but his voice is strained.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cShe has something called placenta previa.\u201d</p><p>I give him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cIt means her placenta is lying unusually low in her uterus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said Dahlia and the baby are okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are for now. The doctor did an ultrasound and said the friction of the two organs being so close is what caused the bleeding. There is a chance as the pregnancy progresses the uterus will lift and there won\u2019t be any more bleeding, but there is also a chance it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I can see his throat working to fight back his fear. \u201cRiver, plain English, please.\u201d</p><p>He clasps both his hands around his neck. \u201cThe doctor advises that she take it easy. Avoid activities that might provoke any more bleeding.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes assess my reaction. He nods and I do the same. Both understanding what this means . . . he won\u2019t be going on tour. I pull him to me and hug him\u2014something I can\u2019t remember doing since our father\u2019s funeral. \u201cYou do what you have to do. I understand.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Just Beneath the Surface</p><p>The moon hasn\u2019t quite disappeared, but the sun hasn\u2019t yet risen\u2014it\u2019s dawn and the streetlights are still on. I exit the cab with my bag in hand and climb the steps lit by the faint glow from the road to my condo in Beverly Hills. A car drives by, tossing the newspaper in the driveway, and I just leave it\u2014I\u2019ll catch up later. I stayed at the hospital all night with my brother, and now I\u2019m contemplating the phone calls I\u2019ll have to make later today. I\u2019ve been taking risks, learning things, and making new relationships since I started to manage the Wilde Ones. But this\u2014being left without a lead singer in the middle of a tour isn\u2019t an evolution, it\u2019s a regression, a detriment . . . it\u2019s the end.</p><p>Once I shower, I sit down and think about how I\u2019m going to tell the guys. It makes me sick to think about it, but it has to be done. They aren\u2019t going to take it well, but I know I can\u2019t put it off. Announcements have to be made so shows can be canceled and money refunded. Time seems to creep by before I finally decide to pick up my phone. I call Garrett and then Nix and tell them both to meet me at my place. I know they\u2019re not going to be happy, but at this point there are no other options. Garrett arrives around four with a six-pack in one hand and a new flick in the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not date night,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d he snorts. \u201cI just thought you could use the company. You sounded like shit on the phone. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I slap his back. \u201cWe need to talk about existentialism.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head in confusion, but I\u2019m saved from explaining when Nix walks in right behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the emergency meeting?\u201d Nix asks.</p><p>\u201cHow about a drink?\u201d I ask and motion for them to have a seat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIs it that bad that beer isn\u2019t strong enough?\u201d Garrett questions, holding up the six-pack that he brought in.</p><p>These guys have been my brother\u2019s friends for longer than I can remember. Actually, although I\u2019ve never admitted it, they\u2019re my friends too, and what I\u2019m about to do is the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to do in a really long time.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dahlia?\u201d Nix asks.</p> <p>Walking over to the bar, I say over my shoulder, \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay . . . but she can\u2019t travel.\u201d</p><p>Pouring whiskey into three tumblers, I turn around. Nix\u2019s and Garrett\u2019s jaws are on the ground, and it\u2019s clear they know what that means. I hand them each a glass of whiskey and toss mine back. \u201cRemember when Brian Chase accidentally hit himself in the nose and blood squirted out everywhere?\u201d</p><p>Nix\u2019s eyes narrow and Garrett just knocks his drink back, moving around me and stepping up to the bar.</p><p>I go on. \u201cThe more he bled, the harder he drummed, and the harder he drummed, the more he bled.\u201d</p><p>They both nod, confused about my reason for telling them this, I\u2019m sure. I continue. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about our band. We keep going and going, but I really feel there\u2019s a time for the bleeding to stop and I think it\u2019s now. No more Band-Aids to stop the wounds from oozing.\u201d</p><p>Nix clears his throat. \u201cI disagree. I think we could take a different approach.\u201d</p> <p>I peg him with my stare and wonder where he\u2019s going with this. Garrett sits down and I do the same as Nix keeps talking. \u201cDo you remember the first time you heard Neil Young sing and you were like, \u2018Really? This guy is popular?\u2019\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cYes. What\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. It means anything can happen when you don\u2019t expect it,\u201d Garrett interprets for me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask them.</p><p>Garrett looks at me a little warily. \u201cWell, someone stopped by last night after you took Dahlia to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Garrett speaks up. \u201cIvy Taylor. She wants in.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and slam my drink down on the bar. My lungs constrict and I have to raise my arms and cradle my head to breathe. Twisting my body, I mindlessly circle the room until I can finally speak. \u201cNo f**king way,\u201d I yell at them.</p> <p>\u201cXander, you and her happened a long time ago. Don\u2019t let your history with her cloud your judgment,\u201d Nix says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying no because of our history,\u201d I reply with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Garrett asks.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, she doesn\u2019t even sing in the same genre as the band.\u201d</p><p>Nix rolls his eyes. \u201cCome on, Xander, you know her. She\u2019ll be able to sing our songs without a problem. For Christ\u2019s sake, you played with her for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she can, she\u2019s managed by that prick, and I\u2019m not f**king working with him,\u201d I tell him very matter-of-factly. I want to be close to her in the worst way, but not when she\u2019s with somebody else\u2014that\u2019s something I would never be able to stand.</p><p>\u201cShe says she won\u2019t be for long. She\u2019s trying to terminate their business relationship,\u201d Garrett says.</p><p>I stop pacing.</p><p>\u201cHow much sweeter could this be? We\u2019ve all known each other since high school, and we\u2019re all in it for the music,\u201d Nix says, trying to persuade me.</p><p>\u201cXander, come on. We\u2019re flirting with disaster, and she pops in as our saving grace. People would follow her into a fire, and she came looking for us,\u201d Garrett declares, and I stand there waiting for the punch line, but there isn\u2019t one.</p><p>\u201cEllie agrees. She says she\u2019ll talk to the label and she thinks they\u2019ll be fine with it,\u201d Nix tells me.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ellie doesn\u2019t manage the band,\u201d I respond, running my hands through my hair.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s not just your band,\u201d Garrett says, a little shakily.</p><p>My head snaps up and I know my eyes are focused and clear. I take a deep breath. \u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie or Ivy?\u201d Garrett asks.</p><p>\u201cIvy,\u201d I bark.</p><p>\u201cTo come over and talk to you with us.\u201d His face is determined. It\u2019s a look that says it all. They\u2019ve already made the decision.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d My voice wavers with uncertainty, but before I can put my issues on the table, the doorbell rings. My eyes flash to his and the pounding in my ears drowns out the sound of the bell. Walking across the dark hardwood floor in my bare feet, I take a deep breath and keep my face blank. Of course I want to see her. Fuck, I want to be with her. But she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me, even though apparently she wants something to do with my band.</p><p>When I open the door, there she stands\u2014and she\u2019s absolutely gorgeous. I tuck my hands in my pockets to control my nerves. Her beauty is only accentuated by the sunlight. Her hair is silky, her skin seems to gleam, and the sapphire earrings that my grandmother gave her follow the angular lines of her jaw . . . I can\u2019t believe she still wears them. But it\u2019s her eyes that capture me. They look darker, fiercer, more expressive, and they are focused on me. I can\u2019t help but take her all in.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say, ushering in her inside.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says back softly, with a forced smile.</p><p>She\u2019s biting her bottom lip and if I could have her right here, I would. Thoughts of her being mine race through my head. With her proximity, it\u2019s hard not to regret having hurt her.</p><p>She stands in the entryway and looks around. \u201cNice place.\u201d</p><p>I grin at her. \u201cThanks.\u201d I wonder if she knows this condo was my grandparents\u2019\u2014the place they moved to when they left the house where we spent so many days and nights. This place is much smaller than their house\u2014just two bedrooms. But it works for me. I hired a decorator who made a few minor changes when I moved in, but not much. Just enough to toughen it up.</p><p>\u201cAre Garrett and Nix here yet?\u201d</p><p>My eyes lock on hers. \u201cAs a matter of fact\u2014they are.\u201d</p><p>I motion toward the living area. \u201cIn there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, before we go in, I just want to say thanks for yesterday, and I\u2019m sorry for being so rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy . . .\u201d Then I stop myself from blurting out the truth about the past. This isn\u2019t the time or the place. \u201cI was just concerned about you. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really, I can take care of myself.\u201d She walks ahead of me before I can say anything else.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ivy,\u201d Garrett says, almost like he has a schoolboy crush on her.</p><p>\u201cIvy.\u201d Nix nods.</p><p>She fidgets. \u201cHey. Thanks for inviting me. So, have you guys talked to Xander about my suggestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just discussing it.\u201d I\u2019m trying to ignore how good her legs look in denim shorts.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd my attorney confirmed that although my contract with Damon prohibits me from making any deals on my own, it does allow me to collaborate with other artists\u2014he says it\u2019s a loophole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Garrett says, pumping his fist in the air.</p><p>\u201cIvy, not that I don\u2019t appreciate the offer. But what does your fianc\u00e9 say about all this?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Nix clears his throat. \u201cHey, Xander, we didn\u2019t get to that part of the news yet, but she broke it off with him.\u201d</p><p>Ivy\u2019s eyes collide with mine. For a moment I wonder if she\u2019s doing this for us, but only for a moment, because I have to quickly look away from the hate I see in her face. \u201cDamon aside, why would you want to \u2018collaborate\u2019 with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want back in the music industry and I can\u2019t do it on my own right now. Garrett and Nix told me River wasn\u2019t exactly keen on hitting the road, so I wondered how you\u2019d feel about having the two of us? I could stay on the road full-time and he could pull off whenever he needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few things have changed,\u201d Garrett says. \u201cRiver won\u2019t be joining us after all. Dahlia has a complication and can\u2019t go on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, it looks like the situations we both find ourselves in seem to be a win/win. It\u2019s a simple case of I help you, you help me,\u201d she responds.</p><p>The room goes silent while I study her. It sounds like a business deal between two strangers, but we are far from that. Or are we? I bow my head, not sure what to say other than yes, because I sure as hell want her. \u201cOkay, so if we do this, what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe start rehearsing. We have time to nail most of the tour songs before we have to hit the road again,\u201d Nix says to all of us, and I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s trying to persuade himself or me.</p><p>\u201cI can meet you in the studio with Leif as early as tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>We all turn our heads her way, but Nix is first to question her. \u201cLeif? Who\u2019s Leif?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeif Morgan. He\u2019s been with me from the start. He plays keyboard and bass,\u201d she says softly, then adds, \u201cAnd he travels with me. If you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>I nod and Nix and Garrett tuck their apprehension aside. There is nothing diva-like in her request. I know she\u2019ll mix with us well. She\u2019s the same girl she always was.</p><p>\u201cWe have ten days. It\u2019s a piece of cake,\u201d Garrett says confidently.</p><p>Her eyes find mine. \u201cLook, Xander, we can give it a shot. If it doesn\u2019t work out, what are either of us out?\u201d</p><p>What can I say? She\u2019s right\u2014we have nothing to lose and everything to gain. We spend the next hour mapping out a strategy and discussing playlists. Changing from a male to a female lead means some minor lyrics changes. We decide I\u2019ll go through those songs while the band rehearses the others.</p><p>\u201cAnyone hungry?\u201d Garrett asks.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind something to eat,\u201d Nix chimes in.</p><p>\u201cI could throw together my famous Enchilada Bake,\u201d Garrett says enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had it before\u2014a can of black beans, a jar of enchilada sauce, and a tube of biscuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we order pizza?\u201d I counter and look over at Ivy. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I actually have to get going. Logan\u2019s in town for the night and I told him I\u2019d meet him for dinner, but I\u2019ll see you all tomorrow. And thanks again.\u201d She walks over to Nix and Garrett and hugs each of them in turn.</p><p>She turns toward me and pauses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d Standing near the entryway, I wait for her. She walks nervously my way. When she reaches me I automatically press my hand to the small of her back to guide her to the front door. When I realize where my hand is, I pull away, but I swear I see her shiver.</p><p>She reaches for the doorknob and my hand covers hers. I leave it there as I ask, \u201cLogan\u2014he joined the service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s a marine. He joined up right after high school, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . I thought he was going to Washington State?\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me. \u201cHe was, but his parents divorced and money was an issue, so he decided to enlist. He\u2019s a sergeant now and stationed at Fort Bragg. He has a wife and three kids. He\u2019s really happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Tell him I said hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She smiles that forced smile at me that I hate and I step just a little closer. My body burns with a need to see the real one, and I allow the fire to consume me. In a moment of weakness, I pull her snug to me. Her breath heats my skin and with my lips just barely brushing hers, I ask, \u201cIvy, are you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>Silence hangs between us until she boldly steps back. Her voice is low and raspy, but her eyes are clear, focused, and still on mine. Her intentions are not the least bit questionable as she answers, \u201cYes. I\u2019m sure. The past is the past, Xander. Let\u2019s leave it there. We can move forward and do this.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her, trying to read her for a different sign, but it\u2019s not there, so I decide to do as she asks\u2014leave the past behind. When her eyes break away from mine, she again reaches for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d I say, motioning toward the door with my hand as she moves hers away. I pull the door open and she walks out.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Xander,\u201d she calls and looks back at me. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Ivy,\u201d I respond and with a strong sigh I close the door\u2014frustrated, confused, and maybe just a little optimistic.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>My face is flecked with two-day-old stubble and my thick brown hair is a mess. I slept like shit. I have a lot on my mind and I had a hard time getting started this morning . . . Maybe I was just procrastinating while trying to figure everything out. There\u2019s a battle going on in my head\u2014Why is she really doing this? I understand she has limitations due to her contract but is there more to it? Did she feel what I felt the minute I saw her again\u2014that what we had so long ago was still there? She could have joined up with any band, so why this one? Did she do it for me? Because I\u2019m not sure I buy the win/win explanation.</p><p>Blinking the sunshine out of my eyes, I\u2019m still trying to sort my thoughts as I walk through the doors of Tyler Records. We\u2019ve come and gone in and out of the glass-and-steel building for years. Actually, ever since my mother started seeing Jack, he\u2019s let us use the studio whenever we needed. My stepfather has been a huge asset to us, with his keen knowledge of the business and his unwavering willingness to help.</p><p>The band is so deep into rehearsing a song from our first album, they don\u2019t even notice me as I quietly slip into the live room. I stand off to the side and check out the scene\u2014Nix has a Fender strapped around him, Ivy is at the microphone singing \u201cI\u2019ll Find You\u201d with unbelievable depth, Garrett\u2019s at the drums, but the cymbals sound a little washy next to the electric keyboard. And at the board stands a tall guy with a spray of freckles across his nose and dirty-blond hair that I can only assume to be Leif Morgan. He\u2019s wearing a pink button-down, and his wavy hair looks somewhat controlled by a slew of hair products, no doubt. I had pictured someone completely different\u2014older, more fatherly, not a guy that looked like he modeled for Abercrombie and Fitch. Why, I\u2019m not sure, but I think it was because of the fondness I saw in Ivy\u2019s eyes when she said his name.</p><p>I listen for a moment and I\u2019m immediately impressed\u2014his playing is spot-on. We just need to work on getting everyone in the same scale. All in all, not bad for the first time they\u2019ve all come together. Shadows from behind the glass pique my curiosity. No one was supposed to be here today. I stride toward the front of the studio, and the sound engineer waves me into the control room. The heavily equipped space is state-of-the-art, including the latest digital audio workstations. I glance at Phil. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He presses the speaker button. \u201cHang on, guys. Give me a minute,\u201d he tells the band.</p><p>Ivy rocks back and forth, smiling at him and unleashing her soft laugh before she stops singing and replies, \u201cNo problem. We\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t stop myself from turning at the sound of her low, creamy voice through the intercom. Her profile is nothing short of perfection. She sets her guitar down, and when she lifts her head our eyes collide. For the briefest of moments I think I feel the stirring of her heart in mine. She blinks and gives me an obligatory nod before shifting her gaze. I do the same, but my nod is slow, wistful, wanting, and I don\u2019t look away. I watch as she studies the music sheets in front of her. Her deep blue eyes practically dart with enthusiasm as she points to the papers on the stand and starts explaining something to the guys. She glances quickly at me again and notices my stare. But she immediately averts her gaze and continues with her conversation, tapping her leg to her own beat. She looks beautiful\u2014every curve of her body is visible. She\u2019s wearing fitted jeans that hug her narrow h*ps and a tank top that clings to her perky tits. She is perfect.</p><p>Phil extends his hand as I approach him. \u201cHey, man, good to see you.\u201d Phil is the kind of guy who punctuates every sentence with man.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a friendly thump on the back and with a broad grin he leads me over to his desk.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just in here for rehearsal time,\u201d I let him know because I see him slithering into recording mode.</p><p>\u201cI know, man. But I couldn\u2019t help but listen in. I think we should record a track and remix Ivy\u2019s voice in with River\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad for your enthusiasm, Phil, but we\u2019re not ready for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, man, you have to hear this. I\u2019ve already played around with it. Just listen.\u201d</p> <p>He pulls up a sound bite on his computer and hits PLAY. Her voice surrounds me, followed by River\u2019s, and I have to tell him, \u201cIt sounds f**king amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, man, I told you. Imagine what it will sound like if we pop that sweet tart in an isolation booth.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath and hold it to keep myself from pounding a guy who\u2019s always been a friend. Letting it out, I slide my eyes toward her. \u201cHer name is Ivy, man.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYeah, man, I know her name. I just like the sound of the words pop and sweet tart mixed together with isolation booth, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashes through me as I shoot fire at him with my eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t talk like that. It might get you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I was only kidding around,\u201d he says, with concern ringing clear in his voice.</p><p>I turn to leave the room, throwing over my shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on the remix.\u201d</p><p>Garrett pounces on me when I push on the large steel bar across the heavy door to exit the studio through the rear. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I gesture down the hall toward the alley. \u201cI need to get some air. I have a f**king headache and the air in the studio is stifling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about an aspirin?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I just needed some fresh air. And what\u2019s with the fifty questions?\u201d</p><p>He eyes me. \u201cYour past with her isn\u2019t going to be an issue, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Garrett. I\u2019m just beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to talk about it, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hands up. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone, but how about we grab some dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>He turns around and walks back toward the studio. I keep going and open the last door leading me outside. The sun shines bright and the sound of the music fades as I take the three steps to the sidewalk, where I can finally breathe. Blurry from exhaustion and hungover from too much booze, I give in and stumble backward. Sitting on the bottom step, I cradle my head in my hands and pray I can do this\u2014that I can handle being around her every day and still do my job.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>What If</p><p>Ivy</p><p>Music has always been my everything. But when I was young, it really was all I had\u2014it was my shoulder to cry on, my confidant, my best friend. I was an outcast in school because I kept to myself. I was always writing lyrics, and the other kids didn\u2019t know what to make of me, so they made fun of me instead. I didn\u2019t really care. I didn\u2019t have time for friends. My mother kept me busy. She wanted me to be an actress and she made me go on audition after audition. I hated the thought of pretending to be someone else in front of a camera. I hated the thought of acting, period. That wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do. I just wanted to share my music with others. But my mom saw it differently. We had very little money and she worked two jobs and odd hours to make ends meet. She thought if I acted we\u2019d be secure. So if I wasn\u2019t running lines for a part I didn\u2019t want, I was going on auditions. I\u2019d gotten a few parts here and there, but nothing permanent. I was also responsible for taking care of my younger sisters. So, like I said\u2014I had no time for friends.</p><p>Then I met him\u2014he got me, understood me, accepted me, guided me, showed me who I could be. Before I knew it, music and Xander Wilde\u2014they became my world and stayed that way all the way through high school. I loved him. He was everything I didn\u2019t know I wanted and everything I needed. But my world turned upside down the day he betrayed what we were, what we had. I was shocked, surprised, and heartbroken, but somehow I think I always knew I wasn\u2019t enough for him. After that I left LA and never looked back. I couldn\u2019t be what he needed, so I never sought him out again. And why would I, anyway? All I felt toward him was hatred. I locked him away in my mind and tried so hard to never think about him. Now, without warning, he\u2019s come back into my life, and my world feels like it\u2019s been turned upside down.</p><p>A shiver ran through me and somehow I knew he was there\u2014it was the strangest thing. I felt his stare and when I looked up into those eyes blazing with an intensity I once knew so well, they were boring into me. I felt a sharp jab of pain for what we had shared as the eyes of the boy I once loved quickly morphed into the eyes of the man I hated. The eyes I spent years looking into\u2014the ones that sometimes look green but if you study them long enough you\u2019ll see their hypnotic flecks of brown.</p><p>He was the same, but different in a few ways. His startling hazel eyes, his tousled brown hair, sharp jawline, and strong, lean frame hadn\u2019t changed that much. He was so good-looking\u2014not in a pretty or adorable way, but more in a rugged, handsome way. But he looks harder, even more closed off now. Then again, I\u2019m sure I do too. Staring at him across the pool, I got lost in my thoughts. He was a boy no girl could ever forget. My mind filled with all the things I\u2019d missed about him\u2014our conversations, his protectiveness, his cocky grin, his charm, the way he said \u201cfuck\u201d just because. So many things I didn\u2019t want to remember, but they were all right here in front of me.</p><p>I never looked back and wondered if I made the right decision. Even now I know leaving Xander is something I shouldn\u2019t be questioning. But the moment our eyes connected at the pool, all the hate I had been carrying around for years dissipated instantly. It scared me. How could just one look erase the bad memory and replace it with all the good ones? He was giving me the same look he used to give me when I\u2019d cross the school grounds and spot him waiting for me\u2014with his smile so genuine that his eyes lit up. It was the look that told me how much he loved me. I only stifled the need to run to him by remembering my fianc\u00e9 was by my side.</p><p>Confusion tangled deep within me, but I couldn\u2019t resist setting my sights on him again. A hint of a smile crossed my lips. God, he was magnificent\u2014broad shoulders, lean waist, toned arms. It might sound clich\u00e9d, but even when we were both fourteen and I noticed him for the first time I thought he was tall, dark, and handsome. And I couldn\u2019t help but fall for him. With his first grin in my direction\u2014I melted. When he first played his guitar for me\u2014he scored my mind. When he first kissed me\u2014he stole my heart. And when he cheated on me\u2014he took a piece of my soul. I was broken. His love broke me, and music was my only refuge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I reminded myself that I hated him. I had once trusted him, confided in him, given him what I\u2019d given nobody, and he stomped on us like we were nothing. I thought I was over him\u2014I\u2019d moved on long ago. But seeing him just brought it all back. The feelings I had for him were still there in my heart. I realized it the instant his stare reverberated through me and butterflies fluttered in my stomach. But I pushed those feelings aside\u2014hate felt better than love, especially when I saw who the girl was that was standing next to him with her fingers in his hair. A wave of jealousy swept through me\u2014I wanted to be the one running my fingers through his hair.</p><p>But seeing him was like a sign I didn\u2019t know I was waiting for. I finally knew it was time to break off my engagement to Damon. It had been time for a while\u2014in fact, I never should have gotten engaged to him. The man I was going to marry was not the man I wanted to marry\u2014that man was standing across the pool.</p><p>But breaking my engagement wasn\u2019t because of Xander\u2014I had decided to do it before I saw him. The simple truth was Damon and I were never right for each other. I loved him in my own way. He had nurtured my talent and helped me with my career. I had trusted him in a world where trust was hard to find. But I had matured, grown up, figured out what I wanted\u2014and we didn\u2019t want the same things.</p><p>He wanted me to put out another album\u2014just like the first one. He also wanted a family right away. I wanted the independence to make my own decisions. I wanted to give my career time to grow before starting a family. That left us at a crossroads in our relationship when he suddenly asked me to marry him. He wanted me to take a year off and create the album of my dreams. He said he\u2019d help me get it out there, help me sell it, and I loved him for supporting me.</p> <p>Yet his job demands had intensified, and suddenly he was insisting that I travel everywhere with him\u2014he wanted me by his side. I had written the songs for my album, but they weren\u2019t being produced. Damon was adamant that he knew what was right for me. Somehow I had become his arm candy and all we were doing was arguing. I was so unhappy, and I knew what we\u2019d had for each other was gone\u2014I just hadn\u2019t figured out how to tell him we were over. And then, without even knowing it, Xander made it all so clear. My relationship with Damon was one of comfortable love, not true undying love. And I wasn\u2019t going to settle.</p><p>The next day things unexpectedly came crashing down with Damon. We were at the pool and my gaze steadied on Xander again. I couldn\u2019t help but be drawn to the sight of him. To his strong, stubbled jaw that I wanted to cup in the palms of my hands, to his pale hazel eyes that were pinned on me, to all of him. Damon saw me staring, and he must have sensed what I was feeling, because he exploded, dragging me from the pool. When I finally told him the name of the person I was looking at, he slapped me. That was it. I wasn\u2019t sticking around any longer. I was done the moment his palm struck my face. I wasn\u2019t going to be anyone\u2019s punching bag. My father used to hit my mother and me until one day he just up and took off. I wasn\u2019t going to repeat my mother\u2019s mistakes in any way, shape, or form. Xander\u2019s seeing me afterward made me so angry, and his concern made me furious\u2014the hate I had for him was back in full force. I didn\u2019t need his help\u2014I didn\u2019t need him.</p><p>As soon as I got back to the room, Damon was full of remorse. We discussed our situation, and he surprisingly took our breakup better than I could have imagined. He wanted me to keep the diamond ring\u2014but I couldn\u2019t. I should have never accepted it from him to begin with. So I left it and left him.</p><p>Our personal relationship was over\u2014but dissolving our business relationship wasn\u2019t as easy. For some reason he didn\u2019t want to let that go. I contacted my attorney, and he told me he would start the litigation needed to terminate our contract, but it wouldn\u2019t be quick, easy, or cheap. I hadn\u2019t earned any money in the past year and didn\u2019t have much money left. I was supporting my mother and my sisters, and my accounts were draining fast. One of my sisters was in med school and the other two were in college. I couldn\u2019t let them down. So when Zane Perry was diagnosed with a mild form of vocal cord paralysis and the Wilde Ones needed a new lead singer, I thought it would be the perfect arrangement.</p><p>When I left Xander\u2019s house the night we\u2019d all agreed I\u2019d replace Zane, I went to meet my cousin for dinner. Logan was really tired and I was glad because Xander\u2019s touch was still burning through my body and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Arriving home early, I struggled to sleep. Images of Xander, on top of me, under me, beside me, in me\u2014I couldn\u2019t erase them. Even after all these years I remembered how we were together. I could see the sensuality of his raw, n*ked body. I could smell him. I could hear the groans he made when he came. And in the darkness of my own room, I used those memories to help relieve the need that had surged within me from the moment I first saw him again. I held my br**sts and slid my thumbs over my ni**les. I ran my hand down to my sex and touched myself. I imagined it was him touching me, pressing his thumb against my clit\u2014taking me to the edge and back simply because he could. My heels pressed into the bed and my fingers gripped the sheets so tightly I nearly tore them as my body finally found its release.</p> <p>But I refused to give in to that kind of need again. I had to stop thinking about him that way. For the past two weeks I\u2019ve tried to avoid getting too close to him. For reasons I don\u2019t want to think about, though, I want to be near him. Then every time I am near him, I teeter between love and hate. It\u2019s a fine line and I\u2019m taking baby steps to avoid stumbling. I have to say, he threw me when he hadn\u2019t said yes right away about my joining the band. That bothered me. I wanted him to welcome me, at least make me feel like he cared. But what bothers me the most is he hasn\u2019t really tried to discuss what happened between us. I know I said the past was in the past, but I never thought he\u2019d listen. He never used to let barriers keep him from discussing the things that were important to him. The fact that he seems so detached from the whole situation is eating at me in a way that\u2019s causing me to lose focus. We\u2019re going to be sharing the confined space of a tour bus and before I get on that bus, we need to clear the air. We are both grown-ups. We can do this\u2014talk it out and then put it aside for the sake of business. At least that\u2019s what I keep telling myself.</p><p>I\u2019m staying with a friend in Beverly Hills, so the drive to his house is short\u2014too short. As I pull up to the beautiful architecture of his Canon Drive condominium building, my pulse races in a way I\u2019m not familiar with. I walk slowly to his door, telling myself I can do this, not to be nervous. Just as I\u2019m about to ring the bell, the door opens. I drop my gaze to the ground and I swear my heart jumps out of my chest. I think about running, but I\u2019m not sure my jelly legs will take me anywhere. I draw a deep breath and when I can finally focus, I look up and almost laugh because it\u2019s not him\u2014it\u2019s his brother. When I saw River at the announcement party I knew who he was right away\u2014the light brown hair that looks almost coppery and the insanely green eyes hadn\u2019t changed. To me he\u2019ll always be Xander\u2019s cute kid brother, but he\u2019s grown up to be equally as handsome as Xander. The difference\u2014River borders on adorable, while Xander exudes ruggedness. Their hair and eye color may be different, but there\u2019s no mistaking they\u2019re brothers.</p><p>\u201cIvy.\u201d He greets me, pulling me for a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cHi, River. Is Xander home?\u201d I ask nervously.</p><p>\u201cSorry. He\u2019s not. I just stopped by to pick up a few things he bought for Dahlia.\u201d</p><p>I must look at him skeptically because he explains, \u201cHe was out and picked up some old albums, CDs, and movies he thought she\u2019d enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was nice of him. I heard she\u2019s been put on bed rest. I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, but really that must be kind of nice. The two of you get to spend time together doing things you like to do.\u201d</p><p>An almost wicked grin crosses his face. He\u2019s so much like his brother. My cheeks turn pink and I feel the need to clarify my comment. I point to the stack of albums under his arm. \u201cLike listening to some awesome music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ve actually been making the best of it,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>Backing away from the door, I say, \u201cWell, it was great to see you again and it was really nice meeting Dahlia at the press announcement party. Please tell her I said hello. I\u2019ll catch up with Xander later at rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy,\u201d he calls in a tone that sounds a little too real for me to want to hear any more.</p><p>I stop just before the steps. Turning around, I clutch the railing.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he says, and I just smile, then leave.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>The sun brightens the east side of the stadium, with blazing-hot rays beating down and making it hard to see anything but what\u2019s right in front of you. It\u2019s our last rehearsal before hitting the road tonight, and Xander insisted on making it as realistic as possible. We\u2019re at the Greek Theatre, the stadium is empty, and I\u2019m clutching the microphone . . . my face carefully blank as I mindlessly search for him. It\u2019s upsetting me that he\u2019s occupying so much of my mind space. Before I went to his house, I thought having it out with him would take care of it, but now I think status quo might be best. My nerves overtook me when I was there, and I\u2019m not sure I can actually discuss the past with him.</p><p>I just have to clear away all thoughts of him and focus on my career. But that\u2019s easier said than done because every time I see him, he\u2019s back in the forefront of my mind. Even right now he\u2019s searing me as he strides down the aisle. He looks amazingly sexy in all black\u2014black T-shirt, black jeans, and black work boots. I\u2019m standing in this huge stadium with so many other people around and he\u2019s still all I see. Moving toward me with his dark good looks and arrogance, he\u2019s just the same eighteen-year-old boy I couldn\u2019t wait to see, talk to, kiss, and wrap my arms around. But today, even though his hazel eyes appear tired and his dark hair looks a little more disheveled than usual, he\u2019s still undeniably gorgeous. What\u2019s wrong with me? One minute I don\u2019t want to lay eyes on him ever again, and the next I can\u2019t wait to see him.</p><p>The sound system is on the fritz and he immediately takes control of the situation. He points to the stage and yells to someone. He struts even closer and his walk is as full of confidence as his tone. Hearing his voice, now the voice of a man, makes my heart beat a little faster, my breath quicken, and gives me that feeling of comfort in my soul that it once did. Screeching crackles from the speakers pierce my ears. The scratching sound would normally make me cringe, but right now it\u2019s the sweetest hymn of music because it helps distract me.</p><p>After he gives a few more directives, the sound system seems to be working again and he moves on to his next task. Ellie, the tour manager, calls him over and he approaches her with the easy grin and flirty manner that used to make me see green when he talked to other girls. It has the same impact on me now. I feel like that same lovesick teenager, and my reaction just makes me furious with myself.</p><p>When we finally finish what has to be the longest rehearsal ever, I swing my purse over my shoulder and make my way to the restroom. My phone rings the minute I cross the threshold backstage, and I fumble through my bag to pull it out. The screen flashes DAMON and I automatically hit IGNORE. He\u2019s been calling and texting me for the last two weeks\u2014begging forgiveness one minute and threatening legal action the next. He wants me back, but whether it\u2019s for personal or business reasons, I\u2019m not sure. I haven\u2019t asked because I have no intention of going back. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen when he finds out I joined this tour. Xander is making the announcement today that I\u2019ve joined the Wilde Ones. I guess I\u2019ll have to talk to Damon tonight, but I\u2019ll wait until we\u2019ve hit the road.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bathroom backstage is old and definitely needs to be remodeled. The mirror is cracked, but I steal a glance at myself anyway. Hot, sweaty, and a mess. Oh, well. I try to stick the pieces of my hair that have fallen out of my low-slung bun back into the elastic as best I can and then head out. I\u2019m a little nervous about starting this journey and a little excited at the same time. Singing is what I love, so getting back to sharing my music is exciting, but having Xander so close has put me on edge. My feelings for him are unclear and crystal clear at the same time\u2014that\u2019s why I\u2019m nervous.</p><p>The smell of hamburgers fills the air, and I smile when I see that the food has been put on the tables previously set up in the orchestra section of the amphitheater. Since I\u2019m starving, I make a plate and join the guys. Xander is not here. See, I\u2019m still thinking about him\u2014crap. I take a seat in the metal folding chair next to Garrett. His slightly long blond hair covers his gray eyes, shielding them from the sun. I just grin at him because his hairstyle and boyish face make him look like he\u2019s still fifteen, and he really is cute. His lip ring only adds to his youthful appearance, and his tall, skinny stature certainly doesn\u2019t help him look any more grown-up. When my phone rings again, I ignore it and switch it to VIBRATE.</p><p>Garrett asks, \u201cNot going to answer that?\u201d</p><p>The sunglasses on my face not only keep the sun from blinding me but also keep Garrett from seeing the stir of nerves within me. Damon\u2019s continual calls are wearing on me. Smiling, I tell him, \u201cIt would be rude to answer at the table.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles back and takes a bite of his burger.</p><p>I push the unidentifiable salad around on my plate. \u201cDo you think these are potatoes?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders and takes another bite of the mound identical to mine on his own plate. \u201cIt tastes like macaroni to me.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the heap of food on my plate becomes very unappealing and I\u2019m not hungry anymore. I push it aside. Nix is sitting across from me, sipping his beer. \u201cHe eats anything,\u201d he mumbles, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Nix is an attractive dark-haired guy. In high school he always had a girlfriend but never seemed interested in any of them. He\u2019s tall, but not as tall as Xander, and he has an athletic build. His hair is short, his eyes are chocolate brown, and his skin always looks tan. He looks the same as in high school, just more mature and more built. But he now wears a very detailed tribal tattoo that circles his biceps with an intricate feather design draped down his arm. It\u2019s always peeking out from under the short sleeve of his T-shirt. Garrett told me he got it right after graduation\u2014he went to visit his great-uncle, who lives on an Indian reservation, and came home with it. Garrett said he never really explained to them why he got it, but he figures it has something to do with his family heritage.</p> <p>I stand up and toss my plate in the trash. My phone rings again, but this time it\u2019s my mother and I decide to bite the bullet and get it over with.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, it\u2019s your mother, honey,\u201d she says, as if I didn\u2019t have caller ID or recognize the sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cMom. Hi.\u201d I drop down to sit on the steps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling you. Why didn\u2019t you call me when you broke off your engagement with Damon? I had to hear it from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just have a lot going on right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, sweetie, I\u2019d like to have lunch this week if possible.\u201d</p><p>I take a couple of deep breaths. \u201cMom, I\u2019m going on the road with another band for a few months and I\u2019m busy getting ready, but I promise I\u2019ll call you as soon as I get settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, honey, it\u2019s important. Your sister\u2019s tuition is due and I don\u2019t have the money and somehow I missed the mortgage payment last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ll see what I can do. Money is tight right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she responds. \u201cDo you think you could ask Damon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I should be able to get you some money in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait that long. The bank will take the house.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. \u201cListen, come get my car. I\u2019ll text you where it is. I\u2019ll leave the keys and the signed pink slip under the mat. That should hold you over for a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIvy, that would help tremendously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go, Mom. I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, honey. I knew I could count on you.\u201d She hangs up.</p><p>Her response was as automatic as mine. She knew all she had to do was ask. But what bothers me is that she didn\u2019t even ask where I was going or with whom. That just wasn\u2019t as important as getting a check.</p><p>My body fills with so much tension I feel paralyzed. I put my head in my hands and sit alone for the longest time, wondering how I\u2019m ever going to free myself from her. Finally, I stand and head backstage to the bathroom to splash some cold water on my face. The floor is slatelike and my heels click against it with each step, but that\u2019s not the only sound I hear\u2014I hear Xander\u2019s voice. With just one simple word he\u2019s back in the front of my mind again and I stand frozen in place in the almost nonexistent space between the stage and backstage.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, and the way the word rolls off his tongue catapults me back in time.</p><p>I had missed a week of school and band rehearsals. I was in the tenth grade and Xander had just gotten his license. I was sick, but I still had to babysit\u2014my mother was working. The doorbell rang and when I opened it all I could see was a finger hooked around a hanging plant of ivy. I slammed the door shut, thinking it was the neighbor kids playing a practical joke and almost caught his finger.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he yelled, and I immediately opened the door again.</p><p>He came into view and handed me the pot. I raised an eyebrow and just looked at him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I eyed the ivy plant.</p><p>Shrugging, he said, \u201cRoses are so clich\u00e9.\u201d Then he kissed me and snickered. \u201cI prefer Ivy.\u201d He made the statement sound simple, but it was so full of meaning. His gift was a symbol of our love and it was something that could last forever . . . like I thought we would. He stayed that night to help me babysit. Once the girls fell asleep, we watched the Grammys and we talked about our dreams for each other\u2014his was that I would be up on that stage one day. That made me laugh and made me cry. After that night he\u2019d bring me ivy plants of all kinds\u2014sometimes as a gesture to make up, sometimes for my birthday, sometimes just because . . . and I loved them all. I planted them in the garden I started with my sisters or hung them in my room, and they never died, but I did dig them all up and throw them away the night I saw him with Tessa.</p><p>Shaking off the memory, I divert my attention away from him and try to push him out of my mind. But when he yells, \u201cCome on, motherfucker!\u201d I can\u2019t help but steal a glance. He\u2019s talking to some guy I don\u2019t know and the motherfucker in question is a coin. Watching him as he throws his muscled arm up to release the coin and yells, \u201cHeads,\u201d subconsciously I yell, \u201cHeads\u201d in unison. I know his call\u2014it hasn\u2019t changed. The way his lip curves around the word as he says it gives me a sudden urge to suck on it. Turning, he looks at me and his eyes lock on mine. His mouth forms that same slow, easy grin that always made me weak at the knees. But I can\u2019t smile back . . . I want to, but I\u2019m afraid that if I do I won\u2019t be able to compartmentalize him anymore. What\u2019s between us has to stay professional; if not, things will get too messy. A flash of something mars his finely chiseled face, but he catches the coin without faltering. Covering it with his other hand, he cocks his head and bobs his chin, calling me over. I stay where I am. I hate him. I hate him. I have to keep saying it or I\u2019ll forget.</p><p>Shrugging, he lifts his hand. \u201cHeads it is.\u201d</p><p>The tall, skinny man standing next him sighs. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll drive straight through to Denver, but if I crash the bus I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d</p><p>Xander lets out an exaggerated laugh and slaps a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFirst of all, you have Brad, and second, you won\u2019t crash the bus. You\u2019ve made runs like this a million times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, boss man,\u201d replies the man I can now identify as John the bus driver.</p><p>Xander walks away. \u201cSee you on the bus,\u201d he calls over his shoulder, maybe to me, maybe to John, maybe to both of us, I don\u2019t know. What I do know without a doubt is that I want him. The sound of his voice alone makes every nerve in my body tingle, makes my ni**les tighten, and causes an ache between my legs. I stand there and watch him move with that ease he has about him, and I know this is going to be so much harder than I\u2019ve convinced myself it would be.</p><p>Later that night, we board the bus and I run for refuge. I have to escape my attraction to him. Being near him only heightens it. I hop in the shower and then get ready for bed. I lie on the mattress in the back bedroom of the bus with my door locked and close my eyes. The movement of the bus should lull me to sleep, but it doesn\u2019t. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him. I picture his long, lean body, his face, the sounds he used to make, and even the way he says the word f**k. I remember the sound of his husky voice in my ear, the way his tone oozed sex. My hands slide down my own body and into my pajama bottoms. I tug the elastic down and kick them off, then spread my legs. And as I lie there alone in the darkness, my hands become his\u2014doing what I want him to be doing so badly at this moment. I come in a shattering cl**ax and sleep finally consumes me.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Talk to Me</p><p>Xander</p><p>The outside passes in a blur as I walk into the front lounge from the galley. As usual, I\u2019m awake before any of the guys. I did my typical tour bus workout in the back lounge\u2014sit-ups, push-ups, and weights that we keep back there. I\u2019ll run tonight before the show. It\u2019s hard to keep a routine on the road, but I try. It helps relieve stress and keeps me focused.</p><p>Entering the room, I get a feeling like I\u2019ve been slapped in the face. Jack White\u2019s \u201cLove Interruption\u201d is playing. It\u2019s an awesome slow-burn blues ballad, and the lyrics seem to reflect the way my relationship with Ivy ended. I flip the light on and see her sitting there on one of the benches. Holding a cup with both hands, she\u2019s drinking coffee and staring out the window. I hear soft, quiet notes as she sings along to the song, but she stops when the lights flicker. Her gaze darts to mine for one brief second, and then her eyes swing immediately back to the window.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cHey. Good morning.\u201d It seems odd to see her on the bus.</p><p>She glances back toward me. Something flashes across her face, but it\u2019s gone before I can pinpoint it. \u201cHey. Morning.\u201d Her expression is neutral and her voice is low.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d</p><p>She sets her cup down. \u201cGreat. The quiet of the engine seems to lull me to sleep every time I ride on one of these.\u201d Her tone is sarcastic and I f**king love it.</p><p>I offer a smile, holding back my smirk. \u201cYeah, try sleeping on the bottom bunk with the floor vibrating underneath you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass,\u201d she says and turns back to look at the cornfields and lush greenery of the Midwest surroundings.</p><p>I pour a cup of coffee and look over my shoulder. Lifting the pot, I ask, \u201cRefill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she answers, covering the top of her cup with her hand.</p><p>I move to sit across from her. \u201cMind?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shakes her head. I want to ask her a million questions. I want to know everything she\u2019s done for the last twelve years, but when one of the songs from her first album comes on the radio, I settle for asking one simple question that has been eating at me. Her song \u201cHit It\u201d surrounds us. The lyrics are about dancing but can very easily be misconstrued as being about sex. Since it doesn\u2019t seem like a song she\u2019d have sung, let along written, I nod toward the speaker and ask, \u201cWhat made you take that road?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes narrow on mine. \u201cWhat do you mean by that road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>She turns to look at me full on. The look she gives me tells me right away that she\u2019s offended, and her answer only confirms this. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Why don\u2019t you explain?\u201d</p><p>Okay, if she wants me to spell it out, I will. I pause for a moment before answering, trying to figure out the best way to phrase this, but decide to just say it. \u201cWhy did you choose pop music? You were never one for the verse-chorus structure or catchy hooks like this.\u201d When the hook plays, I lift my eyes to the speaker and add, \u201cYou have so much artistic depth. I just never thought you\u2019d sell out for mass appeal.\u201d</p> <p>With a sigh, she stands up. Hurt quickly passes over her face before hate presents itself. Bracing her hands on the table, she leans forward. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I have anymore,\u201d she says with a shaky voice. Then adds, \u201cI\u2019m going to get ready.\u201d With that she brushes past me.</p><p>Rising from my chair, I call, \u201cIvy, wait. I wasn\u2019t trying to be an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t stop. Instead she hastily pulls the curtain back to huff forward. It\u2019s then that she finally comes to a dead standstill. I\u2019m on her heels and almost barrel right into her. She\u2019s stopped, just staring, and I glance inside the galley to see what has captured her attention. It\u2019s Garrett and he\u2019s awake, doing his morning exercise.</p><p>\u201cIs that a sex swing?\u201d she asks him wide-eyed, her cheeks turning pink as soon as the words leave her mouth.</p><p>I burst out in laughter. I can\u2019t help it. For some reason being near Ivy makes everything that\u2019s mildly funny seem funnier. It always did.</p> <p>A devilish grin appears on his face. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a yoga swing. But thanks for the idea,\u201d Garrett tells her.</p><p>\u201cFuck, no, not in here,\u201d Nix calls out from behind one of the curtains. \u201cNo one wants to see your n*ked ass in the act.\u201d</p><p>Leif comes out of the bathroom wearing some kind of sleep pants that make me laugh equally as hard\u2014they\u2019re baby blue with an elastic waist, and I wonder if they\u2019re Ivy\u2019s. Holding my stomach, I try to calm myself. Garrett gives me a perplexed look. I know he must be thinking he\u2019s probably never seen me laugh this much, and I don\u2019t remember the last time I did. Leif, with his toothbrush in his mouth, shrugs past as if nothing out of the ordinary is occurring and disappears into his cubby. Nix pops his head out and starts talking to Garrett about setting some new rules.</p><p>I take the opportunity to get Ivy\u2019s attention. Moving directly behind her, I clutch her arm and pull her back to me. \u201cCan I talk to you back in the lounge?\u201d Her laughter stops when I whisper in her ear, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She turns to look at me, her eyes unreadable. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I turn and she follows. I fight the urge to hold her hand. We enter the front lounge again and she moves to one side. I lean against the small counter opposite her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was a shit thing to say. I didn\u2019t mean it like it sounded. What I meant to say was what made you decide to debut with a pop song?\u201d</p> <p>She sighs and sits back down, sipping from the mug she\u2019d left behind. Silence is all around us before she answers, and the room seems much bigger than it actually is. \u201cFirst, yes, it was a shitty thing to say. But to answer your question, it was my only choice. I\u2019d been back in LA for six months and hadn\u2019t found a job. I was singing at the coffee shop my mother worked at. Damon had been going in there for years and she had told him about me. He came to one of the open-mic shows and afterward asked to meet with me. When I first met him, I was determined to put out the album I had always dreamed of. He disagreed with my vision. He said the marketability of what I proposed wouldn\u2019t work in the climate we were in at the time. So I left. Then about a week later he talked to my mother. He called me back and agreed to cut a demo of one of my songs. It took another three months before it went out, and I still hadn\u2019t found a job. He finally sent it out, but we never heard back from a single label. In the meantime I\u2019d managed to get a job working for an advertising agency writing jingles\u2014I hated it. A year later I decided to do it his way. And even though the album didn\u2019t hit the top of the charts\u2014I was still happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. No one was interested in your first song, but he found a label to pick up the album after that?\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me with her blue eyes, the softness in them draining by the second. She rises and walks to the small sink next to where I\u2019m standing. She rinses her mug, sets it down, and turns her head toward me. \u201cXander, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re implying, but Damon has always had my best interests at heart. In fact, we\u2019re working on a new sound now\u2014or we were.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s unlike me to hold back on how I feel, but I\u2019m aware she doesn\u2019t trust me yet, so I put my hands up in surrender. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for a banana and peels it, not responding to my comment. I\u2019m really curious why Damon would switch gears, so I ask, \u201cWhat kind of new sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not new. Old might be a better explanation.\u201d</p><p>I nod, understanding what she means.</p><p>\u201cWe both agreed I\u2019d take a break and refocus, redirect my music to what I envisioned when I first started singing. I\u2019ve written songs and hit the studio attempting to produce them. We\u2019ve tried a few different producers, but I\u2019m still not happy with the results.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I listen to them sometime? You can tell me what it is you don\u2019t like and maybe I can help you.\u201d</p><p>She chews a bite of banana, swallows, takes another bite, as if strongly considering my request. \u201cI\u2019d actually really like that.\u201d</p><p>She makes the simple statement and I want to press her for more. I want to listen to her new songs now. I want to talk to her more about her music. I don\u2019t want this conversation to end. But silence rises up between us again. She throws the banana peel away, and then her head drops and she stares into the sink. When I brace my arms back on the counter, our hands are so close all I\u2019d have to do is move my thumb a fraction of an inch and we\u2019d accidentally be touching. But instead I do something I know I shouldn\u2019t. I lift my hand and gently grasp her chin, pulling it toward me. \u201cIvy?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers, closing her eyes.</p><p>I breathe out. She breathes in. I can feel my skin touching hers and I want to hold her, rest my forehead on hers, I want to brush my lips across hers, I want to whisper in her ear that she can trust me. Having her this close twists me, turns me, makes me think about my actions. I don\u2019t want to upset her. It\u2019s been almost two weeks since she joined the band and our conversations have mostly been work-related until now. This is the first personal conversation we\u2019ve had, and talking to her again has everything inside me screaming for her. Everything she does sets my blood on fire. I drop my hand and back away. I\u2019m going to give her some time because that\u2019s something we have\u2014three months\u2019 worth of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really going to get changed now,\u201d she says, her voice smooth and low.</p><p>I nod and she turns and leaves the lounge. I watch her until she disappears. Then I open the fridge and grab an apple. Taking a bite, I chew it and grin\u2014all in all, that didn\u2019t go that badly.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Time seems to tick by so slowly the rest of the day. Staring out the window at a stream that meanders through fields on its own sweet time, I kick myself for not pushing it with her. Why wade through the stream instead of jumping over it? Yet I know I have to take it slow with her or she\u2019ll keep retreating\u2014and I want her around. I\u2019ve lived on this bus for six months with eight other dudes, and it\u2019s been nothing but comfortably boring. Having Ivy on board has already made everything different\u2014I feel a buzz of energy in the air and everything seems more alive.</p><p>By the time we finally arrive in Denver, I\u2019m ready to blast into action. We get right to work, which I\u2019m glad about because it takes my mind off her. I\u2019m in a hurry to get in as much rehearsal time as I can. And at least the tension between Ivy and me melts away when she\u2019s onstage. We both act professional and don\u2019t let our past interfere with the music. I use today\u2019s sound check as more of a rehearsal, so it lasts three hours. The guys are ready to be done, but I think we need more practice. I want their performances to be perfect. A lineup of forty songs means learning a shitload of material, so we keep going over and over them. Leif switches between keyboard and bass, depending on the song. His versatility has proved to be a great addition to the band.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s call it for now,\u201d I yell.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about f**king time,\u201d Nix snarls at me.</p><p>Leif thumps his shoulder and heads to the keyboard with the corner of his mouth turned up. Leaning over it, he closes his eyes and hits some notes. He seems to be playing a song, but the words that leave his mouth sound more like a rap. The melancholy of it draws me in. I take a seat and just listen until he\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a showstopper,\u201d I comment, meeting him at the bottom of the stairs as he walks off the stage.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s not meant for the audience Ivy sings to.\u201d</p><p>I shoot him a small grin. \u201cYou\u2019re full of all kinds of surprises. But really, I liked it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cThanks, man. Had a buddy years ago and rapping was his thing. What can I say\u2014he taught me well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to change the subject, but what\u2019s your take on learning all the band\u2019s songs in such a short period of time?\u201d</p><p>He sighs with what looks like an authentic worry line creasing his brow before he confesses, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not what I wanted to hear.</p><p>He turns and heads backstage to get ready for the show, throwing over his shoulder, \u201cGotcha, dude! We got this nailed.\u201d</p><p>I grin with relief.</p><p>Showtime comes quickly and ends just as quickly. There are good shows and bad shows and this one is definitely not great. The arena is filled at about seventy-five percent\u2014not bad, considering we\u2019ve switched leads in mid tour. But Ellie has arranged for some special effects to welcome Ivy, and the streamers just seem to take away from the set, and the guys are off the rest of the night after that.</p><p>Fresh from the stage, the band and the crew are digging in to the food backstage. Leif has a penchant for wine and opens a few bottles of red. He sniffs the contents of a bottle and then pours a glass. After he takes a sip he pours some for everyone. By eleven thirty we all smell like red wine and are pretty drunk. Knowing it\u2019s time to leave, we take the backstage door and head to the bus, which pulls out at midnight. We won\u2019t be staying in a hotel until we get to Lincoln.</p><p>Garrett walks beside me, complaining about the streamer gimmick. Just as we start to cross the parking lot, at least two dozen fans come rushing over to Ivy, begging for pictures and autographs. I stop and glance at Leif. The others keep moving\u2014all except for Garrett, who\u2019s still talking.</p><p>Leif stops as well, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for her.\u201d</p><p>I nod, already having decided I\u2019d wait for her.</p><p>He pulls out a pack of cigarettes and taps it against his hand, then pulls one out and hands the pack to me.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, man,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s one vice I never took up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing, because it\u2019s a f**king hard habit to break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only smoke when I\u2019m drinking and never inside,\u201d Leif clarifies, as if I cared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take one of those,\u201d Garrett says.</p><p>I just look at him and shake my head. He lights the cigarette and inhales, then exhales smoke in a huge cough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a f**king retard,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I used to smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, when you could sneak one behind the school grounds in the sixth grade.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>Garrett stubs his cigarette out. \u201cI\u2019m going to make like Tom and Cruise. You coming?\u201d he asks me.</p> <p>Shaking my head, I tell him, \u201cI\u2019ll stick around with Leif and wait for Ivy.\u201d</p><p>I have an uneasy feeling about leaving her with just Leif. She\u2019s pretty tight with him and he seems to watch over her, but if something happens, he\u2019d never be able to handle it himself\u2014from what I can tell he\u2019s definitely more of a lover than a fighter. I make a note to myself to talk to Ena about additional security. I\u2019ll have her call River\u2019s security guy, Caleb, and get some recommendations.</p><p>When the crowd finally clears, the three of us head back to the bus. Leif\u2019s phone rings, and glancing at its screen, he stops. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta take this. I\u2019ll catch up with you later,\u201d he says, stepping away for some privacy.</p><p>Ivy and I walk the remaining few feet in silence. She\u2019s wearing a pair of tight black jeans, a gray shirt with the shoulders cut out, and a pair of spike heels that look more like boots. Her flawless body is a perfect match to her songbird voice. We\u2019re both a little drunk, and it shows when she climbs the steps to the bus and one of her heels sticks in the rubber matting, causing her to stumble. Next thing I know, I\u2019ve fallen on top of her. My mouth is next to her ear and I can smell the fresh scent of her hair. I don\u2019t move because I can hear her breathing and I can almost feel her pulse racing beneath me. At that moment I know for sure\u2014she still feels about me the way I feel about her. And in this one moment everything changes.</p><p>\u201cYou want me, don\u2019t you?\u201d I whisper under my breath and I can feel my mouth tip to one side.</p> <p>She flips around and my body instantly falls, molding to hers in a heartbeat. The heat between us is undeniable, at least to me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she says a few moments too late. \u201cPlease get off me,\u201d she adds in a voice that refuses any rebuttal. Our locked gazes keep me glued where I am, but when she averts her eyes, I can\u2019t help but grin. It\u2019s so apparent what that means. She forgets how well I know her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the liar,\u201d she hisses.</p><p>I want to say I\u2019m not either, but I don\u2019t, because that would be a lie. So instead I stand up and wipe my palms on my jeans before extending my hand to help her up. She refuses my help and pushes herself up.</p><p>\u201cI can manage myself,\u201d she snaps as she turns and walks up the steps.</p> <p>And I stand here smug as shit because now I know\u2014I have to tell her what really happened. I just need the right time and place.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The Lincoln, St. Paul, and Des Moines shows come and go without any noteworthy events. We\u2019re headed to Springfield for Summerfest. Summer festivals are a blast to play and we have about four more lined up on this tour. I\u2019ve been extremely busy with press releases and promo changes. Rehearsal schedules have been ramped up and we have very little time to do anything but sleep and work, so everyone is looking forward to the festival.</p><p>We reach Springfield on the third day of Summerfest. I\u2019m backstage at sunset and the band is just coming off the stage.</p><p>\u201cYou rocked it,\u201d I tell Leif, giving him a high five. He had a solo on the keyboard and really tore it out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check out Eminem a few stages over. Anyone coming?\u201d Nix asks.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Ivy answers and I\u2019m surprised. Since when does she like rap?</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll join you as well,\u201d I add.</p> <p>The other guys head over to see the Sheepdogs and the three of us cross the field as bands on five stages churn out majestic jams. Walking through the crowds, I stay close to her side, occasionally guiding her with a slight touch. Nix stops to talk to someone he knows and we keep moving. It\u2019s hotter than hell and the crowd is a sweaty mess. We reach the stage area as the song ends and everyone is screaming for more. Another song begins to play and we stand together and listen. It hasn\u2019t been just the two of us since the first morning on the bus. A comfortable ease slips between us as we watch the performance. Feeling the time is right, I step closer to her. Close enough that we\u2019re shoulder to shoulder. Then I dip my head and ask, \u201cWant to have a drink someplace quiet? Someplace we can talk?\u201d</p><p>She bites her bottom lip and looks away. She opens and closes her mouth a few times until she actually answers me. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Her breath is sweet and warm on my neck, and I want her to change her mind. I want to hear her say yes. I want to push her, but I don\u2019t. As I study her\u2014her body language, her perfect face\u2014my lips twitch from trying not to laugh at myself. I\u2019m a guy who has always gone after what he wants. I want what I want now . . . but with Ivy it\u2019s different. I need to earn her trust before I can tell her the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looks up at me with an innocence that makes my heart beat dangerously fast.</p><p>I can\u2019t hold back my laughter anymore and I let it out. \u201cNothing, nothing. How about we grab some funnel cakes over at the midway?\u201d</p><p>She nods with a small hint of excitement, and I have to cross my arms to keep my hands from clutching her face and just kissing her for the sweetness that I see in it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ivy and I spent the night listening to bands and just hanging out, but we never talked about the past\u2014about us. I danced around the topic, but every time I did she tensed up and seemed to withdraw. So I decided to put it aside and focus on things between us now. The guys eventually caught up with us and we headed back to the bus and pulled out for our next show. We\u2019re on the way to Cleveland with a stop in Cincinnati for a night out. Leif\u2019s buddy Casper is a boxer and he invited the band to come watch his next fight. Leif\u2019s convinced that Casper will be the reigning heavyweight champion in no time. His career record so far is 23 and 0. Although I haven\u2019t been keeping up with the sport, I\u2019d have to agree with Leif\u2014his record speaks for itself.</p><p>The traffic is crazy on the way to the Horseshoe Casino and we\u2019re running a little late. Ivy\u2019s sitting next to Leif in the SUV and I\u2019m sitting behind them with Garrett. Nix is up front. Ivy\u2019s almost too much to take in at once. Her strapless yellow top shows off her perfect figure, but I want to cover her bare shoulders and pull her top up a little to eliminate all that exposed skin. Her hair is wavy today, a style I\u2019ve never seen her wear, but it looks really sexy on her. She shakes her voluminous curls when she laughs at something Leif says, and I take a deep breath\u2014fuck, she looks amazing.</p><p>We enter the venue just as the fight is being announced. She\u2019s by my side and jumps a little when the speaker blares with the announcer\u2019s voice: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, here he is! I know you all know who I\u2019m talking about\u2014so without further ado I give you Casper \u2018the Ghost\u2019 Holland.\u201d I place my hand on the small of her back and guide her down the aisle. A slight shiver makes her body shake and I grin.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>Just as we reach our seats the crowd roars, \u201cGhost!\u201d and a guy in all white comes trotting down the aisle. The back of his robe is labeled just what the crowd is chanting\u2014GHOST. He climbs into the ring with one fluid jump and moves to a corner, where someone helps him remove his robe. Shit, this guy is ripped. Ivy\u2019s standing between me and Leif, and when I look her way, I see her eyes are glued to his body. Leaning over, I whisper, \u201cYou might want to close your mouth. Leaving your tongue hanging out is a little obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just looking at his tattoos.\u201d But she\u2019s blushing. My eyes travel down her body and my hands want so badly to follow suit. Leif leans over and she tilts her head to hear what he\u2019s saying. I can\u2019t help but notice how close the two of them are, and I\u2019m glad he has a girlfriend. When Leif pulls his phone out, she steps closer to me. Her fresh scent wafts through the air and I breathe it in. My urge to kiss the skin on her bare neck has never been greater.</p><p>When the lights suddenly dim in the stands, she turns to me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure watching two guys beat each other up is my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look away if you don\u2019t like it, and if it\u2019s too much we can leave anytime,\u201d I tell her, thankful for this sign of the innocence I sense she still possesses. I feel an urge to pull her to me and let her bury her head in my chest, but I resist.</p><p>Two burly guys try to get by so they can stand on the other side of me and she pushes her body into mine as she moves out of the way. I stifle a harsh breath. The sound of the gruff voice overhead is the only thing that breaks the spell she\u2019s cast over me. When the crowd goes crazy, I instinctively grip her side and move her to stand in front of me. So much for resisting. She leans back slightly, almost leaning against me. The feeling of her body so close to mine just about sends me over the edge.</p><p>The announcer continues: \u201cAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, may we have a round of applause to welcome, Eddy \u2018Bikini\u2019 Bottoms.\u201d He too almost trots down the aisle. I look into the ring and see that Casper seems to be circling it\u2014waiting for his prey. His opponent takes his place with ease, and both fighters flex their fingers at their sides, their hands taped so their bare knuckles are exposed. I have a feeling this is going to be a good fight. Each of them slides his gloves on and the crowd explodes in cheers around us when the two opponents meet in the middle and the bell rings. Casper\u2019s opponent swings first. Casper ducks and jabs Bottoms\u2019s side with a right, then a left. A few more rounds pass, and then out of nowhere Casper lands one straight punch to the jaw that knocks his opponent down just like that.</p><p>Ivy gasps in disbelief when Bottoms tries to lift himself up on his arms as the counting begins. With each number, she pushes herself farther back into me. Does she know what she\u2019s doing to me? I couldn\u2019t even tell you what\u2019s going on in the ring. I feel like that eighteen-year-old boy that got hard with every move she made. The counting stops and Bottoms\u2019s trainer is by his side, as he lies flat on the mat. I think the ref has already called the fight. But I\u2019m not sure until Bottoms fails to rise and the ref approaches Casper and yanks his arm up in victory while the announcer boasts, \u201cThe victor, ladies and gentlemen! I give you, your one, your only, Casper the Friendly Ghost!\u201d</p><p>Ivy twists her head back and looks up at me with those feline eyes. \u201cIs it over?\u201d she asks.</p><p>With her warm breath on my neck and her lips so close to mine, I\u2019m having a hard time concentrating on anything but her. When I lean forward so she can hear me, I accidentally press myself into her and I swear I hear a small whimper escape her throat. I murmur in her ear, \u201cI\u2019ll take you back to the bus if you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>She looks over at the other guys, who have their eyes glued to the ring, and then turns backs around, now dangerously close. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle and nod. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Just as we move to leave, Leif notices and cups his hands around his mouth. \u201cPssst . . . Ivy, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Ivy turns. \u201cBack to the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? I promised Casper I\u2019d introduce him to you and we planned to go out later,\u201d Leif responds.</p><p>\u201cNext time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no problem. I\u2019ll set something up.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and waves goodbye.</p><p>We make our way back to the bus quickly and when we hit the front lounge she turns toward me. \u201cThank you for bringing me back. I\u2019m really tired and just want to sit around and do nothing for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s no problem. I\u2019m feeling the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to watch a movie or you going to go to bed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatching a movie sounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific. There\u2019s a new movie with that actress Jules Atwood on demand I\u2019ve been dying to catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules Atwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s the actress cast in No Led Zeppelin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I reply with a smirk. \u201cMy cousin\u2019s movie.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cJust give me a minute to change and I\u2019ll meet you in the back lounge.\u201d</p><p>I make a skeptical noise over her choice of movie and she flashes me a grin before leaving the room.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Push-ups, let\u2019s hear your story,\u201d she mock demands as she enters the dimly lit lounge I\u2019m already sitting in watching the all-time classic movie Stripes.</p><p>I swivel around in my chair and glance up. \u201cChicks dig me, because I rarely wear underwear and when I do it\u2019s usually something unusual.\u201d I grin, quoting John Winger\u2019s most awesome line from the movie.</p> <p>She giggles and flops into the chair next to mine. \u201cGod, I haven\u2019t watched this movie in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I almost say Not since the last time I watched it with you, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cCan we watch this instead?\u201d</p><p>I give her a charming smile. \u201cSure, if you insist.\u201d Like she has to ask me twice about skipping what I can only imagine to be a chick flick.</p><p>She has no makeup on, but she doesn\u2019t need it. And when her face is a blank canvas, her eyes seem to always sparkle. Her hair is piled loosely on top of her head, and as she swivels to hoist her feet up on the table, the oversized neckline of her sweatshirt exposes a hint of lace. Fuck, we haven\u2019t been alone like this until now, and I want nothing more than to pull her off that chair and onto my lap.</p><p>We sit next to each other for the rest of the movie and even talk over it at times. But the closest our bodies come to touching is when I kick my boots up on the coffee table next to her bare feet.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t put your shoes on the furniture,\u201d she comments and taps her toes against my boots, shoving my feet down.</p><p>I make an amused face. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. We don\u2019t want to mark up the fine furnishings.\u201d</p><p>She giggles and I toe my boots off, then kick my sock-clad feet back up, where her toes remain very close to mine. Friends, I keep reminding myself. I can do this\u2014establish what we had through friendship first. But no matter how many times I say it in my head, that doesn\u2019t stop me from feeling the way I feel toward her.</p><p>The credits roll. Her feet graze mine for a few long moments\u2014on purpose or by accident, I don\u2019t know, but my body reacts instantly to her touch. She looks at me, biting her lip, and the sight sets me on fire. I rise from my chair, ready to pounce, but she stands at the same time and yawns. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I\u2019m going to call it a night. Thank you for watching that with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Ivy. I really enjoyed the movie and the company.\u201d</p><p>She scurries out of the room without turning back, and for a minute I consider chasing after her, but I head to bed instead.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I awake from a deep sleep. Some nights I sleep like a baby, others I find myself tossing and turning most of the night. Tonight is one of those in-between nights. I open my eyes and find myself spinning the gun on his desk as someone taunts me: \u201cPull the trigger. I dare you. You\u2019re such a sorry excuse of a son. Just do it.\u201d The shadow hovers over me, a face I can\u2019t make out. My heart is pounding and adrenaline pumps through my veins as he urges me to just do it.</p> <p>\u201cXander, man, wake up,\u201d Garrett says, touching my shoulders, shaking me.</p><p>I look up to see him, not my father, standing over me. Fuck, I haven\u2019t had a dream like that in a long time.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks. Sorry if I woke you. Just a bad dream.\u201d He lets the curtain fall back and I shift restlessly for the next few hours.</p><p>After a breakdown on the road, we\u2019re headed to Cleveland, and can finally get off this bus. I\u2019ll be glad to stay in my own room and get some decent rest. I\u2019m too tired to get any work done today. My head is drowning with the same regrets I always have after dreams of my father\u2014mainly one regret\u2014why didn\u2019t I keep my mouth shut? Of course, in my dreams it\u2019s always my father tempting me with death in some way\u2014but three therapists later, the dreams mean the same thing. I have to let my guilt go or the dreams will continue to haunt me. I have no f**king idea how to do that, and seeing a shrink was not my thing\u2014talking about feelings and evaluating everything in my life since I was born is something I ultimately passed on.</p><p>Unable to sleep, I hop out of bed and check my e-mails, but find nothing of concern and no fires to put out, so I decide to go back to bed. Around noon I finally haul my sorry ass up. I skip any kind of workout today\u2014I\u2019m just too drained. The galley is quiet as I walk through it and into the small bathroom. Turning the hot water on in the shower as high as I can, I try to erase the nightmare from my mind and for once just let thoughts of Ivy consume me. The mirror starts to fog up and I think about last night. Shit, all I want to do is make her mine.</p><p>Stripping off my clothes, I\u2019m already half hard just thinking about her, her perfect body, and how much I want to be with her again. I step into the pint-sized shower with my c**k in my hand. I want her hand to curl around me so she\u2019ll feel how hard she makes me. I close my eyes and gently rub, first around my cock, then my balls. Fuck, that feels good. I picture her doing this\u2014in the shower, with us exploring our bodies in any way we want. I want to feel her hands gripping me. I think of her, her face, her body . . . the ways I want to touch her, where I want to touch her. I imagine driving my c**k into her sweet pu**y, and it makes me want to come hard and fast.</p><p>My fist pumps at a quicker pace and I lick the water from my lips. The pressure wells deep and a tingling radiates from my cock. As my orgasm starts to build, so do the contractions\u2014it feels like electricity is shooting through me. My dick twitches and I can\u2019t hold on any longer. As I start to come, practically spasming, the incredible feeling builds and I finally let myself go, crossing that threshold over and over until I\u2019m spent. My chest rises and falls and I slouch back against the shower wall.</p><p>Once my breathing returns to normal, I lather up with soap, rinse it off, and get out of the shower. I don\u2019t bother to shave. Wrapping a towel around my waist, I wipe the steam from the mirror. The ink on my side was always the hope for my future, but I f**ked it up because I never went after it. Hazel eyes and brown hair reflect back and I try to see my life differently from what it really is\u2014I\u2019m thirty f**king years old and I have nothing\u2014nothing that matters, anyway.</p><p>Throwing on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, I attempt to shake off the morning. I print out the daily schedule and post it, then head over to get a cup of coffee. Nix and Garrett sit in comfortable silence in the lounge. Nix is reading the paper and Garrett is eating something that resembles nachos.</p><p>\u201cWant some? There\u2019s plenty,\u201d Garrett says, crunching a chip.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. That looks disgusting. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s classic is what it is\u2014a can of chili con carne, a jar of nacho sauce, and a bag of chips.\u201d</p><p>I pour a cup of the coffee that looks like sludge. \u201cFlynn, your eating habits need some serious help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, watch out\u2014the next time you\u2019re craving my pizza, I might just tell you to make it yourself.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and laugh. \u201cRemind me again when I ever asked you to take a stale-looking hunk of bread and slap a jar of sauce on it?\u201d</p><p>He just grins at me and crunches another chip. I take my coffee and stumble blurry-eyed into the back lounge to catch ESPN. Leif\u2019s in there, and he looks me over.</p><p>\u201cRough night?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I rub my hand over my stubble. \u201cJust ready to get off this bus.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s in the club chair, twirling while watching TV. \u201cI know the feeling. Want to play some ball?\u201d</p><p>Since my mind is shot and I can\u2019t do any work right now . . . \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, I\u2019m killing him. I\u2019ve always been a competitive guy. I don\u2019t f**k around . . . video game or real game, it\u2019s all the same. When my team is beating his, 95 to 72, I yell, \u201cYeah!\u201d and pump my fist in the air.</p><p>He sets the controller down. \u201cBastard! I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are\u2014you sad son of a bitch. You lost! Rematch?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his hand, he says, \u201cNo f**king way. Are we almost there?\u201d</p><p>I glance at my watch and see it\u2019s a little before three. \u201cJohn said we\u2019d be there before five. What\u2019s your rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wish there were chicks on this bus so I could get a handy while we wait.\u201d</p><p>Unable to believe his candor, I have to laugh. \u201cWhat about that girl of yours you\u2019re always talking on the phone with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe dumped my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so punchy. Makes sense now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but tonight I\u2019m not only getting stone drunk, you can bet I\u2019ll be taking as many BJs as are offered my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she break it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girl?\u201d</p><p>I grin at him. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about your dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d he says.</p><p>Leif and I have really hit it off and I enjoy having him around.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, what happened?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pissed that I\u2019m on the same bus as Ivy.\u201d</p><p>This piques my interest. \u201cWhy? Do the two of you have something going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, no. She\u2019s like my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you explain that to your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I\u2019ve talked about it so much that last night after another fight, I was over it and just said fine, believe what you want. You want to believe I\u2019d cheat, believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s definitely not the cheater,\u201d Ivy chimes in. She\u2019s standing behind my chair and I whirl around. Her words assault me and her eyes flash to me in an accusatory manner, but the moment passes quickly. She moves next to Leif and picks up his controller, then adds, \u201cJust give her some time and then call her back\u2014she knows you\u2019re not the kind of guy who\u2019d cheat.\u201d She tips her head to the side and Leif moves out of the chair. She flops down in it and when she does her knee grazes mine, and every muscle in my body clenches. I want that two seconds of contact to happen over and over. She looks at me. \u201cGo for the championship?\u201d</p><p>I quickly focus my eyes on the TV. \u201cBring it, baby.\u201d The word baby slips out. Ivy remains still for a moment, but Leif doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>With the Lakers just catching their stride, Garrett, in all his annoyance, stands in front of me. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you make like Michael Jackson and beat it? My turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeat it yourself, asswipe. We\u2019re not in elementary school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! So take your loss like a man and move on out so a real player can beat a chick,\u201d he says, snatching the remote from me.</p><p>I stand up. \u201cThis ought to be good. You haven\u2019t beaten me in anything since . . . oh yeah, never. Unless you cheat, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d he says and starts to play.</p><p>I lean against the window to watch. But under her breath I hear Ivy mutter, \u201cThat\u2019s the pot calling the kettle black.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve had just about enough of leaving the past in the past. It\u2019s time to have that conversation I\u2019ve been holding back on. So when Nix walks in the room, I ask him, \u201cNix, why don\u2019t you take over for Ivy? I need to talk to her about something.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me with a fierceness in her eyes I\u2019m not used to seeing, but I\u2019m ready\u2014it\u2019s time to come clean. I nod toward her bedroom and she stands with a huff, throwing the controller down. \u201cXander, I told you let\u2019s leave the past in the past,\u201d she tells me in a whisper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leif\u2019s phone rings and when he looks at the screen, he heads our way. \u201cMind if I go in your room, Ivy? It\u2019s Amber and I think I should grovel in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. I\u2019m fine out here,\u201d she tells him, directing all her coldness my way.</p><p>Garrett looks up at me. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeachy,\u201d I answer and head for the front lounge for another cup of sludge, but as I walk I wonder if telling her the truth even matters.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Less than an hour later we pull into the Hyatt Regency at the Cleveland Arcade. I\u2019m in the galley on the phone with Ena making sure the merchandise for this week\u2019s shows will arrive on time, not late like last week.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t f**king help to have T-shirts at a concert once the concert is over,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI know, Xander, but I can\u2019t control the pace at which UPS decides to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEna, just overnight the shit for next week. We\u2019re missing out on a huge financial opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I will. But just remember when you pay the bills, it was your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I gotta run. I\u2019ll check in tomorrow.\u201d I hit END and hoist my bag onto my shoulder\u2014so ready to get off this bus.</p><p>Entering the hotel, I glance around. This place is completely cool. It\u2019s two large buildings linked together by a wall of glass-framed windows. By far one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture I\u2019ve ever seen, with its old railings and wooden trim. In its day it must have been a place to see.</p><p>I get us all checked in and luckily we each have our own room. Garrett takes the room keys while I sign for everything. When I turn around, everyone has disappeared. The lobby is oddly quiet, but the bar is not. A happy hour sign reads TWO FOR ONE. The elevators are to the right of the bar and Leif stands near them, just staring off into space.</p><p>Approaching him, I ask, \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well. She\u2019s in love with someone else. That\u2019s the real reason she wanted to break up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That sucks. But better to find out now. How about I take you out tonight? Get your mind off everything,\u201d I ask as I press the UP button.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me where and when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a club in the warehouse district with a band playing I\u2019ve heard a lot about. I\u2019m going to check them out later. Meet me in the lobby around ten.\u201d The elevator doors open and we get in.</p><p>\u201cI plan to get really shitfaced. I\u2019m just warning you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d I remember the shit River and Dahlia went through last year when I had to take care of his sorry ass after he tried to drown himself in booze rather than tell her what he knew. Not that I haven\u2019t done the same many times. So, shit, a guy whose girl broke up with him\u2014I can handle that.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Blurred Lines</p><p>Ordinarily, I love staying in a hotel\u2014a room to myself, privacy, a decent shower, and a comfortable bed. But by the time I exit the elevator a few hours later, I already miss having Ivy close. So I\u2019m not only surprised but somewhat elated when I hit the lobby and see her sitting in a plush chair near the lounge. I didn\u2019t realize she was coming with us\u2014not that I mind. She\u2019s on the phone, so I just nod a quick hello to her. She gives me a slight smile in return. She\u2019s a knockout in a black minidress and flat sandals. Her hair is down and straight, with a few strands draping over her eyes. I wish I could push them aside so I could see the deep blue of her eyes. I find Nix and Garrett standing near the bar, deep in conversation. Leif doesn\u2019t seem to be down here yet. The bar is open to the lobby, so as I walk up to them I catch the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Phoebe?\u201d Garrett asks Nix.</p><p>\u201cThat teacher I met at the party at the Pelican. She\u2019s from San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. No recollection of you hanging with any girl, especially a smart one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Nix snaps.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the talk about a girl?\u201d I ask them.</p><p>Garrett knocks shoulders with Nix. \u201cThis guy over here invited a chick to fly out and meet him, and she arrives tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. Are you serious?\u201d I\u2019m somewhat impressed that Nix cares about anyone enough to make an extra effort. It\u2019s the first I\u2019ve ever seen him do something like this.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I remember her now. She was the one wearing that slinky purple number with the really low-cut neck, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Garrett makes a gesture with his fists on his chest and shakes them.</p><p>Nix scowls. \u201cYou\u2019re so immature, Flynn. Get a life and get out of mine.\u201d</p><p>Leif walks across the lobby wearing neatly pressed jeans and a starched button-down\u2014slightly more dressed up than the rest of us\u2014Ivy excluded, of course. Who the hell irons their jeans anyway? Ivy notices him and quickly gets off the phone, and they both approach us at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d she asks Leif.</p><p>He nods. \u201cNever better. I\u2019m ready to let off some steam on the dance floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to a dance club?\u201d she asks, looking my way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a dance club per se, but they must have a dance floor since there\u2019s a band.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cStill don\u2019t dance?\u201d</p><p>I give a slight shake of my head and our eyes find each other and lock together for a moment. A flush passes over her face. Was her question a slip? This is the first acknowledgment she\u2019s made out loud in front of others that she knows me from years ago. The softness in her voice and the look in her eyes tell me she remembers how she used to try to get me on the dance floor. Her only victory was her senior prom, where I danced every slow dance with her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hit it. I\u2019m ready to party.\u201d Leif steps in, oblivious to the connection Ivy and I are sharing.</p><p>When Garrett adds, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s party like it\u2019s 1999,\u201d our stare falters and laughter overtakes all of us.</p><p>Outside, the night is warm and the sky is clear\u2014a perfect summer evening that holds the prospect of a good time. This is just what we all need after the vigorous schedule we\u2019ve been keeping. The waiting SUV approaches and Nix hops in the front seat while Garrett and Leif climb in the back, leaving the middle bench seat open. \u201cYour carriage awaits,\u201d I joke, bowing and motioning with my hand that she is next.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI wish!\u201d</p><p>When she disappears into the vehicle, I can\u2019t help but notice how perfect her ass looks. I step in and before I even settle in my seat, I feel it\u2014the energy that zaps through my body whenever she\u2019s close. The guys are talking about the city and what they plan on doing tomorrow, but I\u2019m lost in my own thoughts. I glance down, unable to stop myself from looking at her. When I do, I find that her minidress is riding up so high I can see the lacy bottom of her boy shorts. I run my hands over my face\u2014the sight of her skin mixed with the lace does things to my body that I have to make myself suppress. I\u2019m also pretty sure I could see the crotch of her panties if it were light enough in here.</p><p>Leaning over, I whisper, \u201cDon\u2019t you think your dress is a bit short?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and tucks into my side. Her warm breath on my neck makes me grip the seat to stop from running my hands between her thighs. \u201cI like it that way. You never know when it will come in handy,\u201d she purrs.</p><p>My jaw clenches and I shut up\u2014I\u2019m not used to hearing her talk like that, and I don\u2019t trust what might come out of my mouth if I say anything else. I know she doesn\u2019t mean it. I know she\u2019s not that kind of girl. I also know I\u2019d never let anything like that happen.</p><p>We arrive at the Black Dog later than I planned. It\u2019s a bit off the beaten path, so I\u2019m already expecting the hole-in-the-wall that we walk into. It\u2019s dark, dingy, and smells like smoke, but jam-packed. We push our way through the pulsating throng of people and toward the bar. \u201cFive shooters,\u201d I mouth to the bartender. He nods and melts away into the cries of the other thirsty customers. My eyes adjust to the darkness as I look around. Bright lights from the neon signs on the wall illuminate the faces in the crowd, but I can\u2019t locate the band. There is a floor above us that seems to be a loft of sorts with tables and chairs, and a floor directly below us where I can see the tops of people\u2019s bopping heads, which tells me there\u2019s a dance floor down there.</p><p>When the band starts playing, my ears go on instant alert so I can zero in on their sound. I hear a trumpet in the mix of a guitar and drums, and it reminds me of something my dad would appreciate. Anything out of the ordinary, anything that would bring attention and help speed a single up the charts. Something he would latch onto and study\u2014that was just his thing.</p><p>\u201cIs this the band you were telling me about earlier?\u201d Nix asks.</p><p>I blink myself out of my thoughts. \u201cYeah. I think they call themselves Echo, and the trumpet player also plays keys. A buddy of mine told me I had to look them up. I figured I\u2019d listen for myself when he said he was surprised they hadn\u2019t made it bigger over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat concept. I really like the horns mixed in,\u201d Nix comments.</p><p>\u201cI need to hear a few more songs, but yeah, I agree.\u201d It\u2019s a memorable sound, and I\u2019m glad I found the time to come listen. Soon the bartender returns with our drinks. I hand the shots around and let my fingers graze Ivy\u2019s hand as I pass one to her. Her face remains stoic, but her body responds instantly. Her ni**les harden and I can see them through her tight dress. Leaning over, I ask her, \u201cAre you cold?\u201d She smirks at me and in the most casual way she gives me the middle finger. I nearly drop my glass trying not to laugh. I\u2019ve never seen her do that.</p><p>Leif raises his shot glass. \u201cHere\u2019s to everyone getting lucky tonight.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, knowing he\u2019s out to get laid and hoping he stays sober enough to get it up. I order another round of shots adding beers as well and we all stand around shooting the shit. After a couple more drinks Leif turns toward a redheaded chick in a tight pink dress sitting at the bar and starts talking to her.</p><p>Garrett starts telling Ivy about the girl Nix has joining him. He seems oblivious to the tension between the two of us, but Nix has been homing in on it. \u201cEverything okay with you and Ivy?\u201d he mutters so she can\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool, but if you want to, I\u2019m here to listen.\u201d</p><p>I nod and take a swig of my beer. The four us stand huddled together at the bar, talking, listening to the band, and having a few more drinks. Before I know it Nix is jetting off to the airport to pick up the girl he\u2019s flying in. I glance over at Leif and see that he seems pretty happy. The redhead is sitting on his lap with her hands all over him\u2014doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll be dancing tonight. The band takes a break and dance music is piped in. Ivy raises her eyes and laughs. \u201cSee, we are at a dance club,\u201d she says.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh back. She excuses herself to use the restroom and after ten minutes when she hasn\u2019t returned, I grow concerned and move around to look for her.</p><p>Garrett and I check out the place and end up near the railing overlooking the dance floor, where I spot her immediately. The sheen of her tan legs, the sparkle of her earrings, and the glimmer of her sandals\u2014she seems to shine under the beaming crosses of light reflected from above. She\u2019s dancing with some dick in a white tank top whose hands are all over her ass. Tattoos cover his arms and multiple piercings ornament his ears. He just looks like trouble. My breathing reaches an alarming rate, my heart pounds, and my brain tries to maintain its cool as songs change from one to the next. We stay glued to the same spot, just watching her.</p><p>When the guy she\u2019s dancing with pushes her up against a wall and grinds into her, I lose all control.</p><p>Garrett puts a hand on my shoulder just as my foot perches on the rung of the railing. \u201cLet her handle it, Xander. She\u2019s pushing him away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ignore him and hop the rail in front of me, jumping the four feet between levels and crossing the floor to reach her. The ass**le still hasn\u2019t let go of her, even though she clearly wants him to. He\u2019s about my build, but I know I could take him in a heartbeat. I grip both of his shoulders and pull him back, yanking his hands off her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her like that,\u201d I growl, seething.</p><p>He looks at me, a little surprised, and flashes a mouth full of brilliant white teeth my way. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am, do you?\u201d is all he says. Then he turns and shuffles through the crowd without a word. That was easy enough.</p> <p>I look into her eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods but looks a little shaken.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d I take hold of her arm and step toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me!\u201d She tries to yank her arm away.</p><p>I flip around and lean close to whisper in her ear, \u201cI will after I talk to you.\u201d I slide back and my eyes narrow in on her.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she says, relenting. \u201cBut I could have handled him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t look that way,\u201d I mutter, again turning and leading her to the second floor, where I saw tables and chairs earlier. I indicate a chair with a dip of my chin and she sits. I do the same.</p><p>\u201cI was just dancing with him. He owns the club, and besides, we were only talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who he is. And it didn\u2019t look like he was just talking. It looked more like he was trying to take you in the back room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he was, it\u2019s my choice if I go. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>I nod, because that\u2019s all I can do. Fuck, I knew I couldn\u2019t do this. I knew Ivy joining the band was something I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle. I lean back in my chair and my gaze spears her, but words escape me. Fuck, I want her to choose me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d she asks, with more pain in her voice than I\u2019ve ever heard. I want to say you, but first it\u2019s time to come clean.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. \u201cIvy, I want to explain everything to you. I want you to listen and really think about what I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d I\u2019m nervous as hell about telling her the truth, because if she doesn\u2019t believe me it could undo the relationship we\u2019ve built in the short time we\u2019ve been together on tour. And if she does believe me but doesn\u2019t care\u2014well, that\u2019s what scares the shit out of me the most.</p><p>She\u2019s fidgeting. First clasping her hands together, then moving the candle around in the middle of the table. She blows it out, then looks at me. \u201cXander, I don\u2019t need the dramatics and I really don\u2019t need to talk about you and Tessa, or for that matter, you and Amy or any other \u2018friends\u2019 from that circle.\u201d She air quotes the word friends and I know seeing Amy with me must have stung, but it wasn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s not like it carried on from high school to now. We met back up years after high school, and it was more of a convenience than anything else for the both of us.</p><p>I take her chin in my hand, and even after all the alcohol her eyes are crystal clear and piercing. I take a deep breath and go for it. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. It wasn\u2019t what you thought. That night we were supposed to meet at my grandparents\u2019 . . .\u201d The music suddenly stops and the lights turn on, cutting off my words. There\u2019s a commotion from below and I stand up and look downstairs to see what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cStay here!\u201d I tell Ivy.</p><p>Her eyes flip to mine. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay here. Leif must have pissed off the wrong person.\u201d</p><p>The stairs are a few feet away and I take them two at a time. When I reach the bottom, three brutish dudes, each weighing at least two hundred seventy pounds, approach me and clutch my arms, dragging me into the back storage room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d I yell.</p><p>They stop just inside the door, and I look around to see where I am. The room is lined with boxes, some tossed, some stacked, some filled with empty liquor bottles\u2014it\u2019s a f**king mess.</p><p>The brute with a studded black leather belt cinching his jeans stands in front of me and smiles. He\u2019s missing a tooth and another one is capped in gold.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d I yell again, trying to break away, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou need to learn some manners,\u201d he hisses.</p><p>I swallow hard and take small breaths as the two of them hold me and Missing Tooth swings at me. His fists are like sledgehammers as they hit me. My face. My chest. My stomach\u2014fuck, that hurt.</p><p>\u201cLeave your hands off a guy when he\u2019s making his move on a chick. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask, just f**king curious as to why an owner feels the need to sic his bulldogs on patrons of his bar.</p><p>\u201cThe question is who do you think you are?\u201d he grunts.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer but instead spit on the ground. Probably not the best idea. The bald guy punches me one more time in the gut. With a murky laugh, he says, \u201cGet him out of here\u201d to the guys holding me.</p><p>It happens in unison. They both tug my arms and drag me back into the bar. Before they drop their hold, the ass**le with the lip piercing says, \u201cYou heard him. Get the f**k out of here and don\u2019t ever come back.\u201d</p><p>My eyes swivel around, looking for Ivy, and I make a move to head back up the stairs. I\u2019ve decided to keep my mouth shut not because I\u2019m worried about what they might do to me but because I need to find Ivy.</p><p>\u201cI said get out,\u201d one of them growls as the other moves to stand next to him.</p><p>\u201cOne on one, dude\u2014just you and me,\u201d I hiss back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. The owner wants you out and I hope you got his message. Oh and he already removed that hot piece of ass himself before he ran into your posse.\u201d</p><p>I try not to let him see me flinch. He motions to the bar, where Leif is getting the shit kicked out of him by some other dirtbag who probably weighs twice as much as him. People near the bar are scurrying out of his way.</p><p>I hear the dirtbag scream, \u201cTell your friend she might want to think twice before being a c**k tease again.\u201d</p><p>Breathe, I tell myself. I need to find Ivy, and the only way to do that is to stay calm and get the f**k out of here.</p><p>I put my hands up in surrender, though it kills me not to kick the shit out of these guys. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Call your friend off mine and we\u2019ll get out of here.\u201d</p><p>The one with the dark hair that flops in his eyes smiles, and I want to rip his teeth out of his mouth. He whistles and the dirtbag looks up. He slices his finger across his neck and eyes me, pushing me to the door. I turn and just as I approach Leif, the dirtbag shoves him at me. \u201cDon\u2019t forget this piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. We can\u2019t just leave,\u201d Leif coughs out.</p><p>\u201cShut up. Now,\u201d I hiss under my breath and exit the door with Leif by my side.</p><p>\u201cXander, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Garrett yells to me from just outside the door.</p><p>My eyes search for Ivy as the fury builds within me. If she\u2019s not out here I\u2019m going to kill those bastards. When Garrett jolts toward me to grab Leif, I spot her sitting on the curb. Rushing over, I jump in front of her as cars honk for me to get out of their way. I take her hands, pull her up, and move us to the sidewalk as my eyes scan her from head to toe. \u201cDid they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-o-o,\u201d she stammers.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ask, caressing her cheek.</p><p>She looks at me and her fingers touch my lip. \u201cI should be asking you that question,\u201d she says with tears in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pull her to me and tuck her head into my shoulder. \u201cWhat are you sorry for, baby?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said yes to dancing with that ass**le,\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cIvy, are you all right?\u201d Leif calls out.</p><p>Hearing Leif\u2019s voice, she pulls away from me and turns around. Running to him, she takes his face in her hands. \u201cWhy did you go back in after they asked us to leave?\u201d</p><p>Even though he\u2019s bleeding and Garrett\u2019s holding him up, he manages to babble, \u201cBecause I had a chick waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>She shoves his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, but one minute some hot piece of ass has her hands in my pants and the next I\u2019m getting the shit kicked out of me. Talk about a c**k block,\u201d he says, looking down at his open zipper.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, surveying him for anything more than superficial wounds.</p><p>\u201cI was better with that chick\u2019s hand wrapped around my dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeif, you\u2019re so drunk. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Ivy asks, placing his other arm over her shoulder.</p><p>His tone sobers instantly at the sound of concern in her voice. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. What happened, anyway?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s suddenly more composed, wiped clean of emotion. She\u2019s the same resilient, undaunted girl she always was. She takes his arm over her shoulder and tells him about the guy she was dancing with. I don\u2019t need to relive it, so I turn away and call the driver. \u201cYeah, Scott, we\u2019re ready to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Every inch of me is tense and the pressure in my chest keeps increasing. It\u2019s eight thirty in the morning and I\u2019m standing outside her door. I didn\u2019t sleep all night. I got up way too early and went for a run in a useless attempt to push thoughts of her aside, but I couldn\u2019t\u2014I have to talk to her. When I knock she doesn\u2019t answer, so I keep pounding, louder and louder. She finally cracks the door open, leaving the chain on it.</p><p>\u201cXander, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asks in a low croak.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get dressed and meet me downstairs in the coffee bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, give me thirty minutes.\u201d She huffs loudly and slams the door.</p><p>Her favorite drink was always a vanilla latte, so I take a chance and order her one. I grab myself a coffee and down a red-eye. Leaning over the railing, I think about us and wonder how different things might have been if I\u2019d told her the truth way back when. The line for coffee grows as the room starts to fill with people, but I spot her as soon as she enters the atrium. She looks incredible\u2014white shorts, a tight red tank top that hugs her body in just the right way, and some kind of black wedge sandals. The sight of her makes my pulse race so fast that my fingers are trembling.</p><p>She enters the coffee bar just as I turn around. Spotting me, she walks slowly. Her gaze is fixed on mine and for a moment her face is soft, calm even, but the closer she gets the more unflappable she becomes. When I reach out to offer her the latte, she smiles and takes it.</p><p>\u201cVanilla,\u201d I tell her as I run a nervous hand through my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou remembered,\u201d she says with the first genuine smile I\u2019ve seen cross her face.</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget? We drank our way through late nights and early mornings with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still drink them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I changed to regular coffee. Couldn\u2019t take the sweetness after a while.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers touch my lip, and my body comes alive. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>I c**k my head and press back my smile. \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, again I\u2019m really sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have danced with that ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a lot.\u201d After a few seconds of silence, I add, \u201cI checked on Leif and he\u2019s actually fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I checked on him too.\u201d She clears her throat and the easy back-and-forth of our conversation is over. She takes a sip of her latte and asks, \u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>My brain is warring with my lips to keep me from leaning down and kissing her as she licks the excess froth from her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cXander?\u201d</p><p>I lose myself for a moment, but the softness in her voice brings me back. \u201cI actually want to take you someplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the band?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just you and me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ve told you this a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t talk about anything you don\u2019t want to. Just come with me. I promise it\u2019s a place you\u2019ll love.\u201d</p><p>She wavers and takes a deep breath. \u201cFine. But only because I\u2019m dressed and have nothing else to do. And you\u2019re buying me a muffin first.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cAh. I can definitely do that.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Last night another wall came down between us, and although Ivy is still guarded, she actually seems to be warming up to me. My plan was to talk to her after I took her out for the day, but now that I\u2019ve promised not to talk about the past, I\u2019ll just have to take the conversations as they come. I already believe she\u2019s who I need, but I just need to convince her I\u2019m who she needs. I wanted to take her someplace I know we\u2019ll both enjoy.</p><p>The sign reads: OHIO HISTORICAL MARKER\u2014BIRTHPLACE OF ROCK \u2019N\u2019 ROLL. From afar, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame building is truly stunning. Ivy\u2019s face lights up when she sees it.</p><p>Pointing to it, she says, \u201cLook, Xander, it looks like the pictures of the Louvre you sent me.\u201d</p><p>And it does. The building is made up of geometric shapes resembling triangles that seem to shadow the lake. And although Ivy\u2019s enthusiasm puts the biggest smile on my face, it\u2019s the sound of her voice that melts my heart\u2014the way she just said, \u201cLook, Xander.\u201d</p><p>As we exit the cab I know without a doubt . . . I\u2019m still in love with this girl. And nothing can sour my mood. We enter the building. \u201cWhere to first?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She\u2019s studying the map and points to a small red dot. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cCould you be more specific?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Beatles exhibit. I really want to see John Lennon\u2019s acoustic guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Beatles it is.\u201d I take her hand without thinking and lead her to the exhibit she selected.</p><p>Morning stretches into afternoon as we pass from Metallica to the Rolling Stones memorabilia. We talk about each artifact, spending the most time in the Jimi Hendrix forum.</p><p>When we get to the Janis Joplin area, Ivy studies the jewelry pieces on display. I lean against the glass and just watch her eyes twinkle. \u201cHey, guess what River gave Dahlia as a wedding present.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me and bites her lip. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The heat I\u2019ve felt between us all day\u2014the ease of two people having a great time\u2014seems to flare. \u201cThe gold bangles that Grandpa gave Grandma. Remember, the ones Janis wore all the time and gave to my grandfather when she found out Grandma was mad at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember them. That was a really sweet gift.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment sadness crosses her features, but it quickly passes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move on. The Who or Michael Jackson?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m pretty tired. Late night, early morning. What do you say we call it a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, a little disappointed that our day is already ending. \u201cLet\u2019s just slip in the movie theater and watch a few minutes of Dick Clark\u2019s American Bandstand.\u201d</p><p>She raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you have to admit it. Best damn television idea second to none. It was reality TV before reality TV.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkles her nose. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>Boarding the escalator, we head to the second floor and enter the dark theater. We take seats near the back and watch as eager teenagers try to get the attention of a very young Dick Clark. We watch the show and I lean closer toward her. She stays put and never glances over toward me. I rest my hand on the arm of the chair and force my eyes to the screen. My breathing takes effort and I hear my own heart pounding. Heat rushes through me and my boldness comes alive in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cIvy,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She swallows and meets my gaze. \u201cShh . . .\u201d</p><p>The way she turns is slow and sensual and it completely steals my breath away. I lean back a little in my chair and give her another glance. I feel like a kid again in the movie theater, wanting to make out with my girl, and the tent in the middle of my jeans is a dead giveaway. What the hell is wrong with me? I reach over and drop my hand to the bare skin of her leg. She stiffens.</p><p>\u201cIvy,\u201d I whisper again.</p><p>She turns her head and I focus on her face, her eyes. I stare at her lips. I imagine sliding my tongue down the smooth curve of her arm and shoulder. I sit here as long as I can until I can\u2019t take another minute of wanting her. I lean over and pull her face toward mine. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s breathing. I stop short of her lips and just hold her close to me. I feel the rush of adrenaline as my need for her spikes with every passing second.</p><p>Then, just as I brush my lips over hers, she stands up. \u201cI can\u2019t. Please don\u2019t do that again. I want to be your friend, but that\u2019s all,\u201d she says and rushes out of the theater. I run after her, but before I can catch her, she hops in a cab and is gone. And just like that, so is our perfect day.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Radioactive</p><p>After the Cleveland show the dynamics of the bus changed\u2014I had a lot of work to get done. Ivy hadn\u2019t committed to staying with the band after the tour, and I doubted she would, so I was putting some feelers out trying to see who might be available. And the guys\u2019 social lives were running rampant. Not only did Nix invite Phoebe to join him for the rest of the tour, but Leif seemed to be on a mission to get laid in every city as much as possible. This often meant a stowaway on board from one stop to the next. It also meant I ended up staying out of the galley as much as possible. Nix and Phoebe aren\u2019t exactly quiet and Leif doesn\u2019t care who hears.</p><p>Spending more time in the lounges hasn\u2019t been all that bad, because surprisingly, Ivy seems to be doing the same. She wasn\u2019t kidding about wanting to be friends. At some times it\u2019s exhilarating and at others it\u2019s exasperating, but at least we\u2019re spending time together . . . We talk about nothing that matters, we eat together, we play video games, and even watch TV, but now we never do any of these things alone. Garrett is always with us, and the minute he leaves so does she\u2014my guess is the friends thing is just as hard for her as for me, because while most of the hostility between us seems to have eased, the tension hasn\u2019t.</p><p>Unfortunately something else has changed as well\u2014Ivy can no longer go out without being recognized. The first few weeks with her trademark locks cut shorter, plus having been out of the limelight for almost a year, we were able to move around each city easily. But after the Detroit show, her performance was so dynamic that it went viral. Ivy has gotten in the habit of singing a cover at each performance, and that night\u2019s cover was \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble.\u201d Her rave-y, edgy performance unhinged the audience and they went crazy. The way she sang that particular song made it come alive. She turned it into her own and I f**king loved it. It was catchy in her key and she gave it a rhythm and flow that rocked the audience. It exploded all over the Internet, and overnight the Wilde Ones became Ivy\u2019s band and Ivy was being sought out. The next three stops after that we all stayed on the bus, and tonight is no different.</p><p>I\u2019d fallen asleep early with my headphones on, and another f**king dream woke me up. My dreams come more and more frequently lately. For some reason my dad is weighing heavy on my mind during this tour. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the fact that he wanted this life and I wonder why he did when he had a family or if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve started to think about what kind of life I could have while doing this. Getting out of bed, I throw a shirt on and head to the front lounge to grab a bottle of water, and as I do, I hear voices and laughter from the back lounge. Heading that way, I take a whiff of the air and the smell of cigar smoke has me more than curious as to what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Pausing in the doorway of the back lounge, I take in the scene. Everyone is sitting together and playing cards. Garrett is leaning back in a metal folding chair holding a drink in his hand with a cigar resting over the edge of a bowl. Nix is reclining comfortably in one of the club chairs tapping one hand on the table while holding his cards in the other. Ivy, sitting in the other club chair, is wearing black sleep pants with some print all over them and a white tank top. Again she\u2019s wearing no makeup and has her hair pulled back\u2014she looks so much like she did when she was eighteen. Fuck, she\u2019s gorgeous. Even when she throws her cards on the table with a disgusted look on her face she\u2019s still sexy as f**k. Leif glances around the circle with a huge-ass grin on his face and fans his cards out almost methodically before laying them down. \u201cFull house, aces high,\u201d he says and pulls the pile of guitar picks his way.</p><p>Garrett slams his drink down. \u201cI\u2019m out fifty bucks, thanks to your sorry ass. I think you\u2019re cheating.\u201d</p><p>Leif just laughs at him and continues to rake in the pot. Phoebe throws her cards in and gets up from her chair to sit on Nix\u2019s lap. She\u2019s an attractive girl\u2014average height, maybe a little shorter than Ivy, with chin-length dark hair. Her skin tone is very close to Nix\u2019s. I\u2019d guess that she\u2019s either Italian or Hispanic.</p><p>I stand silent in the doorway, continuing to watch them, but mostly watching Ivy. She pulls her legs up in the chair and wraps her arms around her knees. When I cover my mouth to stifle a yawn, she glances my way. A small smile forms on her lips, and her eyes sweep over me before they lock on mine. I grin at her and button up my shirt before joining the group. She drops her eyes and stretches her legs out over the empty chair next to her. I wonder what she\u2019s thinking when she looks at me like that and why when I catch her doing it she always looks away.</p><p>Garrett looks up. \u201cHey, man, glad you decided to wake up. Welcome to the party.\u201d</p><p>He looks like such a clown gripping that cigar between his teeth and talking around it. He motions to the chair Ivy has her legs on. \u201cPerfect timing. We need another. Phoebe quit playing and I\u2019m about to unless my luck turns.\u201d He takes a puff on his cigar and coughs a little. I bite back the laughter. Phoebe\u2019s not happy as the cigar smoke wafts her way. She waves it out of her face and makes an exaggerated choking noise before resting her head against Nix\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s going to beat your ass for smoking in here,\u201d I scold him, more mocking than serious, although John just might do that.</p><p>He sets his cigar back down in the bowl. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to explain to him that a fine cigar is just like a woman. If you don\u2019t light it up at the right time and suck on it with a certain ferverence, it\u2019ll go out on you.\u201d He waves his arms to the right, where the window blinds are pulled up. \u201cAnd besides, I opened all the windows.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughs, even Ivy. I look around at the glasses on the table and I know they\u2019ve all been hitting the wine pretty hard. Glancing sideways, I notice there are at least four empty bottles in the sink of the bar area and another open one on the small counter.</p><p>Nix looks at Garrett dumbfounded. \u201cFerverence? Is that even a word and where the hell did you pick it up? Wheel of Fortune? Jeopardy!? Either way, you\u2019re watching too much f**king TV.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything to that. I just throw two twenties on the table. \u201cDeal me in.\u201d</p><p>Nix reaches around Phoebe to take my money and shoves a bunch of picks my way and I notice the glass in front of him has an amber-colored liquid in it\u2014definitely not wine.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have what you\u2019re drinking,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>I glance down at Ivy\u2019s legs stretched across the chair. Her feet are bare and her nails are painted red. \u201cMay I?\u201d I ask. My gaze fastens on hers. I wait for her response. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulls her legs off the chair and sinks as far as she can back into her own seat. \u201cWelcome to the game.\u201d</p><p>I sit down and lean forward, inching my way closer to her to take the drink Nix hands me. I take a sip before setting it down on the table and notice she\u2019s still watching me. I divert my eyes only when Leif asks, \u201cNo wine, man? It\u2019s the good stuff. I picked it up at a local vineyard yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Raising my glass, I say, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He feigns offense.</p> <p>I try not to stare as Ivy raises her glass for a sip, but when my eyes catch her mouth, I can\u2019t keep from watching. She licks her lips and says, \u201cI really like it.\u201d I know she\u2019s answering Leif, but I feel like she\u2019s talking to me, and I can\u2019t help but smile\u2014my mind wandering to thoughts of what I know she likes.</p><p>Slamming his hand in front of me, Garrett slips in, \u201cI\u2019ll take your money any day of the week.\u201d</p><p>I look over toward him as he gulps the rest of the liquid in his glass. \u201cI doubt you\u2019ll be taking my money because if memory serves me correctly, I\u2019m the one who taught your scrawny thirteen-year-old ass how to play this game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we didn\u2019t use money back then, just beer bottle caps, and I was usually the one who drank most of the beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were so funny when you drank. You just couldn\u2019t handle your alcohol,\u201d Ivy blurts out. It\u2019s the first time any of us has talked about being together when we were younger, and I notice that her gaze flitters from Garrett\u2019s face to mine before she looks down at the table. When she reaches out to push some chips forward, her hand grazes mine. The skin on my arm prickles and the electricity between us sparks immediately. She quickly moves her hand away and crosses her arms over her chest, but I already noticed her ni**les harden from our encounter. I want more than anything to sit in that chair with her on my lap. To slip my arm around her waist and pull her close to me like I always did when we played poker with River and his friends.</p> <p>\u201cCold?\u201d I ask, wishing I could drape my body over hers and warm her up.</p><p>Flushing, she rubs her arms. \u201cYes, I am. I\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019m going to get a sweater.\u201d At least I didn\u2019t get the finger.</p><p>She stands up and I watch her step across the room and then disappear through the doorway. A few minutes later she\u2019s back with a sweater wrapped around her and when she sits down, I can smell her sweet scent in the air.</p><p>Nix shuffles the cards around Phoebe like he\u2019s a dealer in Vegas.</p><p>\u201cYou smell good,\u201d I mumble in her direction.</p><p>Her cheeks turn pink again and I just smirk at her. I know she sprayed some kind of perfume on when she grabbed her sweater.</p> <p>Nix continues to shuffle the cards and his eyes dart to Garrett. \u201cYou in or out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn,\u201d he says with a scowl, and adds, \u201cBut if I lose this one, I\u2019m done, busted, broke, annihilated. Do I need to go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, dude, just stop whining and ante up. You\u2019re holding up the game.\u201d</p><p>Garrett throws his picks in the middle of the table, and Nix sets the deck down next to Ivy. She cuts it and finally he deals. She gets the first card, since she is to Nix\u2019s immediate left. I get mine next. I stare at the two cards beside each other on the table and try to block memories of playing this game alone with her years ago in my grandparents\u2019 pool house. We didn\u2019t play for money, though\u2014we played for clothes. I\u2019m sure she remembers. Once the cards are dealt, she leans a little my way and I can smell that fresh, soapy scent even more. I get lost in it and those memories come flooding back.</p><p>\u201cXander, snap out of it. What are you doing?\u201d Nix calls me out.</p><p>I blink, realizing I haven\u2019t even looked at the cards in my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll raise,\u201d I say, tossing four picks in the middle.</p><p>Everyone starts laughing except Ivy. She leans toward me and whispers in my ear. \u201cI checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I mutter under my breath.</p> <p>Her body stiffens and she sits back in her chair.</p><p>I turn my attention to the guys. \u201cSo I\u2019m tired. Give me a f**king break. I meant to say I\u2019d open. Either way, see it or fold, ass**les.\u201d</p><p>Needless to say, the first hand ends with me losing. As the game continues, Garrett\u2019s luck seems to have changed. He\u2019s raking it in. About two hours later, the room\u2019s a little fuzzy and if Ivy moves any closer to me I think I\u2019m going to lose it in my pants right here. Shit, I have to get my dick under control.</p><p>\u201cLast hand of the night,\u201d Nix calls and deals the cards.</p><p>Nix makes his way around the table, but Leif tosses his hand down. \u201cI fold.\u201d</p><p>Garrett lights the tip of his cigar again and inhales before showing us his cards. \u201cCall it a straight, baby, all the way,\u201d he boasts.</p><p>Ivy smiles and lays her cards flat but upside down. \u201cI fold too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of this f**king game,\u201d Nix calls out, running his fingers down Phoebe\u2019s bare arms.</p><p>I look at the cards in my hand. Rubbing my nails on my chest, then blowing on my cards, I grin. \u201cFour of a kind. Pay up, buddy.\u201d I slowly fan my cards out. Garrett\u2019s face falls like the cigar he\u2019s stubbing out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k, Ivy?\u201d he blurts out.</p><p>Everyone looks her way and back at Garrett, who has his hands up in surrender, grinning ear to ear. Nix gestures Phoebe off his lap and Garrett\u2019s up and running. Leif and Nix fly after him.</p><p>Ivy quickly pushes the scattered cards on the table into a pile. Her cheeks are bright red. She\u2019s so busted. Here I\u2019m thinking she wants to be close to me. That she doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s driving me nuts when in actuality she\u2019s signaling my cards to Garrett. I glare down toward the floor and spot a number of cards under the table. Looking back up at her, I say, \u201cIvy?\u201d</p><p>She glances up at the sound of her name but quickly averts her gaze. Bending under the table, I pick up the cards and slide them to her with a smirk on my face. Her fierce eyes catch mine and they are cautious, focused, nervous even, as her stare tries to break mine. I notice that the color in her eyes is more liquid blue than gray today. Beautiful. It\u2019s inviting me, calling my name, so I don\u2019t look away. Instead I keep her pegged and stand up to hover over her. Her breathing picks up speed the closer I lean in, and I\u2019m well aware of the attraction between us.</p><p>With no one around to pay any attention to us, I corner her and cage her with my arms. She\u2019s waiting for me to look into her face, but I cut my eyes away. Our faces are close and our bodies are like magnets, drawn to each other. I finally fix my attention on her. A piece of hair has fallen in her eyes and I push it aside. Tucking it behind her ear, I whisper, \u201cIvy.\u201d</p><p>She murmurs something I can\u2019t understand, then closes her eyes. I swallow, my mouth dry. I want to ask her what she said. I want to tell her to open her eyes and look at me. I consider kissing her\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d let me, but I don\u2019t. Instead I get close enough that her breath passes over my skin like a caress. I let my pants rub against her stomach and a small sigh escapes her throat. When I\u2019m as close as I can be without actually lying on top of her, I whisper in her ear, \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why I chose to call her out, but when she pushes me away and runs out of the room, I really wished I had kissed her.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The next afternoon, the bus is hauling ass to Jersey and I\u2019m spending a rare moment alone in the galley. I\u2019m in my cubby playing around with a song on my guitar when I feel her stare on me. When I glance up, she looks younger again. She has no makeup on, she\u2019s wearing a pair of sweatpants and a T-shirt, and her hair is pulled back. She\u2019s gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you. What are you playing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cActually I\u2019m working on something for you.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cOh yeah. Since when do you write songs?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t, but I have this idea that I\u2019ve been wanting to run by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m intrigued. What is it?\u201d</p><p>I pat the spot next to me on my bed, and her eyes grow cautious. \u201cI\u2019m not going to attack you, Ivy. I just want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>She crosses the space and sits next to me, then looks around. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen where you live,\u201d she jokes.</p><p>Grinning at her, I say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not home. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMovies, music videos, a picture of your family\u2014it\u2019s enough to see you\u2019re still the same guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame guy I was in high school? I think I\u2019d have to disagree with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think you are.\u201d</p><p>I bow my head and look at the strings on the guitar. One thing I know for certain is that I\u2019m not, but it\u2019s nice that she thinks I am.</p><p>\u201cGarrett told me you just started playing the guitar again on this tour. Why did you stop? You loved it, and you were so good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, there is so much you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She turns to face me, propping a knee up as she twists sideways. \u201cYou mean about your father\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens with emotion. \u201cNo, I mean about his suicide.\u201d The words come out harsher than I mean them to.</p><p>She nods. \u201cI know, but I wish I did.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other, communicating without talking. We\u2019ve been walking this line between friends and not, between friends and lovers, between I don\u2019t know what since this tour started. She knows she\u2019s digging deep and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to uncover the things I\u2019ve buried.</p><p>She rests her hand on my leg. \u201cXander, you can tell me anything. You can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I wait a beat before answering. My pulse is racing, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from our contact or the conversation. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about you and what I\u2019ve been working on.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her hand to her lap and smiles automatically. It\u2019s a cross between forced and genuine\u2014one I\u2019ve never seen before. \u201cOkay. Spill it,\u201d she says, her tone neutral.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s relieved or offended. I take a breath to steady my voice. \u201cI want to make a video. Take a song like \u2018Last Time\u2019 and maybe add percussion, strings, and then I want you to chant over them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes go wide and a huge, genuine smile crosses her face. \u201cYou want me to be the girl being sung about in the song, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant,\u201d she responds. Full of enthusiasm, she takes my guitar. \u201cHere, let me show you. Something like this, right?\u201d</p><p>She plays a few chords and I get caught up in her movements\u2014the way her fingers dance over the strings, the ease with which she moves her body to the rhythm. This is the real Ivy\u2014the one not putting on a show. The girl who loves music like I do. The reason I fell in love with her to begin with.</p><p>She points her finger at me. \u201cYou missed your cue.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou want me to sing the song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Just take the lead and I\u2019ll interject,\u201d she directs me and starts playing again, tapping her foot.</p><p>I have to stop myself from watching her, from thinking this is what we could have been doing together for years. I sing the first verse, but I\u2019m not a singer, so I\u2019d say I talked the first line.</p><p>We can\u2019t keep doing this going back and forth thing that we do.</p><p>You get mad at me and then slam the door.</p><p>I apologize and you open it back up.</p><p>But, baby, we keep doing it, and this time it\u2019s the last time.</p><p>Ivy bobs her head and closes her eyes, letting the words just flow out.</p><p>I know we\u2019re so dysfunctional that it can\u2019t be any good.</p><p>Sometimes love just isn\u2019t enough.</p><p>But for us it should be, because two wrongs can only make a right.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, baby, let\u2019s keep this and make every time the first time.</p><p>She stops and opens her eyes. My thoughts are racing. The words she can create off the cuff blow me away. And her talent\u2014the way she blends sadness, tenderness, and passion, making them feel like one emotion with just a change in her tone, is why she is the singer that she is. I\u2019m so lost in my awe of her I don\u2019t even notice that she\u2019s set the guitar down until her hands are on my face and her lips are on mine. With a sharp intake of breath I feel their softness, their familiarity. She tastes like peppermint and smells like heaven. My head spins with raw need\u2014a need to devour her, consume her, own her, and make her mine, this time forever. I pull her onto my lap, my hands cupping her ass, placing her right where I need her. I want to touch all of her at once. My fingers slide under her shirt and dig into her flesh, then around to feel her perfect ni**les. She wraps her legs around me and my c**k throbs so much it hurts. All I can think about is stripping off her clothes, being inside her, and f**king her for days.</p><p>\u201cUm, Ivy, sorry to interrupt, but Damon\u2019s on the phone and he says it\u2019s urgent,\u201d Leif says in a rather uncomfortable tone.</p><p>She jumps off my lap immediately. \u201cOkay. Tell him I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p> <p>Leif leaves the galley and I grasp her wrist and tug her back to me, but she resists.</p><p>\u201cIgnore the call,\u201d I tell her, standing up and stepping closer to her.</p><p>She backs toward the door.</p><p>I put a hand on the wall next to her head. \u201cIvy, don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Xander. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I just can\u2019t be that close to you.\u201d</p> <p>I look down at her. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve gone along with the friends thing, but clearly we both want more.\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracks as she whispers, \u201cBecause, Xander, my body might want you but my heart doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The pain in her voice collapses everything I am, everything I have to give. She turns and walks out without a single backward glance . . . leaving my good mood shattered and a knife twisting in my gut.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It\u2019s a rainy, miserable day when we arrive in Jersey, and the weather does nothing to improve my mood. The heat and humidity are unbearable and the rain just f**king sucks. We\u2019re late and rush into the stadium. We do a quick sound check and head backstage.</p><p>\u201cAre you as sweaty as I am?\u201d Ivy asks Leif.</p> <p>\u201cMy balls are sitting in a puddle of water. Does that answer your question?\u201d He grins at her.</p><p>Leif directs his gaze my way and asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the air in the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the f**k would I know? Do I look like the maintenance man?\u201d I snap. His response to Ivy got under my skin, but really I\u2019m pissed that he interrupted us this afternoon for her to take a call from that prick.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was really just making a comment, not asking you directly.\u201d</p><p>I nod and steer the band toward a padded blue table in the NFL training room at New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium. I throw the playlist on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple hours,\u201d I tell them all as a general statement. Ivy and I haven\u2019t spoken to each other since this afternoon. I\u2019m feeling really fed up with the whole situation, so when Amy texted me and told me Breathless was spending the night in Jersey and could I meet her for a drink before the show\u2014I said yes.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The streetlights flicker on as we exit the bar and cross the road. The sun has set, but the sky is still overcast and the clouds are situated in a way that prevents us from seeing the moon.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to have dinner or do you have to get back?\u201d Amy asks.</p> <p>I glance at my watch and calculate the minutes until the show starts. I\u2019m trying to decide if I should leave now or just skip it. Even if I leave now I\u2019ll be late, so I opt for skipping it and calling to check in instead.</p><p>\u201cDinner sounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hotel has a great restaurant. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere is fine with me. I just need a few minutes to check on things.\u201d</p><p>We walk to Amy\u2019s hotel and she goes ahead to get a table and I stop in the lobby and make a few calls. When I hang up I feel comfortable that the show is going to run smoothly without me and go to seek out Amy.</p><p>We\u2019re seated across from each other in a booth in the dimly lit restaurant. I order my third scotch on the rocks of the night and decide to drink this one a little slower than the first two.</p><p>She chats about her job and we compare the cities we\u2019ve both been in. Then the topic of conversation suddenly changes.</p><p>\u201cDamon Wolf is buying up as many small production companies and record labels as he can,\u201d Amy tells me.</p><p>The mere mention of that ass**le\u2019s name makes me want to grind my teeth together. She seems to have some kind of preoccupation with him and I\u2019m trying to keep my cool. \u201cI really don\u2019t give a shit about Damon Wolf,\u201d I snap.</p><p>She gives me an easy smile, ignoring my hostility, and changes the topic. \u201cSo how\u2019s the new lead singer doing?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cShe\u2019s doing pretty good. Her and the guys got most of the songs down.\u201d I leave it at that and gulp the rest of my drink.</p><p>She eyes me. \u201cEverything with you going okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod toward the waiter. \u201cYes, it\u2019s great. I\u2019m just hungry. I don\u2019t think I ate anything all day.\u201d</p><p>The waiter approaches and we order our food and I order another drink. For the first time, I don\u2019t want to be out with Amy. Our relationship has always been casual and we\u2019ve always gotten along really well, but tonight she seems to be pushing all my buttons.</p><p>She passes the rolls, and conversation with dinner seems to go better. We talk about music and bands, and the topics stay neutral. Once I pay the bill, I lean my head back in the booth and close my eyes. \u201cI should get going.\u201d My words come out slurred.</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d Amy asks, the word rolling off her tongue in a nonaccusatory way.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer proudly and open my eyes. \u201cI think I am.\u201d</p><p>She reaches across the table to place her hand over mine. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come upstairs with me and sleep it off?\u201d</p><p>I have to grin, because a night out with Amy always ends up the same way. \u201cSure, why not? But the bus is pulling out first thing in the morning for New York City and I have to be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be up, and if not, the bus is moving less than twenty miles away. You could always take a cab.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYeah, when you put it like that it does sound kind of ridiculous. I just wonder if the bus would wait for me.\u201d</p><p>She giggles and stands up from the table. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The elevator ride seems to last forever and the walk to her room seems even longer. When we finally arrive, she unlocks the door and ushers me in.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m good,\u201d I reply.</p><p>I sit in one of the chairs, hoping that will stop the room from spinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to brush my teeth. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she says, disappearing into the bathroom.</p><p>I close my eyes and start to fade away, but her voice jolts me up.</p><p>\u201cYou seem off tonight. Are you okay?\u201d she asks for the second time this evening.</p><p>I straighten up and look over at her. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Just tired. I haven\u2019t been sleeping great lately.\u201d I try to focus on her. She\u2019s got a toothbrush in her mouth and she\u2019s leaning against the bathroom door wearing nothing but some sexy underwear. She looks hot, and my body responds before my mind can think. She turns back into the bathroom and after a few minutes she turns the light off and crosses the room. She kneels in front of me and presses her palms on my thighs. She slides her hands upward to my zipper and tugs it down.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you get undressed,\u201d she says.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I want more at this moment than to forget Ivy, but I can\u2019t do that to Amy. If I do this with her it would just make me more of an ass**le than I\u2019ve already been tonight.</p><p>\u201cAmy, no,\u201d I whisper, trying to sober up and stop her before she frees my half-hard cock.</p><p>She looks at me wide-eyed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t right now. I\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look fine to me,\u201d she says, staring at my erection.</p><p>\u201cNot because of that.\u201d</p><p>She stands up with a sad smile. \u201cOh. Right. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should get back to the bus and see how the show went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, you can talk to me, you know. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy, really I\u2019m just tired,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But at least let me drive you back. Jane rented a car and had me run errands earlier, so I still have the keys.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She pulls out a shirt and a pair of shorts from her suitcase and slips them on, then pockets the car keys and we leave.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>With a crash and a bang, I manage to pull the door to the bus open and climb the steps. I stand there in the entrance to the front lounge and brace myself against the doorframe. Amy slides under my arm. I think she thinks I need help walking, but really I\u2019m just more tired than drunk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d I announce. As the words come out, I can hear my speech. It\u2019s slightly slurred. My eyes are glassy, I\u2019m sure.</p><p>Garrett raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk, man. What happened to you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and stand there silently as I look into Ivy\u2019s eyes. She\u2019s sitting at the table watching me. Her eyes fill with hurt as she studies the situation.</p><p>\u201cHi, Garrett,\u201d Amy says.</p><p>\u201cHow are you? How\u2019d you get stuck with him?\u201d</p><p>Amy laughs. \u201cI asked him to meet me for a drink.\u201d</p><p>Narrowing her eyes on Amy, Ivy stands up.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ivy,\u201d Amy says to her. \u201cHow\u2019s the tour going?\u201d</p><p>Ivy glares at her with a look I\u2019ve never seen before. \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she says benignly. \u201cI was just going to bed,\u201d she adds and hurries out of the room.</p><p>Garrett comes over and hoists me up, relieving Amy of my weight, which I seem to have bestowed upon her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with her?\u201d I ask Garrett.</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>My lip curls. \u201cClue me the f**k in. Why am I an ass**le?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were worried about you. You\u2019ve never missed a show. We\u2019ve been calling you. Why didn\u2019t you answer your phone?\u201d</p><p>I pull my phone out of my pocket and squint at the screen. \u201cNever heard it. It\u2019s still on VIBRATE from rehearsal.\u201d And laughing, I add, \u201cI never felt it, either.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I needed to check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t, man. Forget it. Come on, let me help you to your bed,\u201d he says, moving toward the door. The air still smells like Ivy and I breathe it in.</p><p>I turn around. \u201cSorry about tonight,\u201d I tell Amy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You were actually a lot of fun and pretty entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for everything.\u201d Meanwhile I\u2019m wondering how the hell she thinks I was the least bit fun.</p><p>She places her hand over her smiling mouth like she\u2019s putting on a show. \u201cMy pleasure,\u201d she says, then adds, \u201cI think I saw on your schedule that we\u2019re both in Bristow, Virginia, next month. Call me and you can make it up to me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I\u2019m starting to feel like the ass**le Garrett just called me.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bye, Garrett,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the delivery,\u201d Garrett responds.</p><p>She climbs down the steps and disappears, waving to me as she goes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real knight in shining armor,\u201d Garrett says mockingly, shaking his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I break loose from his grip. \u201cI got this, man. I need a shower before I have to lie down and listen to the p**n show going on.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you were too drunk to get laid, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d is all I say before hitting a cold shower for the second time today.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p> <p>I\u2019m Alive</p><p>The black Escalade idles in downtown Manhattan. Rain pounds on the roof. Our show was rained out, so the band is heading to a Panic performance in New York\u2019s Bowery Ballroom instead. We\u2019re all ensconced in the chauffeured SUV outside the W, all except for Ivy. We\u2019ve been waiting for her for at least twenty minutes. She got a phone call from Damon as we were walking out of the hotel and decided to take it in private. I try not to think about what that douchebag is talking to her about.</p><p>I\u2019m in the front seat, turned around talking to Leif. We\u2019re discussing the shredding abilities he demonstrated at last night\u2019s show. Ivy sang a cover of \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d and out of nowhere Leif riffs during the chorus, making the song even more appealing to the audience.</p><p>\u201cHey, Xander, what\u2019s with Panic\u2019s underplay? I didn\u2019t think they needed any promo assistance,\u201d Nix calls to me.</p><p>Phoebe looks at him. \u201cUnderplay?\u201d</p> <p>He answers, \u201cIt\u2019s when a big-name band performs in a small venue and instantly sells out. It helps get a new album noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re a little nervous after coming off the momentum of their first two albums and because of the split. I think they just want to make sure they keep their groove going.\u201d</p><p>The door finally opens and Ivy, covered by an umbrella, climbs in and sits next to Leif. She seems a little nervous and she\u2019s definitely been crying. Leif leans over and whispers something in her ear. She answers him and he makes a face.</p><p>The driver slides the SUV into the traffic and spins a tight circle before accelerating. I stay twisted in my seat, my eyes glued on Ivy. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She frowns and looks out the window \u0327 muttering, \u201cNothing that you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flash to Leif\u2019s and he shakes his head, making sure his eyes are locked on mine. He\u2019s signaling me that everything is not okay. I turn around in my seat and watch the people on the street and the lights turning red and green, just waiting to get out of this car and talk to her.</p> <p>We arrive at 6 Delancey Street, and it\u2019s a mob scene. People are everywhere, waiting in line to get in, scalpers hovering to sell their tickets at a markup, and fans are camped out hoping to catch a glimpse of the lucky ones who got tickets and maybe even the band members themselves. Ellie somehow managed to get tickets for us. She\u2019s been really on the ball and I\u2019m thankful for her help.</p><p>The door opens and immediately we\u2019re ushered through the crowds and into the club. Garrett and Nix stop at the bar to get drinks.</p><p>\u201cDo you care what we get?\u201d Garrett asks me.</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. \u201cAnything is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve had enough to drink the past couple of nights, so I\u2019ll lie low on the alcohol tonight. I turn to ask Ivy what she wants, but she and Leif already went ahead. The place is split in two\u2014one side is the bar and the other side is the club. On the club side, the room is decorated with big white wreaths and candelabras set on the balcony tables, and a violinist is standing to one side of the stage. A band I don\u2019t know much about is already playing, but my mind isn\u2019t on the show. It\u2019s on Ivy and what\u2019s going on.</p><p>As soon as I get the opportunity, I make my way over to her and stand behind her. Her hair\u2019s pulled up on top of her head, and she\u2019s wearing a tight sleeveless white dress with high-heeled silver sandals and her sapphire earrings, which sparkle in the light from the stage\u2014she looks f**king amazing. But she\u2019s also a little twitchy and constantly tucking pieces of her hair in place. I can tell the conversation with Damon really got to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I whisper in her ear loud enough so she can hear me but not loud enough so anyone else can.</p><p>She turns her head. \u201cThat was a really shitty thing to do!\u201d</p> <p>I whip her around to look at me. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot showing up for the show so you could go out on a date with Amy.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with her last night?\u201d</p><p>My jaw tenses. \u201cNo,\u201d I snap and peg her with my eyes. \u201cIf I did, would you be jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She exhales. She presses her bright red lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business anyway. Guess I was just curious. I shouldn\u2019t have asked,\u201d she says, shrugging and then looking back toward the stage.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything, Ivy. You should know that.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer in any way\u2014no words and no body language as she focuses on the stage.</p><p>I take the silence to mean that conversation is over, and so I shift back to my original question. \u201cI asked you what\u2019s going on with Damon. Why are you upset?\u201d</p><p>She twists her head back toward me and her body leans into mine as her lips brush my ear. My hands move to her waist and I squeeze my fingers a little.</p><p>\u201cDrinks for everyone,\u201d Garrett says, shoving glasses toward both of us.</p><p>She steps forward and turns toward Garrett to take the glass. Wanting to close the last few inches she just put between us, I take a step in her direction and snatch the drink that Garrett practically shoves in my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I ask, pointing to the pink straw extending out of the glass filled with ice and a blue liquid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mind eraser.\u201d</p><p>Within moments Ivy sucks all of the liquid out of the glass in one swallow.</p><p>I follow suit and the cold liquid slides down my throat. \u201cFuck!\u201d I yell. \u201cThat gave me a head rush.\u201d</p><p>Ivy actually laughs, loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a mind eraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m done with those.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again and I smile at her. For a moment there is no hostility, no tension . . . just us having a good time. I think I miss that most of all\u2014the ease of being with her. Doing anything or nothing, we always had fun. She always made me laugh.</p><p>Garrett goes into detail about what the bartender put in the shot we just drank and then lists a multitude of other shots that have quirky effects. I\u2019m not really listening to him\u2014I\u2019m thinking about Ivy and why she\u2019d ask me about Amy, and about what\u2019s going on with Damon. I just can\u2019t stop thinking about her.</p><p>Finally, Panic takes the stage. It\u2019s just them\u2014no elaborate stage settings, no theatrics, just pure music. The kind of music I love. Ivy dances her way over toward Leif before I can bring us back to the conversation we left unfinished. He clutches her h*ps and starts dancing with her. He\u2019s been pretty hands on since breaking up with his girl, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if they do have something going on. As I watch them, the tension in my body starts to strain my muscles.</p><p>I try to direct my attention elsewhere for as long as I can. I watch the band, the people in the club, talk to Nix and Phoebe, compare notes with Garrett on the sound in the room, but my eyes keep landing on Ivy. Running my hand over the stubble on my jaw, I look at her with unrestrained longing, and she catches me. My heart skips in my chest when she sings along with the band and smiles at me. Watching her makes me weak in the knees. We stare at each other and I rock on my heels. She averts her eyes to pull her phone out of her purse. She glances at it and her smile fades quickly. When she shows the message to Leif, I can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m going to drive myself crazy unless I talk to her.</p><p>Walking up to both of them, I address her. \u201cTell me what happened. I can tell you\u2019re upset.\u201d My voice comes out harsher than I intend.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Leif says, squeezing my shoulder.</p><p>I turn to him and with a scowl on my face, I hiss, \u201cI was talking to Ivy.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hands up in surrender and my gaze goes back to her. Her steely eyes stare into mine for the longest time, like she\u2019s searching for something. Then finally she leans into me and on her tiptoes she whispers against my cheek, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. Damon just wants me back or he\u2019s going to start legal action against me.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in my body freezes. How dare he threaten her! \u201cDid you tell him to go f**k himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, no, I didn\u2019t. He\u2019s serious. He doesn\u2019t screw around. He says regardless of what my attorney says I\u2019m in breach of contract\u2014that I can\u2019t just go out on my own without having the financial agreements prearranged. He\u2019s going to sue me for everything I\u2019ve earned on this tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious too, Ivy. You can do whatever you want. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about the money\u2014he just wants to control you. I hope you told him to take it all.\u201d</p><p>Any softness in her gaze instantly drains from her eyes. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s none of your business anyway. I shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d She turns back toward Leif, who grasps her h*ps again as she runs her hand up his chest, leaning forward to whisper in his ear.</p><p>The front man\u2019s voice booms through the room. \u201cI am so relieved to finally be back,\u201d he says. He\u2019s dressed like the other three members of the band, in a vest and skinny tie. Personally I\u2019m not one for band costumes, but from the cheers and screams the crowd seems to disagree with me. Applause drowns out his voice. He hits the floor with a bevy of dancers costumed in black and gold lam\u00e9, brocade with leather and feathers. The place turns into mayhem.</p><p>He starts his first song in the set and everyone sings and dances along, including Ivy. My eyes sharpen as I continue to watch her. She\u2019s moving to the beat. When she raises her arms over her head and I see Leif\u2019s eyes flow down her body\u2014I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t take her flirting with other men, I can\u2019t take the back-and-forth between us, I can\u2019t take skirting the issues. I\u2019m pissed as hell and I need to get out of here. I turn to Garrett. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. Just make sure Ivy gets back safely and don\u2019t forget to stop by my room. I have changes to the playlist for tomorrow\u2019s gig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem. But you\u2019re not coming to the festival?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing,\u201d I tell him and turn without a second glance her way. I know it\u2019s time again\u2014time to let her go. But I can\u2019t stop thinking about the choice I made so long ago\u2014the one to set her free. As I push through the crowd of people, I don\u2019t see any of their faces. Rather, I\u2019m swept back to the first time I let her go.</p><p>It was nine forty-five p.m. I couldn\u2019t find my f**king car keys. I was supposed to be at my grandparents\u2019 at ten. We hadn\u2019t talked much and definitely hadn\u2019t had phone sex. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to talk to her, so I told her my mother said the phone calls were too expensive and that my aunt wouldn\u2019t appreciate the bill. That may have been a small lie\u2014my aunt would never have cared about the money.</p><p>Anyway, I soon figured out that River had taken my car without asking. Again. My mother was sleeping and it took me forever to find her keys. The whole trip to my grandparents\u2019 I was still trying to figure out how I was going to tell her I wasn\u2019t going to Chicago, that she had to go without me. She couldn\u2019t stay in LA and let her mother continue to guide her career\u2014she needed to get away from her. At one point I even considered begging her to stay in LA with me, telling her how much I needed her, but I knew that was selfish. No, I had to tell her she had to go without me. I knew I had to do right by her.</p><p>Just as I was signaling to pull into the driveway, she went speeding by me in her mother\u2019s car. At first I thought she had to get home because her mother never let her take the car, but when I pulled on into the driveway, I saw my car parked there. I walked around back and through the window I\u2019m sure I saw what Ivy had seen\u2014River with Tessa. I sat there forever, contemplating going after her, figuring out what I\u2019d say. Wondering why she\u2019d left in such a huff. In the end, I decided not to. If her mother was home, she\u2019d be pissed as hell at me for showing up that late, and she\u2019d take it out on Ivy. No, I would go home and call her. But when I got home and tried to call her, no one answered. Just as I was hanging up the phone, Bell came rushing into the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cXander, there you are,\u201d she squealed. \u201cIvy called. She said you and Tessa can have a nice life. What\u2019s she talking about?\u201d</p><p>Her words told me everything. I walked out of the kitchen without answering Bell. Why would Ivy assume that was me with Tessa? I would never do that.</p><p>But in a moment of both anger and clarity, I decided to seize this chance. To use this to my advantage, that maybe what happened would be for the best\u2014it would get her to Chicago. That stupid poem came to mind. I didn\u2019t know the whole thing, but the part I knew was enough\u2014If you love someone, set them free.</p><p>And I did. She ended up going without me\u2014it wasn\u2019t the way I planned or wanted. But once it happened, I let it. I let her go. How was I to know I\u2019d be left feeling like half of me was missing after I did it?</p> <p>As I exit the club, the smothering night not only suffocates me, but also threatens to steal what I have left of my composure. I\u2019m tired, worn, and seething with anger. I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m pushing my guilt aside and letting all of this go. As of right now, I don\u2019t give a flying f**k what any of them do\u2014Ivy included. I move from the shelter of the awning above me. It\u2019s still pouring, but I decide to walk back\u2014letting the rain cool me off.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>All I Want</p><p>Ivy</p><p>Everything is closing in on me\u2014my mother\u2019s constant calls for more money, Damon\u2019s harassing texts about my career, Xander\u2019s unyielding scrutiny. It\u2019s all too much. Tossing back drink after drink, I let myself go. I surge into the crowd and sway my hips. And as the music starts to breathe life back into me, all I want to do is forget the world. I think about the outdoors\u2014the sound of the never-ending rain, the strength of the wind, the ominous color of the sky\u2014I focus on those calming things. But Xander\u2019s features that draw together in a dark triangle whenever he looks at me tonight, that\u2019s all I see and I want so much to be the one to smooth them out.</p> <p>Leif moves close and together we find the beat. We dance to forget\u2014two friends who need each other. We\u2019ve been companions for so long, he\u2019s really the only person besides Xander who I\u2019ve ever really confided in. I\u2019d have been lost without him to talk to these last few years among the stresses of album production, demands on my career, and the need my family has for more and more money.</p><p>I try to push all my stresses and worries away, but I can\u2019t push Xander from my mind. I don\u2019t want to. Spending this time with him has me questioning everything. I feel like we\u2019ve grown close, reestablished that friendship we once shared, but I\u2019ve kept it on the surface. I\u2019m afraid to let it go any deeper. He\u2019s tried to talk to me, but I can\u2019t handle talking about him with another girl. I know he wants me and I want him so badly, but I can\u2019t let go of the past. Whenever he gets close, I see him with her. And I also can\u2019t handle a casual relationship with him. He seems to have that with Amy, and who knows who else\u2014 That\u2019s not what I want from him.</p><p>Everything is hazy, the room is hot, and I\u2019m sweaty, so I excuse myself to use the bathroom. I splash cold water on my face and try to wipe him from my brain. I found the strength to forget him before and I have to find it again. I have to fight these feelings I have for him that just won\u2019t go away. But when I follow the crowd back into the room, I can\u2019t help but look for him. I scan the area. I see people drinking, dancing, groping. I spot the band. But I don\u2019t see him anywhere. My gaze flickers around and finally settles on Leif, who\u2019s talking to Nix and Phoebe. Popping over to him, I stand in the circle, but don\u2019t really listen to the conversation. Instead, I continue to search for Xander.</p><p>When a sweat-clad Garrett taps me on the shoulder, he interrupts the conversation. \u201cHey, there you are. I think it\u2019s a good idea for us to get out of the club before everyone else starts to leave. To avoid the crowds as everyone exits.\u201d</p><p>I nod at Garrett, and he motions toward the door with his chin and takes my elbow. \u201cCome on, this way,\u201d he shouts over the music.</p><p>I\u2019m not really ready to leave, but since he seems to have decided it\u2019s time, I follow him to the car. When we start to drive away, I become alarmed. Turning around toward Nix, I ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s Xander?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen him since the band started playing.\u201d His lack of concern just pisses me off.</p><p>But Garrett seems to know. He mutters something about him being in a shitass mood and leaving, telling him to stop by and pick up the materials for tomorrow\u2019s show when we got back.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is he not coming?\u201d</p><p>Garrett seems annoyed and just throws his head back. \u201cWho the f**k knows?\u201d</p><p>Since I\u2019m pretty sure Xander\u2019s foul mood has something to do with me, I tell him, \u201cI\u2019ll stop by his room. I need to talk to him about something anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one opting to walk into the ring of fire. Just remember, I\u2019m not the one who sent you.\u201d</p><p>I give him a halfhearted grin as I think about how Xander hasn\u2019t changed. His temper, his mood swings\u2014they\u2019ve only intensified. I need to apologize to him for snapping when he asked me about Damon. I think I should explain my financial situation and how important it is that I work things out with Damon in an amicable way. And now is probably the best time. I can tell he doesn\u2019t care for Damon or trust him, but that rush I felt over his protectiveness that first morning on the bus has kept me from discussing Damon with him. I don\u2019t want him to make any trouble for the band because just like Xander, Damon can be hotheaded. And since Damon\u2019s demands keep coming and his calls get more frequent, I\u2019m just not sure what he wants from me, but I know he wants something.</p><p>As soon as the car parks in front of the hotel, we make a run for it through the rain, none of us waiting for the doorman or an umbrella. Leif and Garrett decide to hit the hotel bar for one last drink, and Nix and Phoebe head to their room. I ride the elevator with them and exit at Xander\u2019s floor.</p> <p>Walking down the hall, I notice the slide bar of his dead bolt holding the door ajar. I knock lightly and swing it open. \u201cXander, it\u2019s me. I don\u2019t want to fight with you. And there are some things I think you should know . . .\u201d I\u2019m stunned into silence. I stop for a heartbeat as my gaze tumbles over him. He\u2019s standing in the hotel room, his long, lean body turned to the side, as he shrugs out of his unbuttoned shirt. My eyes graze his body\u2014he is still the most beautiful man I have ever laid eyes on. My breath catches at the sight of him. Seeing the lines in his muscles makes my heart beat so fast, and watching the flexing of his biceps has me biting down on my lower lip. The way his abs ripple down into the waistband of his jeans causes my body to clench with need. My memory of him isn\u2019t nearly as powerful as the real thing.</p><p>I savor the sight, trying not to pant. I make sure not to deflect my stare, but rather I make it clear that I\u2019m studying every single inch of him. I even notice the fraying of his shirt, which on most men would make me think they should mend it or buy a new one, but on him the imperfection only makes him all the more appealing. When that shirt drops to the floor, I watch it intently, and as the hem skims the ground, a small noise escapes my throat.</p><p>His eyes sweep to mine and our gazes lock. He turns, leans slightly forward as if considering picking up the shirt, then decides differently. \u201cIvy.\u201d He says my name not as a question, not as a statement, not in surprise. It\u2019s sensual, full of longing; it\u2019s a sound I remember from him, from before, and one I could never forget.</p><p>I feel pummeled by his rugged good looks\u2014God, he has a face that would melt any woman\u2019s heart. His pale but intense hazel eyes, the sprinkling of stubble across his chin, the lushness of his lips, and the wave of his thick brown hair that always had me itching to run my fingers through it\u2014all features any woman would pine for. I take a step in, letting the door slam against the slide bar behind me. Neither of us says a word. The burn of his stare has me longing to escape the intensity of the moment. I let my gaze slip but feel my lips part\u2014and his do the same. I lower my lids and immediately notice the way his jeans sit so low on his hips, and a shiver runs down my spine. Then something more beautiful than anything I\u2019ve ever seen catches my attention. At first it looks like a tribal design running vertically down his right side, but as I narrow my eyes on it I can see it\u2019s a straight line of black inked letters.</p><p>Gasping, I slowly cross the room. I stand in front of him, trembling. I touch my shaky fingers to his bare skin, to the R right at the apex of his rib cage. It\u2019s warm beneath the pads of my fingers, and my body is electrified at the feel of his skin against mine. Xander looks down at my hand, and I peek up at him. His face is completely unreadable. It\u2019s filled with an emotion I\u2019ve never seen. But when he nearly loses his balance from the contact, I think he\u2019s feeling what I\u2019m feeling\u2014euphoric. Shuffling his feet, he recovers quickly. His head remains bowed and his chest rises and falls rapidly as I carefully trace each one of the letters. Every letter is a work of art, forming the phrase\u2014</p><p>Tears fall and sobs I can\u2019t control escape me as I place my trembling finger on the tiny ivy leaf, the mark used instead of an accent to stress the E. It\u2019s only then that his gaze falters. His eyes flutter closed when I touch him there. Then I drop my hand and his eyes open.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get this?\u201d My voice dips low, but I manage to get the words out.</p><p>He\u2019s gazing down at me. His voice is deep and sexy in the dim room. \u201cRight after you left for Chicago. If I couldn\u2019t have you, I wanted to always have a part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you do that?\u201d My voice quavers as I ask.</p><p>He inhales a deep breath and sighs. \u201cBecause I loved you and knew I always would.\u201d</p><p>All the tension I\u2019ve been feeling. All the pain and anger I\u2019ve held on to. I blurt it all out in what I believe to be the truth. \u201cNo, no you didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t want me. You wanted her. This\u201d\u2014I say, drawing a line down his tattoo\u2014\u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>His hand grasps my waist. \u201cIvy, I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>I pull away and he lets me. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, this is why I didn\u2019t want to discuss our past. Please don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>Everything about him goes rigid. The intensity in his eyes grows even stronger. He pauses for a moment, then almost hisses, \u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, Ivy. Ever. And I NEVER will.\u201d He puts emphasis on the word never.</p><p>I take a step backward toward the door. Afraid\u2014afraid he\u2019s lying . . . afraid he isn\u2019t. Everything about that night suddenly comes crashing back\u2014everything I\u2019ve fought so hard to forget.</p><p>His fingers tuck a piece of hair behind my ear as he says, \u201cI was an ass**le then. I let you believe things I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like what?\u201d I squeak out.</p><p>He pauses, then asks, \u201cWhat did you see that night?\u201d The question comes out quiet, sounding almost sad.</p><p>I move back. Certain about what I saw, but suddenly unsure about the facts, trying to remember everything. \u201cI saw your car parked in the driveway, and when I went around back I heard voices. I looked in the window and saw Tessa\u2019s face almost staring back at me, so I turned and ran.\u201d</p><p>Xander let out a low, shuddering breath. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me with Tessa that night. That wasn\u2019t me in the pool house. River took my car. He was the one with Tessa.\u201d</p><p>I look at his face now, into his eyes\u2014and truth is all I see. \u201cWhy would you let me believe it was you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cFuck, I don\u2019t know. I was confused. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I was mad.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking from head to toe. \u201cYou were mad? Why would you be mad?\u201d</p><p>He steps forward and runs his fingers down my arm. His mouth thins. \u201cWhy would you automatically think I cheated?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause we were apart for so long. I just thought you couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>He entwines his fingers with mine. \u201cCouldn\u2019t wait to f**k someone I didn\u2019t care about? Ivy, you knew me better than that.\u201d</p><p>Tears slide faster down my face. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you just explain? I still don\u2019t understand why you let me go to Chicago thinking you cheated on me.\u201d Anger, sadness, regret\u2014they all resonate within me. None of them taking control. I\u2019m mad that he let me believe a lie for so long, I\u2019m sad that I didn\u2019t confront him before I left, and I regret letting my own insecurities cloud my judgment\u2014overshadow what I knew we had.</p><p>He squeezes my hand and I squeeze back. He catches my chin between his thumb and finger with his other hand and caresses it. \u201cBecause it was the easy way. I had to let you go . . . you had to get away from your mother, and that was the only way. I had so much other shit going on in my head. I couldn\u2019t go with you, baby, even though I wanted to so badly. My mother, my brother, my sister\u2014they needed me.\u201d</p> <p>My tears are out of control and I push him back. Anger finally takes over. I turn and head for the door, my voice rising as I cross the room. \u201cI needed you.\u201d</p><p>He follows on my heels, clutching my hand and twisting me to look at him. \u201cI know,\u201d he says in barely a whisper. \u201cI know. But I knew you were stronger than you thought. I wanted you to make it. To become the powerhouse singer that you deserved to be. And you did it. I had so much going on in my head then, I couldn\u2019t think straight, and at the time it was the only way.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him and he doesn\u2019t falter. More anger clogs my throat. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have decided that on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know any other way. I was struggling with so many emotions, emotions I still struggle with. Things about my father I can\u2019t seem to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there for you. I would have been with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I let it happen. You couldn\u2019t stay and I couldn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I missed you every day. When I started singing, every performance I thought of you, I looked for you, not for congratulations but for support.\u201d</p><p>He steps into me and any buzz I was feeling from earlier is gone. He brings his hand to my face and wipes away my tears and I let him. Silence falls between us as we communicate with only our eyes for a few seconds. He draws even nearer and the attraction can\u2019t be denied and neither can the love. He kisses my forehead and again I let him. I want him to. I want to feel his touch. I love him. Yes, I love him. I always have.</p><p>Pressing his forehead to mine, he whispers, \u201cBaby, I was always there for you. I watched you. I never forgot you. I sent a piece of my heart to your first show and even though you never responded, I didn\u2019t give up for the longest time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m breathing so fast my heart can\u2019t keep up. \u201cWhat do you mean? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plants. I sent ivy plants with a card that said this.\u201d He points to his side, to the beautiful letters.</p> <p>\u201cI never got any of them. I promise. God, if I had gotten them, gotten one\u2014I would have responded.\u201d Did Damon circumvent them? Did he keep them from me?</p><p>Cupping the back of my neck, his strong fingers press against my skin. He pulls me even closer and grazes the very corner of my mouth with his lips. With just that one simple touch, a need that\u2019s been buried for years surfaces, in the most out-of-control way. I lift my mouth toward his, sealing us together, and his response is immediate. His lips are warm, full, inviting. It\u2019s a forceful kiss, and when we both pull away, breathless, his eyes are simmering. My fingers tremble as they dance across his abs over to the letters. He takes a deep breath.</p><p>I bend down and drop my mouth to his tattoo, tracing the letters with my tongue. I peek up at him and see his eyes close and his head fall back. I lick his skin, taste the ink, inhale his sweet scent. His muscles tense under my lips with every touch. Once I reach the ivy leaf, I slowly stand up on my toes and bring my mouth to his ear. \u201cRemember after our first performance when I fell on the bus stairs and you whispered, \u2018I want you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>I slide my hand to rest on the button of his jeans. \u201cAll you had to do was take me and I would have been yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathes through his teeth and his hands slide down my back to my ass. \u201cWell, I want you now, and I\u2019m not asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>His lips part and form an incredible smile. He clenches my h*ps in his strong hands and turns us around. Pushing me against the wall, he grinds into me with his hard cock, and everything in the world as I know it is gone\u2014I have all I want, all I need, right here. His lips are at my ear and he says my name over and over. I skim my hands along the bare skin above his jeans, this time unbuttoning them.</p> <p>He pulls me close to him\u2014as close as he can\u2014and holds me. Just holds me, for the longest time. Then his lips brush my ear and in his sexiest, huskiest voice, he says, \u201cFuck, you feel incredible. I want you, now.\u201d</p><p>His whisper floats into the air and shivers run down my spine. Oh God, I want him so much. \u201cXander, yes!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m frozen in anticipation of what\u2019s to come as he grins down at me before sealing his lips over mine. This time the kiss isn\u2019t as forceful, but it is equally as breathtaking. His mouth is wet and soft . . . just like I remember, and his tongue probes deep inside my mouth . . . just like I remember. We seem to dance a familiar dance with our tongues. I\u2019m so hot for him, I moan with every touch. Pulling my dress up, he reaches between my legs and I writhe against him with a primal need. He cups my sex with one of his strong hands and cups my breast with the other. And then I finally get to bury my fingers in his hair. I am done pretending. I want him and he wants me. I pull on his hair to make sure this is real, and he grits his teeth with a strangled gasp. My dress keeps sliding down and he keeps pulling it back up. His fingers are back in my panties and the moment they circle my clit, I call out his name. \u201cXANDER!\u201d</p><p>His lips and tongue are everywhere. I\u2019m lost in the feeling of him. My dress drops again and I don\u2019t even notice.</p><p>\u201cTake it off,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I lift the dress over my head and before I have it completely off, his hands smooth down the bare skin of my abdomen. I\u2019m wearing a simple white bra and matching thong. He stares at me with such intensity\u2014I don\u2019t even remember kicking off my shoes and pulling my hair down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>I see the appreciation in his eyes and touch his hair again. \u201cYou\u2019re all wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked back from the club,\u201d he tells me, running his mouth down my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you walk back?\u201d I manage to say with shaky breaths.</p><p>He pushes my hair over my shoulder and his tongue slides up and down my neck. \u201cI needed air,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I start to ask why, but he silences me with that mouth I\u2019ve wanted all over me for so long. And it works, because all I can think about is him.</p><p>\u201cTake your panties off,\u201d he says in a hoarse, low voice.</p><p>I nod and shimmy them down with trembling hands. I\u2019ve never let anyone tell me what to do during sex except him. Never since him have I allowed anything but mutual dominance, but with him I love it when he takes control.</p><p>When I move to unhook my bra, he whispers, \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>His soft but callused hands first cup my br**sts, then slide around my back and with the precision he always had, he quickly unfastens my bra. I gasp when his cold, wet mouth finds its way to my breast at the same time his hands slide the straps down my arms. With his mouth still sucking one of my ni**les, his hand caresses the other one. He takes a step back and I swear I blush from the look he\u2019s giving me. I extend my hands to unbutton his jeans, but before I can tug his zipper down, he pulls out the desk chair next him.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he says, chewing his bottom lip.</p><p>He\u2019s watching me, his jaw relaxed, relieved of all the tension he\u2019s possessed since I first saw him at the pool. I slouch back and spread my legs like I know he wants. I want it too. When he drops to his knees, the anticipation of what\u2019s to come has me squirming with an uncontrollable need to touch him. He draws a line with his tongue up my inner thigh and when he reaches my sex he circles it just one time before moving right to my clit.</p><p>\u201cOh, Xander,\u201d I call out, and his eyes flare to mine.</p><p>Watching me, he kisses, licks, and sucks me in a way no one but him ever has. The feel of his stubbled face against my sensitive skin is like heaven. I completely lose control when he inserts first one, then two fingers inside me. My head falls back and I arch my body as I come hard and fast, shattering into what I can only think are pieces of the last twelve years of missed time.</p><p>Lifting my head to look at him, I can see he\u2019s got a huge grin on his face. He wipes his mouth on his arm and toes his boots off before pulling his pants down. I watch with a ravenous hunger as his thick c**k springs free. The tip glistens, and all I can think about is tasting it. I don\u2019t wait for him to kick out of his jeans before I lean over and lick the pr**um off of him.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, pulling me up out of the chair. He claims my mouth with his and a groan escapes his throat when I take his throbbing c**k in my hand. Pulling away, he removes a condom from his wallet and rolls it on.</p><p>Once it\u2019s in place, he growls, \u201cI want to be inside you, right now.\u201d</p><p>He pushes me back onto the desk and in an instant he thrusts into me, filling me in one swift motion. His h*ps jerk and mine follow. He brushes his lips along my collarbone, up my neck, and to my ear, where he whispers, \u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>My fingers dig into his skin as a feeling of complete satisfaction takes over. The passion between us is so fierce that my muscles are convulsing around his c**k way too quickly. I don\u2019t want this to end. I try to slow my impending orgasm, but when he rolls my ni**les with his fingers, I can\u2019t hold back any longer. Instead, I just close my eyes and get ready to experience the joy I haven\u2019t felt in so many years.</p><p>\u201cIvy,\u201d he yells out, pounding into me at an unrelenting pace. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Opening my eyes, I delight in watching him, but I can\u2019t hold it off another minute. Lifting my hips, I grasp hold of his arms and move with him. Leaving no space between us\u2014we come together, shouting each other\u2019s names in unison. When he stops moving, he buries his face in my chest, practically panting. He licks his way up and I can feel his warm breath near my neck and hear his heart pounding against mine. Stepping back slightly, he slips out of me and I feel a sudden, overwhelming loss.</p><p>I pull him to me. \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>He drags his teeth along my jawbone, sending a shiver down my spine. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he says as he pulls me off the desk, and then he goes into the bathroom.</p><p>I stand there watching him\u2014the boy who made love to me over and over is now a man that I don\u2019t think I can ever get enough of. The feeling of having him inside me is something I\u2019ve never forgotten, and I never thought I\u2019d feel it again. It\u2019s a feeling I now know I can\u2019t live without. When he comes out of the bathroom, he rakes his eyes down my body in a way that makes my heart skip a beat. I stare at his tattoo as he walks back into the room and grabs the door handle, pulling the slide bar back and letting the door close on its own.</p><p>I start laughing uncontrollably, and he looks at me, then does the same.</p><p>\u201cIt might not have been so hysterical if Garrett had walked in on us,\u201d he says, crossing the room with a confidence that makes my stomach flutter.</p><p>I bite my lip and stare into the depths of his eyes as he stands in front of me. Wrapping his arms around me, he inhales a deep breath. He runs his hands down my body and I relish his touch. When he presses his cheek to mine, his soft stubble makes me shiver. His body moves flush with mine, and I brush my fingers down the length of his side, blindly tracing the letters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI must be dreaming,\u201d I tell him, leaning back and looking into his intense greenish-brown eyes. My voice is hoarse, but not the least bit weak.</p><p>He places his fingers under my chin and lifts it, tilting my face just enough to press his lips to mine. \u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s not a dream. This is real.\u201d He plants sweet kisses around my mouth, and his words undo me.</p><p>He walks me backward until the backs of my knees are touching the bed. \u201cThis time I want to take it slow. I want to make love to you, and I think the bed is a better choice than the desk.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to agree, but he pushes me back and I fall with a laugh onto the soft mattress, looking up at him. The pulse beating in his throat makes me smile. We stare at each other for the longest time\u2014me lying on the bed, with my feet on the floor, and him standing over me, with the corners of his mouth turned up in the sexiest grin. Then suddenly the mood seems so serious and my laughter stops.</p> <p>\u201cI missed that smile,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything because I know if I do I\u2019ll just cry again. He could always make me smile\u2014not the fake one I have to put on for the sake of my career\u2014and the mention of everything we once had together swells my heart. He licks his lips and I back up slightly on the bed, inviting him to join me. The mattress dips as he crawls onto it and settles beside me. I trace my finger around his moist, full lips, he smiles, and I whisper, \u201cI\u2019ve missed yours too.\u201d</p><p>Tucking his head into my neck, he kisses his way down my body, then rolls us around. We touch, stroke, and lick every inch of each other for what doesn\u2019t seem nearly long enough. Both breathing heavily, we\u2019re tangled in the sheets and he\u2019s hovering over me\u2014his eyes roaming every uncovered inch of my body. The lights are still on and I\u2019m glad, because I want to watch him, see him, make up for all the days that have passed that I never got to see his beautiful face.</p><p>He hovers over me and hesitates for a moment. He presses his forehead to mine, and I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to feel you. Really feel you\u2014like I used to.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him, knowing what he wants but not sure he wants to hear what I have to say. \u201cXander, I\u2019m on the pill, but I haven\u2019t been tested since\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lifting himself up, he cuts me off. \u201cI\u2019m clean, Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d I answer, giving him the go-ahead not to wear a condom.</p><p>With a soft groan, he centers himself and heat floods me. His face smolders when he looks down at me, and I can feel my need for him all the way down to my toes. His teeth clench and he bites his lower lip as he slowly pushes into me. His cock\u2014long, thick, and hard\u2014fills me. Skin to skin\u2014the feeling is magical, and both of our bodies tremble with the intimate contact. My arms circle his back and my fingers press hard into his muscles as we move together in the same rhythm.</p><p>I pull his mouth to mine and softly kiss him. Returning my kiss with the same tenderness, he pulls out of me and I search him for an answer as to why. My question is answered when he rolls onto his back, bringing me with him. Straddling him, I guide his c**k back inside me and he lets out a guttural groan. My legs squeeze his body as I sit up and press my hands to his chest for support. His hands find my br**sts, and he rolls and fondles the ni**les into hard peaks. With his hands on me and his c**k inside me, I just close my eyes as bliss washes through my veins.</p><p>When his fingers stop massaging my chest, I open my eyes and look into his face to see that it\u2019s full of desire. I gasp when his hand slides between my legs and his thumb rubs circles around my clit. \u201cDo you like this?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Moaning, I arch my body and throw my head back. \u201cYes,\u201d I scream, moving my hands behind me and clutching his knees. I want to wait for him, but the higher I lift myself off his c**k and the harder I slam down on him, the more intense the feeling. When he rubs my cl*t harder and harder, moving his thumb in smaller and faster circles, my body starts to tremble and I can\u2019t hold back any longer. \u201cOh God. Yes!\u201d I scream, and everything in the world seems to stop except for this feeling of pure heaven.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ivy, yes!\u201d he yells.</p><p>I open my eyes as my orgasm rolls through me. Watching him, I know he\u2019s coming too. His eyes close and with one final thrust I can feel him filling me. When he opens his eyes and looks at me with that look I could never resist\u2014I melt.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The words just tumble out without any advance thought. I regret saying them immediately. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d I shift my eyes away from him, knowing the words were automatic and true, but it\u2019s too soon to actually say them. I roll away and throw my legs off the bed, but before my feet hit the floor his hands clutch my waist and his hard chest nestles against my back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Without turning toward him, I answer, \u201cTo the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Turn around, Ivy. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>He sits down on the bed and pulls my legs off the floor and lifts me back on his lap. \u201cOkay, now we\u2019re going to do this again. You start by saying \u2018I love you.\u2019 But this time when you say it, keep looking at me and don\u2019t turn away as soon as the words come out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cXander, I shouldn\u2019t have said that. I don\u2019t know why I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Ivy,\u201d he commands, and I do. \u201cYou know why you said it\u2014it\u2019s because you feel the same way I do. Look, we could play the game\u2014pretend we both didn\u2019t feel what we felt the minute we saw each other at the pool, but I\u2019d rather not. I loved you when I was fourteen. I loved you when I was eighteen and had to let you go. I\u2019ve loved you for the last twelve years. And I love you now. Ivy\u2014I love you.\u201d</p><p>Hearing those words from his lips seems surreal. My stomach flutters and I throw my arms around his neck. \u201cI love you, Xander. I love you,\u201d I tell him, holding him and wanting to never let him go.</p><p>He holds me close and I don\u2019t even question his words, not for a second. I don\u2019t need to. I can feel it. I can hear it. I can see it. It\u2019s written all over him\u2014it\u2019s even etched on his body. It\u2019s real and right. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve been missing and everything I want. He\u2019s mine, and this time I\u2019ll never let him go. We were always so much alike. We covered up our feelings, pushed them aside, wore a strong armor to face the world, but with each other we were bared\u2014no shields, no masks\u2014just what was real and what was true. And the emotions I\u2019m feeling between us right now tell me that hasn\u2019t changed\u2014they tell me I\u2019m home.</p><p>He swats my ass a few minutes later. \u201cNow let me get up and get something to clean us up.\u201d</p><p>I lean back and smile at him. He bends down and bites my lip. \u201cOr come with me and we\u2019ll take a shower.\u201d</p><p>Tightening my grip, I let my body answer for me.</p><p>\u201cShower it is,\u201d he says as he moves off the bed with my legs wrapped around his waist.</p><p>Thirty minutes later we\u2019re lying in bed in the pitch-dark room. I\u2019m spent, sated, and happier than I\u2019ve been in such a long time. Pulling me to him, he hugs me like he used to\u2014arms and legs wrapped around me, squeezing so tight.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ivy Taylor,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Xander Wilde,\u201d I whisper back. And then I close my eyes, feeling so full of raw emotion I could burst with happiness.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Feel Again</p><p>Xander</p><p>Daylight threatens to break at any moment. We\u2019re lying here together, and it seems unreal. I can hear our heartbeats in the silence between us. In all the years we\u2019ve been apart I\u2019ve never found anyone that makes me feel like she does. It\u2019s as if my heart closed off after our breakup and it took her letting me back in to reopen it. Hearing her say those three words to me last night and telling her I felt the same\u2014it was the truest and most honest feeling I\u2019ve ever shared with anyone.</p><p>I\u2019m rubbing circles along her back and she\u2019s tracing the lines that are inked down my side. We slept only a few hours, but I feel more rested than I have in weeks. I woke up this morning ready for her, so I put my hands between her legs and did everything to her I\u2019ve wanted to do over the past month.</p><p>Now she\u2019s lying on my chest and the sapphire earrings are still in her ears. \u201cMy grandmother would be happy that you still wear the earrings she gave you.\u201d</p><p>She clutches one and twists it in her ear. \u201cI never take them out. They\u2019re the most special gift I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d</p><p>My hand catches the back of her neck and I tilt her head toward mine. Her statement makes me equally as happy and sad.</p><p>\u201cI loved her too, you know. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make it to her funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I miss her, and my grandfather. At least they didn\u2019t have to be apart long. The six months my grandfather was alive without her, he was lost. I moved in with him when his depression took over. Really he just didn\u2019t want to live without her. And at eighty\u2014who could blame him? He had been with her for so long and he just really loved her.\u201d</p><p>Silence takes over and we lie here together.</p><p>\u201cTell me something?\u201d she asks, flipping onto her back and staring at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you see this going?\u201d she asks, motioning between the two of us.</p><p>My lips twist into a sad smile as I pull her onto my chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll take one day at a time together. Twelve years is a long time and we have a lot to learn about each other. But I\u2019m not planning on spending any more days apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think relationships can work that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat something once broken, irreparably, like us, can be so easily mended?\u201d</p><p>I shift to hover over her, taking her wrists and pinning her arms to her sides. Kissing her neck, I slide my tongue up to her mouth before answering. \u201cI think all relationships are different and each one has its own dynamics. There are no rules to follow. So, yes, I think if we both want this bad enough there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicker from my eyes to my lips, and I take that as a sign not only that she agrees but also that she wants me to kiss her, which I most happily do.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We\u2019ve spent the morning n*ked in bed, ordering room service and just talking. We talked about my brother and his decision to leave the band. I even told her about the difficulty I had accepting his decision. She told me about her years in Chicago and that she hasn\u2019t seen her family in some time. She told me why she stopped singing last year, and I was really proud of her for taking a stand and trying to gain control of her own career. Then she finally told me about her money worries and why she doesn\u2019t want to piss Damon off. We got lost in so many conversations that when I finally pick up my phone to check the time, I bolt straight up. \u201cShit, it\u2019s almost eleven.\u201d</p><p>She pushes up onto her elbows and looks up at me. \u201cI have to go. We\u2019re supposed to meet on the bus in less than an hour,\u201d she says, rushing out of bed and quickly pulling her dress over her head.</p><p>I nod and stand to stretch.</p><p>She stares at me\u2014her dark eyes gleaming and her mouth twisting into a smile that I can\u2019t resist returning. Then I pull her to me so I can kiss her. She tugs on my lip and presses her body to mine and there it goes. Fuck, I have to get this under control.</p><p>\u201cI have to get ready,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I\u2019m already pulling her dress back up over her head. \u201cBut you can be fifteen minutes late. The bus won\u2019t leave without you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ivy\u2019s full of confidence and poise onstage without her trademark guitar. Both of her hands are on the microphone stand and her head is down, waiting for the music. She\u2019s wearing a short one-piece black outfit with lace sleeves. When she slipped it on this morning, I thought we were going to be really late for the show. And when she started out the door with it on I had to stop her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smirked at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing your pajamas to perform?\u201d</p><p>She laughed so hard it took her a few minutes before she could say, \u201cIt\u2019s called a romper, and it\u2019s clothes, not sleepwear.\u201d</p><p>As her sound fills the open space, the crowd cheers her on. It\u2019s a midday show and the sun beats down on the stage, causing everyone to squint. But even though she\u2019s only five seven, her voice is a powerhouse. She begins to sing a simple ballad. She pats her chest with her palm while singing, \u201cWith the beating of your tiny heart.\u201d</p> <p>Today I notice the band has really come together as a group\u2014from Ivy\u2019s adorable, awkward banter with the audience to Garrett making shadow puppets on the wall while Nix tunes his guitar. Leif seems introverted at times, turning his face and his guitar away from the audience at the deep emotional parts of certain songs, as if getting lost in the music, but it works. They\u2019ve mastered the union of a band in such a short period of time\u2014it\u2019s incredible to watch.</p><p>My gaze automatically slides back to Ivy and my body starts to tremble when I think about how everything has changed between us in the last twenty-four hours. The only thing assuring me that it\u2019s all real is her sideways glance at me and that smile she gifts me with before saying to the audience, \u201cI want to come back next year. I love it here. Upstate New York, you rock!\u201d The crowd yells louder and louder, and once again she\u2019s a hit.</p><p>We got to New York\u2019s Mountain Jam early enough that we could enjoy the other shows, but we can\u2019t stick around. She exits the stage with Nix, Leif, and Garrett following her. The minute her foot crosses the threshold behind the curtain, she smiles at me and I can\u2019t help myself. I pick her up and swing her around in a circle. Once I\u2019ve set her down, she grasps my cheeks and pulls my face toward hers. My hands drift down her back while I press my lips to hers.</p><p>Garrett clears his throat. \u201cUmmm . . . Xander, would you like to tell us what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Ivy laughs and we break free of each other. The guys are standing around us with their eyes wide open and their jaws hanging.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Xander, would you like to tell them?\u201d Ivy mocks.</p><p>We played it cool on the bus ride over, since we hadn\u2019t discussed telling the guys. And once we got here we went in different directions\u2014I had to take care of a few things and she and Leif had some bands they wanted to watch. Ivy and I discussed Leif last night, and she assured me they\u2019re only friends, so her hanging out with him doesn\u2019t concern me anymore. Garrett and Nix know we used to date in high school, but that\u2019s about all. I was going to tell them we were back together before the show, but there was no time. And when I saw her exiting the stage in all her glory, it made me feel like that eighteen-year-old boy . . . and all I wanted was to have my arms around her.</p><p>Now all I can do is smirk. I clutch her waist and pull her away from the guys. Leaning over, I whisper in her ear, \u201cI think they can figure it out for themselves.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know it, but I rented a car and have a short sightseeing trip planned for us. Ever since my father killed himself, I\u2019ve kept such a tight grip on things. I control my emotions\u2014containing things when I\u2019m angry, pissed, or frustrated. I control my life\u2014I decide where I go, who I go with, and what I do. Everything is planned. I never waver. There\u2019s been such a driving force within me for so long, I hardly acknowledge it. But with her I can let my guard down; I don\u2019t have to control every little thing. I feel free\u2014free to have fun and explore the emotions I\u2019ve locked away for so long.</p><p>Once we\u2019re alone in the car, I pull out a blindfold.</p><p>She stares at it. \u201cWhat is that? Part of Garrett\u2019s sex swing?\u201d</p> <p>I smirk. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell. Now come on, I want where we\u2019re going to be a surprise. So turn around.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and does as I ask. I tie it around her.</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s a short ride,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I put the car in DRIVE and we carry on with our conversation like she\u2019s not wearing a blindfold. I can\u2019t help but steal glances at her the whole way.</p><p>When we come to a stop she asks, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>I put the rental car in PARK and open my door. \u201cStay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I supposed to go? I can\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>One thing I know is that I have a lot to make up for, and I\u2019m not letting any more time pass. Striding around the car, I can\u2019t help but admire how gorgeous she looks with that blindfold on. Her blond hair is sticking out everywhere with the small piece of fabric strapped around her eyes. It\u2019s a perfect match to her ruby red lips. The material actually is a small piece of Garrett\u2019s yoga swing that I snipped off the top. I considered bringing the whole thing and trying it as a sex swing, but I didn\u2019t have time to figure that contraption out.</p> <p>Slowly I open the door and take her hand. She pushes herself against me, snaking her arms around my neck. All the air leaves my lungs. \u201cYou have a habit of doing that. Not that I want you to stop.\u201d I don\u2019t tell her I have to work on controlling the hard-ons she keeps giving me the minute her body touches mine.</p><p>She giggles and it\u2019s so f**king sweet I want to remember this moment forever. I feel more alive than I\u2019ve felt for years. My body hums with an energy she\u2019s instilled in me. She\u2019s biting her lip and I take a moment to mimic her gesture.</p><p>Staring at her lips, I trace them with my finger. \u201cYou ready?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She brings her hands up to her covered eyes and I clear my throat. \u201cNot yet.\u201d I slip my hand in hers, my heart thumping at the boundary between happy and happier. Caressing her soft skin, I tug her forward in anticipation. The closer we get, the louder the roar becomes. Cold water plops on us from everywhere and drops glisten against her skin. One falls right on the corner of her lips and when I bend to lick it off, she catches my tongue with her mouth. The heat that arises between us is enough to ward off any chill from the icy water. Panting and out of breath, I slide my fingers up her cheeks and under the stretchy fabric, removing the blindfold and turning her around to see the crystal cascades of the roaring falls. We lean over the railing, both of us silent and staring at Niagara Falls. The air is warm and full of moisture, but the sky is darkening and the slight breeze seems to make her shiver.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I ask.</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t answer, I place my hands on the curve of her h*ps and turn her back around to face me. We\u2019re chest to chest, and as my gaze meets hers I see tears streaming down her face. \u201cWhy are you crying? What is it?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and manages to say, \u201cThey\u2019re happy tears, not sad ones.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not the kind of guy who cries. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cried, not even at my dad\u2019s funeral. I may have shed a tear or two for my grandparents, but I swear I have to rely on all the self-control I can muster not to let one slip past me now. The joy I see in her eyes is enough to bring me to my knees. I take her face in my hands and kiss away each and every tear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to cry, gorgeous. I brought you here so we could experience something we both enjoyed together once.\u201d Leaning back, I lift her chin so I can look in her eyes. \u201cTalk to me, Ivy.\u201d</p><p>She gets up on her toes and touches her lips to my ear. \u201cThis is the single best surprise I\u2019ve ever received in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I tell her, and then I kiss her hard and hold her tight. We stand like that for a long time.</p><p>The smell of food wafts over to us from the nearby restaurants, and after the intimate silence I clear my throat and ask, \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Come on, let\u2019s find someplace to eat.\u201d</p><p>Walking down the busy sidewalk, we reach the crossing. The light is red, so we wait with a bunch of other people. Cars screech to a halt behind the white lines that etch the road, and out of nowhere a driver slams on his brakes, obviously thinking twice about running the light. He comes to a standstill in the middle of the crosswalk, and I instinctively step in front of Ivy, who was closer to the car. I pause for a minute to look over at her, and it hits me. After all this time it\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t love someone, that I wasn\u2019t capable\u2014it\u2019s that the one I needed wasn\u2019t there for me to love.</p><p>As we start walking again, I lean over and whisper in her ear, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get you alone. To get your clothes off and do everything I didn\u2019t get to finish last night.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me and a rosy blush covers her cheeks. Then out of nowhere someone screams, \u201cYou\u2019re Ivy Taylor. Oh my God,\u201d and snaps a picture before either of us can turn away. I move to go after the woman, but Ivy pulls me back. \u201cIgnore it. It\u2019s fine,\u201d she says. So we keep walking and I reach for her hand as we look in the windows of all the tourist-trap shops that line the street. When we walk past a cheesy diner with a pink flashing sign that says ROSIE\u2019S, we smile at each other. Diners were always our thing. In high school we searched them out for the best breakfasts, milk shakes, and burgers. Just as we walk into the restaurant, her phone rings and she retrieves it from her purse and holds it in her palm.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>My eyes narrow on her. \u201cWho\u2019s calling that you don\u2019t want to talk to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d But she\u2019s still stopped on the sidewalk, gazing down at her phone.</p><p>I take it from her. Ten missed calls from Damon Wolf. \u201cWhy is he calling you nonstop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to discuss our contract termination. My attorney says to let him take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it when we get back.\u201d I can feel that I\u2019m glowering, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s best to let my attorney do it.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Like hell I will. \u201cSure, gorgeous. Come on, let\u2019s eat.\u201d I lace my hand with hers and lead her to the diner I spotted.</p><p>We walk in and it\u2019s like a scene out of Happy Days. The front counter is lined with classic candies\u2014Sugar Daddys, Bit-O-Honeys, Sixlets, Oh Henry! bars, candy necklaces, Sky Bars, and Cherry Mashes. Betty Boop memorabilia is everywhere. The waiter waves us to take our own seat, and we find a booth in the very back. The restaurant looks like it hasn\u2019t been remodeled since it opened in the 1950s. The booths are ripped and the table is sticky, but I could care less because we both look up at each other and grin. There\u2019s a shiny chrome Seeburg Wall-O-Matic jukebox sitting at the end of our table. Jackpot!</p><p>I ask the waitress for some change and when she brings it to the table, I push it all over to Ivy. \u201cYour choice, baby.\u201d</p><p>We both order pancakes with bacon and then she selects a number of songs. We listen to the singles spinning round and round somewhere we can\u2019t see, while we wait for our food. Once we\u2019ve eaten, she uses the restroom and I snag a candy necklace for her, pay the bill, and stuff the little sugar beads in my pocket before she comes back.</p><p>We spend an hour or so walking around Niagara Falls and really talking. Telling each other the things we have done in our lives\u2014what we feel we\u2019ve accomplished, what we haven\u2019t, and what we want out of life. As strange as it is, I think we both want the same things. It\u2019s too early to talk about a future, but I see mine with her in it.</p><p>Back at the small private cottage I rented on the lake, she pushes me flat on my back on the bed as soon as we walk in. I give her a knowing look as she peels off her top and then removes her bra. The tears are long since gone and an entirely different emotion has taken over. I raise my head to suck on one of her ni**les, but she pushes me back down. I try not to laugh and decide just to roll with it. She runs her hands down my arms and I try to grab her fingers, but instead she lifts my shirt up slightly. Again I let her. She traces the letters inked along my side. Another moment passes and she drops her lips to my skin to kiss each and every letter of my tattoo. A raw ache from her touch emanates from every nerve in my body. When she sits up, her hair rests on her shoulders and she takes it and swirls it around as if knotting it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even in the dim light I soak up the curves of her body, the angles of her face, the way they light up the room. I move to sit up, so she straddles my lap and I pull her close to me. She tugs hard on my hair and I kiss her even harder. Her br**sts rub against my bare chest and I clutch her ass and press her more firmly into my lap. By the time I break away, after she rocks forward on my erection, I\u2019m nearly panting. With boldness she never exhibited in our moments of intimacy before, she unbuttons my shirt and takes it off, then pulls my undershirt over my head but leaves it tangled around my wrists.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d she asks, her voice shy but smooth.</p><p>I grin at her and then close my eyes. I\u2019m so turned on by this side of her, but I don\u2019t want to ask whether she\u2019s done anything like this before, because I might not like the answer.</p><p>My c**k is so hard against the fabric of my jeans that I decide the \u201chave you ever\u201d question will definitely have to wait. I tug the shirt the rest of the way off and capture her hips. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d I tell her as I roll us over so she lies beneath me. I\u2019m just not okay with giving up control. I reach into my pocket and pull out the elastic candy necklace. \u201cI got you something,\u201d I murmur to her. But instead of putting it over her head where it would sit snugly around her beautiful neck, I pull her wrists to me. She stares at me with a glimmer in her eye and I know she\u2019s fine with this. After all, she started it and it\u2019s a tame, harmless first attempt at something I\u2019ve never thought about doing until now.</p><p>She draws a line with her tongue from my mouth to my ear. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she whispers in a sexy, ragged voice. \u201cBut I can\u2019t use my hands if you do,\u201d she adds.</p><p>I smile at her as I wrap the elastic in a figure eight around her wrists and then stand up, kicking off my boots, and taking my pants off in record time. Hovering over her, I remove her remaining clothes\u2014everything except her lacey black thong. Then I slowly pull her arms over her head and pin them there. With my other hand I slide my fingertips down her bare stomach to the edge of her panties. Creeping along their edge, I feel her wetness and quickly slide my hand inside them to cup her pu**y.</p><p>She gasps. \u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>I answer against her skin as I lap my tongue over the peaks of her hard ni**les. \u201cI want that too.\u201d My lips move farther down the swells of her breast. \u201cKeep your hands pressed together,\u201d I groan as my lips move toward her taut stomach and I let go of them.</p><p>\u201cXander, I want you inside me,\u201d she moans.</p><p>\u201cI know, Ivy. Soon. But first I want to devour you until you can\u2019t stand another minute.\u201d</p><p>My tongue dances around the lace of her panties and I peek up at her. She\u2019s staring at me with her hands where they\u2019re supposed to be. Her sexy, hooded eyes make me throb even more. \u201cI\u2019m so hard right now,\u201d I whisper as my tongue continues down over the lace. Her hands start to move. \u201cKeep your hands together over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander!\u201d she screams out when my hands tug so hard on her underwear that the crotch rips apart.</p><p>I laugh against the wetness of her pu**y as she pushes herself toward me. With my mouth, my lips, my tongue, I can\u2019t get enough\u2014she tastes so good. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted your sweet pu**y in my mouth, around me, on me . . . all day. I\u2019m going to feast on you.\u201d</p><p>She giggles and I\u2019m sure she must turn red. Talking dirty to her is something I know she likes. But as I slide my finger inside her and circle her walls, she stops laughing and I can feel her muscles tighten\u2014she feels so good. I circle her cl*t over and over, licking her and stroking her at the same time. I want to devour her, every inch of her . . . lick her all up and then do it again and again. The way her body reacts to my touch, the need between us\u2014it\u2019s raw and real and I never want it to end. But I settle on savoring her\u2014slowly bringing her to the brink and pulling back to do it all over again.</p><p>When she starts to tremble, she digs her heels into the bed and I know she\u2019s climaxing\u2014that puts a huge grin on my face. I run my tongue up her body all the way to her lips, and she attacks my mouth greedily. She twists the necklace off her wrists and tangles her fingers in my hair. \u201cI want to suck on you,\u201d she says, letting her fingers slide down my back, pressing into my skin.</p><p>Rolling over onto my back, I bring her with me. I catch both her wrists and try to make my voice sound serious. \u201cYou let your hands free.\u201d</p><p>She bites down on her lip. \u201cI want to suck you. Please,\u201d she says in that same sexy, raspy voice.</p><p>Her look melts my insides. \u201cFuck,\u201d I growl, lifting my ass off the bed, offering my hard c**k to her. Her warm lips are on my neck, my chest, my stomach. Her hand wraps around my base and her lips lick around my tip. Fuck. I might lose it before she even starts\u2014I have got to get the horny teenage boy under control. Her tongue licks down my shaft before her mouth wraps around me. That feels so unbelievable. I throw my head back and brace my hand on her head. A low groan steals past my mouth and I can feel her lips move in an upward curl.</p><p>The next minute she\u2019s taking all of me and I close my eyes and just let this feeling that I wish could last forever take over. I try as hard as I can to hang on, but I have to let go and feel what comes next\u2014that feeling that puts me on top of the world, the one that is unlike anything else I\u2019ve ever felt. I start to shudder and release at the very same time my phone on the nightstand starts to ring. I ignore it and continue to ride out the feeling as she swallows everything I have to give. I never let my phone go to voice mail, but today I do. The message light flashes, but my attention is for her right now. \u201cFuck,\u201d I mutter, pulling her up to me. I kiss her hard, feeling out of breath and completely satisfied.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The smell of sausage and bacon wafts through the small one-room bungalow. I sit up, immediately blinded by the assault of light from the large picture window with a view of the lake. Rubbing my eyes, I sniff again and the sound of percolating coffee catches my attention. I glance around and see her, not very far away, but still not close enough.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say with a grin.</p> <p>She walks toward me with a coffee mug in her hand and I accept the cup, but immediately set it on the table beside the bed and pull her down to me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want me to go the store naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d like you next to me when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d She starts to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not naked.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and takes her layers off before sliding in bed next to me. \u201cI am now,\u201d she repeats.</p><p>My hands slide down her body. \u201cMorning,\u201d I whisper in her ear, pushing my erection against her stomach.</p><p>\u201cGood morning again.\u201d She giggles as her hands follow a similar path to mine.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>An hour later I sip the cold coffee and tie the laces of my boots. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we staying here?\u201d she asks with a hopeful tone to her voice.</p><p>I cross the room as she\u2019s stirring batter in a bowl. \u201cYes, it\u2019s the Fourth of July, so I thought we would. We don\u2019t have to be back to the bus until tomorrow. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to stay here. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I pull her h*ps to mine. \u201cNo, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She blushes, but the crackling of oil has her easing out of my grip way too soon.</p><p>On the counter sit a box of pancake mix and a bowl of blueberries. I know I must be wearing the biggest shit-eating grin when I see them. She\u2019s busy taking the bacon from the pan when I open the drawer and grab a black rubber spatula. I hide it in my back pocket and once she\u2019s finished, I scoop her up and set her on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you haven\u2019t had in a while?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, with more giggles.</p><p>I pull the spatula from my pocket and move it back and forth under her ass. \u201cThe Aunt Jemima Treatment.\u201d</p><p>She laughs some more, and her blue eyes match the color of the water in the lake. \u201cNo, no, stop it!\u201d</p><p>Channeling my best Bill Murray from Stripes, I ask, \u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you love?\u201d I question.</p><p>She places her hands on my cheeks and in a moment that takes my breath away she says, \u201cYou, you, always.\u201d</p><p>We eat breakfast on a blanket out on the grass and then take a walk around the lake. The water looks like a mirror\u2014clear and calm\u2014and we decide to take out the small rowboat that\u2019s tied up to the dock. We stop in the middle of the lake and lie back, absorbing the sun and each other. With my arms stretched behind my head, I can hear fish breaking the surface of the water, and it takes me back to when my grandfather and my father would occasionally take River and me fishing. Those days were good ones\u2014dropping a pole in the water, sitting back, waiting for the fish to bite.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asks, raising her head off my chest.</p><p>I wrap my arms around her and look straight at her. \u201cRiver. He was so impatient when we would all go fishing. He\u2019d put his pole in the water for about five seconds and then get upset that he hadn\u2019t caught anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve envied what you have with him and Bell.\u201d</p><p>My hand finds hers and I give it a squeeze. \u201cDid you stay close with any of your sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. Not the way you are with your brother and sister.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her head. I have no words to respond. I am lucky in that way\u2014in the way that I have a family that will do anything for one another. It\u2019s always been that way. Even when my dad was a drunken mess, even when I caught him in bed with his guitar student and he claimed their relationship had not escalated to sex, we stood together\u2014my brother and I and my sister.</p><p>\u201cIvy, I have some things to explain to you about my family. Things I probably should have told you years ago.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and I pull her back to me. I want her close as I tell her about my father\u2019s suicide. I tell her everything, everything except the fact that I\u2019m to blame and what his last words to me were\u2014that he muttered the name of her ex-fianc\u00e9 before he died. And it\u2019s strange, but in a moment of clarity I suddenly get why River didn\u2019t want to tell Dahlia what he knew about her ex-fianc\u00e9\u2014that Ben Covington had cheated on her with our sister, Bell. I get it. Damn it, River. I get it.</p><p>She lifts her chin, offering her mouth to take and do with as I want. I kiss her for a long time and then we lie quietly as the boat rocks us back and forth and I\u2019m lulled to sleep.</p><p>The next thing I know I can feel her soft touch creeping up my chest. I snatch her hand and roll her over, but the rocking of the boat has me second-guessing my agility. I\u2019m not sure I can actually f**k her in here and not tip it over.</p><p>\u201cWe should get back and figure out what to eat for dinner,\u201d she says.</p><p>I look down at her, now pinned beneath me. She is so incredibly gorgeous, especially right now\u2014her blond hair shines in the sunlight, her eyes reflect the color of the water, and the warmth from her body makes me wish we could stay like this forever.</p><p>\u201cI know what I want for dinner,\u201d I growl in her ear.</p><p>\u201cBlueberry pancakes?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, pushing my hard-on against her pu**y.</p><p>\u201cBacon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d She giggles as I dip my tongue in her belly button\u2014having decided I may not be able to f**k her in this boat, but I can certainly put my face between her legs.</p><p>When her cries of passion subside, I manage to row us back to shore. We take a shower and she very nicely relieves me of the tent I\u2019ve had in my pants for the past hour. Then we finally get dressed and head to a small local pizzeria for dinner. Being together like this and having fun\u2014it\u2019s the way it used to be, and the way I hope it will stay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Later, fireworks blaze above the lake as we watch bursts of color paint the sky through the open windows. The air is warm and we lie together in bed, entangled in each other\u2019s arms, discussing our remaining stops and the things we want to explore in each city. When my phone rings, I pick it up and glance at the caller ID. It\u2019s my sister.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bell. Let me just see what she wants,\u201d I tell Ivy.</p><p>She nods, her fingers skimming the letters down my side.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bell. This isn\u2019t the best time to chat. Can I call you back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cXander.\u201d I tense at my sister\u2019s tone. It sounds like she\u2019s crying, but then she falls oddly silent.</p><p>\u201cBell, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad, Xander. It\u2019s really bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell, just f**king tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dahlia. She\u2019s on her way to the hospital. I was over there watching movies with her one minute and then the next minute there was blood everywhere. So much blood.\u201d</p> <p>I sit up, as alarm and concern course through my body.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What happened?\u201d A sick knot forms in my gut.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was talking to her and the next thing I know I see blood seeping through the bedsheets. I called nine-one-one, and the ambulance just left. Xander, it\u2019s too soon for the baby.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself tremble. \u201cWhere\u2019s River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him. He\u2019s on his way to the hospital. Xander, you have to come home. We need you.\u201d</p><p>Ivy lifts her eyes and I take her hand, holding on tight, wanting to never let go.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can. Call me when you get to the hospital.\u201d I stare silently at Ivy after I end the call. \u201cI have to go home,\u201d I tell her, wrapping my arms around her and pulling her to me.</p><p>We leave Niagara Falls in a blur. The one-hour car ride is an emotional one. I don\u2019t want to have to leave her, but I can\u2019t pull her off the tour. For some reason I bring up my father\u2019s suicide again. We discuss it in more detail than I\u2019ve ever told anyone\u2014breaking down, I tell her I think I pushed him too far and that I\u2019m the one who broke him. She\u2019s quiet for the longest time and then she leans over and says, \u201cXander, people make their own choices\u2014don\u2019t blame yourself for your father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze her hand, remembering all those sessions in therapists\u2019 offices when they would say the same thing. The difference when she says it is that I actually want to believe it. She runs her fingers through my hair and around my ear. \u201cI wish you would have told me then, but thank you for telling me now. I understand so much more now.\u201d</p><p>We fall quiet as we both immerse ourselves deep in our own thoughts. I blink when I feel her smoothing her fingers through my hair. \u201cI need you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens as I shift my eyes to hers. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can. I\u2019d bring you with me if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispers quietly, fidgeting in her seat in the dark.</p><p>I stop at a light and turn toward her. I tip her chin to look at me and run my thumb over her lip. \u201cHey, we are going to be together. We might not know how or where, we might not know what comes after the tour, but we\u2019re going to figure it out and we\u2019ll figure it out together.\u201d</p><p>Tears spill from her eyes and I gather her close to me. By the time I pull up next to the bus, I\u2019m a f**king wreck. Thoughts of her and of my father are mixed with worry for my sister-in-law and my brother.</p> <p>When we finally arrive it\u2019s really late and everyone is asleep. As soon as I set foot on the bus my phone rings. \u201cBell, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cOh, Xander, Dahlia had a miscarriage. She lost the baby. She was hemorrhaging and the doctors had to perform an emergency C-section.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. I have a hard time saying anything as I sit down and bow my head.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bell says between sobs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d I manage to say and then I hang up.</p><p>Ivy\u2019s hand finds my shoulder and I place mine over hers and a few moments later she leads me to the galley. She helps me throw a few things in a bag and within fifteen minutes I\u2019m ready to set off for the airport to catch the red-eye. Tossing my bag in the trunk, I slam it shut and turn to her and pull her to me, holding her tightly. Anxiety and nervousness pulse through me at the thought of leaving her. It\u2019s an incredibly familiar, yet somehow still foreign, feeling.</p><p>I place my fingertip over her lips and outline them, then cup the sides of her face and lean in to kiss her. \u201cBye, gorgeous. I\u2019ll see you in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>She nods reluctantly. Her expression softens as she runs her hand down my cheek. \u201cCall me when you land, even if it\u2019s early. Okay?\u201d Exhaling deeply, she adds, \u201cAnd, Xander, I\u2019m here for you if you just need to talk. Remember that. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her words catch me off guard\u2014I\u2019m not used to people baring their feelings to me and I\u2019m not used to baring them back.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I tighten my grip on her. Kissing her hair, I whisper, \u201cI love you too\u201d into her ear. Then I notice she\u2019s wearing the candy necklace. I bend down and gently bite a piece off. Chewing it, I say softly, \u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d and without looking back, for fear of not being able to leave, I quickly get into the car.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Disappear</p><p>Dark clouds surround me, and the first flash of bright lightning zigzags across the sky. Thunder follows with a loud crash. The rain pelts down, smashing against the plane\u2019s windows, and another burst of lightning flashes, immediately followed by a low rumble. After hours of circling, we finally land and I just want to get the hell off this plane.</p><p>Once I hail a cab, I go straight to the hospital. I text Bell and she tells me where they all are. The ping of the elevator alerts me that I\u2019ve arrived. I exit and see Mom standing in the open doorway to a small room. I rush to her and she holds me tightly. The waiting room is bathed in darkness, with only a single lamp in the corner to light the space. Bell enters the room from the other side and runs to join us.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask my mother.</p><p>She explains the medical terminology of Dahlia\u2019s condition and the reason for the emergency C-section. She tells me the baby was just too little to survive the premature birth. When she finishes, I ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s River?\u201d</p><p>She shows me to Dahlia\u2019s room. My hand stills on the doorknob. I suck in a breath and open the door, looking in before entering. It\u2019s dark and the hissing of the blood pressure machine is the only sound when I walk into the room. River is nestled in the chair next to Dahlia\u2019s bed, and she\u2019s sleeping. He shifts his gaze to the door and as soon as he sees me, he stands up.</p><p>I study his face\u2014it\u2019s worn, tired, but most of all heartbroken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry about the baby,\u201d I stammer.</p><p>He chokes down a sob. \u201cThe baby was a boy,\u201d he tells me in a trembling voice.</p><p>I can see the nakedness of his grief. I put a hand on his shoulder and then pull him to me. We stand together in silence for the longest time. \u201cHas Dahlia woken up?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me intently before scrubbing his eyes with the palms of his hands. \u201cJust once. She was hysterical, so the doctor gave her a sedative. She should sleep for a while, he said. They had to cut her open to deliver the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I can\u2019t find any other words to soothe his pain because right now his pain is my pain.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go take a shower and get something to eat? I\u2019ll sit with her.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head no and pushes back in the chair. I grab a chair from the other side of the room and just sit next to him for hours. By the time I leave the hospital the rain has stopped and the day has faded into night. I take Bell\u2019s car\u2014she got a ride from my mother and Jack. As I drive to Beverly Hills, I look up into the sky at the stars and wonder why things happen in life the way they do.</p><p>At my house, it\u2019s dark and I\u2019m alone. I make my way to the bedroom and throw myself on the bed. Pulling out my phone, I hit Ivy\u2019s name. I texted her when I landed, but she hasn\u2019t responded. I figured they were preparing for the show, but it should be over by now. There\u2019s no answer, though. I lie in bed listening to her voice mail message and start to get nervous. \u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d I leave her a message and fall prey to exhaustion while waiting for her to return my call.</p><p>When I wake up, I check my phone\u2014four a.m. here, seven there, and still no call. My nervousness quickly turns to annoyance as I dial the number again. When did I turn into a chick? I ask myself and lie back down.</p><p>I wake up again to my cell phone ringing. Blurry-eyed and groggy, I can just make out that the screen is flashing RIVER. I answer it.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sorry to wake you up so early, but Dahlia woke up and wants to go home this morning. The doctors cleared her. Do you think you could run by the house and pick up her car? Mine will be too uncomfortable for her. Her keys should be on the hook near the garage door. And Mom ran over to the house this morning and packed a bag for her. She left it in my bedroom, if you could pick that up too.\u201d</p><p>Wiping the sleep from my eyes, I throw myself back on the bed. \u201cSure, bro, I can do that. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and jump out of bed, shower, snatch my phone, and hop in my car. Bell\u2019s car is parked next to mine and I have to get it back to her. With the sun blinding me, I search for my sunglasses and then squint at my f**king phone. Still no call from Ivy. I swing the car around the corner and turn onto Sunset Boulevard. Glancing down at my phone to call her, I look up and come to a screeching stop. Fucking LA traffic.</p><p>At River\u2019s house, I park in front of the garage and wonder whose car is blocking the steps to the front door. I check my phone one last time and then squeeze between the concrete wall and the car. The door is ajar\u2014cleaning lady maybe?</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I bellow, pushing the door open with my foot.</p><p>A roar from the TV catches me off guard and my gaze shoots to the figure moving in the kitchen. A head full of long dark hair rises above the counter. Her slender figure is wrapped in an apron over a navy tank top. \u201cXander.\u201d She smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cAmy? What are you doing here?\u201d She tries to kiss me, but I turn my cheek as she gives me a hug.</p><p>\u201cI ran into your mother at the supermarket this morning and I told her to let me take care of the food so she could concentrate on your brother and Dahlia. She let me in and said she\u2019d be back in a bit. I\u2019m so sorry to hear about the baby.\u201d</p><p>She glances at the door. \u201cI left the door open because I burned the brownies.\u201d</p><p>I stifle a laugh. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice of you to do this. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been friends for years. It\u2019s the least I can do. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head and take a step back, throwing my keys and phone on the counter. My gaze drifts to the TV, where the news is flashing a picture of two men being escorted in handcuffs to waiting police cars. The screen alert reads: OPERATION SHADOWDANCERS COMES TO AN END. It draws my attention because I think Caleb mentioned something about Ben Covington being involved with that case.</p><p>I focus on the woman reporting the news: \u201cTwo more members of the Mexican drug cartel have been arrested. Along with the bust\u2014more than one hundred pounds of methamphetamine, ten pounds of cocaine, and half a pound of her**n were seized in the raid\u2014vice squad detective Jason Holt said he estimates to have removed nearly five million dollars of trash from the streets. The almost five-year-long investigation culminated late last night when a long undercover operation targeting the remaining members of the Cortez family was executed. The Department of Justice said that they believe the trafficking organization run under this family is now completely shut down. In related news, Josh Hart, believed to be linked to the cartel, who was found guilty of aggravated assault and battery back in March, was sentenced to three years in prison today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She scans the stations and stops on Entertainment Today. \u201cOh, look, there\u2019s your picture with Ivy.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps back to the TV. It\u2019s a picture of Ivy and me in Niagara Falls together.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the band played there,\u201d Amy comments.</p><p>I shrug, not clarifying that we didn\u2019t play there. Then I focus on the banners scrolling across the screen. One reads: \u201cToday marks the thirtieth anniversary of Dylan Wolf\u2019s death. He was the prodigal son of Sheep Industries\u2019 founder, Josh Wolf. His fraternal twin, Damon Wolf, now sits at the helm. Dylan\u2019s life ended tragically when . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Damon had a twin brother.\u201d I toss the comment off to Amy, ignoring the rest of the newscast.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I heard he had a drug problem and overdosed.\u201d She claps her hands together. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m all done in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in town anyway?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe band has a few days off before heading to Bristow. Are you staying in town? Maybe we could go to dinner? You do owe me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cActually, as soon as I make sure River and Dahlia are settled I have to get back. I\u2019m leaving tonight, or first thing in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>I step around the counter and Amy crosses to the sink to rinse the bowls before loading them into the dishwasher. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up in Bristow, then,\u201d she says with a smile.</p><p>I know I should tell her about Ivy, but I need to get out of here. \u201cListen, River\u2019s waiting for me. I\u2019m just going to grab some things.\u201d I direct the statement her way, already walking down the hallway toward the bedroom. When I come back out she\u2019s sitting at the breakfast bar drinking a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cPour a cup to go if you want. I just made it,\u201d she says, motioning to the pot.</p><p>I do, then snatch my stuff off the counter, say goodbye, and jet.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>My nerves are buzzing by the time I walk in my house well after ten. I\u2019d picked River and Dahlia up at the hospital, helped him get her settled, sat and just talked to him while Dahlia slept, talked with my mother, with Bell, and with Jack when he came over after work with dinner in hand. At least Amy was gone by the time we got back from the hospital, so I didn\u2019t have to deal with that guilt. The pain I feel for River and Dahlia, plus my mother\u2019s crying, and Bell\u2019s strange behavior, on top of not having talked to Ivy yet, are putting my temper into overdrive.</p> <p>I flop down in a chair in my living room and run my hands through my hair. Then I decide to call Garrett. Fucking voice mail again. I\u2019m the band manager\u2014they should be answering when I call. I hang up and slam my phone down, then throw my head back, just closing my eyes.</p><p>I hear a faint ringing noise. Glancing at my watch, I notice I\u2019ve been asleep for thirty minutes. It\u2019s my phone. I quickly answer it.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man, sorry I missed your call.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and focus. \u201cAnything going on I should know about? I\u2019ve been trying to get hold of Ivy since I got home and she hasn\u2019t picked up.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s going on. I would have called you, but I can\u2019t find her.\u201d</p><p>Standing up, I start to pace the room. \u201cWhat the f**k do you mean you can\u2019t find her? Did she do the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know how to say this, man, but Damon showed up just before the show and they disappeared into her room. She came out, did the show, and vanished. None of us have seen her since.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you talk to Leif?\u201d I can hear the irritation in my voice.</p><p>\u201cYes. He doesn\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><p>The blood pounds through my veins. \u201cWhy the f**k wouldn\u2019t you have called me the minute that ass**le showed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, you weren\u2019t here and there was nothing you could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust f**king keep looking for her and call me the minute you know anything. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can,\u201d I tell him and hang up.</p><p>I leave all my shit and just grab my keys. I peel my Porsche onto the street. The engine roars and the tires squeal. Slamming on my brakes only when I need to, I run every red light. I circle through the airport garage but find no empty spots, so I park in a handicap space. Fuck it\u2014let them tow it. Right now I\u2019m pissed as hell, and the last thing I care about is my f**king car. I hustle to get into the terminal and somehow manage to get on the red-eye to New York City.</p><p>\u201cSir, can I get you something to drink?\u201d the flight attendant asks when I take my seat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a Jack and Coke. No, make that two Jack and Cokes.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Through the Glass</p><p>Bars surround me. I\u2019m wearing an orange jumpsuit. \u201cI did it, Dad. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>His face fades in and out, but I can see he\u2019s frowning. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay the price for your sins, son. Your apology can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. I wake up in a cold sweat just as the wheels touch down at JFK. The effects of the alcohol have long since worn off; I push that dream far from my mind as I exit the plane and scramble to rent a car. It\u2019s seven a.m. and once I\u2019m flying down the highway, I call Garrett. The band is playing in Hartford and I\u2019m humping ass to get there.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he answers groggily, obviously asleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just leaving New York City. I\u2019ll be there in two hours. Did you find her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, man. I\u2019m sorry. No sign at all. She didn\u2019t come back to the bus. We waited as long as we could. Leif said she told him after the show she\u2019d meet us in Hartford. We still waited as long as we could before pulling out of New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything else to Leif?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He asked her what was going on, but she said she didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Call me if you hear anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, f**k, f**k. I hit the accelerator and pound my palms against the steering wheel. What the hell is going on?</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Just shy of two hours later, I pull into the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut. There are two tour buses there\u2014one of them ours. I slam the car into PARK right next to it and pound on the door. John opens it. \u201cHey, buddy, where you been?\u201d</p><p>I give him a cursory nod, but say nothing and head toward her room, crossing through the front lounge first. No one is around. I quickly stride to the galley, and find that it too is empty. When I hit the back lounge, all the guys are huddled around the table. Rubbing my hand over my stubbled jaw, I assess the room before walking through the door. She\u2019s not in here, but three mouths drop open when the guys turn to look at me. My eyes catch Garrett\u2019s first and I stare him down. He looks nervous as he stands up and heads my way. Stopping in front of me, he places his hand on my shoulder. \u201cHey, can we talk outside?\u201d</p><p>I jerk away, feeling agitated and unnerved. \u201cNo, we can talk now. Where the f**k is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I dart to her bedroom and fling the door open, but it\u2019s empty. I spin around toward Leif, who\u2019s behind me. \u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should sit down and let us explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I ask again, getting closer, my eyes flashing with fury.</p><p>He swallows a few times. \u201cIn the other bus, but we need to explain.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t need to hear any explanation. I take off like a bat out of hell to the other bus I saw when I pulled in. My heart pounds and my stomach is in knots as I approach. Pulling the doors open, I take the two steps in one and find myself face-to-face with a burly dude at least twice my girth. He levels a serious stare at me and I return the same to him.</p><p>He comes right up to my face and grabs my shirt with his fist, almost picking me up off the floor. \u201cAny reason you felt you couldn\u2019t knock?\u201d he mutters, his lips flapping over his set of double chins.</p><p>I laugh. As if anything he thinks he can do is going to intimidate me or stop me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Johnny.\u201d A voice colder than ice comes from behind the ninja assassin.</p><p>Johnny steps aside and then directly in front of me I see the ass**le himself\u2014Damon Wolf. I lurch forward to drop him on the spot, but his bodyguard stops me. He\u2019s got my arms twisted behind my back, so I use my feet and kick his shins\u2014hard.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t make a sound or move a muscle, except to pull tighter on my arms. It feels like he might pull them out of the sockets if he pulls any harder.</p><p>Turning my head, I try to spit in his face, but he picks me up and quickly slams my head into an overhead compartment. I can feel a faint trickle of liquid oozing down my face as he sets me down.</p><p>With my head throbbing, I stare at the man in front of me. \u201cWhere is she!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe with me. You don\u2019t need to worry about her.\u201d Hearing this, I want to punch the smug look right the f**k off his face.</p><p>\u201cIvy,\u201d I yell and again flatten my work boot against the guy\u2019s shin. This time he clocks my face on the small counter and I think my nose just might be broken. \u201cFuckkkk,\u201d I yell and when I look up I see her.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she screams.</p><p>I wipe the blood from my face and stare at her. She\u2019s wearing a tight white dress that hugs her curves perfectly. The neck is high and so is the hemline. Her hair is pulled back and her sapphire earrings sparkle in the morning light shining through the windows. I let out a huge sigh of relief that she\u2019s all right. Searching her body for signs of abuse, I see none\u2014none that appear physical anyway. But she looks at me with a deep sadness I\u2019ve never seen in her eyes before and my heart slams out of my rib cage. Adrenaline spikes through me and I manage to somehow free myself. I shove Damon out of my way and move toward her.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d I tell her, wiping my palms on my jeans before trying to take her hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispers and pulls her hands behind her back.</p><p>My knees buckle at her words, and the ninja is on me again.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d she orders in a much sterner voice. She then looks at Damon. \u201cYou said you\u2019d leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will, my angel, when he leaves us alone.\u201d</p><p>Us. I feel like I might puke right here. I look at Ivy and then I can see it\u2014her eyes are red and swollen, her face looks lifeless, but she regards me with what I think is pity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d I direct the statement to Damon and shift slightly before finding her eyes again. \u201cIvy, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer me, but repeats herself, this time screaming at Damon. \u201cYou said you\u2019d leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>My eyes are narrowed on her and I\u2019m moving closer now that there is room. \u201cI don\u2019t need you or anyone else to fight my battles.\u201d The closer I get to her, the faster my heart beats. Without any hesitation, I run my hand down her cheek. But before I can talk to her, the wind is knocked out of me by a swift punch in my side, and then my arms are restrained again. Sucking in a painful breath, I narrow my eyes at Damon. I would kill him in a minute if I knew I could get away with it.</p><p>\u201cHow about you and me outside\u2014now,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cXander, Xander, Xander. So much like your father.\u201d</p><p>My eyes slam to Ivy, who noticeably flinches, and back to him. Everything about him is revolting. His words infuriate me, set my blood on fire, and I turn, trying to move toward him, consumed by a rage I haven\u2019t felt since the day I saw my sister\u2019s fingers bleeding. But again I\u2019m blocked by his bodyguard. \u201cNow, listen, Xander. You don\u2019t want to end up like your father, do you?\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s last words haunt me\u2014Damon Wolf. I spit in his face and this time I hit my mark. \u201cWhat do you know about my father?\u201d I spit out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Removing a handkerchief from his pocket and wiping his cheek, he says, \u201cI\u2019ll give you that one, but now you need to walk away and know she\u2019ll be happy with me.\u201d</p><p>Ivy\u2019s cries turn into sobs.</p><p>\u201cIvy, angel, stop crying and come here.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move.</p> <p>\u201cIvy! Come over here so we don\u2019t have to shout,\u201d he commands, his eyes speaking to her in a language I don\u2019t understand. She walks with trepidation toward him. She\u2019s shaking and I know she\u2019s scared. He takes her hand and I cringe, again trying to free myself.</p><p>\u201cWe have an announcement and you\u2019re going to be the first to hear it. In fact, you can be the first to congratulate us. We got married today.\u201d</p><p>Her face pleads with me for something\u2014understanding, maybe\u2014and the sudden pain that strikes my body is unbearable. I try to struggle free, but the adrenaline surge I had is gone.</p><p>She looks at me a moment longer before his barking voice commands, \u201cAngel, tell him how much you missed me. Tell him how you begged me to forgive you, to take you back because you loved me. How much you regretted leaving me. Tell him how it took him to make you see I was right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamon, please stop,\u201d she says to him, with tears streaming down her face.</p> <p>My gut twists with disgust. \u201cIvy?\u201d</p><p>Her body trembles.</p><p>Still unable to believe it, I finally ask, \u201cIs it true? Did you marry him?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I don\u2019t even recognize my own voice at this point.</p><p>\u201cLet it be, Xander,\u201d she pleads.</p> <p>I look around at the posh surroundings. \u201cDoes this have to do with money?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Her face turns to anger.</p><p>\u201cYou need money. Is that why you joined the band so eagerly? Is that what this was all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cries out, but for some reason I feel like she\u2019s saying no.</p><p>Damon laughs. \u201cKeep trying to figure it out and you\u2019ll keep coming back to square one. Love speaks for itself. She just couldn\u2019t stand to be without me. She loves me. Has for years. Her mother told me about you two when the picture surfaced and I\u2019ve forgiven her for her slight misjudgment.\u201d</p><p>I flinch. I\u2019m the misjudgment? That makes me want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she mouths silently, and when our eyes connect for that one moment, I know she\u2019s trying to tell me something. I know she is, but I can\u2019t get any sound to come from my throat to ask what.</p><p>He grabs her hand and shoves the ring in my face. \u201cI think your visit has lasted long enough. Ivy will be performing tonight and she should rest. We\u2019ll discuss the rest of the tour tomorrow. Oh, and Xander, Johnny will be with her at all times.\u201d He nods to Johnny, who drags me down the aisle of the bus.</p> <p>\u201cIvy, talk to me,\u201d I yell. \u201cHow could you do this to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, this is how it has to be,\u201d she says in a soft voice, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>Damon steps closer and she steps back. It\u2019s clear that what he says is love is not. Why did she marry him? I don\u2019t have a chance to find out anything more, because the muscle throws me out of the bus and I land on my ass. In a haze I stand up. Ivy married Damon Wolf? I puke right there as thoughts of his hands on her send me to the pits of hell and devastation careens through my body. Looking around, I see Leif, Garrett, and Nix staring in disbelief and I stare back with the same feeling.</p><p>\u201cFuck, man, let\u2019s get you cleaned up,\u201d Nix says, throwing my arm over his shoulder. I walk with him, pissed and confused about what just happened, but knowing it is far from over . . . knowing something isn\u2019t right . . . knowing sure as shit that Damon must have something over her. Because there is no other explanation I want to think about.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Underneath It All</p><p>Morning had stretched into afternoon and before I know it, it\u2019s evening. I spent the morning trying to convince myself not to turn my back on her like I did before. She loves me\u2014or I thought she did. Fuck, for twelve years I\u2019ve been flirting around, never finding anyone else who could light up my soul like her. I never paid much attention to it, either. Then once she was back in my arms, it was all there\u2014she was the one I\u2019d always needed. She brings out parts of me I never thought I had. I had spent the afternoon talking myself down off the ledge\u2014I wanted to kill him, with my bare hands, strangle every last breath out of him. But then who would win? I have to keep my cool.</p><p>We\u2019re huddled together for our drink and a prayer. But no one is praying tonight. I regard them all steadily as I sit in a chair and lean over. My head throbs, my nose hurts\u2014the painkillers Leif gave me are wearing off. I\u2019m starting to feel more than a little bit agitated and annoyed. The show begins in minutes and she\u2019s not here yet. What the hell is going on? Did I imagine what we had? Why would she marry him? The questions are on constant repeat in my mind and I feel like I\u2019m going to puke again.</p><p>The feeling gets even worse when I hear Damon\u2019s voice taunt me. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I say, not bothering to raise my head.</p><p>They walk in together, with the ninja right beside her, but I already felt her nearness. My body has come alive and her presence gives me the strength I need. I flick my eyes toward her. She looks just as sad as earlier. I need to talk to her\u2014alone. But it\u2019s too late\u2014the music sounds and the band is announced, so she makes her way onstage with the guys. Thank f**k Damon disappears, but he forgot the ninja and the guy stays front and center at the curtain.</p><p>Since backstage is as empty as I feel, I watch for a bit and then suddenly feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019ll be back before the show ends. The outside air is hot, muggy, almost suffocating, and I try to block out everything as I make my way back to my small cubby on the bus. The walk feels like miles and when I look up toward the sky I see thousands of stars there to light my way, but the darkness is everywhere. The bus doors are open and John is asleep in his seat. I finally make it to my bed and throw myself down, then call my brother. I want to check on Dahlia, but when he asks me what\u2019s wrong, I tell him. He tries to persuade me to keep my cool and not do anything stupid, but at the same time I\u2019m sure he knows he\u2019s talking to the wind. I want to kill that son of a bitch, I want to scream at Ivy and ask, \u201cWhat the f**k are you thinking?\u201d I want answers. And I\u2019m going to get them.</p><p>An hour or so later I\u2019m back in the empty area backstage and she\u2019s announcing her last song. \u201cHow about \u2018Sorry\u2019 by Buckcherry?\u201d she asks the crowd. They go crazy, like they always do whenever she sings a cover.</p><p>Vamping chords, then a wailing bass introduce the song. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m bad,\u201d she croons into the mic with her eyes closed. Her voice goes even lower and she sounds raspy, beautiful, inspiring, as she continues with \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all the things he said to you.\u201d</p><p>And there it is\u2014he. She said he, not I, like the song is written. What the f**k is going on? She turns slowly, fixing her gaze on me. She swings the mic gently and she sings the song to me.</p><p>With each verse, her voice grows stronger and louder and the ache in it more pronounced. Her passion and the love heard within the lyrics of the song infect everyone in the audience, but no one more than me. I want to wrap my arms around her and feel her body against mine, tell her we can fix whatever it is he did. Because I know it\u2019s something he did. This time I will take care of her\u2014I will not set her free. She needs to know this. I have to tell her. And now I know I\u2019ll do whatever I have to to get her back\u2014I\u2019m not going to let her go this time.</p><p>When the song ends, the crowd explodes. Whistles, cheers, and yells fill the air as she walks offstage toward me. Before she reaches me, Ninja steps between us. Her demeanor changes as she approaches. \u201cJohnny, Damon said not to let him within five feet of me. But he didn\u2019t say we couldn\u2019t talk. I need to discuss our upcoming shows. I\u2019m sure Damon would never jeopardize the performance.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m actually impressed at the way she turns the charm on and works him. Shit, did she do that to me? No. Now I\u2019m only second-guessing myself. My mind is so f**ked right now.</p><p>Ninja nods at her. Is he hot for her? I\u2019m going to kill him right after I kill Damon Wolf. He steps back and I stay where I am. I consider grabbing her and making a run for it, but what good would that do. She\u2019s married to the bastard.</p><p>In a low whisper she says, \u201cLeave this alone, Xander. Leave us alone. I wanted to marry him. He makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>Fury courses through me. My pulse races and my blood pounds.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d I practically spit out the words, angry, repulsed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. Just move on. You\u2019ve done it before. You can do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBravo. Bravo,\u201d the bastard\u2019s voice calls from behind me.</p><p>I turn around. I want to rip him into a thousand pieces and let him spend his days putting himself back together.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re all here now, you\u2019ll save me the time of having to call you tomorrow. Look, Ivy doesn\u2019t need you to manage her\u2014that\u2019s my job,\u201d he says, and his words rock my body with a jealousy I\u2019ve never felt before.</p><p>Once I can focus again, I look straight at him and say, \u201cI manage the band and she\u2019s in the band, dickface.\u201d</p><p>Ivy moves to stand next to him and he tries to grab her hand. If that happens, I know I\u2019ll lose all control. Thank f**k she pulls her hand away. But she\u2019s still standing beside him.</p><p>\u201cListen. Let\u2019s make this simple. I see it like this. Your whole band is Ivy. Keep your name for now, since there\u2019s less than six weeks left on the tour. But you need to disappear. I\u2019ll give you until after Bristow to arrange it. We don\u2019t need you around causing trouble and chaos. This is our honeymoon after all,\u201d he says, this time wrapping his arm around her waist.</p><p>I rip my gaze from him in time to see the tears escaping her eyes, but I can\u2019t feel anything right now but hatred. I fight the urge to tell them both to f**k off. I glare at her as she frees her body of any contact with him. I don\u2019t want to leave, but I have to. I can\u2019t take it. I can\u2019t take his grimy hands on her. I can\u2019t even think about his hands on her. I inch a step toward him, ready to tear his wagging tongue right out of his mouth, but the ninja is up my ass within a nanosecond. Like I didn\u2019t see that coming. I shrug my shoulders and push past them both. I\u2019ve had enough of this. Turning around, I walk toward the door. When I reach it, I punch it hard, wishing it were his face. The pain pulses through me and it feels like such a relief.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Mirrors</p><p>Ivy</p><p>My ravaged eyes stare back at me in the bathroom mirror of the ridiculously glamorous tour bus. With a built-in coffeemaker, plush sofas, an enormously large shower, and even a vanity in the bathroom\u2014it really is over the top. Damon insists we remain here and not in a hotel even though we\u2019re not traveling for a couple of days. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s afraid I won\u2019t keep my end of the bargain if I spend too much time with the band, too much time with Xander. But what I don\u2019t think he really gets is that it\u2019s my overwhelming love for Xander that pushed me to make this decision\u2014my primal instinct to protect him from getting hurt, not my need for money.</p><p>Holding the can of spray near my hair, I suddenly feel faint. The memory of his piercing dark eyes fades in and out and I know I should sit down and put my head between my knees. But I don\u2019t want to appear weak. I take a deep breath, spray my hair, and let the breath go. I wish I were stronger than I am\u2014to stand up to Damon, but I can\u2019t. Instead I close my eyes, hating myself. Hating myself for knowing him, for marrying him, for hurting the only man who understands me . . . who loves me for me.</p><p>Grinning, maybe gloating, Damon watches me put my red lipstick on. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says, snapping his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be late and I flew her all the way here just to interview you so we could put some hype behind these performances. Next week you\u2019ll meet with Mara and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s a double blast\u2014Sound Music and Sound Entertainment together will really garner some attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open my eyes and finish putting my makeup on, ignoring how his gaze rolls down my body. First down the front through my reflection in the mirror and then down my backside. He insisted I wear what he picked out\u2014a push-up bra, a low-cut white cowl neck blouse that just skims the top of my br**sts, tight skinny jeans, red high-heeled sandals, and a huge matching flower in my hair. He wants to take publicity photos later, but I can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s getting off on playing dress-up and it revolts me. It reminds me of how my mother insisted on dressing me whenever I went on auditions. I like to wear sexy outfits, but only because I want to, not because someone else wants me to.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t stare.\u201d My voice pulses with hatred.</p><p>\u201cAngel, I\u2019ve always enjoyed the way you look. That will never change. You\u2019re a beauty. But I\u2019d like it if you\u2019d watch the way you speak to me. I\u2019ve treated you with respect and I\u2019d like the same. In fact, I think I\u2019ve been very understanding. I\u2019ve let you have your own room and although I am your husband, I haven\u2019t insisted that I share your bed, not even on our wedding night. I\u2019m hoping our business transaction helps us find our way back to each other, but if it doesn\u2019t in six months, you\u2019ll be free of me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m saved from having to reply when his phone rings. \u201cI\u2019ll take this in the lounge. You have five minutes. And, Angel, you look exquisite.\u201d He smiles before leaving, closing the bathroom door behind him.</p> <p>I close my eyes again. He was never like this when we were together, was he? God, if he was, how did I never see it? And what must Xander think? He threw me yesterday. I thought I knew what to expect from him when he found out I\u2019d married Damon. He\u2019s an all-or-nothing, black-or-white kind of guy. I thought he\u2019d walk away hating me, but he didn\u2019t. Instead he searched me, for answers, for love, maybe even for hope. I didn\u2019t expect that and he just broke my heart all over again\u2014this time in a different way. He asked questions I hadn\u2019t anticipated and the words stumbled out of my mouth, but not the right ones, not the ones that mattered\u2014not the truth. That I couldn\u2019t tell him. He has to leave me alone and I have to be the one to push him away. I can be strong for him\u2014this I know without a doubt. He did it for me twelve years ago\u2014I can do it for him now.</p><p>The pitch of Damon\u2019s voice rising tears me out of my thoughts. \u201cAngel. We have to go. Now!\u201d he snaps. I put on my facade and walk out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>White linen tablecloths embroidered with gold threads dress the dining room of the downtown Marriott Hotel. Soft lighting sets the tone for intimate conversations and the distance between the tables lends itself to privacy. We\u2019re escorted to a secluded table in the corner and served coffee right away. Sipping his coffee, Damon is explaining to me how to answer the interview questions in order to fast-track my career. That\u2019s the bottom line; he needs money and for some reason he sees me as his golden ticket\u2014although he didn\u2019t quite put it that blatantly. He finessed the words\u2014but I think it\u2019s more. I wish Xander and I would have kept our reunion between ourselves, but we didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m doing what I have to to protect him.</p><p>Damon keeps talking and I easily distract myself from the monotony of our conversation by staring at the magnificence of the high ceiling. Its beautiful tinwork catches my eye and the molding is truly a work of art.</p> <p>\u201cIvy, are you listening?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cYou want to get a single out right away to help launch me back on top of the charts.\u201d</p><p>He pushes his cup away. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to have one of the songs selected by the end of the week. That should make you happy.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I just let him go on thinking that I\u2019m fine with our bargain\u2014that trading Xander\u2019s career for money is my motivation. My mother called him even after I sent her what she asked for. I guess it wasn\u2019t enough, because she told him I was suffering from financial difficulty. From that conversation he got the perverse idea that I\u2019m getting something out of our arrangement. As if the money ever mattered to me. I guess he really never knew me\u2014all I wanted was to earn enough to help my sisters finish college.</p><p>A beautiful petite woman approaches us. She pulls her wavy blond hair back and fastens it with a clip she fishes out of her purse. Greeting us, she extends her hand and I scan her outfit. She\u2019s wearing a pale gray suit, all buttoned up with a hint of black lace peeking from above the lapel of her jacket. Her high-heeled pumps scream \u201cI\u2019m a corporate bitch.\u201d Right away I know she must be one of Damon\u2019s \u201cYes, sir, whatever you say, sir\u201d lackeys and I try not to roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIvy, this is Aerie Daniels. She manages Sound Music Magazine for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAerie Daniels?\u201d I question. \u201cYou\u2019re the niece of Ian Daniels, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI\u2019m also a music journalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course. It\u2019s just I\u2019ve been following the movie reports on the progress of the planning of the No Led Zeppelin film. And I can\u2019t wait for it to start filming and then for its release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, Ms. Daniels is here to interview you, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m so sorry, Ms. Daniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she replies.</p><p>Damon\u2019s phone rings. \u201cExcuse me one moment, ladies.\u201d He scoots his chair back quickly, nearly knocking it into the waiter. \u201cYes,\u201d he answers, then pauses for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019ll call you right back.\u201d He hangs up. \u201cLadies, I have to return this call, but please carry on without me. Hopefully it won\u2019t take very long. Johnny is right over at the next table if you need him.\u201d</p><p>Damon bends to kiss my cheek and I feel the tip of his tongue on my skin. His mouth actually repulses me, but he doesn\u2019t notice as he quickly leaves the restaurant. I absentmindedly wipe my face with my napkin and catch Aerie staring. The look on her face tells me she knows what I\u2019m doing. Women pick up on stuff like that. I should have been more careful. But I watch her face as she stares at the doorway where Damon breezed out moments ago. The crease in her brows and the pucker of her lips tell me I might be wrong about her. The look on her face seems to perfectly match mine. It\u2019s a look of distaste and disdain. Maybe she isn\u2019t the savagely ambitious \u201cYes, sir\u201d journalist I thought she was.</p> <p>In the next moment it\u2019s like a switch is flicked and she yanks her laptop from her oversized bag and turns it on. A grin dances across her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just proud of myself. I wasn\u2019t wrong,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She moves the bud vase and two votive candles from the center of the table and then turns her computer around so I can see what she\u2019s looking at. It\u2019s the picture of Xander and me in Niagara Falls and it\u2019s flashing across a gossip magazine Web site. The caption reads, \u201cIvy Taylor moves on to a new love.\u201d A huge smile that I can\u2019t contain crosses my face as I remember my body snug against his muscles, his face so close to my ear that I could feel his warm breath, and the way his arm curved around my shoulder protectively when the woman jumped out in front of us and snapped the picture.</p><p>Aerie turns the screen back around and says, \u201cI told Jagger I knew there was more to this picture. But he laughed it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Jagger is Xander\u2019s cousin and my boyfriend. He\u2019s also the lead in the movie about my uncle.\u201d She has a sparkle in her eye that softens her demeanor when she says his name.</p><p>\u201cYou know Xander, then?\u201d I ask, surprised.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYes. Not well, but I know him. Not only am I dating his cousin, but his brother is married to my best friend.\u201d</p><p>The waiter approaches. \u201cCan I start you both with a drink?\u201d</p><p>Aerie glances at me and I nod. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>We both order a glass of wine and my comfort level continues to increase as she fills me in on her friendship with Dahlia Wilde. I ask how she\u2019s doing during what must have been a hard time for all of them. I wish I could have been there for Xander. I also ask her questions about her boyfriend and the movie.</p><p>The waiter brings a basket of Brie with crackers and two goblets of Chablis.</p><p>\u201cSo am I wrong about the picture?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I start to feel nervous, so I drum my fingers on the table. She notices right away.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me, you know.\u201d</p><p>My eyes search hers and I stifle a laugh. \u201cYou work for Damon, my husband. Of course I can trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. Look, Ivy, you don\u2019t have to tell me anything, but I get the feeling that something isn\u2019t right. That today\u2019s headlines stating you\u2019ve reconciled with your true love don\u2019t reflect the real story.\u201d</p><p>I stay quiet. Damon warned me not to say a word. The deal was simple\u2014Xander\u2019s career would remain untarnished as long as I cooperated. Otherwise Damon threatened to dismantle the band and ruin Xander\u2019s future. I have to put out an album and keep quiet about our real reason for the reconciliation. Six months I have to give him\u2014I can do that.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI married him,\u201d I answer, not wanting to lie.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just that the look you\u2019re giving Xander in the photo looks like love. The look you gave Damon when he walked away looked more like disgust.\u201d</p><p>I look at her, stunned, and before I can stop them the words tumble out. \u201cDamon threatened to ruin Xander and the band\u2019s career like his father did to Nick Wilde . . . unless I married him. I couldn\u2019t let that happen to Xander or the band. So I did what he asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Nick didn\u2019t stop touring because Xander\u2019s mother, Charlotte, got pregnant?\u201d she asks, and I quickly answer.</p><p>\u201cNo. Damon said his father fired Nick for poor sales performance and that the Wilde Ones\u2019 sales have been anything but stellar, so he could do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I know, Josh Wolf is a decent man. I can\u2019t imagine him killing anyone\u2019s career unless the sales were nonrecoupable. And I\u2019ve actually seen those sales reports not too long ago, and I don\u2019t think that was the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have? How? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have them in my possession. My uncle never married and I was his sole heir. When he died, all his possessions were willed to me. I was going through his stuff a few months ago to help Jagger prepare for his audition and I came across the sales reports. I thought it was strange that they were in with his things, but then, my uncle was a silent partner with River and Xander\u2019s grandfather\u2019s store, Avery\u2019s. So I figured the documents just got placed haphazardly in the wrong stack. I did look at the numbers out of curiosity and remember thinking they were actually phenomenal.\u201d</p><p>I look at her, trying to figure this all out. My head is spinning. Why would Damon lie about that?</p><p>She reaches across the table and takes my hand. \u201cI can help you. Do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a freelance writer who specializes in financial investigation. Can I contact him? Ask him to look into this? Maybe he can find something you can present to Damon as a counter, a way out, who knows?\u201d</p><p>Again I nod. A counter\u2014the word sounds so strange, but then again, my situation is anything but normal.</p><p>She sets her phone on the table and hits CONTACTS. I watch her as she selects BEN and texts, I have a job for you. I\u2019ll e-mail you the details later.</p><p>\u201cThere, done.\u201d She hands me her phone. \u201cGive me your number and I\u2019ll let you know if we find anything. And, Ivy, if you need to talk, just call me.\u201d</p><p>I type in my contact information and slide the phone back across the table. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, it\u2019s none of my business and I don\u2019t know Xander that well. But from what I do know, he seems like a tough guy. I think he can handle Damon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can handle Damon?\u201d his voice inquires from behind me. His lips are on my cheek as he pulls up a chair. The spot where his mouth touched my face feels damp and clammy, and I want to wipe it away.</p><p>Aerie doesn\u2019t stumble in her response. \u201cIvy\u2019s security.\u201d She smiles and looks over at Johnny. \u201cI was joking about having a glass of wine\u201d\u2014she raises her glass\u2014\u201cwhile conducting the interview and asked if he\u201d\u2014she points to Johnny\u2014\u201cwould get in trouble. Then I corrected myself when I looked over at him again and said I think he can handle you.\u201d</p><p>Damon isn\u2019t amused. \u201cWell, are you ladies finished? I have a lot of pressing business to attend to today and I want to get my wife back to the bus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we are,\u201d Aerie says, closing her laptop. \u201cI\u2019d like to send Ivy the questions and responses before I publish, though. If that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p><p>Damon seems extremely distracted. \u201cOf course. Just run them through my assistant and she\u2019ll see to it that Ivy gets them.\u201d He scoots his chair back, reaches for his wallet, and throws a fifty-dollar bill on the table like it\u2019s confetti. Then he takes my hand and tugs me to my feet with a smile, as if I\u2019m a child not following directions. More disgust flows through me.</p><p>I extend my other hand to Aerie. \u201cNice to meet you, Ms. Daniels,\u201d I say as nonchalantly and as formally as I can.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wolf, it was my pleasure. Damon, thank you for the opportunity.\u201d I\u2019m so sickened by the sound of his name as mine that I can feel the bile rising in my throat.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Damon says for the both of us before placing his hand on the small of my back and guiding me forward. She glances down when her phone beeps with a text and I hope it\u2019s the information she was talking about.</p> <p>My disgusted reaction toward him only grows with every touch, and again I question what I ever saw in him. We reach the waiting car as Johnny trails behind us. On the way back to the bus, Damon says nothing while he reads e-mails on his phone and I relish the silence. Looking out the window as we approach the two tour buses in the parking lot, I see Amy boarding the Wilde Ones bus. The pit in my stomach grows, and I start to wonder if I am strong enough to do this\u2014even for Xander.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>Something to Believe In</p><p>Xander</p><p>Damon Wolf has been here for two days. I can\u2019t get near her and it\u2019s killing me. I have to find a way to get past his security\u2014I need to know if she did this because she wanted to or because she had to. Either way, I don\u2019t understand her actions but I\u2019m not ready to give up. Hatred has been consuming me and I exhale his name as a curse before mustering the strength to get out of bed.</p><p>Slowly sitting up, I turn my phone on\u2014too many messages to check right now. My head is pounding and I feel like shit. The bus is unusually quiet. No one seems to be around. I tack up the daily before hitting the bathroom. Then I jump in the shower, slip a pair of jeans on, and head back to the galley, where I lie back down and close my eyes, trying to figure out what the hell I\u2019m going to do next.</p> <p>\u201cXander, there you are. I\u2019ve been calling you. Why aren\u2019t you answering your phone?\u201d Amy calls from across the room, holding the daily sheet in her hand.</p><p>I lift my head. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiffy Lube Live is a double bill, remember? You were supposed to call me?\u201d She points to the sheet I prepared days ago but never bothered to look at today before I posted it.</p><p>I throw my head back. \u201cShit, I completely forgot Breathless is opening for us tonight.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYeah, I know. I called Ena and she didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head\u2019s been in my ass lately. I\u2019m really sorry. What do you need me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took care of it all. The guys are finishing up in the amphitheater now.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Technically, coordinating with Breathless would have been Ellie\u2019s job, but as soon as Damon showed up he told the label to let her go, quoting cost cuts. She was actually really happy about it\u2014she said she had wanted to move to New York City for some time and the severance pay would give her the time she needed to find a new job.</p><p>\u201cWant some company?\u201d Amy asks me with a smile.</p><p>I throw my hand over my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m really beat and I have a lot on my mind. What do you say we catch up later?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no response, so I move my arm and rise on my elbows. She smiles at me and reaches her arms around her head to unwind her braid. Then in an extremely bold move she steps forward and straddles me on the bed. The smell of her hair hits me and the feel of her body on mine makes me want to forget everything and just let go.</p><p>She runs her fingers up my bare chest.</p><p>\u201cAmy, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Again nothing\u2014just silence. She slowly starts to unbutton her blouse, but I gently take her hand to stop her.</p><p>Again I ask, \u201cAmy, what are you doing?\u201d but this time my voice is cool in a way I\u2019ve never spoken to her before.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and carefully slide her off me. I take her chin in my hand and tip her face up to mine. \u201cAmy, I have to tell you something I should have told you a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s married to Damon,\u201d Amy snaps.</p><p>\u201cI know, but that doesn\u2019t change how I feel about her.\u201d</p><p>Tears fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a casual thing going for a long time. It had to end eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted more than casual for a while and I thought you did too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy, believe me, you\u2019re gorgeous and I enjoy your company . . . but I\u2019m not in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and stands. With a frown she says, \u201cFuck you, Xander Wilde. Don\u2019t call me ever again.\u201d</p><p>I throw myself back down on the bed as soon as she leaves. I can\u2019t even go after her right now. I feel like an ass**le, but I never promised her anything.</p><p>The guys come back around thirty minutes later and drag my ass out of bed. They ran into Amy, who was spitting nails. Garrett puts his arm around my shoulder. \u201cLook, buddy, I think I told you once\u2014chicks don\u2019t do casual.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head because I don\u2019t really have a response and he pours me a drink and tells me all about how chicks don\u2019t do casual. After drinking more than we should on the bus, we head over to the arena, all in foul moods. We watch Breathless perform and drink a few more beers. I know I\u2019m being irresponsible, but I just don\u2019t give a shit right now.</p><p>Breathless is ending their set and it was flawless. Jane\u2019s love for the audience and of performing made for a great high-energy show. Scarcely taking a breath between songs, she powered through soaring ballads, bounced excitedly through new songs, and scorched the place with a cover of Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cRoar.\u201d Her charm and undeniable strong pipes had the half-packed house crazy in love with her.</p><p>The band has fifteen minutes before taking the stage. Again Ivy doesn\u2019t show to huddle with us, but this time we know she\u2019s in her dressing room because her f**king bodyguard is standing outside it.</p><p>Leif, undaunted, walks up to him. \u201cI need to talk to Ivy. Get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>The brute crosses his arms and completely ignores him.</p><p>Leif gets right in his face. \u201cI said, I need to talk to Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening before the show,\u201d he grunts.</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k can\u2019t I talk to her?\u201d Leif curses fluently at the ninja.</p><p>With my face still battered from my last encounter with Johnny, I make my way over there. I want Leif to make it onstage; I don\u2019t give a f**k what happens to me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man, no use trying to budge this ass**le,\u201d I tell Leif.</p><p>Just as the door opens and I think I finally have my chance to talk to her, I see that it\u2019s Damon, not Ivy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201d he asks me, staying close to his bodyguard.</p><p>I just stare at him while ways to kill him run through my mind.</p><p>The cue for the band to take the stage sounds, and I look at Leif. \u201cGo.\u201d He hesitates and I growl at him. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is f**king bullshit,\u201d he shoots at Damon and finally walks away, leaving me with Damon and his bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cAre you letting her onstage or what?\u201d By this point I\u2019m scowling at them both.</p><p>\u201cLook, boy, you need to learn how this is going to work. I hold the cards. I say where and when Ivy makes an appearance. I say who she talks to and who she doesn\u2019t. Do you get it?\u201d He enunciates every syllable in case I don\u2019t understand him.</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cFuck off.\u201d My voice is cold and my intentions are made clear.</p><p>There\u2019s fury blazing on his face but not as hot as mine.</p><p>\u201cYou will be gone before morning\u2014or you and your band will be on your bus headed back to LA. A few calls to the remaining venues about a conflict among the band members, some drugs found on the bus, whatever the hell I want to make up, will have them accepting Ivy graciously in your band\u2019s place. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I lunge for his throat, but Johnny grabs me by mine with one hand and gives me a swift punch in the gut with the other. Damon nods at him toward the set of doors leading backstage. \u201cLet him watch his last show,\u201d he orders, and I\u2019m assisted backstage, in case I couldn\u2019t find it myself, in some kind of hold that I can only assume is a martial arts move.</p><p>The Wilde Ones\u2019 show sucked. By the time Ivy took the stage, the audience was yelling about why it was taking so long. They started up with hits, but their performance lacked energy, there was no excitement, and they all seemed completely drained of any artistic ability. Even Ivy\u2019s last song, a cover mix of a combination of both Kelly Clarkson\u2019s and the Script\u2019s \u201cWalk Away,\u201d just wasn\u2019t enough to excite the audience. The show was a bomb. Immediately afterward Ivy was quickly taken from the arena. As I\u2019m staring at her back as Damon\u2019s personal security leads her away, Leif grabs my arm. \u201cCome with me. We\u2019re getting the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the other guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all went back to the bus. It\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t told the guys I have to leave before the bus takes off at six a.m. I was going to tell them right after the show, but maybe it\u2019s best this way. I decided to go, not because I give a shit about Damon\u2019s threats but because I want the guys to finish the tour and if they know my reason for leaving they probably won\u2019t agree to finish. So putting all that happened tonight out of my mind, I follow Leif into what looks like an abandoned warehouse. It\u2019s incredibly loud and hot in there and I regret agreeing to come the minute I set foot inside. I can feel the pulsing bass lines travel up my leg and uniform glassy expressions are on everyone\u2019s face. This place screams illegalities. From having to call ahead to get in to the fact that there are no lines, no signs, and no ropes outside.</p><p>As soon as we walk through the main part of the club, there are beautiful girls surrounding us. Leif has his choice and he takes what\u2019s offered along the way\u2014running his hands down women\u2019s chests and occasionally even up their skirts. I pass on the walking and grazing. We take the stairs and end up in an even darker part of the club.</p><p>\u201cFuck, is this some kind of strip club on steroids?\u201d I yell over the beat of the wild music.</p><p>He looks around with experienced eyes and I know he\u2019s been to places like this before. Laughing, he says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s an underground nightclub. No rules. Sex. Drugs. Threesomes. Whatever you want, it\u2019s here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not joking, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he says with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThat explains the practically n*ked women dancing on the tables.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. \u201cLet\u2019s have a seat and take a better look. Order a drink and I\u2019ll show you how it\u2019s done here.\u201d</p> <p>Once we sit down, I raise a finger and quirk it my way. He leans forward and I say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me anything. But I\u2019ll definitely take a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, man, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it,\u201d he says as he whips out a pack of cigarettes and lights one up. Exhaling the smoke in a ring, he motions a waitress in our direction. She\u2019s at our table before he even takes another drag. The voluptuous brunette is wearing fishnet hose and a see-through bra with her tits pushed up. She bends down enough to give me a perfect view of her ni**les. She asks me what I\u2019m drinking and once I tell her she shimmies over to Leif and does the same thing. I shake my head when he tucks a twenty between her br**sts. A few minutes later her tits are back in my face and she\u2019s sliding a gin and tonic my way. \u201cThanks.\u201d I slip her a twenty across the table.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d It\u2019s easily understood she\u2019s talking about things not on the menu.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I say and lean back in the booth. I start to relax a little when the cold and icy mixture hits my lips. I hold the liquid in my mouth and let the ice slide across my tongue as I watch Leif place a hand on the waitress\u2019s hip, then slide it down to her ass. She whispers in his ear and then dances off into the crowd, letting at least a dozen other shitfaced men touch her in the same way.</p><p>Leif slams his drink back. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in ten,\u201d he says with a sly grin.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t catch anything,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cMan, it\u2019s just a hand job. What could I possibly catch? And if you change your mind, just ask any of the girls down here. A hundred bucks and it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019ve never paid to have someone touch my dick and I don\u2019t think I will tonight.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just easier. I don\u2019t feel like charming some chick right now, and my guess is neither do you. But serve yourself.\u201d He laughs and walks away mimicking jerking off.</p><p>Two thoughts hit me almost simultaneously . . . I need to enroll in Jedi training classes before approaching the ninja again and I have to get the hell out of here\u2014out of both this club and this town.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>I awake in the darkness, glancing quickly at my watch to see it\u2019s eight a.m. East Coast time. After leaving the bar last night, I went to the bus, packed my shit, and left a note for the guys that said I wanted to check on River and Dahlia and I\u2019d be in touch. That was all they needed to know. I took a cab to Dulles International and waited for the next flight to LA.</p><p>Sitting here, I remember I probably won\u2019t have a car when I get back\u2014I make a mental note to call Ena and tell her to do whatever she has to do to get my car out of impound and have it delivered to my house. I think today is Sunday, but I\u2019ve lost track of the days. Once the wheels touch the ground I turn my phone on to check the date and there are more than twenty missed calls and messages. Fuck. I turn it back off. It is Sunday\u2014a day of rest\u2014and I think I\u2019ll take advantage of it.</p><p>I manage to exit the secure area of the terminal in record time. There\u2019s some kind of commotion in the airport. There are at least twenty reporters and photographers in the vicinity. Cameras are to eyes and microphones are in hands as soon as I exit security, and they all head toward me. A woman shoves her microphone in my face and asks, \u201cIs it true that Dylan Wolf was your biological father?\u201d</p><p>That stops me in my tracks. There are more strangers surrounding me, yelling out ridiculous questions that seem more like statements. It hurts to breathe. I swallow hard as cameras flash repeatedly in my face. \u201cCome again. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? Josh Wolf passed away this morning, and his son Damon announced that you are his nephew.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced before overtakes me. Still, I just stand there and stare at her. What the hell is she talking about?</p><p>\u201cDo you have a comment? Dylan Wolf died before you were born but were you close with Josh Wolf? How do you feel about sharing control of Sheep Industries with Damon Wolf? Are you in love with Ivy Taylor? Did your mother love your father . . .\u201d Questions from all directions and of all kinds surround me and I can\u2019t answer a single one. How is this happening? I only just learned Damon had a twin brother who overdosed and now I\u2019m hearing his name again. Where the hell did this come from? What are these people talking about?</p><p>\u201cXander!\u201d I hear Jack\u2019s voice calling my name.</p> <p>I look ahead and see his face through the crowd. My heart pounds in my chest and threatens to break in two\u2014why is he here to pick me up? His expression looks pained, and right away I know that what these people are yelling out can be nothing but the truth. He approaches me with a team of airport security behind him. Clutching my arm, he tries to thread us through the vultures.</p><p>\u201cCome on, follow me,\u201d he directs, and I do, only because I need to get the hell away from the chaos that\u2019s trailing behind me.</p><p>His car is parked out front and he opens his door. I get in, feeling numb. He stops and talks to one of the men on the security team, then climbs in the car.</p><p>\u201cXander . . .\u201d Jack reaches across the car to touch my shoulder.</p><p>He pulls me out of my trance and I jerk away. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your mother to explain this to you.\u201d</p><p>Through gritted teeth I say, \u201cJack, I need you to tell me what the hell\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>He pulls out of the airport and speeds onto the highway. \u201cJosh Wolf died today and his son Damon decided to make a public announcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI f**king gathered that. Is it true?\u201d</p><p>He grips the steering wheel and hits the gas. A minute passes and he still doesn\u2019t answer me.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d I yell.</p><p>\u201cYes, son, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull over now. I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother is waiting for us at home.\u201d</p><p>A scowl tightens my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not your f**king son and I said I need a drink. Either pull off at the next exit or stop the car so I can get out.\u201d</p><p>Veering off the highway, he takes a right. He pulls into a dive bar just outside the city and I bolt out of the car. He follows and catches up with me inside the joint. \u201cLook, I want your mother to explain everything, but you should know a few things.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him from where I\u2019m sitting at the bar. \u201cWhat exactly are \u2018a few things\u2019? I think there is one thing\u2014that Nick Wilde wasn\u2019t my father and she never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, son. Nick may not have been your biological father, but he was your father in the ways that count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotch, neat. Make it a double,\u201d I order. The bartender pours the amber liquid in a tumbler and I pound it back, then slam the glass down. I nod and he pours another.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d I ask Jack, after I\u2019ve finished off the second glass and motioned the bartender back over.</p><p>\u201cTwo shots of tequila,\u201d I tell the bartender, deciding a couple of shots might help faster than another drink.</p><p>\u201cI only know what your mother told me today.\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. \u201cSo she kept you in the dark, too. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, I understand you\u2019re upset\u2014and you have every right to be\u2014but I think you need to let your mother explain everything to you.\u201d</p><p>I lick the back of my hand and salt it. I tilt the shot back and suck on the lime, then toss back the second one straight up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did she cheat on Nick when he was on the road? Was that the catalyst behind his career tanking?\u201d</p><p>His hand grips my shoulder and this time he\u2019s not trying to comfort me\u2014he\u2019s warning me. \u201cI get this is a shock and I\u2019ll let you take the brunt of it out on me. But I\u2019m telling you right now, you will listen to your mother and treat her with the respect she deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cheated on Nick. What does that deserve?\u201d I spit out.</p><p>\u201cXander, I can tell you this. She never cheated. She and Nick broke up right after he went on the road. She was seeing Dylan Wolf on and off for a while when you were conceived, but he died before he ever knew she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Anger washes over me and I know I should just shut my mouth. My hand flies up in the air without conscious thought. \u201cBartender, another,\u201d I yell. I don\u2019t want to hear another word because already the use of the word conceived makes me want to puke right here. I am so f**king relieved when the conversation finally disappears from my mind and into the next tequila shot.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>You\u2019re Not Alone</p><p>A ray of moonlight through my window brings me to consciousness. I sit straight up, staring into his face, wild and fierce, full of hate. It takes me a moment to realize he is me. I struggle to find the floor and then stumble to the mirror over the dresser. I peer at the reflection; it\u2019s murky, but I can see it now\u2014I look like him. If I look like Damon, he must look like his brother. How did I not see it?</p><p>Devastation, anger, and remorse run through me in a cacophony. I head to the bathroom and splash cold water on my face. I squeeze my eyes shut as a rapid succession of faces flies across a blank canvas in my mind. My family, the ones I belong to . . . but not really. I shake off that thought and try to persuade myself that my conception doesn\u2019t change anything. But I know it does. If it didn\u2019t, why did no one ever tell me?</p><p>Was Dylan Wolf a monster like his brother? I scream at that son of a bitch buried in a coffin somewhere\u2014you bastard. Gripping the sink, I break down when I realize that no, I\u2019m the bastard. What kind of f**king irony is that? Along with rage, should I be feeling shame? What do you call that combination of emotions?</p><p>I bend over and purge myself of my thoughts and the alcohol. Vomiting profusely, I fall to my knees and wrap my arms around the toilet. A rush of memories that I haven\u2019t thought about in years surfaces, only causing me to want to expel the toxicity even more. I spit in the bowl one last time, making sure every ounce of wretchedness is gone.</p><p>\u201cFeel any better?\u201d my brother\u2019s voice asks from behind me.</p><p>I slowly turn my head, not sure if any of my senses are functioning. It\u2019s River, leaning against the bathroom doorframe. His eyes are red, bloodshot, even more so than when I left him two days ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be home with your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell\u2019s with her and I should be here with you. I want to talk to you. I\u2019ve been calling you and when I called Mom for the hundredth time Jack finally got on the phone and filled me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to anyone right now. I just want to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cNot happening. We can talk . . . or not. Your choice, but I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>My heart rate picks up speed as I try to stand up, and he extends his arm to help me. I take it. He feels like my brother. He\u2019s the same guy he always was\u2014 except we no longer share the same father.</p><p>I get a close look at him. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so hot yourself.\u201d Then with his voice full of sarcasm, he adds, \u201cYou want another drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about it. I\u2019m going back to f**king bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuits me. I\u2019m pretty exhausted myself.\u201d He follows me into my bedroom.</p><p>I kick my boots off and peel out of my jeans before sliding into the sheets. He stares at me and throws himself on the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you f**king kidding me? You\u2019re not sleeping in the same bed as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe f**k I\u2019m not,\u201d he says and toes his shoes off.</p><p>I roll over with my back to him and close my eyes. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>When I next open my eyes the sun is filtering through my bedroom window and I\u2019m alone. For a moment I\u2019m the person I always was, but then the recent revelations come back to me. I feel the pain as soon as I lift my head, but I don\u2019t give a shit how my head feels. Kicking out of bed, I glance over at my phone. I turn it on to see missed calls and messages from late last night and most recently an hour ago. My mother, Jack, Bell, the guys, and Ivy have all called. I turn it back off\u2014I can\u2019t deal with any of them right now, not even Ivy. Instead I walk out of my room and through the living room into the kitchen. River\u2019s sitting at the kitchen table that used to belong to my grandparents . . . the people I thought were my grandparents anyway. He\u2019s sipping a cup of coffee and thumping his fingers on the wooden tabletop.</p><p>He watches me cross the room to the coffeepot. I pour a cup and move to head out the back door onto the balcony.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d his voice asks calmly.</p><p>\u201cOutside. Where does it look like I\u2019m going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p> <p>I pause at the door but don\u2019t turn around. \u201cEverything in my life that I thought was real was a lie. Fuck, even this house that belongs to me is a lie. It was willed to me by the two people I admired more than anyone in this world and they weren\u2019t really mine. So what\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being such a f**king douchebag and sit down and talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I open the door. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my brother and I\u2019m concerned about you. Please talk to me.\u201d His voice sounds just as shaky as mine.</p><p>Closing the door, I lean my head against the cool glass.</p><p>\u201cYou and me\u2014we\u2019re the same as we were two days ago. Nothing has changed. We\u2019re always there for each other. We always have been. Come on, Xander, we\u2019re the same two kids that grew up together, fought with each other, went to school together, took care of our drunk father, watched over our sister, looked out for our mother. We started our careers together. We know who we are. Whose DNA runs through your veins doesn\u2019t change any of it.\u201d His voice rising slightly, he adds, \u201cNone of it!\u201d</p> <p>I turn around and close the distance between us, taking a seat across from him.</p><p>I look at him for a long while before speaking. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s weird, but I don\u2019t feel any different. Both men are dead, so what\u2019s it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>I nod and try to put everything in perspective.</p><p>He looks me in the eye. \u201cYou know I love you, right?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI was just starting to think you had stopped being such a pu**y and now you\u2019re going to talk about feelings?\u201d</p><p>River takes a serious tone. \u201cNo, Xander, I\u2019m serious. I want to talk to you about Mom.\u201d</p><p>One solid f**king hour we spend talking about how I need to go talk to my mother. I tell him I\u2019m not ready. I mean, I\u2019m still digesting that I\u2019m not who I thought I was. All he keeps saying is that I\u2019m the same person I\u2019ve always been\u2014and f**k, I know he\u2019s right. I just need time. We slam our fists on the table, throw both our coffee cups across the room, and I almost walk out about a dozen times, but the storm passes and now we\u2019re both lying on the huge L-shaped sofa in the living room reminiscing about our youth.</p> <p>\u201cYou should take that \u2019Vette out of storage,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI hate that f**king car,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cReally? Then why have you held on to it for all these years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Grandpa bought it and he helped me get it running again after it sat in his garage for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, come on, I know as well as you do that you loved it that Dad gave that car to you. Do you know how pissed I was when I was finally able to drive and I begged Dad to make you share it with me and he said no. He actually said it was yours and yours only. Then when you wouldn\u2019t even let me drive it\u2014that pissed me off more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet for the longest time, and I try to remember the last time I even set eyes on that car.</p><p>River sits up and breaks the silence. \u201cXander, I\u2019ve got something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, no more feelings. I can\u2019t take any more of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off! I\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamon shut the tour down. Everyone arrived home this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an ass**le.\u201d That\u2019s all I can come up with because I can\u2019t even think about work or the band.</p><p>After a few more minutes of silence, I\u2019m tossing a basketball above my head. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about Dylan Wolf? What kind of person he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers softly. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d he counters.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think Damon made the announcement?\u201d</p><p>My heart starts pounding and I bolt upright, tossing the ball aside. River\u2019s eyes flare to mine. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019d wager it has something to do with money,\u201d I say with a lump in my throat that I can\u2019t swallow.</p><p>River frowns and crosses a leg over his knee. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith everything that\u2019s been going on with Ivy and the tour, he still kept it going. It had to be for the money. He could have given a shit about the band. Then his old man dies and he cancels the remaining shows even after I left. When I confronted him, he kept throwing things out there about me being like my father. I assumed he meant Nick, but he must have meant his brother.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rings. Blood rushes to my face and my shoulders stiffen. \u201cDon\u2019t answer it,\u201d I bark.</p><p>River shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick. You can\u2019t stay locked up all day. People are looking to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy people, you mean Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom, Jack, Bell, the band. Everyone that cares about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to talk to Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her anyway. I told her I\u2019d call when you were ready. I made her promise to give me the time I needed to talk to you. But, Xander, she\u2019s a wreck. Don\u2019t make her wait too much longer.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and stare at him. \u201cWhen did you become so mature?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head at me.</p><p>Walking over to the door, I look through the peephole to see who it is. It\u2019s Aerie.</p><p>As soon as I open the door she rushes in. She\u2019s dressed more casually than I\u2019ve seen her before. She\u2019s wearing some kind of track suit. Her blond hair is pulled back and the sneakers on her feet make her seem really short. She\u2019s almost a whole head shorter than me.</p><p>\u201cXander,\u201d she greets me in total business mode.</p><p>\u201cAerie, what are you doing here?\u201d Then I remember she asked for an interview. \u201cNow is not the best time for that interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask her as I close the door.</p><p>\u201cCan we sit down and talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Come in.\u201d I move past her, escorting her toward the living room.</p><p>River\u2019s still sitting on the couch and stands up the minute he sees her.</p><p>\u201cRiver,\u201d she says softly and crosses the room to hug him. She holds on to him tightly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I had to run out on Dahlia. As soon as I explain everything to the both of you I\u2019m heading back over to see her. Jagger\u2019s meeting me there with lunch from her favorite place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe understands. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to see you,\u201d River responds.</p><p>She pulls away. \u201cMind?\u201d she asks, looking at me and pointing to the large graphite-colored chair that used to be my grandfather\u2019s favorite.</p><p>\u201cNo. Have a seat.\u201d I wonder what could be so urgent that she would come over here to talk when I know she\u2019s obviously seen the headlines. \u201cYou want a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, I don\u2019t drink coffee. I\u2019m fine really.\u201d</p><p>Aerie takes a deep breath, pulls some papers out of her bag, and sets them on the large glass coffee table. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cI have something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Shoot.\u201d I\u2019m a little agitated that she\u2019s not just getting to the point, but I think I get it. \u201cFuck, did Damon send you over? What does he want now? For me to sign some kind of huge-ass contract?\u201d I say, pointing to the stack of papers on the table.</p><p>\u201cXander, relax, man. Let her finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHear what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamon no longer owns Sound Music Magazine. If it hasn\u2019t been announced yet, it will be later today.\u201d</p><p>River raises an eyebrow. \u201cReally? Why\u2019d he sell it?\u201d</p><p>Aerie snickers. \u201cWell, he didn\u2019t really have much of a choice. We were in poor financial condition. I actually think it was a takeover. I\u2019m not sure about the details, but I\u2019ve been reassured that the company that bought it intends to keep the magazine intact. I\u2019ve never been more thankful in my life on both counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho bought it?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Aerie shrugs her shoulders. \u201cA company by the name of Plan B. It\u2019s a small private company. Sound Music is its first acquisition, but I know another magazine is being shopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d River responds.</p><p>\u201cAre you concerned?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cNo, just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like perfect timing if you ask me,\u201d I interject.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she says, looking a little nervous. Then, \u201cI can\u2019t divulge the details just yet. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. It\u2019s no skin off my back.</p><p>She fumbles through the papers on the table and my agitation level only grows.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to keep you. I just wanted you to have these,\u201d she says after she\u2019s located what she\u2019s looking for. She rises and walks over to where I\u2019m still standing at the bottom of the steps in the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d I have to ask because I have no f**king clue why she\u2019s handing me a stack of papers with numbers all over them.</p><p>\u201cSales reports and various supporting documents from when your father was signed under Sheep Industries\u2019 Little Red label.\u201d</p><p>I hand the papers back to her. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with these?\u201d</p><p>She pushes them toward me. \u201cLook at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAerie, I have a lot going on right now. Can this wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, I wouldn\u2019t be here if it could wait. I talked to Ivy yesterday and she told me everything. I know your mind is probably in a million places, but these reports are what she needs to get out from Damon\u2019s hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamon\u2019s hold?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cYes. Damon is blackmailing her\u2014or he was. I wanted her to have the information either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, I knew he was up to something. I just wasn\u2019t sure what. Do you know what he\u2019s holding over her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll she told me was that he\u2019d said he ruined Nick and he would do the same to you. But I overheard him on the phone with his attorney just before the takeover became official, and he said at least the marriage clause was executed before his old man passed. I know it has something to do with the will, but that was all I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh Wolf\u2019s will going public has to be news to everyone. I can only guess the bastard wanted to be the first to report it. Put his own spin on it,\u201d River muses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aerie flips through the stack and hands me two sheets of paper. \u201cWell, here is what I found. This report is from Little Red\u2019s records,\u201d she says, pointing to the column on the right. \u201cAnd this one I just got,\u201d she says, pointing to the one on the left, like I have any idea what that means.</p><p>I look at both pieces of paper. My eyes scour the numbers. They\u2019re different. I read the handwriting on the bottom and have no problem deciphering what this means now. \u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d River asks, standing and crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>Aerie explains. \u201cOne set was in the basement of Sheep Industries, the other is from a box of old papers that I found in my uncle\u2019s things when Jagger and I were going through everything a couple of months ago.\u201d</p> <p>I want to question her further, about how she got documents from the basement of Sheep Industries and why would sales reports of a record label be among her uncle\u2019s things, but right now I don\u2019t give a shit where the information came from. I stand there dumbfounded as River comes over to us and looks over my shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re for the same period of time, but there\u2019s a huge discrepancy in reported earnings,\u201d he manages to say, shock evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Aerie says.</p><p>What kind of person does that to someone? I have to sit down, and once I do, I read the handwritten note again, but it begins to blur. River sits next to me, both of us staring at the series of numbers in front of us. Spots cloud my vision and my heart pounds for the man I always knew as my father\u2014the one who wanted his whole life to be successful and thought he\u2019d failed . . . when in actuality he was a superstar in his own right.</p><p>Utter silence falls in the room. River and I both sit there in shock, absorbing the information that might have changed both our lives . . . Maybe we both take the quiet to fast-forward that life in our minds, or maybe we\u2019re barricading ourselves from the truth, maybe we\u2019re just trying to stop the black fury that comes with the truth\u2014or maybe those are just my feelings. I push aside the papers in my hands and lean over the others on the table, noticing that my hands are trembling. I look to my brother\u2014his face is white, his expression blank.</p><p>I take a deep breath, adjust my focus, and pull myself together. I drop my hands to my sides and flex my fingers. When Aerie\u2019s wide eyes meet mine I can finally say, \u201cThanks so much for this. I have to run, but call me for anything.\u201d</p> <p>River nods, still seemingly in a trance. Then he stands as well. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a sad smile. \u201cCall me for anything, Xander. I\u2019ll leave you all this,\u201d she says, pointing to the stack of papers. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly collaborating documentation in case you file a complaint with the FCC.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I stare at her. \u201cI think I\u2019ll handle this in my own way,\u201d I tell her with no edge to my voice at all. Do I want to turn him in or do I want to use this to get him to leave Ivy alone? That\u2019s a question I don\u2019t even have to ask myself.</p><p>River leads Aerie to the door. I hear them whispering in the foyer. I cradle my head in my hands and know I have to see my mother before I do anything else. The biggest question being . . . selflessness or selfishness? The two conflicting feelings struggle within me and I\u2019m not sure which will win out.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Thirty minutes later I\u2019ve sent my brother packing and I\u2019m climbing into my sister\u2019s car, which is still parked in my driveway. She never came to pick it up. She must be driving my mother\u2019s car. Fuck, I never called Ena and told her to get mine, but right now I don\u2019t give a shit about my car. There\u2019s no sign of the press and I\u2019m f**king thankful. At first I lurch full speed down the road in my sister\u2019s Cabriolet, but with no pickup in her chick car I change my mind and lay off the gas. Gripping the steering wheel tightly, I quickly decide to turn around, trading Sunset Boulevard for the scenic route, the longer way. While I drive, I think about everything that has happened over the past days. I think about my life. I\u2019m a guy who likes control. I follow a plan. I have a schedule. I\u2019m all about structure\u2014not chaos. And lately my life has been full of instability.</p> <p>As I drive through the wooded streets, I stare at the beautiful manicured lawns and large homes that belong to families who I bet know who they are. I think about Nick\u2014did he know any of this? If he knew the truth, why did he never treat me any different from River and Bell?</p><p>Pulling in the driveway, I park the car, whip off my sunglasses and toss them in the passenger seat. I look at the large two-story house tucked away behind a bounty of trees that my mother shares with Jack. I\u2019m suddenly thankful that this isn\u2019t my childhood home. I always thought it would have been cool to visit my mother with my kids at the place I grew up in\u2014but now it\u2019s a relief not to have to see that house again, since my childhood was a lie.</p><p>Turning off the ignition, I wipe those thoughts from my mind and get out of the car. I jam my hands into my pockets and pace the shadows of the sidewalk in front of the house. My stomach is in knots. I\u2019m not sure I can do this. What can she say to take any of the pain away? Nothing can make me feel any better. I notice a strange car in the driveway and wonder if Brigitte got a new one or if someone is visiting. Fuck.</p><p>I stall as long as I can, pondering leaving in case someone is here, but I take a deep breath and go for it, hoping it\u2019s just Bridgette\u2019s new car. I walk slowly along the cobblestone path that leads to the back entrance, before slipping in through the door. The gleaming black-and-white marble floor of the rear entrance blinds me and I pause a moment to reconsider having this conversation with my mother. I\u2019m still furious despite my heart pounding with fear, but I know I have to do this.</p><p>The kitchen smells of freshly brewed coffee and I look around for our housekeeper, Brigitte. Since she\u2019s been with our family for years, I wonder if she knows. The room is empty, though; she doesn\u2019t seem to be around, so I make my way through the house. The stab of irritation I\u2019m already feeling quickly turns to trepidation when I hear Ivy\u2019s voice\u2014she\u2019s here talking to my mother. The sadness in her tone makes me stop in my tracks. As if in slow motion, I come to a stop just outside the family room and listen.</p><p>My mother\u2019s voice is raspy as she speaks. \u201cYou did what you had to\u2014Xander will forgive you. I know he\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. But he looked so hurt and betrayed. It killed me to see him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, Xander is strong and perceptive. It\u2019s easy to see through Damon\u2019s manipulative ways and I\u2019m sure he did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, I feel so dumb. How did I never see that side of him until recently? If I had I would have never been with him. Never.\u201d Ivy starts to cry and her words only serve to strengthen not only my fury but also my fear.</p><p>It sounds like my mother\u2019s comforting her. Then Ivy continues. \u201cDamon told me after he received the call that his father passed that Josh\u2019s will had a clause in it that Damon had to be married to collect his inheritance. That\u2019s why he insisted we get married so quickly. I thought it was money from my performance he wanted. He said he only needed us to stay married for six months, enough time to produce an album. But really he knew his father didn\u2019t have much time and he wanted to be sure he got what he thought he\u2019d earned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ivy, no one could have known, darling,\u201d my mother says amid sobs.</p><p>Ivy\u2019s voice is low and I can\u2019t make out what she says.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how it hurts me that you had to go through that,\u201d my mother tells her.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, I\u2019m so sorry to come over like this. I just didn\u2019t know what to do. Xander won\u2019t answer my calls. I can\u2019t believe Damon made his father\u2019s will public. I heard him on the phone with his attorney, completely shocked that Xander was in the will and the marriage clause wasn\u2019t. I guess Josh changed his will, or Damon was told incorrect information. I don\u2019t know. But as soon as he was behind the microphone making that announcement about the will, I knew I had to be with Xander. But now that I\u2019m here I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><p>With my mother\u2019s sobs weighing me down and Ivy sounding so emotional, I can\u2019t stand to stay hidden listening any longer. I swing around the corner, almost manic. My mother turns toward me and I meet her gaze. Her face is full of concern and love, whereas I know mine must be a picture of confusion. She rushes over to me as I stand in a daze.</p><p>\u201cXander!\u201d She pulls me in for a tight embrace. Then she pulls away and clutches my face in her trembling hands. \u201cXander.\u201d She begins weeping again.</p><p>I shift on my feet, not sure what to ask. Not sure I want to know anything. I take a step back and nearly collide with the doorframe. The moment is awkward, and for the first time in my life I don\u2019t know what to say to my mother.</p><p>Ivy clears her throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you two alone. Thanks for talking to me, Charlotte.\u201d I meet her gaze and her sad eyes, but I can\u2019t talk to her now. I wish I could think of a way to let her know I know what she did and why she did it\u2014I hope she understands I\u2019m telling her I get it.</p><p>\u201cIvy, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d my mother manages, but I see Ivy turn and leave the room, then hear the click of the door. My mother is in such a state that her tears won\u2019t stop. She\u2019s sobbing so hard that her breathing is out of control.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, Mom,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you wouldn\u2019t come. That you\u2019d never talk to me again. I was so scared I wouldn\u2019t be able to explain everything to you.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand and lead her to the sofa. \u201cSit down, Mom. I\u2019m going to get you a glass of water. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She tries to stop me, but she\u2019s so hysterical I can\u2019t even understand what she\u2019s saying. I hate seeing her like this\u2014because of me. I pour some water in a glass and gulp it down, then fill another and take it to her. She drinks it, and once she sets the glass down, she takes my hands.</p><p>She looks at me helplessly. \u201cI want you to hear the truth from me. I should have been the one to tell you, and I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and then open them to look at her. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>With a deep sigh, my mother starts to explain. \u201cI never told any of you that your father and I spent some time apart before we were married. That was a dark time for me. I was lost and alone. I had dated your father all through high school, and then we broke up shortly after he left to go on tour. I missed him terribly. Dylan and Damon went to UCLA with me. We were friends, but I had allowed Damon to fill my head with stories of what it must be like on the road. I loved Nick so much, but jealousy tore us apart. After we broke up I spent a lot of time with Dylan and Damon. I started to date Dylan, but it didn\u2019t last long. Once we broke up\u2014well, Damon\u2014he was there for me. He made me think he was taking care of me\u2014that my well-being was what mattered to him. He made himself trustworthy, he was a friend, a confidant even. And then one day he turned on me. Even now his name is a painful reminder. I never say it. Never talk about him or his brother. I let it go\u2014I had to. But I\u2019ll never forget . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you don\u2019t have to go on. It\u2019s okay.\u201d My voice fades, but I know she hears it. She seems to forget I\u2019m there, even though her story continues.</p><p>\u201cI woke up the morning of Dylan\u2019s death with a feeling of terrible anticipation\u2014something had startled me out of what I thought was a horrifying dream. I sat up and realized I wasn\u2019t in my own bed. My stomach was in knots from one too many drinks the night before. I groggily scanned the area for clues, trying to remember why I was in Damon\u2019s room.\u201d Her voice goes hoarse and I hand her the glass of water again.</p><p>\u201cDamon rushed into the room\u2014opening the door and closing it behind him just as quickly. He spoke haltingly as he opened the blinds and let the light flood the room. His tone was unusually grim and his haste caught me off guard. He told me he took care of everything. I didn\u2019t know what he meant. I was scared. Shivering, I pulled the covers up closer to me and asked him what he was talking about. But even as the words left my mouth, hazy memories of what had happened came rushing back to me. I looked out the huge window at the daylight and tried to piece together where the previous night had led.\u201d She stops again and I\u2019m feeling poisoned by my own thoughts. Sitting up straighter, I try to calm my breathing so I can speak, but she starts again before I can say anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfter a few moments I cleared my dry throat and told him I had been out with my girlfriends and I\u2019d had a little too much to drink. I\u2019d called Dylan from the bar to see how he was doing. We had run into each other earlier that day and he looked terrible, so I wanted to check on him. He had asked me to come over and I couldn\u2019t say no. When I got there he cried for me to take him back and when I refused he was so upset. I tried to talk to him, but he wouldn\u2019t listen so I thought it best that I leave. I told Damon that when I tried, Dylan begged me to stay, so I did.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick\u2014my head is pounding and I\u2019m not sure I want to hear any more, but my mother seems intent on telling me the whole story.</p><p>Swallowing, she goes on, but the words stick in her throat. \u201cHe was a mess and he needed someone. Please don\u2019t judge me, Xander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, Mom, I\u2019m not. I promise,\u201d I assure her. Because I am certainly in no place to judge.</p> <p>\u201cI started to feel sick when I was telling Damon what had happened\u2014I felt so incredibly hungover, so I slowly edged toward the bathroom, but I stopped at the dresser to look in the mirror. My hair was a mess, my eyes deeply shadowed, and my face pale, but what concerned me most was Damon\u2019s reflection staring back at me\u2014the crease in his brow and the anger in his eyes scared me.\u201d</p><p>And once again my mind entertains thoughts of wanting to kill him.</p><p>She goes on. \u201cThe rest happened so fast. Damon told me Dylan was in the hospital, I\u2019ll never forget the icy-cold edge to his voice. I looked at my hands and saw red stains and I screamed. Just then the phone rang and he answered it. The expression on his face darkened as he hung up the receiver. In that instant I felt like I had to get out of there. For the first time I was afraid of him. As I moved, the room started spinning, but I managed to make my way to the door. I swung the door open to the family room, the room I had been in the previous night. He caught me before I crossed the threshold and told me Dylan had died and I cried as I ran out of his bedroom and the nightmare of the previous night set in. The last thing I remember is the floor rushed up to meet me and unconsciousness consumed me.\u201d</p><p>My mother pauses and seems to snap out of whatever trance she was in. \u201cWhen I woke up I was home alone. He had brought me home. I remembered everything then. Dylan had gotten up and a few minutes later I heard a thud. I ran into the living room and there he was lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He must have fallen and hit his head on the coffee table. A syringe was on the floor next to him. Damon came in as I hovered over him and found us. He called for an ambulance and they came and took Dylan to the hospital. Damon stayed with me. Dylan died of an overdose before Damon made it to the hospital. Nick flew back for the funeral and we went for coffee and started talking. We kept talking even after he left again and we ended up reconciling while he was still on the road. He even asked me to marry him over the phone. He was always so impatient. God, I loved that man.\u201d She pauses again, taking another breath and squeezing my hand. \u201cAfter Nick left again to get back on the road, Damon kept coming around, but his mood was darker, grimmer. I thought it was because his brother had died and I didn\u2019t want to turn my back on him. One day he asked me about Nick and I told him we were back together. It was like a switch went off. He started blaming me for Dylan\u2019s death. He\u2019d call me and ask if I wanted to go to dinner one minute and when I\u2019d say no he\u2019d ask if I wanted to go to jail. I knew what he was doing\u2014he was trying to scare me into marrying him. I knew I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong\u2014but I still worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made him finally leave you alone?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t right away. First, he tried to convince me to marry him, and when that didn\u2019t work he threatened me. But my father overheard our conversation and when he asked me about it, I broke down and told him everything. My father intervened and after that I never heard from Damon again\u2014I honestly don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><p>My ribs ache from breathing so erratically as I listened to my mother. I take a good look at her for the first time since sitting down next to her. She\u2019s wearing tan linen pants that look like they\u2019ve been slept in. Her white blouse looks rumpled and is covered in coffee stains. Her naturally long brown hair is messy and her eyes are swollen. Seeing her like this . . . I can\u2019t fight what\u2019s in me. I want to be mad, upset, yell at her, curse the day she gave birth to me, but she\u2019s my mother and I love her. I\u2019ve always looked after her, protected her, and I can\u2019t change that now.</p><p>The words just slip out. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand why you didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She takes a deep breath and her tears start to wane, but her chest seems to be heaving at a greater rate. I draw her into my arms and kiss her hair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay, Mom. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>She wraps her arms around me in return and rocks me back and forth. In her comforting arms everything I\u2019ve been feeling melts away. This woman loves me for who I am. After a beat, I pull away and wipe the tears from her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cXander, Nick will always be your father. Please tell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you about Dylan, but once you knew, you couldn\u2019t unknow it. And I just knew it would have mattered to you so much more than it should have. You were always my and Nick\u2019s firstborn. You were his son and he loved you.\u201d</p><p>My words come out as the question of a young boy. \u201cDid you love my father, my real one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s your real father, Xander. Dylan and I had a short and turbulent relationship and he died before he ever knew about you. So Nick\u2014he is your real father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he know? Nick, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course he knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could it not have mattered to him?\u201d I ask, looking into her eyes\u2014the eyes that none of us had inherited. Mine are more brown, like his, I\u2019m sure, and River\u2019s and Bell\u2019s are greener, like Nick\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cYour father and I loved each other, and the time we were apart took its toll on both of us. Once we were finally back together, we vowed we\u2019d never let anything tear us apart, and I tried to keep that promise.\u201d She cries a little more and her words trail off. She doesn\u2019t have to finish. Walking over to the mantel, she lifts a crystal-framed photo of River, Bell, and me. \u201cWhen I told your father I was pregnant, he stared at me for the longest time. We both knew whose baby it had to be. I expected anger, or worse. But instead he put a protective hand on my belly and with a calm and certain voice he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have a baby, Charlotte, so now you have to marry me.\u2019 That\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you not hate me?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I ever hate you? You\u2019re my son. I love you. You healed me.\u201d</p><p>At her words my gut wrenches. I swallow hard. \u201cHealed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealed, mended, made me the person I wanted to be. You made me grow up and, Xander, I loved my life with your father. I loved him. I know he had his flaws and I know you saw him in a way that highlighted those flaws, but he was a good man. He loved us. He loved you, Xander. You were his son. It made no difference whose blood ran through your veins. And I think he was more afraid of you finding out and not loving him than anything else. He was so proud of you. He loved you so much.\u201d</p><p>I wince at the raw emotion in her statement and stare at her, at a loss for words. I hated my father for so long I never looked at the good in him. I buried those memories the day he killed himself. But he was my father, not the man with the brown eyes, but the one with the green ones. And he loved me. He did.</p><p>Everything is a jumbled mess in my head. I can\u2019t look at my mother anymore because she\u2019s right. I feel a need to flee from any more emotional conversation. I stand up and cross the room to the sliding doors, go out onto the deck, then across the wet lawn. The sprinklers are on, but I sprint across the yard and fall to my knees. Holding my head in my hands, I think of Nick taking us to every concert, instilling in us everything he knew about music, teaching me to drive in the Corvette he never drove anymore because it wasn\u2019t a practical family car. He was my father, but over the years I\u2019d forgotten all the good things.</p><p>\u201cXander!\u201d The slight wind carries her shaky voice, but I can hear it. I can hear the worry and concern.</p><p>At first I don\u2019t move. She calls to me again. I raise my head and see her wiping her tears, the tears I\u2019m causing to fall, and I lift myself up. And in this moment of clarity, I realize I don\u2019t give a shit who my biological father is. And I know with everything I am that I loved Nick Wilde and that I have to tell him. But before I go I have to tell my mother about the falsified sales reports\u2014the reports that not only changed Nick\u2019s life, but all of ours.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The memories that hit me as I enter Forest Lawn Cemetery are oddly not memories of the many times I\u2019ve been here, but ones of the people it holds. All of my grandparents, both my mother\u2019s and my father\u2019s, are buried here, and of course so is my father, Nick. It\u2019s an older place with large tombstones . . . some toppled, some crumbling with age, others new. It\u2019s eerily quiet and I can hear the birds singing as they land on top of the marble and stone that line the rows.</p><p>It seems wrong to come here and not visit my grandparents. A young boy is selling cut flowers and I stop to purchase a wrap from him. I ask him what kind of flowers they are, and he says, \u201cToday I have lilies, but tomorrow I\u2019ll have wreaths with a mixture of flowers.\u201d I just grin at his enthusiasm\u2014an entrepreneur in the making.</p><p>The grass between the carved headstones leads to people I don\u2019t know, but I read their names etched on the stones as I pass and scan their markers. Some of those buried here lived long, full lives. Some of their gravestones read, BELOVED HUSBAND AND FATHER or BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER. Others aren\u2019t so descriptive, with just their date of birth followed by their date of death. Wilted bouquets of flowers lie below some of the gravestones and others have rosary beads draped around them. A far greater amount show no sign of visitation.</p><p>I stop at Nick\u2019s parents\u2019 graves first. Pulling two lilies from the stemmed flowers I\u2019m holding, I place one on my grandmother\u2019s grave and then another on my grandfather\u2019s. Finding words has never been easy for me, but today my thoughts pour out and I thank them for loving me.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve told them all I can handle right now, I stand and make my way down the path toward Nick\u2019s grave. I think about him, about our life as a family, and about the turn his life took because of a man that hated him. Stopping in front of his headstone, I stare at it and silently recite the last words scripted on it: \u201cA beloved son, husband, and father rests here where no shadows fall.\u201d It\u2019s a simple inscription but full of so much meaning. More now that I know the truth. I\u2019ve never actually come here to visit him. I came with my grandparents to help take care of the area, I came with my mother when she needed to visit, but I\u2019ve never come for me\u2014just to talk to him.</p><p>I shuffle on my feet, feeling uncomfortable, and stand in front of the industrial gray marker. I run my fingers through my hair, then skim them over the smoothness of the stone. Glancing around, I\u2019m surprised at how well tended the site is. My mother or Bell, or possibly even River, must still come here. I don\u2019t know\u2014I have never asked. I\u2019ve carried this anger toward him deep inside myself for so long that once in a while I can douse it, but it has never gone away. I didn\u2019t think I would ever get rid of it, but right now I don\u2019t feel it anymore. The trees lining the cemetery sway back and forth as a slight wind ripples through the air. I inhale and let it out. I clear my throat and try to find my voice. This is so much more difficult than I ever thought it would be. I take another deep breath and sit down.</p><p>Dad,</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My old man killed himself and left me to take care of the family. That was my \u201ctagline\u201d whenever anyone asked me about you. That basically summed up everything anyone needed to know about you as far as I was concerned. I hated you\u2014not only for taking your life and leaving us, but also for leaving me feeling guilty in the wake of your death. I was never the same\u2014our family, your family, we were never the same without you.</p><p>River and I said once if our life before you died was a puzzle, you took a piece of that puzzle with you\u2014a piece that can never be returned. It took me until now to see that you were a product of the tolls life took on you . . . that you were a good man who had more than his share of obstacles thrown his way. But you and me\u2014we shared a bond and I felt like you destroyed it when you took your life. I was mad at you a lot, but I was a teenager, you were the adult. You should have had faith that I loved you, no matter what. I mean, come on, you knew me better than anyone else\u2014and I always wondered why. Was it because you wanted to make sure I was more like you than him? If so, I hope you are proud of me because I am proud to be so much more like you.</p><p>My view of the world has changed since your death, but I remember when I was young and naive and you taught me everything you could about music and helped me believe in the magic of the world. We looked for four-leaf clovers for hours and when we found one, you laminated it for me to preserve that small wonder. When I had questions, you answered them. You were always there for me.</p><p>Then after the funeral, that all changed. I lost my parent, my hero, and my teacher. I thought a lot about death and dying and who was to blame. In the end I blamed you rather than myself, but now standing here talking to you\u2014I blame no one. I just wanted you to know that\u2014I blame no one. And, Dad, know this\u2014I love you.</p> <p>That\u2019s how I feel about him\u2014finally I can accept him for him. I get to my feet and brush off the grass. Then I pick up the flower pack and pull the lilies out one by one and lay them on the ground. As I turn and walk away, birds sing and a bell tolls in the distance, but all I can think about is this man who I called Dad, even with all of his flaws\u2014he was my dad and I loved him.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>I\u2019m Alive</p><p>My eyes blink against the silvery glow of moonlight as I open the door. Her earrings glimmer and her shy smile makes it hard to breathe. I\u2019d fallen asleep on the couch and the sound of the doorbell jolted me awake. I\u2019m surprised to see her\u2014why, I\u2019m not sure. Maybe because I acted like an ass**le, maybe because I feel like I should have taken her away from him. I haven\u2019t had time to figure out where exactly my guilt is coming from, but as I stand before her I know it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>We look at each other for the longest time until I notice her eyes tilt to my chest and I realize my shirt is unbuttoned. She\u2019s staring at my skin, at my side, where the ROSES ARE SO CLICH\u00c9 tattoo is inked\u2014the tattoo I got for her because I knew I\u2019d always love her. I know that not even what has happened the last few days can change that. She stands in the doorway before me, quiet and utterly gorgeous. She\u2019s in a pair of jeans and a simple white T-shirt. She\u2019s not wearing any makeup, not even her trademark red lipstick, and her hair is pulled back by some kind of band. My heart races at the sight of her and I let out a long breath.</p> <p>\u201cIvy,\u201d I manage as the love I feel for her whirls around and cocoons us.</p><p>Her cheeks flush at the sound of her own name.</p><p>\u201cXander, I\u2019m so sorry. Are you okay?\u201d she asks in an impassioned voice.</p><p>I nod. But I don\u2019t want to discuss Nick or Dylan any more today. After a beat, I ask, \u201cIs everything all right? What are you doing here so late?\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms tightly over her stomach and grips her elbows. \u201cI needed to see you. Make sure you were all right. Can we talk?\u201d</p><p>My breath catches on the smallness of her voice\u2014the uncertainty in it tears a hole through me. She holds my gaze, and my gut twists in a funny way. She inhales deeply and blurts out, \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to say I\u2019m sorry. I left Damon. I never loved him. I only married him to protect you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper and close my eyes, standing silent for the longest time. It\u2019s like my body turns to stone at the mere mention of his name. When I open my eyes and look at her, I let everything go and just pull her to me and hold her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Xander,\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper again, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s married to him. I swallow, trying to catch my breath and then pull away. I move aside and motion for her to come in. She reaches for me again, but I retreat and instead place my hand on the small of her back and guide her into the living room. This slight, seemingly intimate touch makes me come alive. I want to feel her skin all over mine, touch her, taste her, sink into her. I want to forget about the day and just get lost in her. But she\u2019s married. We take the step down into the living room. My stuff is thrown on the coffee table and the pillows from the sofa are tossed on the floor. Normally I\u2019d have an urge to pick up, but I really don\u2019t give a shit right now. When my eyes shift from the floor to her, I see it\u2014the innocence she possesses\u2014and my guilt is back.</p><p>\u201cI want to explain everything, Xander,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>\u201cI understand why you did what you did. You don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d I pause, then add, \u201cFuck, I just wish you hadn\u2019t . . . After everything, I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t . . .\u201d I stop as the words keep catching in my throat.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t what?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYou should have called me the minute he showed up. To be honest with you, I can\u2019t even think about you with him without wanting to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did call you, Xander. I did,\u201d she cries. \u201cBut Amy answered and I hung up. Did you run to her the minute you got home?\u201d</p> <p>I whirl around to face her. \u201cFuck, no! Of course not. I didn\u2019t even know you called.\u201d I try to figure out how Amy would have answered and then I remember being over at River and Dahlia\u2019s and leaving my phone on the counter. \u201cI headed over to my brother\u2019s to pick up some things and left my phone on the counter. She was there helping my mother get some food ready. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Alarm flashes across her face. \u201cI believe you. I do. But I needed to talk to you then. Damon was threatening you and the band. I tried to reach you and she answered your phone and I had no idea what that meant. Before I knew it, he was whisking me off to get married. He told me if I didn\u2019t do it he was going to tear you apart with lies\u2014your life, your band, your family. He was on the phone with TMZ. He gave me five seconds to make my decision. I knew I\u2019d regret not stopping him for the rest of my life\u2014so I agreed to his terms\u2014I had to appear happily married to him for six months. Once I said yes, we were married before I could even think twice about it. In hindsight that may not have been the best decision to make, but it seemed right at the time. Xander, I\u2019m so sorry, but I hope you understand and forgive me.\u201d</p><p>I sit a safe distance from her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive. You did what you felt was right. I may not agree with it, but I understand. I get it, but that doesn\u2019t change anything right now. You\u2019re still tied to him\u2014not me\u2014and I can\u2019t stand it. I have to figure this out. You need to give me some time. I need to get a handle on how to proceed.\u201d Looking at her, I want nothing more than to thread my fingers through her hair and pull her mouth to mine. But I can\u2019t. I swallow the lump in my throat. I don\u2019t want to ask the question because there can be only one answer that will make us all right. Bending down, I cradle my head in my hands.</p><p>\u201cXander, talk to me,\u201d she begs.</p><p>\u201cI just need to know one thing right now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes search mine and she never lifts her gaze. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>I shift uncomfortably before I even ask the question. But I\u2019m tired, beat, shot for the day, so I just ask, \u201cDid you let him touch you while you were together on the bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. No. No, Xander. I would never. Not after you and me. Not after what we finally had again. I don\u2019t want anyone else. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she seems so far away. I stand up and close the distance between us. She smiles at me and I wrap her in my arms. We hold each other for a long time. I kiss her head over and over. \u201cCome here,\u201d I whisper in her ear, and I sit down, pulling her onto my lap. I slump back against the couch. Relief floods me, and now that that burden has been lifted off my shoulders exhaustion overtakes me. \u201cIvy, I know we have a lot of talking to do, but I just can\u2019t right now. I\u2019m just wiped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand. We can talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I nod with a small smile and claim her mouth as mine. \u201cIvy,\u201d I breathe against her lips.</p><p>\u201cXander, take me to bed. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ivy. Not while you\u2019re someone else\u2019s. I want you, but we need to figure all of this out.\u201d I stare into her perfect face and know I\u2019ll do anything to make her mine.</p><p>She pleads, \u201cPlease let me stay here.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to contemplate what to do\u2014I lift her off my lap and stand up. \u201cCome with me,\u201d I tell her and lead her to my room. She changes into one of my T-shirts and I get her settled in bed and kiss her on the forehead. \u201cGood night, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep on the couch.\u201d</p><p>She clasps my hand. \u201cNo, stay with me. I just want to be near you. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, don\u2019t make this more difficult. You\u2019re still married to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were married for three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re still married and until we can take care of that I think we should keep our distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just stay with me. Just lie down with me until I fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>Tired, worn, and so in love with her, I give in, against my better judgment. Seeing her lying on the bed, I feel like my willpower has already crumpled and being this close to her is crushing it. I bite down on my lip to keep from stripping her clothes off and f**king her right now. She pats the bed next to her and I give in and crawl in beside her. She rests her head on my chest and I wrap my arm around her. I squeeze her against me and she\u2019s right where she should be. I close my eyes and finally find peace.</p><p>The bathroom light illuminates the room a bit when I wake up to her fingers trailing down my stomach. I take a deep breath. \u201cNo, Ivy, I told you. Not while you\u2019re married to him. Don\u2019t make this any harder.\u201d Her touch is breaking me down. I have to find whatever strength I have left to deny the need to bury myself in her. I want to slide inside her and just let time slip away. But I\u2019ll hate myself if I do.</p><p>\u201cEven if we can\u2019t be together, we can be close in a different way,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Her fingers brush the side of my cheek. \u201cXander . . .\u201d She shifts her body so she\u2019s lying on her back.</p><p>My pulse races as her hands drift down her own body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to touch myself and I want you to do the same,\u201d she says in a soft, quiet voice, and even in the barely lit room I can see her cheeks flush violently. I\u2019m shocked by her words, but it\u2019s her actions that floor me. I sit up, but don\u2019t say a word. I\u2019m mesmerized by the look on her face. She stands up and I watch her every move. My breathing is so accelerated I\u2019m not sure if I can ever catch my breath. She lifts my T-shirt over her head and runs her fingers over her pink bra. She reaches behind her to undo it and she slowly lets the straps fall down her shoulders. I lick my lips at the sight. The bra falls from her body and her perfect br**sts are all I see. I want so much to touch them, squeeze them, suck her ni**les into small peaks, but I can\u2019t\u2014I won\u2019t.</p><p>Instead I continue to watch her, captivated not only by her actions, by her beauty, but by her body language as well\u2014by the way I can tell she wants me to know she loves me. She moves her hands to her panties and I hold my breath. Exhaling, barely able to speak, I ask in a hoarse, low voice, \u201cFuck, what are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reaches inside the lace and her back arches as her hand disappears. A low, slow groan slips from my lips. \u201cI told you. I\u2019m going to touch myself. I\u2019m going to make my hands yours the way we talked about so many years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can stay or you can go take a cold shower and come back after, but I need you, even if I have to imagine you\u2019re the one getting me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ivy,\u201d is all I can say.</p><p>\u201cJoin me or don\u2019t,\u201d she whispers so sweetly and so full of seduction. I can feel the sound echoing in my cock.</p><p>When she hooks her thumbs into her matching pink lacey underwear, I chew my bottom lip. Fuck, do I look like a pervert if I do this? When I was eighteen it sounded hot\u2014now I\u2019m not so sure. But I want to do it in the worst way. No, what I want in the worst way is for her hands to be my hands, but I\u2019m not giving in. I\u2019m not f**king her when she\u2019s married to him\u2014I won\u2019t be the other guy.</p> <p>Her eyes close and she strokes and tweaks her ni**les. I can see them harden and my c**k grows harder with each passing second. The room is so quiet, I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. \u201cUse your thumbs,\u201d I tell her, and her eyes open but remain hooded. She smiles and does as I tell her. I\u2019m almost panting at the sight. \u201cLie down,\u201d I direct her. But she doesn\u2019t do it right away. Instead she slides her panties off and her whole body flushes everywhere. Once she\u2019s naked, then she lies on the bed. Her head rests on a stack of pillows and my body molds into the mattress. When she spreads her legs and lifts her hips, I want so badly to be the one to fill her that I have to close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cXander.\u201d She calls my name, and my eyes fly open just in time to see her hand cup her pu**y. She runs her fingers through her folds and all my muscles clench with need. It\u2019s an urgency unlike I\u2019ve ever felt before\u2014it\u2019s a need for her.</p><p>Her hands continue to move. Fuck, she\u2019s really going to do this. I have two choices: enjoy it or leave and endure the torture of wishing I\u2019d stayed. It\u2019s an easy choice. I unhook the button on my jeans and shove them down just enough to free my cock. I kick them the rest of the way off, then whisper, \u201cAre you wet?\u201d and she lets out a small whimper while nodding her head.</p><p>She presses the heel of her palm against her cl*t and then I watch as her fingers circle it over and over. I start stroking myself; concentrating on the fact that it\u2019s her hands, not mine, bringing me closer to exploding. I bite down on my lip and let my head tip back as I feel the intensity of her stare on me and the sounds of her rapid breathing. Once I start and I know she\u2019s watching I don\u2019t stop. I\u2019m doing this for her, for me, for us. Stroking myself, I push my h*ps forward and thrust my c**k into my closed fist.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cMore than okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me. Tell me what you like me to do to you and then do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your fingers inside me,\u201d she says shakily.</p><p>\u201cInside you where?\u201d I ask, stroking myself faster. Pumping in and out, wishing it was her I was thrusting into.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say it,\u201d she says.</p><p>I grunt at the sound of her voice. The innocence in it and the thought that she\u2019s doing this with me almost sends me over the edge.</p> <p>\u201cAdd another finger,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThen with your other hand rub circles around your clit, massage it. Find the spot and when you do, pretend my tongue is on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Xander,\u201d she moans and lifts her hips, pressing her heels into the mattress. Watching her fall apart makes me come hard with a shuddering release. After a few seconds, she collapses to the bed, and I do the same.</p><p>\u201cI need to jump in the shower, alone,\u201d I tell her and she nods at me.</p><p>Just as I hit the threshold, she purrs, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I turn around. \u201cYou never have to thank me for that.\u201d I grin.</p><p>When I get out of the shower I throw a pair of sweatpants on and head back into the bedroom. She\u2019s back in my T-shirt, under the covers and half asleep. I climb in beside her and find her hand, lacing my fingers in hers and pulling her against me, my front to her back.</p><p>I hear her give a sigh of contentment.</p><p>I squeeze her tight.</p> <p>\u201cGood night, Xander. I love you,\u201d she says.</p><p>Leaning over, I whisper into her ear. \u201cGood night, baby. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I allow myself a soft, sweet kiss to her cheek and slide my mouth to her lips before throwing my body back on the mattress. I close my eyes knowing she knows I\u2019m right\u2014us being together before her ties with him are severed will just muddy up the relationship that we\u2019ve worked really hard at. But knowing this doesn\u2019t make any of it any easier.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Fingers creep across the pillow and push my hair away. I open my eyes to peer into her beautiful ones. \u201cGood morning.\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d She smiles, inching closer to me.</p><p>I glance at the digits on the old clock radio on my nightstand and hop out of bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she calls softly, her sleepy eyes gleaming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t go yet. Come back to bed,\u201d she says, rolling over onto her stomach and rising on her elbows.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. When I lie next to you like that, all I can think about is being inside you. I need to take care of the Damon situation.\u201d</p><p>She rolls back over and tosses the pillows off the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to touch myself again. Aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ivy. Don\u2019t talk like that. The shower can\u2019t get cold enough for me already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could let your crazy thoughts go and spend the day in bed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, stop. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander, his father is being buried today. My attorney said he\u2019d take care of it as soon as he could.\u201d</p><p>I look at her. \u201cIvy, I\u2019ll take care of it much sooner. I can promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Looking out the car window, squinting against the brightness of the sun, I think I have to get my f**king car back. And what is Bell doing without a car anyway?</p><p>Turning the corner to my mother\u2019s house again, I resolve not to be so emotional. I need to know what she knows about Damon and his family.</p><p>I step in the back door again. This time Brigitte is in the kitchen. Her shoes clatter against the floor as she runs to greet me. \u201cMy Xander. My Xander,\u201d she says, hugging me.</p><p>\u201cBrigitte. How are you?\u201d I respond.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she answers. \u201cYour mother will be so pleased to see you.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her cheek and make my way through the house. I find my mother sitting in her leopard-print chair at the oversized desk in her office. This room is her domain. The carpet is the lightest of beiges. The walls are a deep red with three large shadow boxes strategically placed behind her desk. They are lit from within. One houses my first basketball jersey, another River\u2019s pint-sized first guitar, and the third one holds Bell\u2019s pink ballet slippers. Our most prized possessions that she just couldn\u2019t part with. Photos plaster the walls. On one wall, photos of the three of us kids are hung, and on another, photos of her parents and sister. There is one large photo of my mother and Jack on her desk.</p><p>She looks up at me from over her reading glasses. She opens her mouth to say something, but I\u2019ve already crossed the room and planted a kiss on her cheek. \u201cI love you, Mom,\u201d I tell her, because I know I don\u2019t let her know this often enough.</p><p>She stares at me, squeezing the hand I leave on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Mom. I am. But I need some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about Ivy and Damon,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMom, I need to understand him. What makes him tick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower and money.\u201d She looks at me and then picks up a letter on her desk. Running her finger over the edges, she hands it to me and says, \u201cI think this is what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>I take a shaky breath. My hand grips the envelope tightly for a few seconds. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your inheritance.\u201d</p><p>My mind is running in circles. \u201cWhat do you mean, my inheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh Wolf was a good man. He never knew Dylan was your biological father until Damon blurted it out one night in the heat of anger. He came to see me afterward. You were around seven. I made him promise to leave you alone, and he did as I asked. His only request was that I send a photo of you once a year on your birthday with a few words about you written on the back. He wanted to know you even if he couldn\u2019t really know you.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me, studying my reaction before continuing. \u201cThis came this morning. It\u2019s a letter from Josh\u2019s attorney telling me it was Josh\u2019s wish for me to use my best judgment in determining if you are ready for this. Ironic that his son couldn\u2019t even let him die in peace. He had to tell the world about you before his father could. I\u2019m really sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I told you I\u2019m okay. And I am.\u201d I take the letter and have a seat. I open it and a number of pictures fall out onto the thick carpet. I bend to pick them up\u2014they\u2019re of me, with words written on the back. A picture of me in a Poison T-shirt at eight years old with the words \u201cLoves Ninja Turtles\u201d on the back. Another of me with my new guitar, the words \u201cLoves to jam\u201d scripted on the reverse side. I pile them all together and sit back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cI stopped sending them when you turned eighteen. At that point I figured you were a man and I couldn\u2019t stop him from telling you if he wanted. I thought about telling you so many times after Daddy\u2019s death because I was afraid Josh or Damon would, but I couldn\u2019t get the words out. Like I said, Josh was a good man and he respected my wishes.\u201d</p><p>I understand why she couldn\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t have to ask. She knew how much I hated Nick then. And she didn\u2019t want me to hate him. She wanted me to love him like she loved me. She was right not to tell me because I\u2019m not sure how I would have reacted back then. I shuffle the stuffed envelope between my hands until I decide to pull the letter out. The note itself is a short handwritten one . . .</p><p>I\u2019ve watched you grow into a young man. I\u2019ve watched you take control of your life. I wish I could have been a part of your life, but you have a family that loves you more than anything, so it\u2019s only in my death that I\u2019m able to tell you how proud of you I am. By all rights what I\u2019m giving you is yours. Take care and never forget who you are.</p><p>Love, Your Grandfather</p><p>I unfold the thickly folded pieces of paper and read the bottom line\u2014he\u2019s left me half of Sheep Industries. I stare in disbelief. I stand up with a huge grin on my face.</p><p>\u201cXander, where are you going?\u201d my mother asks.</p><p>I look at her. \u201cTo take back what\u2019s mine. Do you know where the funeral is taking place?\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The afternoon sun is warm on my face. I take a left turn and slam right into the congested part of the city. I quickly change lanes, wishing I had my own car because every time I accelerate, this little putt-putt car goes nowhere. Exiting the highway, I see a steady line of cars pulling into Evergreen Cemetery. The media are following right behind, but a police barricade turns them away. I turn on my headlights and slip into the funeral procession without a problem. Once I\u2019m in, I ease off toward the east side of the cemetery with the processional cars heading south. I park and watch as men in suits and women in dresses spill from their automobiles. They\u2019re all engaged in their own conversations as they walk through the cemetery to Josh Wolf\u2019s final resting place. I watch the pallbearers pull the casket from the black hearse and an uneasiness creeps through me. I didn\u2019t know the man lying in the long rectangular box, but he was my grandfather and he left me half of his company.</p><p>I sit in the car and watch until everyone assembles for the burial ceremony. Once everyone has gathered, I see him. He stands front and center\u2014smug, black suit, sunglasses, and a rose in his hand. Fuck, a rose. I laugh to myself, thinking Roses are so clich\u00e9. Getting out of the car, I lean against the door and just watch. The sound of his muffled voice courses through my body and lures me closer. From a distance I watch as people with tearstained faces throw roses on top of the casket. The ceremony is soon over and everyone seems to disperse quickly. I take the opportunity to blend into the crowd and make my way toward Damon. His bodyguard is a few feet away and I wonder why he has one\u2014I thought he had hired the ninja for Ivy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Weaving through the tombstones that will last far longer than the lives they mark, I near the gravesite. The casket is resting in the hollowed-out earth and Damon stands next to it talking to a silver-haired woman dabbing her eyes with a white handkerchief. As soon as I approach, the ninja is on me. Damon excuses himself and with a staggered gait that can only be for show, he confronts me. Through gritted teeth he says, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d There\u2019s a calm control to my voice that I\u2019m surprised by, considering I want to pound the shit out of him and bury him in the hole.</p><p>He\u2019s glaring at me through his sunglasses. His hate for me is so apparent. \u201cThis is my father\u2019s funeral. How dare you show up here!\u201d His blood pressure must be out of control because his face turns beet red.</p><p>My eyes hold his. \u201cMeet me in your office in one hour. Alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d He flinches, trying to find his composure.</p><p>\u201cBecause you and I,\u201d I tell him, anger coursing through my veins at an uncontrollable speed, \u201chave business to discuss.\u201d</p><p>He works his jaw. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>Before walking away, I sneer and say, \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019ll be if you don\u2019t meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Rush hour is barely beginning as I approach the city. With one hand I grip the wheel; with the other, I verify the address. I know where I\u2019m going, but I want to be sure. Taking the next left, I pull into an underground garage but decide not to take the elevator leading straight into the building. I want to see it from the outside. I take my time entering the large black marble building with gilded doors. The number reads \u201c1619\u201d and the words above the door spell out SHEEP INDUSTRIES in big block letters. Entering the lobby of the building that is home to most of Sheep Industries\u2019 holdings\u2014Little Red, Front Line Management, and House Records, I\u2019m not surprised at what I see. The lobby is nothing less than posh. Several seating areas span the vast area in color variations on the building itself\u2014golds, whites, and blacks. Plaques, certificates, and various recognitions cover an entire lobby wall. The reception desk in the middle of the jet-black marble floor is the home to three women, all with headphones hooked over their ears. I approach them with a strange trepidation\u2014this building, these furnishings, the businesses under this roof are half mine. I\u2019m connected to them by a bloodline I never knew flowed through my veins.</p><p>Approaching the oldest of the women, who\u2019s wearing a black blouse and has short gray hair, I smile and say, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Xander Wilde, and I\u2019m here to see Damon Wolf.\u201d</p><p>She almost cracks a smile but keeps her businesslike demeanor. \u201cYes, Mr. Wilde, he\u2019s expecting you. Take the elevator to the twelfth floor and his receptionist will show you the way from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I reply and then make my way to the elevator. My nerves start to pop and my legs seem to be shaking\u2014what the hell am I nervous about? Stepping into the elevator, I can only think, Keep your poker face on, mean what you say, and own it. The doors close and I close my eyes. The doors open and I\u2019m not even paying attention until the bell dings. I snap my eyes open and hustle out of there. Game on.</p><p>My fingertips tap the dark wood of the reception desk and a cute redheaded girl smiles at me. \u201cYou must be Mr. Wilde. Flo told me you were on your way to see Mr. Wolf. Let me show you in. I\u2019ve already told him you had arrived.\u201d</p><p>She opens his door and holds it open for me to enter. I walk into his over-the-top office\u2014a huge mahogany desk, floor-to-ceiling windows with a view, four large-screen TVs on a red wall, a sheepskin rug with a large leather sofa on top of it. All very designer chic, all very impersonal. He\u2019s standing at the bar, pouring himself what looks to be a scotch. He raises his glass. \u201cI\u2019d offer you one, but you won\u2019t be here long enough to drink it and I hate to waste hundred-year-old Balvenie.\u201d</p> <p>Striding across the room in two seconds flat, I decide I\u2019ve had enough of him. I snatch his shirt, but stay in complete control of my actions. I push him roughly, slamming his back up against the wall. \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d I stare hard into his cold brown eyes and repeat myself. \u201cYou disgust me . . .\u201d</p><p>He struggles to free himself from my hold. \u201cYou\u2019re just like your father,\u201d he hisses.</p><p>I flinch and let go of him. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am. Nick was a decent man. Nothing like you.\u201d</p><p>He gives a sad laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. He was weak. Easily manipulated. But what I meant is that you\u2019re like Dylan, my brother. He wasn\u2019t so easily fooled, but he was easily feathered. It\u2019s been fun watching you get so riled up. I could do it to my brother with a simple word, and I looked forward to perfecting my technique on you. It\u2019s a shame everything came to an end sooner than I had hoped, but now I can show you what a great uncle I can be. And I\u2019ll start by telling you how well I can take care of my wife.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a cocky grin and although I want to knock it off his face, I\u2019m choking, shuddering at his audacity. I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror behind his bar and rein my temper in. For Ivy, I keep reminding myself. Keep your cool for your girl.</p><p>\u201cBut before we discuss my wife, let me start by telling you a little bit about the man that owned this company\u2014the great Josh Wolf, my father, your grandfather. He was a man who ruled with an iron fist, always logic and numbers, never any emotion. So getting Nick Wilde fired was easy. I knew all I had to do was show poor performance\u2014no matter how much my father liked Nick, he was a businessman through and through and nothing but performance mattered in both his personal and professional life. Oh, wait\u2014there was one tiny exception to that rule\u2014Dylan, my brother, your father. The great Josh Wolf loved that boy in a way he loved no one else\u2014Dylan could do no wrong. Ironic, since he was a user, a drug addict who couldn\u2019t keep clean. I always tried to help my brother. I lived with him, I took care of him, I picked him up off the floor numerous times. And how did he repay me\u2014by dating the woman I worked so hard to get. I deserved your mother . . . he didn\u2019t. Do you know that when he overdosed, my father blamed me? Me!\u201d he screams. \u201cAnd then your mother\u2014she went back to Nick.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t move. I\u2019m caught in the web of the story he\u2019s spinning.</p><p>\u201cMy father never forgave me for Dylan\u2019s death and for years I had to prove to him I was worthy to be a part of his business. I had to make my way up the ladder and even after I landed Zeak Perry as a client, that wasn\u2019t enough. Only when he took ill did I earn my rightful place. And then in his death I learn the bastard didn\u2019t leave me the company\u2014he left me half. I\u2019d been under the impression my inheritance had a marriage clause. I never thought it had you in it. Never saw it coming. He didn\u2019t seem to care about you. The night I told him you existed he didn\u2019t even blink an eye. I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the anniversary of Dylan\u2019s death and he was putting my brother on a pedestal again. I couldn\u2019t take it, so I just blurted out that at least I didn\u2019t have an illegitimate son out there. You see, he knew about you for years and never did anything, never cared\u2014not until he died anyway. How does that make you feel?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t bother to tell him Josh Wolf sought out my mother\u2014that he knew about me and that he did care. He cared enough to do as my mother wished. His knowing the facts wouldn\u2019t change anything. The man in front of me is vile, evil to the core, and I want to rid my life of him as soon as I can. I reach in my pocket and pull out the documents showing my fifty percent ownership.</p><p>\u201cAhhh . . . so you\u2019re not here to meet your dear old uncle. I was wondering when you\u2019d get to the point. How long it would take. But finally!\u201d Damon says, walking to his desk. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re here.\u201d He claps his hands together as if congratulating himself. \u201cYou\u2019re here for your half of the company. What do you think? Should we share desk space? Make decisions together? How do you think my dear old dad saw this going? Did he think we\u2019d make an excellent team?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. He is so cold that I freeze. Falter. Words can\u2019t explain how this man makes me feel. Finally I find my voice. \u201cWhy did you go see my father the day he killed himself?\u201d I ask the question I\u2019ve wanted to know the answer to for so long, unconcerned as to what position that puts me in in his eyes\u2014because I know without a doubt that when this meeting is over I will be the winner.</p><p>A smile slowly spreads across his face. He touches his fingertips to the desk and leans on it. \u201cFor you and your brother. Boy bands were popping up everywhere and I had one in my backyard. I wanted to represent you both, but Nick was adamant that he wasn\u2019t going to let me. I may have mentioned telling you about Dylan and then I gave him twenty-four hours to decide. But we both know how he responded to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not why he killed himself. He wouldn\u2019t have wasted a single breath on you.\u201d I\u2019m seething. I shoot across the office and slam his head down on the desk. I\u2019m shaking so much it\u2019s making me dizzy. I inhale, then exhale and let go.</p><p>He stands up straight and removes his handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his brow. He levels his gaze at me. \u201cHow about we discuss whatever it is you so urgently had to call me away from my father\u2019s funeral for before I call Johnny in to escort you downstairs.\u201d He cocks his head and holds back a smile.</p><p>Shaking in my anger, I fist my hands at my sides. \u201cI\u2019m here for a trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA trade. Really?\u201d</p><p>I hold the paper in the air. \u201cIvy for this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darken as realization dawns on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t play you for the type to put love before business. I have to say I\u2019m surprised. But it\u2019s not going to be that easy. There is so much I want from her before I can let her go.\u201d</p><p>Stepping forward, I stand directly in front of him. Eye to eye. I\u2019m buried in hatred, anger, frustration\u2014wanting so much to wrap my hands around his neck and strangle him. But I have what he wants and I\u2019m pretty sure he wants it more than anything else. I casually walk around his desk and take a seat in one of the two chairs in front of it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re more like me than my brother. Willing to make a deal,\u201d he says with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWe are nothing alike. Nothing!\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleam and he sits in his desk chair, tenting his fingers. \u201cYou start. Tell me what you think you can offer me for that beautiful wife of mine.\u201d</p><p>Vibrating with disgust as the words roll off his tongue, I take a deep breath, knowing I have to keep myself under control. I put my poker face on.</p><p>He squeezes the arms of his expensive leather chair and with a clenched jaw asks, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>I c**k my head and suppress a bitter smile. \u201cTo tell you it\u2019s in your best interest to file annulment papers as soon as your shaky fingers can call your attorney.\u201d</p><p>His bottom lip trembles. \u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d</p><p>No longer able to hold my smile back, I tell him, \u201cBecause for every minute that passes once I leave your office today that you don\u2019t, you might not like the results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games with me, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, see, here\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m not a boy and I\u2019m not playing any kind of game. I\u2019m dead serious. I will sell one share of stock to the public for a dollar for every passing minute you don\u2019t pick up that phone. You figure it out\u2014you\u2019re smart. In about a week, half of Sheep Industries will be worthless. Oh, and when you call your attorney, tell him to terminate your contract with Ivy, effective immediately.\u201d I\u2019m quiet for the next few seconds as he sits there with an incredulous expression on his face. Then I look him straight in the eye and add, \u201cAnd when our business is settled you can do what you want with the company. I\u2019ll stay silent. But hear this: if you ever threaten my family again I\u2019ll make it my life\u2019s mission to ensure you don\u2019t have a company left to run.\u201d Once I\u2019ve said all I came to say, I get up and walk out the door\u2014never looking back, never wanting to see his face again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Dig</p><p>One Month Later</p><p>There are no degrees or certificates hanging on the walls in the hallway of the Amazing Grace recording studio. Rather, only one wall gleams with gold and platinum records from Tyler Records and Amazing Grace, and that makes me smile. I want Ivy\u2019s up there one day. Jack and River have combined the recording aspect of their companies and now Amazing Grace handles production and Tyler Records takes care of distribution. It\u2019s clean and easy and gives Jack a little more free time.</p> <p>I owed Jack a huge apology for the way I acted the night I found out about Dylan. Jack, in his typical fashion, blew it off as a small blip on the radar and graciously accepted my apology. I took that opportunity to talk to him about the guys, and he said that with the merger of the two companies there were a number of positions that needed to be filled. I wasn\u2019t sure how they\u2019d react or if they\u2019d want to work there\u2014but they did. Garrett and Nix both decided to join River. It\u2019s been great to see the childhood friends who almost launched a band to stardom now helping other bands achieve their dream\u2014pretty awesome if you think about it.</p><p>Finishing a call, I tuck my phone in my pocket. I know I have a huge grin on my face as I enter the control room. Ivy\u2019s eyes are closed at the microphone and everyone is silent. Leif is on the keyboard accompanying her. He is staying on with her. I\u2019m not sure he will forever, but he seems happy\u2014for now. Pressing the intercom, I say, \u201cMove your music forward, Ivy. Don\u2019t overthink it.\u201d She peeks over at me and smiles that genuine smile that I love, and I add, \u201cSo we can get out of here.\u201d The ease with which we have fallen into sync with each other isn\u2019t hard to believe. We get each other and we get along\u2014we did before and we do now. It\u2019s just that easy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, no chance of that.\u201d I wink at her.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a tight red blouse that buttons up the middle. It makes her tits look all the more perfect. She\u2019s also wearing a pair of jeans that when she turns around to cue the band, make her ass look amazing. Shifting on my feet, I think, Fuck, when am I going to get this under control?</p> <p>She and Leif start playing, and concentrates on laying the tracks. He hasn\u2019t made a single sketchy comment to me since that first day in the studio and our ability to work together has been spot-on. This is the first album completely under Ivy\u2019s control and it\u2019s coming together faster than I ever expected. For the past month we\u2019ve lived and breathed the studio day in and day out. Ivy already had the songs written. Dahlia\u2019s designing the cover art and Aerie is working on promoting the album. With any luck it will be ready to launch in six weeks.</p><p>Ivy has moved into my grandparents\u2019 place with me, but I want us to have a place that we can call our own. We\u2019ve started looking at houses in my mother\u2019s and River\u2019s neighborhoods and she found one she loves. It\u2019s a restored Mediterranean with a spectacular view of the city. It was built in 1926 for a silent film legend. Ivy thinks it\u2019s a work of art. I was about to buy it when fate stepped in and the people who swooped in and bought it out from under us told me about the house they were selling. I bought it immediately without telling Ivy because I know she\u2019s going to love it. It will be weird moving out of the last place my grandparents lived, but I know they\u2019re smiling over my decision about where to move\u2014a house not only for kids but for grandkids too.</p><p>Having Ivy near me, waking up next to her, I\u2019ve never been happier in my life. I didn\u2019t know someone could be this happy. I\u2019m even thinking about my own family now, something I haven\u2019t done in a long time. And my dreams, or my nightmares\u2014I haven\u2019t had a single one since going to the cemetery and visiting my father\u2019s grave. I\u2019ve accepted him for who he was\u2014both his strengths and his weaknesses. I may never understand why he chose to take his own life, but I no longer hate him for it\u2014in the end he did choose us, his family, over music.</p><p>I\u2019m in a hurry to wrap up the day, so I call it much earlier than usual. Everyone else leaves and Ivy and I are the last ones at the studio. She packs her guitar in its case and props it against the wall, then meets me outside. Her eyes glitter. \u201cWhy are you in such a rush?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I pull her out into the alleyway by one hand. The air is cool and there\u2019s a light breeze that blows her hair across her face. I push it aside. \u201cI have something to tell you. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, full of excitement.</p> <p>Lifting her high in the air, I turn her around in slow circles.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She squirms, pressing herself against my waist and finally I look forward to exploring the incredible attraction that\u2019s been building between us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s final,\u201d I whisper, my voice hoarse as I trail my tongue down her neck. She quickly wraps her legs around me and I know she can feel how excited I am.</p><p>With wide eyes she asks, \u201cThe annulment?\u201d</p><p>I nod with a huge-ass smile on my face.</p><p>In a low, soft voice she cries, \u201cI\u2019m so happy right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, baby. Me too.\u201d</p><p>Damon had moved quickly to get the annulment. I was in constant contact with the attorneys. I didn\u2019t want Ivy stressing over any of it. Damon used his connections to get it fast-tracked, and I kept my word\u2014I didn\u2019t sell a single share and I gave all exercising rights to him. I\u2019ll stay part of the company, but as a silent partner. It was a quick and easy transaction and I never want to see his face again.</p> <p>My red Corvette is only a few feet away, but I can\u2019t resist stopping and pushing her up against the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this so f**king much.\u201d My lips find hers and after nearly a month, I can actually kiss her the way I want to. She\u2019s finally free and she\u2019s all mine. I gently bite down on her lower lip before sucking on it. She lets out a soft moan and I seal my mouth to hers. She presses her lips against mine with equal force. Her hands tangle in my hair and I hold her like I\u2019ve never held her\u2014in a way that tells her I\u2019m never going to let her go. She bites on my tongue and then flutters hers against the tip of mine . . . driving me insane.</p><p>I pull back. \u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she purrs. \u201cIt\u2019s too far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ivy, don\u2019t do that,\u201d I tell her as she takes my hands and presses them against her br**sts. She kisses my chin, my neck, and slides her tongue over to my ear. I slip my hands up the front of her shirt, which has come untucked, and feel her soft skin. It electrifies me. It\u2019s been a month with no actual physical contact. We\u2019ve imagined each other\u2019s hands on our bodies, told each other what we want to do to each other, talked each other through our deepest desires, but now we no longer have to use our own hands and bodies to make love to each other. Running my mouth down her neck, I undo each button with my teeth. When I get to the last one I pull her shirt open and quickly lift her bra. The cool air makes her ni**les harden and when I close my mouth around one, fondling the other between my fingers, she moans loudly.</p><p>I look around and pull her shirt together. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d she questions softly.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to f**k you now\u2014and not in the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She giggles and follows me as I stride quickly back to the recording studio, fumbling for my keys.</p><p>We stumble up the three steps and our lips break apart only so I can unlock the heavy metal door. Once we are on the other side of it, I slam her against the door and run my hands all over her body. I\u2019m hungry for her, starving. I walk us backward toward the studio. \u201cTake your bra off,\u201d I growl, knowing that unhooking it and trying to navigate backward to the studio at the same time would be nearly impossible with how turned on I am. My hands find her back, her ass, and finally her freed br**sts. My mouth doesn\u2019t leave hers even though I want to suck on each nipple and hear her moan. I can\u2019t tear my lips from hers. I feel every touch we made to ourselves over the last month penetrating our kisses. My body\u2019s singing\u2014and it\u2019s alive. I can\u2019t wait for the feel of her smooth skin as her fingers wrap around my cock.</p><p>The backs of my knees hit the sofa in the recording studio and I fall to it. She lands on top of me. I finally break the connection our lips were fervent to hold. Pulling back, I stare at her gorgeous n*ked tits. I run my hands up and down her chest, holding each breast, squeezing it, pinching the nipple between my fingers. Bending toward her, I nuzzle one before licking and pulling it in, sucking on it. She arches her back and my hands move to the front of her jeans. My pulse is racing. She tries to pull my shirt over my head, but I want her so badly, I can\u2019t tear my hands from her. Finally I manage, \u201cStand up and take your pants off,\u201d and then I pull my own shirt over my head.</p><p>She rises and easily slides her jeans down her legs. My hands find the lace of her panties, ripping them off before she even lifts her feet to kick off her shoes. I pull her closer to me. She stands before me completely stunning and again I can\u2019t help but think, She\u2019s all mine. My mouth goes slack as I see her hooded eyes staring down at me. I slip one finger inside her, then another, and then just one more. Stretching her, f**king her with my fingers. Her body starts to shake and as she cries out in pleasure, I remove my fingers and replace them with my mouth. Her hands grip my shoulders tightly.</p><p>\u201cXander!\u201d she screams when I find her cl*t with first my lips, then my tongue. I pull her closer to me. I don\u2019t just want to eat her . . . I want to devour her. Her body trembles and she calls out my name louder and louder with each passing second. She tries to pull away, but I hold her tight. \u201cJust feel it baby. Just feel it,\u201d I manage, stopping to blow on the small nub that I plan to devour again in an instant.</p><p>Her grip tightens and she cries out, \u201cI love you!\u201d Those words have my c**k throbbing to be inside her. I pull away and stand up. She\u2019s wobbly and holds on to me. I tear out of my boots and jeans and stand fully ready in front of her. Her fingers wrap around my hard c**k and the feeling is so unlike my own hand that I feel myself start to tremble.</p><p>I take a few minutes to admire her. Her smooth, tan skin, her seductive, stormy eyes, the cute sprinkling of freckles across her nose, her lush lips, and those br**sts\u2014all Ivy, all things I will never get enough of.</p><p>\u201cDid you like that, baby?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d she moans as I take my c**k and rub it against her entrance.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d I ask, running my tongue around the shell of her ear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cries out as I place my knee between her legs and gently fold her onto the sofa.</p><p>I hover over her and she pulls my face to hers. She gently traces my mouth with her soft lips and I nip at her finger. She giggles only for a moment before taking my c**k in her hand and guiding it to her. She rubs my tip over her cl*t and I feel like I\u2019m going to explode if I don\u2019t get inside her this very minute, but the look on her face is so full of lust, I grip the back of the sofa and just fall into her. She takes her other hand and grabs me, cupping and tugging alternately while she continues to rub the tip of my c**k over her wet pu**y.</p><p>\u201cThat is so f**king hot,\u201d I tell her, but when her fingers trail up my shaft, I can\u2019t take it anymore and I thrust into her. Both of us yell out in ecstasy and I don\u2019t wait another minute before pounding into her over and over. Thrust for thrust, she meets each and every one. My c**k pulses and I pump my h*ps into her. I grip her shoulders, holding on, trying to go deeper, wanting to be as far into her as I can. Everything about her is so sweet. The feeling of being buried deep inside her is one I never want to lose. A groan stutters out of me as I try to hold on for her, but I can\u2019t. Letting go, I stop kissing her and look at her angelic face.</p><p>She moans, \u201cOh God,\u201d and I can tell an orgasm is rocketing through her, just as powerful as the one owning me right now. All I want to do is hold on to her for dear life because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to die from the unbelievable pleasure I\u2019m basking in. We both come in unison. Fuck, it feels so good\u2014I can\u2019t hear, my vision\u2019s a little hazy, and there\u2019s a gentle ache radiating from all parts of my cock\u2014all reminders of the intensity we just shared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a few minutes, when I\u2019m able to move, I pull her to my chest. She smiles against my neck and rests her head on my shoulder. I murmur in her hair, \u201cThat felt so good.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her head and her beautiful eyes dance in the light. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cMe too. Ready to go home to our bed?\u201d</p><p>Her smile fades and I lift her chin and see a tear dripping down her cheek. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Just the way you said home\u2014it couldn\u2019t be more right.\u201d Her smile reappears and she says, \u201cXander, please take me home now.\u201d</p><p>God, again I have to swallow a surge of emotion from the sight of the tear on her cheek and hearing those words. I kiss her tear away and say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want more.\u201d</p><p>We head for my car again and this time, for some reason, that stupid poem from so long ago pops in my head, but this time I know the words\u2014\u201cIf you love someone, set them free. If they come back, they\u2019re yours.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>You</p> <p>Ivy, Three Months Later</p><p>The day has arrived. All the hard work and energy and it\u2019s finally ready to share. And it\u2019s all because of him. He shifts to his feet before me and the mere sight of him makes my eyelashes flutter, my throat burn, and my heart pound. He hasn\u2019t shaved and his hair falls forward as he moves, making him look impossibly sexy. The hint of stubble I\u2019m staring at has just rubbed against the sensitive skin of my face, my stomach, and everywhere else, but the yearning I feel for him is raging\u2014I still want more.</p><p>He pulls up his pants and zips them, standing before me bare-chested\u2014he looks hotter than sin. He catches my stare and before he buttons them he says, \u201cI\u2019ve just got a few things to pick up while you get ready. I\u2019ll shower when I get back. Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>I lick my lips at the sight of the way his pants hang low on his hips, and I take in the perfection of his chest, the muscles in his arms, the line of his collarbone up to his neck. The jaw I\u2019m desperate to kiss, to taste. I can almost feel my hands sliding inside those jeans and I suck in a deep breath as I imagine the feel of his warm, thick cock\u2014the one I just felt. My heart skips a beat at the thought and when I look at him to answer, I\u2019m not smiling. I don\u2019t want him to leave and I can do something about it. A low purr escapes my throat and his mouth quirks up at the corners in response.</p><p>I rip the T-shirt off that I just slipped on and sashay across the room. I feel like a lion after her prey. His eyes search mine, and the tone of that hissing noise he makes that just sounds like sex as he watches me makes my pu**y clench. I approach him without an ounce of hesitation. \u201cStay. Take a shower with me. And I promise I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d I feel a slow blush creep up my throat but ignore it and concentrate instead on tracing each letter of his tattoo. The one he had inked on his skin to keep me close to him. His body reacts to my tender touch and I grin. When I finish, I skim my fingers up his body and then bury my hands in his hair. His fingers grip my hips, but he stands still. I kiss his jaw, then his mouth. My tongue seeks what my body just had and we lose each other in our kiss.</p><p>Minutes later he cups my face and says, \u201cIvy, I have things to do before we leave. What are you doing?\u201d He drops his head back as I do what I imagined doing just a few seconds ago. I push my hands into the front of his pants and feel the pulsing and throbbing of his already thick penis.</p> <p>\u201cI want you to f**k me again. I want to suck on your cock. Please.\u201d My animalistic approach, the fierceness I felt before his body was touching mine, is ruined by the shakiness of my voice and my use of the word please. But he doesn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ivy,\u201d he growls. Then he unzips his jeans and in one quick motion shoves them down, freeing his erection. Knowing he has just come inside me not more than fifteen minutes ago and he is already this turned on makes my cl*t throb. He shakes his head and just grins at me, then leads me to the bathroom. Without a word he turns the shower on and pulls me in.</p><p>The warm water hits us both and I push up against him, licking a few drops off his chest as they make their way down to the same place my hands are headed.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to wash you?\u201d he asks, burying his face into my neck so I can feel his stubble.</p><p>I nod. He pours the body wash into his palm and I let my arms fall to my sides as his fingers work lather all over me. His hands move lower and I melt against the cold tile of the shower wall when his fingertips graze my clit. His hands circle and I push my h*ps forward, moaning in delight.</p><p>\u201cYou want my fingers in your pu**y?\u201d he asks, tracing his tongue around his lips, the lips I want on my body. He uses it to draw a line down my throat to my br**sts, where he licks away the drops of water that fall on them.</p><p>I nod my head again and the water pelts down against my skin.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Ivy. Use words. I can\u2019t see your response,\u201d he says as his mouth sucks on my nipple.</p> <p>I drop my head back and my hair, having grown longer, touches the space between my shoulder blades. \u201cYes. I always want your mouth on my pu**y, your tongue over my clit,\u201d I tell him and gasp when his lips descend farther down my body.</p><p>He stops and I peek down at him with a look of urgency. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNothing.\u201d I\u2019m panting now.</p><p>He climbs up my body and his hard muscles touch my skin, sending shivers down my spine.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He says the word with such tenderness I feel silly mentioning it.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he says more forcefully and pushes the wet hair from my face.</p><p>I close my eyes and just say it. \u201cI want you in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, and it\u2019s not a laugh that upsets me at all . . . it\u2019s a laugh that makes me laugh too, but our laughter is laced with desire. Our breathing picks up before we stop and I can see the rapid rise and fall of his chest. His fingers twist in my hair and he leans down to kiss me. As he kisses my neck, the water splashes between us like rain. His lips find mine as his fingers release my hair and clutch my head. He turns us around so his back is against the sleek tile, and I smile. Making my way down his lean body, I take my time. I trace the lines of each muscle with my tongue. My mouth eases onto his length and my hand grips his base. He moans at first contact and it\u2019s the sexiest sound I\u2019ve ever heard. He pushes his h*ps up and I take him all in. I love this side of him\u2014the way he lets go and just feels the pleasure. As I glide my tongue up his length and over his head, my hold loosens as my lips slide farther down. I repeat this movement over and over at a steady pace, but when he makes that same noise again, I move faster and suck harder. Xander takes a long, slow breath and then pulls me up to him.</p><p>He turns us back around . . . he\u2019s taking control again and I love it. The shower door has turned steamy and the water mists all around us. His hands slide up my shoulders and then down my arms until he reaches my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous,\u201d he says breathlessly into my ear. Water slices down his chest and when he presses his hard c**k against me, excitement runs through my body. He lets go of my hands and positions himself at my center. Looking at him, the water on his skin, the way just a few wisps of his dark hair curl onto his forehead, I can\u2019t wait another minute to have him. I lean in and my ni**les brush against his chest as I thrust my tongue into his mouth, kissing him hard for a long time. Sliding my lips to his ear, I whisper, \u201cI want you,\u201d and then I kiss his mouth, his jaw, his shoulder. \u201cSo much.\u201d I see him quiver. I love how affected he is by my touch. He finally strokes his finger inside me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you now,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I close my eyes and the water sprays against my face. Resting my forehead on his shoulder as he strokes inside me, I lose all thoughts. \u201cDon\u2019t come yet,\u201d he whispers and I open my eyes. He quickly presses me back against the tile and pushes my feet apart. He kisses my neck, sucks on my nipple, and I have to clutch his muscular back to hold on. \u201cDon\u2019t come,\u201d he growls again. \u201cI want to be inside you when you come.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps cover my body as I try to hold on\u2014the water, him, it\u2019s all too much. I\u2019m still wrapped up in the pleasure of him when he slides into me without warning. I suck in a breath and enjoy his hard c**k as he thrusts into me. He moves at a slow pace, much slower than earlier today.</p><p>Standing on my tiptoes, I run my fingers through his hair. Then I clutch the muscles of his arms with my hands, pushing myself farther back against the cool marble wall of the shower so he can press farther into me. When I lift my chin I notice the look on his face. That combined with the water dripping in small, even streams from his head to his cheek to his shoulder to where my hands are grasping, squeezing, as he moves in and out, is the most erotic thing I\u2019ve ever seen. When I drop from my toes, his c**k goes even deeper inside me. I moan in pleasure at the feeling and he seems to lose complete control\u2014his hooded eyes and the look on his face is one of pure pleasure.</p><p>I scream, \u201cOh God, Xander,\u201d as my back bows and my inside muscles tighten around him.</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d he pants, his hot breath caressing my ear.</p><p>I do it again and another peak rolls through me before the first one\u2019s even ended. Then I do it again, and this time the overwhelming sensation takes us both, making me feel like the two of us have become one.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ivy,\u201d he mutters. Resting his head against mine, he manages, \u201cPut your arms around my neck.\u201d</p><p>When I do he buries himself in me and the pleasure is pure, raw, full of energy. His mouth slams to mine as we experience something that is beyond anything I\u2019ve ever felt and I hope beyond anything he has ever felt as well. My heart stills, my breathing stops, and I let this feeling consume me. Let him own me with everything I have and everything he has. His body goes limp against my already boneless one and together we stand under the shower trying to recover from something I want to feel over and over.</p><p>I cling to him for support and he buries his head in my neck. After a while he lifts my chin. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like that,\u201d he tells me, his mouth lifting slightly as his hooded gaze tells me how much he loves me.</p><p>\u201cNeither have I,\u201d I manage, relishing the feeling of his stubbled jaw against my skin.</p><p>He grins and then runs his fingers through my hair as his lips dance over mine.</p><p>I trace the rim of his collarbone, then wrap my arms around him as the water cascades over us. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>He sighs contentedly and then whispers against my lips, \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you,\u201d and his words echo with happiness through me because I know he has.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>An hour later it\u2019s almost time to leave. Soft music plays from the bedroom and when I glance up from the vanity, my heart beats that familiar thumping. Xander\u2019s standing there with one shoulder propped against the wall, just watching me. He can say so much with just a look\u2014the quirk of his mouth and the rise of his brow make my body flush all over.</p><p>\u201cWill you zip my dress?\u201d I ask him, trying not to drool at how incredibly hot he looks in his suit, with no tie, of course. Just like roses, he thinks wearing a tie with a suit is too expected. I turn around as he enters. Damp towels are on the floor from our shower, my makeup is scattered across the vanity, and my dress hangs on the hook behind the door.</p><p>Xander loves the dark blue sapphire satin because he says it matches my eyes. It\u2019s short, sleeveless, and just about backless. First, letting his fingertips skim across my skin, he ties the cord that spans my back and holds the dress in place, and I shiver. He moves to the zipper at my side and with his finger he trails a line from my hip to under my arm. He takes his time zipping it and when he\u2019s done he smooths the zipper with his palm and I can barely keep myself upright.</p><p>He\u2019s quiet. Not saying a word. I turn around to face him and he\u2019s pressing his fist into his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said you loved it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ivy, it\u2019s sexy as hell,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I smile and blush at the same time.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a little too much skin showing in the back?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>This actually makes me laugh. I used to think he didn\u2019t want me to show off my body because he didn\u2019t like other guys to see it. But now I think I was wrong\u2014it\u2019s because him seeing so much skin drives him wild, and I love that! I step close to him. \u201cI think it\u2019s the perfect amount of skin,\u201d I whisper hotly against his lips.</p><p>He catches my mouth and kisses me. \u201cYeah, for roving hands who want to feel you in places where they shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he breathes, sliding a hand into the side of my dress and squeezing my breast.</p><p>Smiling, I say, \u201cTrust me, you\u2019re the only one thinking that way.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and throw him a wink, but before I can move away his hands are on my h*ps and when I rock back against him, I can feel the heat and hardness of his c**k beneath the layers of fabric. He mumbles something against my skin that sounds like, \u201cFuck, you\u2019d think I was fourteen again,\u201d but I don\u2019t ask why because the softness of his mouth in my ear and the feel of his breath against my cheek is all I care about. He turns me around and anchors his h*ps to mine. He slips his arms around my waist and I place mine around his neck. His feet start to move in a slow circle\u2014he\u2019s dancing with me in the bathroom. I strain to hear the lyrics to the song playing as his fingers trace the exposed bumps of my spine. He draws me closer and I can smell his cologne\u2014a mix of the sea, the sun, the earth, and a Mediterranean breeze. I breathe him in and become intoxicated by his scent.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good,\u201d I murmur in his ear.</p> <p>\u201cYou like it? I wore it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmmm . . .\u201d</p><p>My head fits perfectly on his shoulder and I find all the comfort I need for the night ahead right here in him. His hands slide up the center of my back\u2014the skin against skin contact makes me forget any apprehension I\u2019m feeling. He suddenly dips me and pulls me back to him. \u201cWe have to go,\u201d he murmurs. But instead of letting me go, he kisses me again.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d I breathe around his lips. I can feel his sexy smile against my mouth, but I somehow manage to break free and make my way back over to the vanity on shaky legs. I pick up my earrings\u2014the sapphires that dangle with stars at the bottom. He grins at me as I put them in both ears. We stare at each other and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re both remembering the woman who gave me her earrings because she just knew I was going to be a star.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I\u2019m still tingling when we get in the car. He hits the gas and takes off, but instead of taking a right to head toward the studio he takes a left. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I have one stop I have to make before the party.\u201d</p><p>About thirty seconds elapse and he pulls over. \u201cOh, I forgot one thing.\u201d He grins as he pulls out the piece of fabric from Garrett\u2019s yoga swing that he used as a blindfold when he took me to Niagara Falls. \u201cYou have to wear this.\u201d</p><p>I look at him in surprise. \u201cWhy? I can\u2019t see where you have to stop along the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust turn around,\u201d he tells me with a smirk, and I do. He ties the fabric around my head and kisses my hair.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how much time passes before he parks the car and turns the ignition off. I rest my hand on the door handle and he says, \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><p>He quickly opens my door and guides me out. I have no idea where we\u2019re going. Soon I hear the click of a lock and we seem to be inside somewhere, but then I hear another click and we\u2019re back outside. When I hear another lock open, I ask, \u201cXander, where are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home, baby,\u201d he says, and his deep, husky voice resonates against my skin. He quickly removes my blindfold and opens the ornate etched-glass door in front of us. I stand in shock as my eyes roam the very familiar room. The built-in window seat, ceiling fan, light blue walls, and bamboo wooden floor are still the same. It looks just like it did the very last time I set foot in it, twelve years ago, except that the countertops seem to have been upgraded to granite and track lighting now glows from the ceiling. But even with the minor changes there\u2019s no mistaking this place he just called home.</p><p>\u201cHome!\u201d I cry, turning around to throw my arms around him. \u201cYou bought your grandparents\u2019 old house? But how?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>His eyes meet mine and he doesn\u2019t answer. Instead he drops to one knee, and I swear the butterflies actually flutter out of my stomach. My heart pounds and I\u2019m a little nervous\u2014no, a lot nervous. Xander\u2019s eyes take in every inch of me, but my full attention stays locked on his tranquil hazel eyes. His gaze skims over my dress to the sapphires that never leave my ears, and then it settles on my eyes. In that moment I have no doubts about this man, my life, our life. He pulls a velvet box from his pocket and holds it out. My pulse races as he slowly lifts the lid. What I see in the velvet cushion brings tears to my eyes. The ring flashing so brilliantly there is the ring that his father gave his mother. He\u2019s offering it to me\u2014he wants me to be his wife. It\u2019s simple and perfect and I always thought it was the most absolutely beautiful ring I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Ivy Taylor?\u201d he asks with the slow and easy smile that makes my heart melt every time.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I cry without a second thought, and drop to my knees next to him before he can even take the ring out of the box. I cradle his face in the palms of my hands and tears stream down my cheeks. \u201cYes, I will marry you,\u201d I whisper. Then I kiss him. I kiss my prince charming with a long kiss that is full of meaning. I don\u2019t want to ever stop kissing him. When I lean back to catch my breath I ask, \u201cYou bought your grandparents\u2019 old house for us? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck, fate, destiny.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say. \u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d</p><p>His smile is as wide as mine, I\u2019m sure. He nibbles my lip one more time and pulls me to my knees. We kneel together and hold each other and before we stand up he says, \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>I extend my left hand and as he slides the large pear-shaped diamond on my finger, my other hand flies to my mouth. It\u2019s perfect. The brilliance of the diamond is just so stunning, I\u2019m completely surprised and so overwhelmed. My tears are still flowing and he softly says, \u201cStop crying. You\u2019re not supposed to be crying.\u201d His eyes are gleaming and he kisses my fingers so gently I feel like I\u2019m floating on a cloud. I just want to hold him, smell him, feel him\u2014forever.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We walk into the building where the unveiling of my new album, My Mended Heart, is taking place. Both of us are literally beaming. We\u2019ve decided not to mention our engagement until the end of the evening, so I turn my ring backward for now. We\u2019re a little late, but not much, and surprisingly Xander hasn\u2019t looked at his watch or even mentioned it. His hand is on the small of my back as we enter the gala, and before we greet everyone I turn to him and mouth I love you. This is the album I always wanted to put out but never had the courage to\u2014until he came back into my life. I allow myself to just stare at him\u2014he\u2019s the most handsome man I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>I breathe in the scent of the flowers that fill the room and then shift my gaze to admire the glimmer of light from the crystal chandeliers. The room looks as magical as the night already has been. Amazing Grace has been transformed from a concrete hangar into a glittering nightclub. With six crystal chandeliers, dozens of round tables, and more than a hundred vases of purple dahlias and, of course, a splash of ivy, compliments of Xander, this get-together feels more like a welcoming party than a release party.</p><p>Bell planned the whole event. I would have thought she\u2019d have been here for hours, but she actually walked in right before we did. Jack and Charlotte dropped her off and she got out of their car with a large bag hanging from her shoulder. We tried to catch up with her, but she was off fluttering around and making sounds that seemed incomprehensible. Xander had just shrugged his shoulders. But his cool facade seems to have evaporated now.</p><p>As we make our way farther into the room, his brow creases and I can tell he\u2019s nervous. I bite the inside of my cheek, wondering if I should feel more nervous than I do. I decide to try to calm him instead of joining him in the nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s the calm before the chaos,\u201d I tell him, as he stands next to me gripping my hand tightly. Squeezing his fingers, I look around at all the people who are here for me and realize I may have misspoken about the calm. The mood in the room is anything but sedate. It\u2019s full of such real positive energy that no forced smiles are necessary.</p><p>My stomach flutters when he kisses my forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be great. Don\u2019t let my sorry-ass nerves get to you.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping my arms around his neck, I pull him to me. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then I seal my mouth to his and kiss him in a way that lets him know that with him by my side I know I\u2019ll be fine. Pulling away, we smile at each other. We have both been lavishing these smiles on each other. Smiles that make the world seem all the more perfect. And it is. His thumb traces my lips.</p><p>Over Xander\u2019s shoulder, I catch sight of his brother. A minute later a chin rests on his shoulder and arms wrap around his waist. He too smiles. It\u2019s contagious. I motion toward the door. \u201cThere\u2019s River and Dahlia. Let\u2019s go say hi.\u201d</p><p>Dahlia looks amazing. She\u2019s wearing a pewter-colored halter dress with a chain neck and a large brooch at the center of the deep V. River looks pretty good himself in a suit much like Xander\u2019s, and he as well has opted for no tie. He and Dahlia are fashionably late as always, but since today is their one-year anniversary I think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable. Their tardiness seems to always drive Xander crazy, and River seems to get a kick out of it every time. Over the past few weeks, Xander has ended up laughing along with us. I actually find his reaction pretty funny myself because for someone so much in control all the time, he seems to be letting some of his barriers down.</p><p>Xander and Dahlia have a bond that warms my heart. It seems that when Xander first met Dahlia he acted like a real ass. I\u2019m glad to see that they\u2019ve moved past their issues, especially since the day he met her was the day I announced my engagement to Damon. He told me he was pretty drunk by the time they were introduced.</p><p>\u201cXander. Ivy,\u201d River says in such a drawn-out way that it clues me in that he knows something. Dahlia kisses River\u2019s cheek before circling to stand next to him. River searches Xander, and if I hadn\u2019t been looking, I would never have noticed the slight nod Xander gives him. River grabs Xander around the neck and pulls him forward, and with a not so subtle snicker, he says, \u201cA phone call would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>Xander\u2019s eyes grow bright with laughter. \u201cRight, bro. Sorry. I\u2019ll remember next time.\u201d</p><p>River lets him go. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Xander slants him a look. \u201cIf that\u2019s not a spade calling a spade.\u201d</p><p>Before River can counter Dahlia swoops in. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she cries, kissing me and then Xander in turn as she wraps an arm around each of us, pulling us together for a group hug.</p><p>River ducks under Dahlia\u2019s arm and pops up in the middle. He kisses her on the lips. \u201cDon\u2019t forget me.\u201d</p><p>Dahlia releases us just as Garrett comes over. \u201cAwww . . . I missed out on the hugs and kisses. What, because we all work together now, I get shafted?\u201d</p><p>Laughing at him, I have to say he is the funniest person I know. He seems to love his new job, and I think he may have even gone on a date or two with Ena. He nods hello to each of us and then in true guy fashion grabs River by the collar and jerks him backward. \u201cYou\u2019re late, dick. Come on,\u201d he quips. Then he starts to shake his h*ps and sing, \u201cLA, let\u2019s get this party started!\u201d He sounds so much like B. Taylor, I actually want to hear him sing the whole song. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dahlia and I giggle as Xander shakes his head and we all watch as River gets dragged away and pulled onstage for a jam session with the guys. They\u2019re all up there\u2014River, Leif, Nix, Garrett, and even Zane. The crowd rushes the dance floor and throws hands in the air, dancing to a cover of \u201cHands All Over.\u201d I have to laugh because I know how much Dahlia loves Maroon 5. I also know how much River dislikes them. But he must have planned this for her, for their anniversary.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she says, and moves toward the stage. Mesmerized, she watches them, her hands clasped near her heart. She grins ear to ear as River sings to her\u2014the performance seems to make her very happy.</p><p>Bell finds me in the midst of all the excitement. She too looks beautiful. She\u2019s so petite, but her vibrant emerald eyes and long coppery brown hair make her look like a spitfire. She\u2019s wearing a green strapless romper with metallic flowers on it, and wisps of thin gold chains adorn her neck\u2014she\u2019s stunning and it looks like she\u2019s also a little sunburned. The red contrast against the silky dark fabric makes her rosy all over. Dragging me over to the photo booth she rented, she has me posing in it for at least twenty different pictures. Then she runs off to use them to decorate the tables so everyone knows who I am\u2014I can only laugh at that.</p><p>I spot Xander across the room and wave him over to drag him in with me. I try to get him to make playful faces and whenever I whisper something dirty in his ear, he does. These pictures are for me, not for the tables. When we step out of the booth, I\u2019m a little flushed myself.</p> <p>Sashaying up to us, Aerie greets us in an extremely bubbly manner despite looking very businesslike\u2014her hair is in a bun and she\u2019s wearing a purple pantsuit with pumps, but surprisingly it\u2019s low-cut and shows a hint of cle**age. We\u2019ve spent a great deal of time together since I came back to LA. We get along so well. She\u2019s even shown me some of her uncle\u2019s music collection. She hugs me and cascades kisses on each cheek, then does the same to Xander, who looks utterly shocked at her exuberant display of affection.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jagger?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>She gestures toward the makeshift bar with her wineglass. \u201cOh, Jack caught him on our way in and they\u2019re huddled somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Xander\u2019s gaze follows mine across the room. They\u2019re leaning against the bar with their heads together, each holding a glass of beer. Xander crosses his arms and lifts his brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Aerie giggles. \u201cJack wants Jagger to help him move No Led Zeppelin\u2019s sound track release date up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it hasn\u2019t finished filming yet, has it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cNo, but Jack\u2019s pushing for an early sound track release around Christmas and then a rerelease when No Led Zeppelin hits theaters.\u201d</p><p>Xander nods. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a brilliant idea, but Jagger is still working on perfecting most of the songs,\u201d Aerie says.</p><p>\u201cGet River to help him,\u201d Xander suggests.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been coconspiring, but I think they might be spending more time playing around than actually focusing,\u201d Aerie replies, rolling her eyes.</p> <p>Xander chuckles. \u201cSounds like I\u2019ll need to pay them a visit.\u201d</p><p>Now I roll my eyes.</p><p>Aerie snatches the sleeve of photos I have in my hand. \u201cNice,\u201d she says with a smirk. \u201cI like the one of Xander licking your neck.\u201d</p><p>He snags the photo strips from her and she laughs.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you think I can talk to you a minute?\u201d Aerie asks Xander.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I think you should know before it\u2019s announced,\u201d she adds, slipping back into business mode. Then she looks at me and says, \u201cAnd you and I will catch up later. And don\u2019t forget lunch tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>I nod my head. She\u2019s such a type A personality. \u201cI\u2019m going to get another drink. I\u2019ll leave you two to talk.\u201d</p> <p>As I walk away, I feel a pair of hands grip my waist. \u201cYou forgot something,\u201d Xander\u2019s deep voice says into my ear.</p><p>I turn my head and feel the tickle of his whiskers against my skin. \u201cWhat?\u201d I purr.</p><p>He gently pulls my mouth to his, and a soft brush of our lips has me tingling all the way to my toes. He runs his cheek down my neck and groans wickedly in my ear before releasing me. And for some reason, this tiny display of affection seems so much more intimate than just a simple goodbye kiss\u2014it has me flushing.</p><p>I can feel myself smoldering as he turns back toward Aerie. I stand there and watch him as the two of them engage in conversation. When I snort to myself and break out of my lovesick trance, I continue my journey toward the bar just as Phoebe turns the corner in a knockout champagne-colored gown. She sees me instantly and waves, motioning me over. I look her up and down. She\u2019s dressed so elegantly, she even takes my breath away.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d I say.</p><p>She\u2019s grinning from ear to ear. \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d she asks, practically jumping out of her heels.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNix and I got married today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I scream. I can\u2019t believe they got married on the same day I got engaged. I\u2019m so happy for her and Nix. It\u2019s all so exciting and I want to share my news, but Xander and I agreed to let this night be about the album.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, I know. We haven\u2019t known each other that long, but it seemed like the right time. Nix loves his new job and I love my new teaching position. We decided what better way to start our new lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Phoebe! I\u2019m so happy for you. And love doesn\u2019t have a meter, so don\u2019t worry about how long you\u2019ve known each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ivy.\u201d She\u2019s beaming.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s find some champagne to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>The night has just begun and I already feel like a princess\u2014but not the molded pop princess that catapulted my career. This time I\u2019m my own person, doing what I\u2019ve always wanted to do\u2014singing about life as I know it and putting my own soulful twist on it.</p><p>With Xander at my side, I finally went to see my mother last week. Before that I hadn\u2019t actually seen her in years. I\u2019ve supported her and my sisters but had no contact with them. I\u2019m not sure where my relationship with her will go. She told Damon about Xander and me and God knows what else\u2014I don\u2019t trust her, but she is my mother. In the end we worked out an arrangement giving her some time to work out her finances, but I told her I can no longer be her primary source of income. I\u2019ll continue to support my sisters, but that\u2019s it. Surprisingly, she agreed.</p><p>Charlotte is talking to Dahlia and I start to make my way over to them. Dahlia and I have spent a lot of time together. We talked about her miscarriage and she told me she and River are taking it one day at a time. The pregnancy was unplanned, and right now they want to enjoy each other and not stress about getting pregnant again. I was so happy to hear that, because so many couples go down that road. They are so happy together, and I know they will face what comes their way together with love\u2014it\u2019s so obvious how they feel about each other.</p><p>We could not have had any more fun putting my album together. Xander, River, and Dahlia all worked together. Xander took charge and managed every detail. River took care of coordinating with producers he thought would best enhance each song. And Dahlia designed my cover, using photographs she took of me\u2014it really is a work of art. When we weren\u2019t all working together in the studio, we were hanging out\u2014going out to eat and even running trails together. Dahlia and I have a common bond\u2014she doesn\u2019t have any family, and in a way neither do I. We seem to be drawn to each other because of it.</p><p>\u201cIvy\u2014there you are.\u201d Bell appears, interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spent as much time with her as I have with River and Dahlia, but I\u2019ve known her since she was ten, so I feel a connection to her as well. Tonight she seems nervous, much like Xander, and I have to bite the inside of my cheek to stop from laughing at the similarities between the two of them\u2014similarities of course that neither would ever admit to.</p><p>\u201cNo more pictures, Bell,\u201d I joke.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cOh God, no, I think Xander might lose it if I ask him to smile one more time.\u201d With that we both laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d he asks, putting his arm around my waist and pulling me to him.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>Bell\u2019s phone dings and I watch as she pulls it out of the pocket of her little romper. A slight rosy color blooms on her cheeks. \u201cWho\u2019s that? A guy? Maybe a boyfriend?\u201d I tease.</p><p>Xander snorts. \u201cYou don\u2019t know Bell well enough yet\u2014she always has a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>She puts her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, brother of mine, I have not had a boyfriend since Tate.\u201d</p><p>Xander raises his arms in surrender. \u201cWow, calm down. I didn\u2019t know. But I\u2019m just teasing you.\u201d</p><p>She quickly slides her phone back into her pocket and gives him a giant smile before slipping a stuffed mushroom in her mouth. \u201cUmmm . . . these are so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, little sis, aren\u2019t those your favorite?\u201d he asks, pointing to a silver tray with scallops wrapped in bacon.</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try one of them for old times?\u201d Xander asks, the tone of his voice dropping.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she says almost menacingly.</p><p>\u201cI dare you,\u201d he challenges.</p><p>Her gaze flits over him in an assessing manner as she reaches for the appetizer. She squishes her nose in disgust and pops it right into her mouth. I think she swallows it without even chewing. Then she covers her mouth as if to stop from gagging.</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d she says, suddenly waving her hands in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you going to throw up?\u201d Xander asks, now with concern in his voice.</p><p>She covers her lips again and I think she\u2019s gagging. Her next words are muffled. \u201cI just remembered. I forgot the Bellinis. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>She scurries off amid the clacking of her gold and silver heels against the floor.</p><p>I turn around and catch Xander shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, long story, but Bell has hated scallops wrapped in bacon ever since she ate too many of them years ago and threw them all up. And here\u2019s something else you don\u2019t know about my sister\u2014she can never, I mean never, back down from a dare.\u201d</p><p>I lift a brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat? She\u2019s a bundle of nerves. She needed to calm down.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on his chest. \u201cSo are you. I think we all are.\u201d The glimpse of his stubbled cheeks makes my fingers itch and I forget all about the fact that I meant to scold him. Instead I run my palms up the side of his face and look into his eyes. After a few minutes I ask, \u201cEverything okay with Aerie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just wanted me to know who the new owner of Sound Music Magazine is before it\u2019s announced on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one I really give a shit about or want to talk about now. I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><p>I step closer and kiss the place where my hand was just resting.</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cFuck, you look incredible. I know I already told you this, but I can\u2019t keep my eyes off you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I can feel the heat blazing in my cheeks from the way he says it. I run my fingers up his shirt, thinking of his tattoo lying just underneath it. The tattoo he got for me. The one I love to trace with my eyes, my fingers, my tongue. I take a deep breath, then rub my hand over his stubbled jaw again.</p><p>A wicked grin crosses his lips. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t have time to shave. Someone hijacked me before getting ready.\u201d My pink flush turns to red instantly, I just know it. \u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed. Feel free to hijack me anytime,\u201d he says, unabashed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With my hand still on his jaw, I rub the slight stubble one more time. \u201cI like it when you don\u2019t shave.\u201d</p><p>He grins and kisses me. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the evening is enchanting, spent with Xander\u2019s family and our friends. But now it\u2019s time to debut my new songs and I\u2019m really nervous. But as soon as I hear his voice at the microphone introducing me, my nerves fade away and a contentment washes through me.</p><p>\u201cHere she is, everyone\u2014Ivy Taylor,\u201d he announces and steps off the stage before I reach him. I know he wants this to be my moment, but I at least wanted to kiss him. He stands right in the front as I bound onstage. The music begins and I start with the buoyant opener \u201cRollercoaster,\u201d then move into the slinky number \u201cJagged,\u201d and then go on to the hypnotic, hitching grooves of \u201cPure,\u201d which is the only song I wrote after Xander and I got back together\u2014it\u2019s about us.</p> <p>I surprise Xander by ending my performance with a vampy cover of Prince\u2019s \u201cLittle Red Corvette.\u201d It seems appropriate since he started driving the car that we spent so much time in in high school. It\u2019s the perfect song\u2014it tells our story. When I finish, everyone applauds, but no one louder than Xander. He holds out his arm for me to join him, and his familiar gaze is full of heat. He smiles at me and my whole body goes weak. I smile back as he jumps on stage and swings me around whispering, \u201cCongratulations, baby,\u201d in my ear.</p><p>We spend the rest of the night talking to the guests. After almost everyone but our close friends and Xander\u2019s family has left, I notice that the band takes the stage again. The music begins, and as I try to place it, Xander takes my hand and leads me to the dance floor. Suddenly I know the song. I smile because, oh my God, it\u2019s \u201cMarry Me.\u201d River begins to sing the lyrics, \u201cHe can\u2019t help that he likes to kiss you. And he wouldn\u2019t mind if you changed your name to Mrs.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>No Doubt\u2019s song, of course\u2014Xander always said I looked like Gwen Stefani, and we even modeled our first band after them. As River sings, Xander braces his arms around me and for the second time today starts dancing with me. I bury my face in his neck and enjoy the dance. This is obviously his way of announcing our engagement. Just as the song ends, the applause starts. He lifts my left hand and turns the ring around. Looking over his shoulder, I see his mother right away. She too has tears streaming down her face. Wiping my own tears away, I take a deep breath. \u201cLet\u2019s go hug your mother.\u201d</p><p>He gazes at me with those eyes so full of intensity and I know I\u2019m home. \u201cShe\u2019d love that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIvy . . .\u201d Charlotte throws her arms around me and hugs me tightly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be any happier right now.\u201d She holds me for the longest time and then says, \u201cYou really make him so happy.\u201d</p><p>Jack flashes a grin and engulfs me in a huge embrace. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier for the two of you,\u201d he says, and I swear I see a few tears in his eyes too. He slaps Xander on the shoulder and pulls him in as well, whispering something in his ear that I can\u2019t hear, but whatever it is, it makes Xander\u2019s mouth quirk up.</p><p>River smiles at us as he crosses the room with a bottle of champagne in his hand. Dahlia is at his side, snapping pictures. Bell trails behind with a tray of champagne flutes. They must all have known.</p><p>River hugs me. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>Dahlia squeezes me. \u201cIt\u2019s so amazing that you both found your way back to each other.\u201d</p><p>Before I know it, River tugs on the cork and it goes flying. I jump, startled by the noise. Laughter fills the room when he spills a little on the floor and flashes a grin. \u201cI always say I\u2019m not much of a bartender.\u201d</p> <p>Xander whispers something to him that I can\u2019t hear. River nods and then the two embrace, pulling their sister in as well.</p><p>River turns back to the crowd and hoists a glass high for a toast. \u201cTo Ivy and Xander. To true love.\u201d We all clink our glasses and tears of joy well up in my eyes. Bell makes a sweet toast, then whispers in my ear that she has to leave but she\u2019ll be calling me to plan the wedding. That makes me laugh\u2014I\u2019m sure she will. Aerie, Jagger, Leif, Garrett, Nix, and Phoebe join us. Several more toasts are made, not only to us but also to a successful album. At this moment life just couldn\u2019t be more perfect.</p><p>Looking around the room, I see us surrounded by a group of people who have become my family, and the man in the center of this universe who is my life, my love, my happily-ever-after. He wraps his arms around my waist and holds me tight. \u201cI love you,\u201d he breathes in my ear.</p><p>When I turn to look at him, to tell him how much I love him, I catch a glimpse of that boy I loved so long ago, and it makes me think about my life growing up. I wasn\u2019t a little girl who played dress-up, had tea parties, or even liked the color pink\u2014but I was a girl who dreamed of her prince charming and a fairy-tale wedding. That\u2019s why the girl who always wore black clothes and combat boots melted when she laid eyes on him for the first time. At first glance, I just knew he was my prince charming, my happily-ever-after. Now, his teeth find my shoulder for a nibble and I shudder. Xander Wilde the boy may have broken my heart once upon a time . . . but Xander Wilde the man, is the one who mended it.</p>  </body></html>"]
