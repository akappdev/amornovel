Don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t panic.</p><p>I\u2019ll escape from this. Of course I will. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be trapped here in this hideous confined space, with no hope of release, forever ... is it?</p><p>As calmly as possible, I assess the situation. My ribs are squashed so that I can hardly breathe, and my left arm is pinned behind me. Whoever constructed this \u201crestraining fabric\u201d knew what they were doing. My right arm is also pinned, at an awkward angle. If I try to reach my hands forward, the \u201crestraining fabric\u201d bites into my wrists. I\u2019m stuck. I\u2019m powerless.</p><p>My face is reflected, ashen, in the mirror. My eyes are wide and desperate. My arms are crisscrossed with black shiny bands. Is one of them supposed to be a shoulder strap? Does that webbing stuff go round the waist?</p> <p>Oh God. I should never ever have tried on the size 4.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing in there?\u201d It\u2019s Mindy, the sales assistant, calling from outside the cubicle curtain, and I start in alarm. Mindy is tall and rangy, with muscled thighs that start three inches apart. She looks like she probably runs up a mountain every day and doesn\u2019t even know what a KitKat is.</p><p>She\u2019s asked three times how I\u2019m doing, and each time I\u2019ve just called out shrilly, \u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d But I\u2019m getting desperate. I\u2019ve been struggling with this \u201cAthletic Shaping All-in-One\u201d for ten minutes. I can\u2019t keep putting her off forever.</p><p>\u201cAmazing fabric, right?\u201d says Mindy enthusiastically. \u201cIt has three times the restraining power of normal spandex. You totally lose a size, right?\u201d</p><p>Maybe I have, but I\u2019ve also lost half my lung capacity.</p> <p>\u201cAre you doing OK with the straps?\u201d comes Mindy\u2019s voice. \u201cYou want me to come in the fitting room and help you adjust them?\u201d</p><p>Come in the fitting room? There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting a tall, tanned, sporty Angeleno come in here and see my cellulite.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, thanks!\u201d I squawk.</p><p>\u201cYou need some help getting it off?\u201d she tries again. \u201cSome of our customers find it tricky the first time.\u201d</p><p>I have a hideous vision of me gripping the counter and Mindy trying to haul the All-in-One off me while we both pant and sweat with the effort and Mindy secretly thinks, I knew all British girls were heifers.</p><p>No way. Not in a million years. There\u2019s only one solution left. I\u2019ll have to buy it. Whatever it costs.</p> <p>I give an almighty wrench and manage to snap two of the straps up onto my shoulders. That\u2019s better. I look like a chicken trussed up in black Lycra, but at least I can move my arms. As soon as I get back to the hotel room, I\u2019ll cut the whole thing off myself with a pair of nail scissors and dispose of the remains in a public bin so Luke doesn\u2019t find them and say What\u2019s this? or You mean you bought it even though you knew it didn\u2019t fit? or something else really annoying.</p><p>Luke is my husband, and he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m standing in a sports-apparel shop in L.A. We\u2019re moving out to Los Angeles as soon as possible because of his work, and we\u2019re here on an urgent house-hunting trip. That\u2019s our focus this week: Real estate. Houses. Gardens. Rental agreements. Very much so. I\u2019ve only popped to Rodeo Drive very, very quickly between house appointments.</p><p>Well, OK. The truth is, I canceled a house appointment to come to Rodeo Drive. But I had to. I have a genuine reason for needing to buy some emergency running clothes, which is that I\u2019m running in a race tomorrow afternoon. A real race! Me!</p><p>I reach for my clothes, grab my bag, and walk stiffly out of the cubicle to see Mindy hovering nearby.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Her voice is bright but her eyes are shocked. \u201cYou look ...\u201d She coughs. \u201cAwesome. It\u2019s not too ... tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect,\u201d I say, attempting a carefree smile. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d She can barely hide her astonishment. \u201cSo, if you want to take it off, I\u2019ll scan it for you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ll wear it.\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cMight as well. Can you put my clothes in a bag?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Mindy. There\u2019s quite a long pause. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want to try the size six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Size four is perfect! Really comfy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Mindy after a silence. \u201cOf course. That\u2019ll be eighty-three dollars.\u201d She scans the bar code on the tag hanging from my neck, and I reach for my credit card. \u201cSo, you\u2019re into athletics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m running in the Ten Miler tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d She looks up, impressed, and I try to appear nonchalant and modest. The Ten Miler isn\u2019t just any old running race. It\u2019s the race. It\u2019s held every year in L.A., and loads of high-profile celebrities run it, and they even cover it on E! And I\u2019m in it! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did you get a place?\u201d Mindy says enviously. \u201cI\u2019ve applied for that race, like, every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I pause for effect. \u201cI\u2019m on Sage Seymour\u2019s team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Her jaw drops, and I feel a spurt of glee. It\u2019s true! I, Becky Brandon (n\u00e9e Bloomwood), am running on the team of a top movie star! We\u2019ll do calf stretches together! We\u2019ll wear matching baseball caps! We\u2019ll be in Us Weekly!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re British, right?\u201d Mindy interrupts my thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m moving to L.A. soon. I\u2019m out here to look at houses with my husband, Luke. He has a PR company and he works with Sage Seymour,\u201d I can\u2019t help adding proudly.</p><p>Mindy looks more and more impressed. \u201cSo are you and Sage Seymour, like, friends?\u201d</p><p>I fiddle with my purse, delaying my reply. The truth is, despite all my hopes, Sage Seymour and I aren\u2019t exactly friends. In fact, the real truth is, I still haven\u2019t met her. Which is so unfair. Luke\u2019s been working with her for ages, and I\u2019ve already been out to L.A. once for a job interview and now I\u2019m out here again, finding a house and a preschool for our daughter, Minnie ... but have I even glimpsed Sage?</p><p>When Luke said he was going to work with Sage Seymour and we were going to move to Hollywood, I thought we\u2019d be seeing her every day. I thought we\u2019d be hanging out by her pink pool in matching sunglasses and going for mani-pedis together. But even Luke hardly ever seems to see her; he just has meetings with managers and agents and producers all day long. He says he\u2019s learning the movie business and it\u2019s a steep learning curve. Which is fair enough, because previously he\u2019s only advised financial companies and big conglomerates. But does he have to be so resolutely non-starry-eyed? When I got a tiny bit frustrated the other day, he said, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Becky, we\u2019re not making this huge move just to meet celebrities.\u201d He said \u201ccelebrities\u201d like he was saying \u201cearwigs.\u201d He understands nothing.</p><p>The great thing about Luke and me is that we think alike on nearly everything in life, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so happily married. But we have just a few teeny points of disagreement. Such as:</p> <p>1. Catalogs. (They are not \u201cclutter.\u201d They\u2019re useful. You never know when you might need a personalized kitchen blackboard with a dinky little bucket for the chalk. Plus I like reading them at bedtime.)</p><p>2. Shoes. (Keeping all my shoes in their original boxes forever is not ridiculous; it\u2019s thrifty. They\u2019ll come back into fashion one day and then Minnie can wear them. And, meanwhile, he should look where he\u2019s stepping.)</p><p>3. Elinor, his mother. (Long, long story.)</p><p>4. Celebrities.</p><p>I mean, here we are in L.A. The home of celebrities. They\u2019re the local natural phenomenon. Everyone knows you come to L.A. to see the celebrities, like you go to Sri Lanka to see the elephants.</p><p>But Luke didn\u2019t gasp when we saw Tom Hanks in the lobby of the Beverly Wilshire. He didn\u2019t blink when Halle Berry was sitting three tables away at The Ivy (I think it was Halle Berry). He didn\u2019t even get excited when we saw Reese Witherspoon across the road. (I\u2019m sure it was Reese Witherspoon. She had exactly the same hair.)</p> <p>And he talks about Sage as if she\u2019s just another client. Like she\u2019s Foreland Investments. He says that this is what she appreciates about him: that he\u2019s not part of the circus. And then he says I\u2019m getting overexcited by all the Hollywood hoopla. Which is totally untrue. I am not overexcited. I\u2019m exactly the right amount excited.</p><p>Privately, I\u2019m disappointed in Sage too. I mean, OK, we don\u2019t exactly know each other, but we did speak on the phone when she was helping me with a surprise party for Luke. (Although she\u2019s got a new number, and Luke won\u2019t give it to me.) I would have thought she might be in touch, or invite me round to her house for a sleepover, or something.</p><p>Anyway, never mind. It\u2019ll all come good tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to boast, but it\u2019s totally due to my own quick wits that I\u2019m in this Ten Miler race. I just happened to be looking over Luke\u2019s shoulder at his laptop yesterday when a round-robin email came in from Sage\u2019s manager, Aran. It was entitled First come first served and read: Dear friends, there\u2019s a last-minute place available on the Ten Miler team due to an injury dropout\u2014anyone interested in running and supporting Sage?</p><p>My hands were on the keyboard, pressing REPLY and typing, Yes, please! I would love to run with Sage! Best wishes, Becky Brandon, before I was even aware I was moving.</p><p>OK, so maybe I should have consulted Luke before pressing SEND. But it was \u201cfirst come first served.\u201d I had to act fast! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke just stared at me and said, \u201cAre you nuts?\u201d Then he started going on about how this was a proper race for trained athletes, and who was going to sponsor me, and did I even possess any running shoes? Honestly. He could be more supportive.</p><p>Although, actually, he has a point about the running shoes.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you in the movie business too?\u201d Mindy asks as she hands me the receipt to sign.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a personal shopper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, OK. Which store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... actually, it\u2019s ... Dalawear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looks taken aback. \u201cYou mean, the store for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder women. Yes.\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cIt\u2019s a great store. It\u2019s really exciting. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m being super-positive about this job, even though it\u2019s not exactly my dream. Dalawear sells \u201ceasy-wear clothes\u201d for ladies who rate \u201ccomfort over style.\u201d (It actually says that on the poster. I might try to persuade them to change it to \u201ccomfort as much as style.\u201d) When I went to the interview, the woman kept talking about elasticated waistbands and washable fabrics and not once about directional fashion. Or even fashion.</p> <p>But the truth is, there aren\u2019t that many personal-shopping jobs popping up in L.A. at the last minute for a newly arrived Brit. Especially a Brit who may only be in the country for three months. Dalawear was the only store that had an opening, because of a maternity leave. And I rocked the interview, though I say it myself. I enthused about their \u201call-purpose floral shirtwaist\u201d dresses so much, I almost wanted to buy one for myself.</p><p>\u201cCan I please buy some running shoes too?\u201d I change the subject. \u201cI can\u2019t exactly run in these!\u201d I gesture at my Marc Jacobs kitten heels with a little laugh. (For the record, I did once climb an entire mountain in a pair of shoes just like these. But I mentioned that to Luke yesterday as proof of my athletic ability and he shuddered and said he\u2019d blanked that whole incident from his memory.)</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Mindy nods. \u201cYou\u2019ll want our technical store, Pump! It\u2019s right across the street. They stock all the shoes, equipment, heart-rate monitors ... Did you get a biomechanical assessment in the UK?\u201d</p><p>I look at her blankly. A bio-what?</p><p>\u201cTalk to the guys across the street; they\u2019ll get you set up.\u201d She hands me a carrier bag holding my clothes. \u201cYou must be super-fit. I\u2019ve worked out with Sage Seymour\u2019s trainer. She\u2019s hard-core. And I\u2019ve heard about the team regimen. Didn\u2019t you, like, go to Arizona for training?\u201d</p><p>This conversation is unnerving me a tad. Hard-core? Team regimen? Anyway, I mustn\u2019t lose confidence. I\u2019m perfectly fit enough to run a race, even if it is in L.A.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been on the regimen exactly,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut obviously I have my own ... er ... cardio ... program ... thing....\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s just running. How hard can it be?</p><p>As I head back out to Rodeo Drive, I feel a swoosh of exhilaration as the warm spring air hits me. I\u2019m going to love living in L.A.; I just know it. Everything people say about it is true. The sun shines and the people have super-white teeth and the houses look like film sets. I\u2019ve looked at several houses for rent and they all have pools. It\u2019s as if a pool is a normal thing, like a fridge.</p><p>The street around me simply glistens with glamour. It\u2019s lined with expensive, shiny shopfronts and perfect palm trees and rows of luxurious-looking cars. Cars are a whole different thing here. People drive by in their colorful convertibles with the roof down, looking all relaxed and friendly, as if you might stroll up to them while they\u2019re pausing at the light and start a conversation. It\u2019s the opposite of Britain, where everyone\u2019s in their own self-contained metal box, swearing at the rain.</p><p>Sunlight is glinting off all the shop windows and sunglasses and expensive watches on people\u2019s wrists. Outside Dolce &amp; Gabbana, a woman is piling a whole load of bags into a car, and she looks just like Julia Roberts except with blonder hair. And a bit smaller. But apart from that, just like Julia Roberts! On Rodeo Drive!</p><p>I\u2019m just trying to edge closer to see what bags she\u2019s got when my phone buzzes, and I pull it out to see Gayle on the screen. Gayle is my new boss at Dalawear, and we\u2019re having a meeting tomorrow morning.</p><p>\u201cHi, Gayle!\u201d I say in cheerful, professional tones. \u201cDid you get my message? Are we still on for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Rebecca. Yes, we\u2019re all good at this end ...\u201d She pauses. \u201cExcept for one hitch. We still didn\u2019t get your reference from Danny Kovitz.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Drat. Danny is one of my best friends and is quite a famous fashion designer. He promised to give me a reference for Dalawear, only it\u2019s been ages now and he hasn\u2019t done anything about it. I texted him yesterday and he promised he would send an email within the hour. I can\u2019t believe he hasn\u2019t.</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s not true. I can totally believe it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d I promise. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>The truth is, I never should have asked Danny for a reference. But I thought it sounded so cool, having a top fashion designer on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. And I\u2019m sure it helped. They couldn\u2019t stop asking me about him in the interview.</p> <p>\u201cRebecca ...\u201d Gayle pauses delicately. \u201cYou do know Mr. Kovitz? You have met him?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t believe me?</p><p>\u201cOf course I know him! Look, leave it with me. I\u2019ll get the reference. I\u2019m really sorry for the delay. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I end the call and instantly speed-dial Danny, trying to stay calm. There\u2019s no point getting cross with Danny; he just wriggles and becomes all plaintive.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Becky.\u201d Danny answers the phone as though we\u2019re mid-conversation. \u201cYou would not believe what I need for this trek. It\u2019s, like, who knew you could get freeze-dried lasagna? And I have the cutest little teakettle; you have to get one.\u201d</p> <p>This is why Danny is even more distracted than usual at the moment. He\u2019s about to start training to do some celebrity charity expedition across the Greenland ice sheet. Every single person who knows Danny has told him he\u2019s mad, but he\u2019s adamant he\u2019s going to do it. He keeps saying he wants to \u201cgive something back,\u201d but we all know it\u2019s because he fancies Damon, the lead singer from Boyz About, who\u2019s also doing it.</p><p>Although how you get it together with someone on a Greenland expedition, I have no idea. I mean, can you even kiss? Do your lips stick together in the freezing air? How do Eskimos manage?</p><p>\u201cDanny,\u201d I say sternly, wrenching my mind away from an image of two Eskimos stuck together on their wedding day, flailing their arms to break free. \u201cDanny, what about my reference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d says Danny without missing a beat. \u201cI\u2019m on it. How many pairs of thermal underwear should I take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on it! You promised you\u2019d send it yesterday! I\u2019ve got to go and see them tomorrow and they don\u2019t believe I even know you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course you know me,\u201d he says, as though I\u2019m an idiot.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know that! This is my only chance of a job in L.A., and I need to have a reference. Danny, if you can\u2019t do it, just tell me and I\u2019ll ask someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else?\u201d Only Danny can manage to sound mortally offended when he\u2019s in the wrong. \u201cWhy would you ask someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they might actually do it!\u201d I sigh, trying to stay patient. \u201cLook, all you need to do is send a little email. I\u2019ll dictate it, if you like. Dear Gayle, I can recommend Rebecca Brandon as a personal shopper. Signed, Danny Kovitz.\u201d There\u2019s silence down the phone, and I wonder if he\u2019s taking notes. \u201cDid you get that? Did you write it down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t write it down.\u201d Danny sounds indignant. \u201cThat is the crummiest reference I ever heard. You think that\u2019s all I have to say about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give out personal references unless I mean them. Unless I\u2019ve crafted them. A reference is an art form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a reference, I\u2019ll come and give you a reference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say, confused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not writing three crappy lines on an email. I\u2019m coming to L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come to L.A. just to give me a reference!\u201d I start to giggle. \u201cWhere are you anyway? New York?\u201d</p><p>Since Danny hit the big time, it\u2019s impossible to know where he\u2019ll be at any moment. He\u2019s opened three new showrooms this year alone, including one in the Beverly Center here in L.A. Which you\u2019d think would tie him down, but he\u2019s always scouting out yet more new cities or going on \u201cinspirational research trips\u201d (holidays).</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco. I was coming anyway. I need to buy sunblock. I always get my sunblock in L.A. Text me the details. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be great. You can help me choose a name for my husky dog. We each get to sponsor one, but I may sponsor a whole team. It\u2019s going to be, like, such a life-changing experience....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once Danny starts talking about life-changing experiences, it\u2019s hard to cut him off.

They should have a little catwalk where you\u2019d walk along to cool music and maybe strobe lighting, and they\u2019d take a video. And then the expert would say, We feel the black-and-white stiletto perfectly suits your awesome supermodel gait. And then you\u2019d take the video home to show all your friends. I am so suggesting it next time I\u2019m in there.</p> <p>\u201cSo here\u2019s the heart monitor I was telling you about....\u201d The sales assistant, Kai, reappears, holding a little metal and rubber bracelet. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s our most discreet model, new to the market. I\u2019m excited to hear your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d I beam at him and put it on my wrist.</p><p>Kai has asked if I\u2019d like to join in a customer study of this new heart monitor, and why not? The only sticky moment was when he asked what heart monitor I was using currently and I didn\u2019t like to say \u201cnone,\u201d so I said \u201cthe Curve\u201d and then realized that\u2019s Luke\u2019s new BlackBerry.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some more coconut water before you start?\u201d</p><p>More coconut water. That\u2019s so L.A. Everything in this shop is so L.A. Kai himself is ripped and tanned and has exactly the optimum amount of stubble, and bright turquoise eyes, which I\u2019m sure are lenses. He looks so like Jared Leto that I wonder whether he went to a surgeon with a picture torn out of Us Weekly and said, This one, please.</p> <p>He\u2019s already dropped into conversation that: 1. He\u2019s modeled for Sports Illustrated. 2. He\u2019s working on a script about a sportswear consultant who becomes a movie star. 3. He won Ohio\u2019s Best Pecs three years running and has had his pecs specially insured. He asked me within about thirty seconds whether I worked in the film industry, and when I said no, but my husband did, he gave me a card and said, \u201cI\u2019d love to meet with him to discuss a venture he might be interested in.\u201d The idea of Kai and Luke sitting at a table discussing his pecs nearly made me snort out my coconut water.</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019ll kindly step up here.\u201d Kai ushers me onto the treadmill. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking a record of your heart rate, so we\u2019ll raise it with some aerobic activity and then lower it with rest periods. Just follow the treadmill and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d As I step up, I notice a massive rack of exercise clothes being wheeled onto the shop floor by two sales assistants. Wow. They look amazing\u2014all different shades of purples and grays, with abstract logos and really interesting shapes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask Kai as the treadmill starts to move gently along.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He looks at it without interest. \u201cThat\u2019s from our clearance fashion floor.\u201d</p><p>Clearance fashion floor? No one mentioned a clearance fashion floor. Why didn\u2019t I know about the clearance fashion floor?</p> <p>\u201cWeird.\u201d He peers at his computer screen. \u201cYour heart rate just spiked, and we didn\u2019t even start the intense activity yet. Oh well.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>The treadmill starts to move along more briskly, and I up my walking pace to match. But I\u2019m distracted by the rack of clothes, because an assistant is putting sale signs on every garment! I spot a 90% OFF sign and crane my neck to see what it\u2019s attached to. Is that a T-shirt? Or a minidress? Or\u2014</p><p>Oh my God, look at that cardigan. I can\u2019t help gasping aloud. That is stunning. It\u2019s longline, in what seems to be gray cashmere, with an oversize neon-pink zipper, all the way up the front and the back. It\u2019s gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cSo now we\u2019ll rest for a moment....\u201d Kai is concentrating on his screen. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great so far.\u201d</p><p>The treadmill slows, but I barely notice. I\u2019m feeling stabs of alarm. A pair of passing girls has seen the rail and fallen on it in delight. I can hear them exclaiming with glee, showing clothes to each other and dumping them in their baskets. They\u2019re taking everything! I don\u2019t believe it. The sale of the century is going on ten yards away, and I\u2019m stuck on this stupid treadmill. As long as they don\u2019t see the cardigan. I will them silently: Don\u2019t look at the cardigan.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK, this is strange.\u201d Kai is frowning at his screen again. \u201cLet\u2019s pause the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I need to leave,\u201d I say breathlessly, grabbing my handbag and shopping basket. \u201cThanks. If I need a heart monitor I\u2019ll definitely get this one, but I must go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca, have you ever been diagnosed with arrhythmia? Heart disorder? Anything like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m stopped in my tracks. \u201cWhy? Have you picked something up?\u201d</p> <p>Is he joking? No. His face is serious. He isn\u2019t joking. I\u2019m gripped with fright. What have I got? Oh my God, I\u2019ll be in the Daily Mail health pages. \u201cMy one-in-a-million heart condition was picked up in a simple exercise store test. Shopping saved my life,\u201d says Rebecca Brandon\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour heart response wasn\u2019t typical. It spiked, but not at the moments I was expecting. For example, it spiked just now when you were resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say anxiously. \u201cIs that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. It would depend on a lot of things. Your general heart health, your cardio fitness ...\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019s talking, my eye wanders over to the sale rack again, and to my horror I see that one of the girls has picked up my cardigan. No! Noooo! Put it down!</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s happened again!\u201d says Kai in sudden animation, and points at the screen. \u201cDo you see? Your heart rate rocketed!\u201d</p><p>I look at Kai, and at the screen, and then at the cardigan with the neon-pink zip, and it all falls into place. Oh God, is that why my heart rate zoomed up?</p><p>This is so embarrassing. Stupid dumb heart. I can feel myself blushing bright red, and I hastily look away from Kai.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d I say in flustered tones. \u201cI have no idea why that happened. None! Just one of those mysteries. Mysteries of the heart. Ha-ha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. OK.\u201d Kai\u2019s face snaps as though in recognition. \u201cOoo-kay. I think I get it. I\u2019ve seen this a couple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK, this is a little awkward....\u201d He flashes me a perfect smile. \u201cIt was physical attraction to me, right? You don\u2019t need to be uncomfortable. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s why I had to give up personal training. The clients became ... I don\u2019t know, would you say \u2018infatuated\u2019?\u201d He glances complacently at himself in the mirror. \u201cYou looked at me and your response was beyond your control. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say honestly.</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d Kai sighs. \u201cI know it\u2019s embarrassing to admit, but believe me, you\u2019re not the only lady to become attracted to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t looking at you,\u201d I explain. \u201cI was looking at a cardigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cardigan?\u201d Kai plucks at his T-shirt, confused. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s over there. It\u2019s on sale.\u201d I point it out. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was looking at, not you. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d I take the opportunity to dash over and grab the cardigan, which, thank God, the girl has replaced on the rack. It\u2019s super-soft to the touch and the zip is amazing, and it\u2019s reduced by 70 percent! I\u2019m sure my heart is racing again, just from holding it.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it gorgeous?\u201d I enthuse, heading back toward Kai. \u201cIsn\u2019t it fab?\u201d Suddenly I realize I\u2019m not being very tactful. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re very good-looking too,\u201d I add encouragingly. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019d be attracted to you if it weren\u2019t for the cardigan.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Kai looks slightly stunned, to be honest. Even his turquoise contact lenses seem a bit less sparkly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be attracted to me \u2018if it weren\u2019t for the cardigan,\u2019 \u201d he echoes at last.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019d probably get infatuated, just like those clients of yours. Unless there were any other amazing clothes to compete with,\u201d I add, for honesty\u2019s sake. \u201cI mean, like a Chanel suit on ninety-nine percent sale. I don\u2019t think any man could beat that!\u201d I give a little laugh, but Kai\u2019s face has gone a bit rigid.</p><p>\u201cI never had to compete with clothes before,\u201d he says, almost to himself. \u201cClothes.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m noticing that the atmosphere isn\u2019t quite as easy and fun as it was before. I think I might just go and pay for my trainers.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the heart test anyway!\u201d I say brightly, and take off the bracelet. \u201cGood luck with the pecs!\u201d</p><p>Honestly. What a bighead that Kai is. I know he has stunning turquoise eyes and a great body, but he doesn\u2019t have a neon zip, does he? Lots of men have stunning blue eyes, but only one cardigan has a cool oversize neon-pink zip. And if he thinks he\u2019s never competed with clothes before, then his girlfriends have been lying to him. Every woman in the world sometimes thinks about shoes in the middle of sex. It\u2019s a well-known fact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anyway. Don\u2019t think about stupid Kai. On the positive front, I\u2019ve got the best, most whizzy trainers in the world. And, OK, they cost four hundred dollars, which is a lot, but I\u2019ll just have to think of this as an investment in my career. In my life.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll box those for you,\u201d says the sales assistant, and I nod absently. I\u2019m imagining standing at the start of the race with Sage, and her glancing down at my feet and saying, Cool shoes.</p><p>I\u2019ll give her a friendly smile and reply carelessly, Thanks.</p><p>Then she\u2019ll say, Luke never told me you were such a serious athlete, Becky.</p> <p>And I\u2019ll say, Are you kidding? I love running. (Which isn\u2019t quite true yet, but I\u2019m sure it will be. Once I start this race, the endorphins will kick in and I\u2019ll probably become addicted.)</p><p>Then Sage will say, Hey, we should train together! Let\u2019s meet up every morning.</p><p>And I\u2019ll say, Sure, very nonchalantly.</p><p>Then she\u2019ll say, I train with some friends, but you\u2019ll love them; do you know Kate Hudson and Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz and ...</p><p>\u201cWill you be paying by credit or cash, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p> <p>I blink at the assistant and fumble for my card. \u201cOh. Right. Credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you choose your water bottle?\u201d the sales assistant adds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re offering a free bottle with every shoe purchase.\u201d He gestures at a nearby poster.</p><p>Well. This four hundred dollars seems more and more of a bargain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have a look. Thanks!\u201d I beam at him and head toward the display of bottles. Maybe if I\u2019m carrying a cool bottle, Sage will notice that too! There\u2019s a whole wall of them\u2014chrome, matte black, and all sorts of colors in silicone. As my eye travels upward, I spot a label: LIMITED EDITION PRINT. I squint, trying to see\u2014but they\u2019re on the fifth shelf. Honestly. Why would you put the limited-edition-print bottles on the fifth shelf?</p> <p>There\u2019s a stepladder nearby, so I drag it over and climb to the top. Now I can see the bottles properly, and they\u2019re amazing: all with gorgeous retro prints. I can hardly bear to choose\u2014but in the end I narrow it down to three: one with red stripes, one with amber swirls, and one with black-and-white flowers. I\u2019ll pay for the extra ones, I decide, because I can give one each to Minnie and Suze as souvenirs.</p><p>I carefully put the bottles down on the top step of the ladder and turn to survey the shop. I have an amazing view up here. I can see all the aisles, and I can see that the woman at the cash register needs her roots touched up, and I can see\u2014</p><p>What?</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>I stiffen in disbelief and peer more closely.</p><p>In the far corner, there\u2019s a girl I hadn\u2019t noticed before. She\u2019s incredibly thin, wearing pale skinny jeans, a gray hoodie up over her head, and dark glasses that hide her face. And no wonder she\u2019s dressed so furtively. Because she\u2019s stealing.</p><p>I stare in utter shock as I see her putting a pair of socks into her oversize handbag (Balenciaga, this season), and then another. Then a third. Then she looks around, kind of shrinks down into herself, and walks swiftly toward the exit.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen a shoplifter in action before, and for an instant I feel stunned. But next moment a boiling outrage is rising through me. She took them! She shoplifted! She shouldn\u2019t do that! People shouldn\u2019t do that!</p> <p>What if we all did that? I mean, I bet we\u2019d all like to have free socks, but we don\u2019t just take them, do we? We pay. Even if we can\u2019t really afford it, we pay.</p><p>My stomach is churning as I watch her leave. I feel really angry. It\u2019s not fair. And suddenly I know I can\u2019t just let her go. I have to do something. I\u2019m not sure what\u2014but something.</p><p>Leaving the water bottles behind, I bound down the ladder and out of the shop door. I can see the shoplifter ahead of me, and I increase my pace to a run, dodging pedestrians as I go. As I get near, my heart is thumping with apprehension. What if she threatens me? What if she\u2019s got a gun? Oh God, of course she\u2019s got a gun. This is L.A. Everyone has guns.</p><p>Well, too bad. Maybe I will get shot, but I can\u2019t wimp out now. I reach out a hand and tap her on her bony shoulder.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>The girl whips round and I tense in fright, waiting for the gun. But it doesn\u2019t come. Her sunglasses are so huge I can barely see her face, but I make out a thin, pale chin and a scrawny, almost malnourished neck. I feel a sudden stab of guilt. Maybe she\u2019s on the streets. Maybe this is her only source of income. Maybe she\u2019s going to sell the socks to buy food for her crack-addict baby.</p><p>Part of me is thinking, Just turn away, Becky. Let it go. But the other part won\u2019t let me. Because even if there\u2019s a crack-addict baby, it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI saw you, OK?\u201d I say. \u201cI saw you taking those socks.\u201d</p><p>The girl immediately stiffens and makes to run away, but I instinctively grab her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t steal stuff!\u201d I say, struggling to keep hold of her. \u201cYou just shouldn\u2019t! You probably think, So what? No one got hurt. But, you know, shop assistants get in trouble when people shoplift. Sometimes they have to pay for the goods from their wages. Is that fair?\u201d</p><p>The girl is wriggling desperately to get away, but I\u2019m gripping on to her arm with both hands. As the mother of a two-year-old, you learn a lot of immobilization skills.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then all the prices go up,\u201d I add, panting. \u201cAnd everyone suffers! I know you might think it\u2019s your only option, but it\u2019s not. You can turn your life around. There are places you can go for help. Do you have a pimp?\u201d I add, trying to sound sympathetic. \u201cBecause I know they can be a real pain. But you could go to a safe house. I saw a documentary about it, and they\u2019re brilliant.\u201d I\u2019m about to elaborate when the girl\u2019s sunglasses slip to one side. And I glimpse the side of her face.</p><p>And suddenly I feel faint. I can\u2019t breathe. That\u2019s\u2014</p><p>No. It can\u2019t be.</p><p>It is. It is.</p><p>It\u2019s Lois Kellerton.</p> <p>All thoughts of crack addicts and safe houses disappear from my head. This is surreal. It can\u2019t be happening. It has to be a dream. I, Becky Brandon, am clutching the arm of top Hollywood actress Lois Kellerton. As I peer at her unmistakable jawline, my legs start to shake. I mean, Lois Kellerton. I\u2019ve seen all her films and I\u2019ve watched her on the red carpet and I\u2019ve\u2014</p><p>But what\u2014</p><p>I mean, what on earth\u2014</p><p>Lois Kellerton shoplifted three pairs of socks? Is this some kind of prank show?</p><p>For what seems like the longest moment, we\u2019re both motionless, staring at each other. I\u2019m remembering her as Tess in that brilliant adaptation of Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles. God, she made me cry. And there was that sci-fi one where she got deliberately stranded on Mars at the end in order to save her half-alien children. I cried buckets, and so did Suze.</p><p>I clear my throat, trying to gather my thoughts. \u201cI ... I know who you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she cuts me off in that familiar husky voice. \u201cPlease.\u201d She takes off her dark glasses and I stare at her in fresh shock. She looks terrible. Her eyes are red-rimmed and her skin is all flaky. \u201cPlease,\u201d she says a third time. \u201cI\u2019m ... I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Are you employed by the store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a customer. I was up a ladder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>With a trembling hand, she grabs the three pairs of socks from her bag and offers them to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was doing. I haven\u2019t slept for two nights. I think I went a little crazy. I never did anything like this before. I never will again. Please,\u201d she whispers again, shrinking inside her hoodie. \u201cTake the socks. Take them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She sounds desperate. At last, awkwardly, I take the socks from her.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d She\u2019s scrabbling in her bag again and produces a fifty-dollar note. \u201cGive this to the employees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look quite ... um ... stressed,\u201d I venture. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>Lois Kellerton raises her head and meets my eyes, and I\u2019m suddenly reminded of a leopard I once saw in a Spanish zoo. That looked desperate too.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell the police?\u201d she breathes, so quietly I can barely hear her. \u201cAre you going to tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Oh God. What do I do?</p><p>I put the socks in my bag, playing for time. I should tell the police. Of course I should. What difference does it make if it\u2019s a movie star? She stole the socks and that\u2019s a crime, and I should perform a citizen\u2019s arrest right now and march her off for justice.</p><p>But ... I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t. She looks so fragile. Like a moth or a paper flower. And after all, she\u2019s giving the socks back, and she\u2019s making a donation, and it sounds like she just had a moment of madness....</p><p>Lois Kellerton\u2019s head is bowed. Her face is hidden inside the gray hood. She looks as though she\u2019s waiting for an execution.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI promise. I\u2019ll give the socks back and I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>As I release my grip on her, her thin hand squeezes mine. Her dark glasses are already back on her face. She looks like an anonymous skinny girl in a hoodie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThank you.

Stop gabbling. \u201cUm, Becky,\u201d I finish lamely.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Becky.\u201d</p><p>And before I can say anything, she\u2019s turned and gone.</p> <p>Next morning, my head is still sparking in disbelief. Did that actually happen? Did I actually meet Lois Kellerton?</p><p>When I returned to Pump!, clutching the socks, it turned out they hadn\u2019t even noticed that the socks had gone. For an awful moment I thought they were going to accuse me of stealing them. But thankfully a sales assistant took over the incident and called up the CCTV footage, and we all watched as a thin girl in a gray hoodie put the socks in her bag and slipped out. I was tingling all over as I watched. A tiny part of me wanted to yell, Don\u2019t you see who it is? Don\u2019t you see?</p><p>But of course I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d made a promise. Besides which, they\u2019d never believe me. On the video you can\u2019t see her face at all.</p><p>Then we watched the footage as I chased her out of the shop. All I can say is, I am never buying an Athletic Shaping All-in-One again. I wanted to die when I saw my bottom bulging through the shiny fabric.</p><p>Anyway. On the plus side, everyone was really impressed by what I did, even if they were more interested in arguing about whether the socks should have been fitted with security tags. My story was that the \u201cmystery girl\u201d dropped the socks as I chased her down the street and that I couldn\u2019t catch up with her. I didn\u2019t know what to do about the fifty-dollar note, so in the end I pretended that I\u2019d found it on the floor and handed it over. I left my name in case the police need a statement, then hurried back to our hotel, where I finally cut that awful Athletic All-in-One off myself. (I bought a pair of shorts and a tank top from Gap instead.)</p> <p>Lois Kellerton. I mean, Lois Kellerton. People would die if they knew! (Well, Suze would.) But I haven\u2019t told anybody. When Luke and I finally met up for supper last night, he wanted to hear all about the rental houses I\u2019d looked at, and I didn\u2019t want to admit I\u2019d spent quite so much time on Rodeo Drive ... and besides which, I made a promise. I said I\u2019d keep it a secret and I have. Today it feels as though the whole event was a weird little dream.</p><p>I blink and shake my head to dislodge it. I have other things to think about this morning. I\u2019m standing outside Dalawear, which is on Beverly Boulevard and has a window display of mannequins in \u201ceasy-wear\u201d dresses and pantsuits taking tea on a fake lawn.</p><p>I\u2019m not meeting Danny for another twenty minutes, but I wanted to get here early and remind myself of the store and its layout. As I wander in, there\u2019s a lovely smell of roses in the air, and Frank Sinatra is playing over the sound system. It\u2019s a very pleasant store, Dalawear, even if all the jackets seem to be one style, just with different buttons.</p><p>I\u2019ve gone through separates, shoes, and underwear when I come to the evening-wear section. Most of the dresses are full-length and heavily corseted, in bright colors like periwinkle blue and raspberry. There are lots of big rosettes at the shoulder or waist, and beading, and lace-up bodices, and built-in \u201cslimming\u201d undergarments. Just looking at them makes me feel exhausted, especially after my Athletic Shaping All-In-One experience. Some clothes just aren\u2019t worth the hassle of trying to get them on and off.</p><p>I\u2019m about to take out my phone to text Danny when there\u2019s a rustling sound, and a girl of about fifteen appears out of the dressing room to stand in front of the full-length mirror. She\u2019s not the most together-looking girl. Her dark-red hair is in a fuzzy kind of bob, and her nails are bitten and her eyebrows could do with a bit of a tweeze. But, worst of all, she\u2019s wearing a jade-green strapless, swooshy gown that totally swamps her, complete with a rather revolting chiffon stole. She looks uncertainly at herself and hitches the bodice over her bust, where it really doesn\u2019t fit. Oh God, I can\u2019t bear it. What is she doing here? This shop isn\u2019t for teens.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I approach her hurriedly. \u201cWow! You look ... um, lovely. That\u2019s a very ... formal dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my end-of-year prom,\u201d mutters the girl.</p><p>\u201cRight. Fantastic!\u201d I let a pause fall before I add, \u201cThey have some pretty dresses in Urban Outfitters, you know. I mean, Dalawear is a brilliant choice, obviously, but for someone your age ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to shop here.\u201d She shoots me a miserable look. \u201cMy mom had some gift cards. She said I could only get a dress if it didn\u2019t cost her anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe saleslady said green would set off my hair,\u201d she adds hopelessly. \u201cShe went to find me some shoes to match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe green is ... lovely.\u201d I cross my fingers behind my back. \u201cVery striking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, you don\u2019t have to lie. I know I look terrible.\u201d Her shoulders slump.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cYou just ... it\u2019s a tiny bit full for you ... perhaps a bit fussy....\u201d I tug at the layers of chiffon, wanting to trim them all off with a pair of scissors. I mean, when you\u2019re fifteen, you don\u2019t want to be dressed up like a Christmas cracker. You want to be in something simple and beautiful, like\u2014</p><p>And then it hits me.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d I say, and hurry back to the underwear section. It takes me about twenty seconds to grab a selection of silk slips, lace slips, \u201cshaping\u201d slips, and a \u201cluxury satin slip with boned bodice,\u201d all in black.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get those?\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes light up as I arrive back in the evening-wear section.</p><p>\u201cThey were in another section,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cHave a go! They\u2019re all in small. I\u2019m Becky, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnita.\u201d She smiles, revealing train-track braces.</p><p>While she\u2019s rustling around behind the curtain, I search for accessories and find a black beaded sash plus a simple clutch bag in dark pink.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Anita emerges shyly from the changing room, utterly transformed. She\u2019s in a strappy lace slip that makes her look about three sizes smaller and shows off her long legs. Her milky skin looks amazing against the black lace, and her short, stubby hair seems to make more sense too.</p><p>\u201cAmazing! Just let me do your hair....\u201d There\u2019s a basket of complimentary water bottles on the counter, and, quickly opening one, I wet my hands. I smooth down her hair until it looks sleek and gamine, cinch her waist in with the beaded sash, and give her the pink clutch to hold.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d I say proudly. \u201cYou look fabulous. Now, stand with some attitude. Look at yourself. Don\u2019t you just rock?\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019s got a pair of heels on, she\u2019ll look a million dollars. I sigh happily as I watch her shoulders relax and a sparkle come to her eye. God, I love dressing people up.</p> <p>\u201cSo I found the shoes in your size ...\u201d comes a trilling voice behind me, and I turn to see a woman in her sixties approaching Anita. I met her when I came for the interview before, and her name\u2019s ... Rhoda? No, Rhona. It\u2019s on her name badge.</p><p>\u201cDear!\u201d She gives a shocked laugh as she sees the teenage girl. \u201cWhat happened to the gown?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s eyes slide uneasily to me, and I step in quickly.</p><p>\u201cHi, Rhona!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m Becky; we met before\u2014I\u2019m starting work here soon. I was just helping Anita with her look. Doesn\u2019t that slip look great worn as a dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, goodness!\u201d Rhona\u2019s rigid smile doesn\u2019t move an inch, but her eyes fix me with daggers. \u201cHow imaginative. Anita, sweetheart, I\u2019d love to see you in the green full-length.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Anita stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m wearing this one. I like it.\u201d</p><p>She disappears behind the curtain and I step toward Rhona, lowering my voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to see her in the green. It didn\u2019t work. Too big. Too old. But then I suddenly thought of the slips and\u2014bingo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly the point,\u201d says Rhona, bristling. \u201cYou know what the commission on that green gown is? You know what the commission on a slip is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who cares?\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cThe point is, she looks lovely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she looked far lovelier in the green gown. I mean, a slip.\u201d Rhona looks disapproving. \u201cTo a prom. A slip.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. I can\u2019t say what I really think.</p><p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re going to be working together, so ... shall we agree to disagree?\u201d I hold out my hand placatingly, but before Rhona can take it, there\u2019s an exclamation from behind me and two arms twine themselves round my neck.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny!\u201d I wheel round to see his pale-blue eyes shining at me through heavy eyeliner. \u201cWow! You look very ... um ... New Romantic.\u201d</p><p>Danny never puts on any weight or looks a day older despite leading the least healthy lifestyle on the planet. Today his hair is dyed black and gelled into a kind of droopy quiff; he\u2019s wearing a single dangly earring and tight jeans tucked into winklepicker boots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he announces. \u201cI have my reference.

It would set off the black lace wonderfully.\u201d She reaches for a length of pink tulle adorned with oversize white sequins and spreads it out on the counter.</p><p>Anita glances at me and I surreptitiously shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she says confidently.

Have fun at the prom, Anita!\u201d</p><p>As I head away with Danny, I can\u2019t help wrapping an arm round him. \u201cThank you for coming.

Couldn\u2019t you have chosen somewhere nearer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, some hike in the mountains?\u201d says Danny dismissively. \u201cSome little day trek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We would still have sponsored you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, you don\u2019t get it.\u201d Danny gives me a serious look. \u201cThis is something I have to do. I want to push myself to the limit. I have this great trainer, Diederik, and he\u2019s done the Greenland expedition. He says it\u2019s a mystical experience. Mystical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well. Mystical.\u201d I shrug.</p> <p>\u201cWho buys these clothes?\u201d Danny seems to have noticed the racks for the first time.</p><p>\u201cEr ... lots of people. Lots of very fashionable, stylish, um ... chic people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChic?\u201d He looks at me with a comically appalled face. \u201cChic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh! There\u2019s my boss!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve reached the entrance to the personal-shopping area, where I\u2019ve agreed to meet Gayle, and there she is, looking around anxiously. Maybe she thought I wasn\u2019t going to turn up. She\u2019s a really lovely woman, in her forties\u2014very pretty except her hair\u2019s too long, in my opinion\u2014and I\u2019m looking forward to working with her.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I wave to attract her attention.</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d She exhales. \u201cI was about to call you.

Where there is disaster, she will find style. Where there is blah, she will find a look. Where there is ... um\u2014\u201d He breaks off, pulls a piece of paper out of his jeans pocket, and consults it. \u201cYes! Where there is misery, she will find happiness. Not just fashion happiness, all-round happiness.\u201d He takes a step toward Gayle, who looks a bit shell-shocked. \u201cYou want Rebecca Brandon in your store. The last person who tried to fire her faced a backlash from the customers; am I right, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I shrug awkwardly, feeling a bit overcome. I had no idea Danny would be so nice about me.</p><p>\u201cYou may have heard some strange rumors about Rebecca.\u201d Danny has gone on to his second sheet of paper. \u201cYes, she once deliberately trapped a customer in a dress. But she had good reason.\u201d He hits the paper emphatically. \u201cYes, she\u2019s been known to disguise clothes as sanitary products. But she was helping her clients. Yes, she organized two weddings for the same day and didn\u2019t tell anyone, even her fianc\u00e9....\u201d He peers at the sheet.</p><p>\u201cDanny, shut up!\u201d I mutter.

Thank you.\u201d He gives a bow, then looks up at Gayle. \u201cI\u2019d now be glad to answer any questions, except those about my personal life, my beauty routine, and my ongoing lawsuit with my former manager.

Oh, it\u2019s too bad.\u201d She shuts her eyes. \u201cThis is all too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s too bad?\u201d I say, with a sudden feeling of foreboding.</p><p>\u201cRebecca ...\u201d Finally she faces me properly. \u201cThere\u2019s no job for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I falter.</p><p>\u201cI had a call just now from the group director. He\u2019s been doing a review, and we have to lose some staff.\u201d She winces. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that a personal-shopping maternity cover is too great a luxury for us. We\u2019re going to have to get by with just Rhona for now. I would love to hire you, believe me.\u201d She glances from me to Danny. \u201cBut in this climate ... things are so tough....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I say, my voice wobbly with shock. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sure you would have been a great addition to the department.\u201d She looks so sad, I feel a pang of sympathy. What a horrible job, having to fire people.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s life,\u201d I say, trying to sound more cheerful. \u201cThanks for the chance anyway. And maybe I\u2019ll come and work here when things get better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Thanks for being so understanding. I\u2019m afraid I have to go break some more bad news.\u201d She shakes my hand, then turns and strides away, leaving Danny and me looking blankly at each other.</p><p>\u201cBummer,\u201d says Danny at last.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sigh heavily. \u201cThanks for the reference anyway. Can I buy you lunch to say thank you?\u201d</p> <p>By the time Danny leaves for the airport, two hours later, we\u2019ve had a blast. We\u2019ve done early lunch with cocktails, and a shopping spree for sunblock, and I\u2019ve laughed so hard, my stomach muscles ache. But as I watch his car whisk him away along Beverly Boulevard, there\u2019s a lump of disappointment weighing me down. No job. I was counting on that job. Not just for employment, not just for money\u2014but as something to do. A way to make friends.</p><p>Anyway. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s all good. I\u2019ll think of something else. There are loads of shops in L.A.; there must be opportunities. I\u2019ll just have to keep looking ... keep my ears and eyes open ...</p><p>\u201cHey, lady! Watch it!\u201d</p><p>Oops. I was so busy thinking about keeping my ears and eyes open, I didn\u2019t notice a great big crane thing parked slap-bang in the middle of the pavement. A man in a headset is directing people around it, and there\u2019s a bit of a buzz farther up the street. As I go nearer to get a look, I can see glinting, and lights on stands ... oh wow! It\u2019s a camera crew! They\u2019re filming something!</p><p>I know I need to get back to the hotel and prepare for the Ten Miler race, but I can\u2019t just walk away. Even though I\u2019ve been to L.A. before, this is the first camera crew I\u2019ve seen. So I hurry along in excitement, heading toward the bright lights. The pavement is cordoned off with metal barriers, and a guy in a denim jacket and a headset is politely asking people to step away to the other side of the street. Reluctantly, I obey, keeping my eyes fixed on the action. There are two guys in jeans sitting on director\u2019s chairs, and a burly man operating a camera, and several girls scurrying around with headsets on, looking important. I feel massive pangs of envy as I watch them all. I mean, how cool, to be involved in a film. The only kind of filming I\u2019ve ever done was on TV, advising people how to invest their pensions. (I used to be a financial journalist. I used to spend all day talking about bank accounts. Sometimes I get an anxiety dream where I\u2019m back in that job and I\u2019m on TV and I don\u2019t even know what an interest rate is.)</p><p>Standing on the sidewalk, all alone, is a woman who I guess is an actress, as she\u2019s so tiny and made up. I don\u2019t recognize her, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything. I\u2019m just wondering whether to get out my phone, take a picture, and text\u2014Who\u2019s this?\u2014to my best friend, Suze, when an older woman in jeans and a black tank top comes up to her. She\u2019s wearing a maroon peaked cap and has long black braids and the coolest high-heeled boots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone else in the crowd is pointing at the actress, but I\u2019m riveted by the woman with braids. I know her. I\u2019ve read interviews with her. She\u2019s a stylist called Nenita Dietz.</p><p>She\u2019s holding a see-through plastic bag containing a stripy vintage-looking coat, which she carefully takes out and puts on the actress. She stares critically, adjusts it, then adds a necklace. And as I watch her, my thoughts are suddenly spinning in a new direction. Imagine having that job. Working on films; choosing outfits for actors; styling stars for appearances ... Forget department stores, I should aim higher! That\u2019s the job I should have. I mean, it\u2019s perfect. I love clothes, I love films, I\u2019m moving to L.A.... Why didn\u2019t I think of this before?</p><p>Now Nenita Dietz is trying different pairs of sunglasses out on the actress. I follow every move she makes, utterly mesmerized. Nenita Dietz is amazing. She was behind that trend for boots with evening wear. And she\u2019s starting a line of underwear. I\u2019ve always wanted to design my own underwear.</p><p>But how on earth would I get into it? How do you become a top Hollywood stylist? Or even a low-to-medium Hollywood stylist? Where do I start? I don\u2019t know anyone here, I don\u2019t have a job, I don\u2019t have any film experience....</p> <p>Now people across the road are shouting, \u201cQuiet on set!\u201d and \u201cRolling!\u201d and \u201cQUIET PLEASE!\u201d I watch in fascination as the actress folds her arms and looks upward.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>Cut? That was it?</p><p>All the film people are scurrying around again and I peer hard, searching for Nenita Dietz, but I can\u2019t see her. And people are starting to press at my back. So at last I tear myself away, my mind whirling with fantasies. A darkened cinema.

Signature look!)</p><p>Pink hair and distressed pinstripe jacket</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 brooches pinned to wellies</p><p>Jeans cut up and made into arm warmers</p><p>Carry two designer handbags at once (Yes!

All I need to do is meet Sage Seymour, start chatting about clothes, offer to style her for an appearance ... and I\u2019ll have an in. It\u2019s all about who you know, and Sage Seymour is the perfect person to know. And this is the perfect event to meet her! I mean, I\u2019m actually on her team! I have every reason to talk to her, and I can easily edge the conversation onto red-carpet trends while we\u2019re sprinting along together. I haven\u2019t seen her yet, but my eyes are swiveling around, and I\u2019m poised for action as soon as I spot her.</p><p>A bell sounds, and all the runners start pressing more closely together. The cocktails I drank with Danny are starting to creep up on me, and I slightly regret that Malibu Sunrise now ... but never mind. The endorphins will soon kick in.</p><p>It\u2019s quite a spectacle, this Ten Miler race. It starts at Dodger Stadium, and it goes along Sunset and then onto Hollywood Boulevard. According to the welcome pack, the route passes many Hollywood landmarks, which is brilliant, because I\u2019ll be able to sightsee as I run! I\u2019ve already checked in, and I can\u2019t believe how many people are doing it. Everywhere I look, I see runners limbering and jogging and adjusting their shoelaces. Music is playing through loudspeakers, and the sun is shining hazily through the clouds and there\u2019s a smell of sunscreen. And I\u2019m part of it! I\u2019m standing in the middle of Group 1, about ten feet away from a massive great metal arch, which is the start of the race, with a number taped to my chest (184) and a special chip in my shoe. Best of all, I\u2019m wearing the fab team baseball cap, which was waiting for me at the hotel desk. It\u2019s bright turquoise, with TEAM SAGE in white letters. I feel like I\u2019m in the Olympics!</p><p>Yet again I scan the crowd, searching for another TEAM SAGE turquoise baseball cap, but the runners are too closely packed together to see much. She has to be here somewhere. I\u2019ll just have to find her when we start running. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I\u2019m doing a leg stretch, I catch the eye of a wiry black girl limbering up beside me. She looks at my baseball cap and her eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on the Sage Seymour team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m with Sage. We\u2019ll be running together, and chatting, and ... everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You must be good. So, what time are you hoping to make today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI expect I\u2019ll take about ... um ...\u201d</p><p>I have no idea. Ten miles. How fast can I run ten miles? I\u2019m not even sure how fast I can run one mile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just hoping to improve my personal best,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d The girl stretches her arms over her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s your race strategy?\u201d</p><p>Meet Sage Seymour, talk about clothes, and wangle an invitation to her house flashes through my mind.</p> <p>\u201cJust ... run,\u201d I say with a shrug. \u201cTo the end. You know. As fast as I can.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me blankly, then laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201d</p><p>The runners are clustering together even more tightly. There must be at least a thousand people, stretching back as far as the eye can see. And despite my lingering jet lag, I feel a sudden burst of exhilaration as I bounce lightly in my new high-tech shoes. Here I am! Running in a high-profile race in L.A.! It just shows what you can do if you put your mind to it. I\u2019m about to take a photo of myself and send it to Suze when my phone rings and it\u2019s Mum. She always calls last thing at night, just to tell me that Minnie got off to sleep OK.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I answer the phone in delight. \u201cGuess what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on a red carpet!\u201d exclaims Mum excitedly.</p><p>Every time Mum phones, she asks if I\u2019m on a red carpet. The truth is, not only have I not been on one, I haven\u2019t even seen one. Even worse: Luke had an invitation to a premiere the first time we were here, and not only did he not go, he didn\u2019t even tell me about it until it was too late. A premiere!</p> <p>This is why I can\u2019t rely on Luke to get me in to anything cool. He has completely the opposite view of L.A. from me. All he\u2019s interested in is attending meetings and being on permanent BlackBerry call, i.e., business as usual. He says the work ethic in L.A. is something he really relates to. The work ethic. Who comes to L.A. for the work ethic?</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m running in a charity race. With Sage!\u201d</p><p>Mum gasps. \u201cYou\u2019re with Sage Seymour? Oh, Becky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly with her right this second,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to catch up with her while we\u2019re running. I\u2019ve got a Team Sage baseball cap,\u201d I add proudly.</p><p>\u201cOh, love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019ll take a picture of it. Show Minnie. Is she OK? Fast asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, fine!\u201d says Mum breezily. \u201cAll snuggled up in bed. So, who else have you met? Anyone famous?\u201d</p><p>Lois Kellerton flashes through my mind.</p> <p>No. Don\u2019t even think about it. I love my mum, but if you tell her anything, it\u2019s all over Oxshott in a nanosecond.</p><p>\u201cThere are loads of celebs in the race,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cI think I just saw a guy from Desperate Housewives.\u201d It could have been him, or it could have been a different guy, but Mum won\u2019t know.</p><p>A klaxon is sounding. Oh God. Is that the race starting?</p><p>\u201cMum, I have to go,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI\u2019ll call later. Bye!\u201d</p><p>That was the start of the race. We\u2019re off. We\u2019re running. I\u2019m running too! Feet and arms are blurring around me as the runners jostle for position and I breathlessly try to stay with them.</p><p>God, they\u2019re fast.</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fast too. I\u2019m totally keeping up with the others. My chest is already burning, but that\u2019s OK, because the endorphins will kick in, any minute.</p><p>The most important thing is: Where\u2019s Sage?</p><p>As the crowd thins out, I\u2019m able to get a better view of my fellow runners. I\u2019m scanning the heads desperately for a turquoise baseball cap.... She must be somewhere.... I can\u2019t have missed her, surely....</p><p>There! I feel a burst of joyous adrenaline. She\u2019s right up at the front, of course. OK, time to make my move. I\u2019ll sprint up to her casually, gesture at my hat, and say, I think we\u2019re on the same team. And our close friendship will begin.</p><p>I\u2019ve never really considered myself an athlete before, but as I charge forward, it\u2019s like some invisible force is powering me. I\u2019m overtaking the wiry black girl! I\u2019m on fire! I\u2019m exhilarated! But still the turquoise cap is bobbing along ahead of me, tantalizingly out of reach, so I put on an extra spurt of energy. Somehow I succeed in drawing level with her. My face is boiling and my heart is hammering in my chest, but I manage to point at my hat and gasp, \u201cI think we\u2019re on the same team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The turquoise baseball cap turns ... and it\u2019s not Sage Seymour. It\u2019s some girl with a pointy nose and brown hair, who gives me a blank look and ups her pace. She\u2019s not wearing a TEAM SAGE cap, either, just a plain turquoise one. I\u2019m so disconcerted, I stop dead and nearly get knocked over by a horde of runners.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne eighty-four, what are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>Hastily, I move to one side and try to catch my breath. OK, so that wasn\u2019t Sage. But never mind. She\u2019ll be here somewhere. I just have to keep my eyes open for turquoise ... turquoise ... Yes! Over there!</p><p>With a fresh surge of adrenaline, I plunge into the race again and chase after another turquoise baseball cap. But as I draw near, I can see already that it\u2019s not Sage. It\u2019s not even a girl. It\u2019s a skinny Italian-looking guy.</p><p>Bloody hell. Panting hard, I head to a water station and take a sip of water, still desperately scanning the crowd of runners, refusing to give up. So I\u2019ve had two near misses. Never mind. I\u2019ll find her. I will. Wait, there\u2019s a flash of turquoise up ahead. That must be her....</p><p>An hour later, I feel like I\u2019ve moved into a parallel universe. Is this \u201cthe zone\u201d? It feels more like hell. My lungs are pumping like pistons; my face is sweaty; I have blisters on both feet; I want to die\u2014and yet still I\u2019m moving. It\u2019s as if some magic force is keeping me going. I keep seeing turquoise baseball caps in the crowd. I keep chasing them. I\u2019ve approached one blond girl four times now. But none of them is Sage. Where is she? Where is she?</p><p>And where are these bloody endorphins? I\u2019ve been running for ages and haven\u2019t had a single one. It\u2019s all lies. Nor have I seen a single Hollywood landmark. Have we even passed any?</p> <p>Oh God, I have to drink some water. I head to the next water stand decorated with helium balloons. I grab one paper cup and pour the water over my head, then gulp at a second. There\u2019s a crowd of cheerleaders in red costumes doing a routine nearby, and I look at them enviously. Where do they get all that energy from? Maybe they have special springy cheerleaders\u2019 boots. Maybe if I had glittery pom-poms to shake, I\u2019d run faster.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Over here! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>I straighten up, panting, and look around in a daze. Then I spot Luke on the other side of the barricade. He\u2019s holding a Ten Miler flag and gazing at me in alarm. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he repeats.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d My voice comes out rasping. \u201cAll good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come along to support you.\u201d He eyes me in amazement as I stagger toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re making incredibly good time. I didn\u2019t realize you were so fit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I wipe my sweaty face. \u201cRight.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even thought about how quickly I was going. The whole race has been a blur of chasing turquoise baseball caps.</p> <p>\u201cDid you get my text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Sage pulling out.\u201d</p><p>I stare up at him blankly, the blood still pumping in my ears. Did he just say ...</p><p>\u201cShe sends her apologies,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cYou mean ... she\u2019s not in the race?\u201d I manage. \u201cAt all?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been chasing all those turquoise baseball caps for nothing?</p><p>\u201cA friend of hers decided to take a bunch of pals on a trip to Mexico,\u201d says Luke. \u201cShe and her whole team are on a plane as we speak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe whole team have pulled out?\u201d I\u2019m trying to make sense of this. \u201cBut they trained! They went to Arizona!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they did. But they pretty much move in a pack,\u201d he says drily. \u201cIf Sage says, Let\u2019s go to Mexico, they go to Mexico. Becky, I\u2019m sorry. You must be disappointed.\u201d He touches my shoulder. \u201cI know you only ran the race to meet Sage.\u201d</p><p>His sympathy hits a nerve in me. Is that what he thinks? I mean, I know it\u2019s the truth, but it shouldn\u2019t be what he thinks. Husbands should think the best of their wives, as a matter of principle.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t only run the race to meet Sage!\u201d I say, drawing myself up tall with an affronted expression. \u201cI did it because I love running and I wanted to support the charity. I hadn\u2019t even thought about whether Sage was in the race or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Luke\u2019s face flickers. \u201cWell, then, bravo. Not much longer to go.\u201d</p><p>As it hits me, my heart plummets. I haven\u2019t finished. Oh God. I can\u2019t run anymore. I just can\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s four miles more.\u201d Luke is consulting a race map. \u201cYou\u2019ll do that in no time!\u201d he adds cheerfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Four miles? Four whole miles?</p><p>As I look at the road ahead, my legs feel wobbly. My feet are aching. Runners are still pounding by, but the thought of getting back into the fray fills me with dread. A guy in a turquoise baseball cap powers by, and I scowl at him. I\u2019ll be happy if I never see a turquoise baseball cap again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better limber up before I start again,\u201d I say, playing for time. \u201cMy muscles are cold.\u201d</p><p>I lift up my foot to do a quad stretch. I count very slowly up to thirty and then do the other side. Then I flop down and let my head dangle in front of my knees for a couple of minutes. Mmm. This is nice. Maybe I\u2019ll stay here for a while.</p> <p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke\u2019s voice penetrates my consciousness. \u201cSweetheart, are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stretching,\u201d I inform him. I raise my head, stretch out my triceps, and then do a few yoga-type poses I\u2019ve seen Suze do. \u201cNow I\u2019d better hydrate,\u201d I add. \u201cIt\u2019s really important.\u201d</p><p>I reach for a cup of water and sip it slowly, then fill another and hand it to a passing runner. I might as well be helpful while I\u2019m here. I fill a few more cups with water, ready to hand out, and straighten a stack of energy bars. There are empty wrappers everywhere, so I begin to gather them up and put them in the bin. Then I retie a couple of balloons which have come loose and adjust some streamers. Might as well make the stand look tidy.</p><p>I suddenly notice that the guy behind the water stand is staring at me as though I\u2019m insane.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he says. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be running?\u201d</p> <p>I feel a bit indignant at his tone. I\u2019m helping him. He could be more grateful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a stretch break,\u201d I explain, and look up to see that Luke is surveying me quizzically.</p><p>\u201cYou must be pretty well stretched out,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you going to start running again now?\u201d</p><p>Honestly. All this pressure to run the whole time.</p><p>\u201cI just need to ...\u201d I interlace my fingers and stretch them out. \u201cMmm. I have a lot of tension there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, you\u2019re gonna miss the whole thing,\u201d says the waterstand guy. He gestures at the road. \u201cThat\u2019s the last bunch.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true: The race is thinning out by now. Only the last few stragglers are left. The spectators are drifting away too. The whole atmosphere is kind of melting away. I can\u2019t put it off anymore.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I try to sound positive. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll quickly run those last four miles, then. Shouldn\u2019t take long. Great.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll just get going, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr ...\u201d says Luke, and my head jerks up.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering, Becky, if you didn\u2019t mind slowing your pace to mine, maybe we could walk it? Together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk it?\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand over the barricade and clasps mine. By now we\u2019re practically the only people around. Behind us, workmen are beginning to dismantle the barricades and pick up litter with special sticks.</p><p>\u201cNot often we get a chance to walk in L.A.,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got the street to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>I want to expire with relief.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI don\u2019t mind walking. Although obviously I would very much have preferred to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He shoots me an amused little grin, which I ignore. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>We start to walk along, picking our way through the paper cups and energy-bar wrappers left everywhere. I tighten my fingers around his and he squeezes my hand back.</p><p>\u201cCome this way.\u201d Luke leads me to the right, off the street and onto the pavement\u2014or sidewalk, as I must start calling it. \u201cYou know where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHollywood? Los Angeles?\u201d I look at him suspiciously. \u201cIs this a trick question?\u201d</p><p>Luke makes no answer, just nods at the sidewalk. And suddenly I get it.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I look down with a beam. \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re standing on the stars. The Hollywood Walk of Fame, which I\u2019ve seen a million times on TV but never for real. I feel as though Luke has put it there especially as a present for me, all shiny and pink.</p><p>\u201cEdward Arnold!\u201d I exclaim, reading a name and trying to sound reverent. \u201cWow! Um ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d says Luke. \u201cSomeone famous. Clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d I giggle. \u201cAnd who\u2019s Red Foley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBette Davis,\u201d says Luke, pointing at another star. \u201cWill that do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh! Bette Davis! Let me see!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a while I do nothing but dart backward and forward, looking for famous names.

This is a wonderful place to explore. I\u2019d just enjoy the healthy outdoor lifestyle with Minnie. Go hiking in the hills, play on the beach ...\u201d</p><p>That is so Luke. First the work ethic, now the \u201chealthy outdoor lifestyle\u201d? What\u2019s he on about? I haven\u2019t come to L.A. for the \u201chealthy outdoor lifestyle,\u201d I\u2019ve come for the \u201ccelebrity-big-sunglasses-red-carpet lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.

OK, so maybe I didn\u2019t expect him to shout Go, girl!, but neither did I expect this. His eyebrows are raised and furrowed at the same time. His mouth is turning down at the edges. I\u2019ve been married to Luke so long, I know his expressions off by heart, and this one is Number 3: How do I break it to Becky that I hate this idea? It\u2019s exactly the same expression he had when I suggested painting our bedroom purple. (I still say it would have been sexy.)</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I demand. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea ...\u201d he begins carefully.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cWhat do you really think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, you know Sage only hired me as a consultant on a short-term basis. If this whole venture works out, maybe Brandon Communications will open a media arm here and maybe I\u2019ll fly back and forth. But I can\u2019t imagine we\u2019ll relocate permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what will you do if you establish a whole new career here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cFigure it out.\u201d</p> <p>This is typical. Luke always lets practical plans get in the way of creative inspiration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot of hard work,\u201d he\u2019s saying now, \u201ca lot of banging on doors, a lot of disappointment....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t do it?\u201d I say, affronted.</p><p>\u201cMy darling, I think you can do pretty much anything you put your mind to,\u201d says Luke. \u201cHowever, I think to get into the world of Hollywood styling in three months will be, let\u2019s say, a challenge. But if you really want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just want to, I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>Luke sighs. \u201cWell, then, of course I\u2019ll help. I\u2019ll ask around for some contacts, see what I can fix up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help!\u201d I retort.</p><p>\u201cBecky, don\u2019t be silly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not being silly,\u201d I shoot back, feeling outraged. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rely on my husband. I\u2019m an independent woman, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think I can\u2019t break in to Hollywood on my own? You just watch. Katharine Hepburn,\u201d I add.</p><p>We walk on for a while in silence, not even bothering to say the names anymore, and gradually I simmer down. Actually, Luke\u2019s help would have been quite useful. In fact, really useful. But it\u2019s too late now; I\u2019ve said it. I\u2019ll have to find a way to do it on my own and show him.</p><p>My mind starts working hard. Sage is still my most obvious way in. I\u2019m bound to meet her soon. And meanwhile I can plan a few outfits for her. Maybe I\u2019ll even buy her an accessory or two, just like a personal stylist would. Yes. Brilliant. And if Sage doesn\u2019t work out ... well, I have other contacts, don\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cYou know, Luke, I do have my own resources,\u201d I say grandly. \u201cI have worked at Barneys, remember. I am a bit connected, remember. In fact I think you\u2019ll find I\u2019m even better connected than you.\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s true! I met loads of Hollywood people when I worked at Barneys. At least three producers and a music consultant and a casting director. I\u2019ll contact all of them, and someone will be able to give me an entr\u00e9e, and then\u2014</p><p>Ooh, Lassie!</p><p>From: Laird, Nick</p><p>To: Brandon, Rebecca </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Subject: Hi, Melanie, how are you?!</p><p>Dear Mrs. Brandon,</p><p>I am replying to your email to Melanie Young.

How?</p><p>As soon as I got back to the UK, I looked up all my old contacts and sent off a stack of emails. But I haven\u2019t got anything out of it: not a lunch, not a meeting, not a phone number. Every single one of my former customers who worked in film seems to have moved jobs or had a nervous breakdown or something. The only one left was Genna Douglas, who was a customer of mine at Barneys and had the hugest collection of backless dresses. But after getting no reply, I Googled her, and it turns out she left her job at Universal a year ago to start a beauty salon. She\u2019s invented some treatment involving electric currents and honey and has been sued twice by disgruntled clients but is actively seeking investors. Hmm. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be pursuing that one.</p><p>I\u2019m so disappointed. I thought I\u2019d be swimming in contacts. I thought I\u2019d be fixing up lunches at Spago and meetings with producers and saying to Luke casually, Oh, are you going to be on the Paramount lot this afternoon? I\u2019ll see you there.</p> <p>Anyway. On the plus side, I still have Sage. A genuine, copper-bottomed, A-list contact. And I haven\u2019t been sitting around doing nothing. I\u2019ve started working on some looks for her, and I really feel I\u2019m tuning in to her personality. Her world.</p><p>\u201cSo, look.\u201d I spread a pale-blue brocade coat out on the bed for Suze to see. \u201cIsn\u2019t this fab?\u201d</p><p>Suze is my oldest friend in the world, and we\u2019re lolling on her bed in Hampshire with gossip magazines, just like we used to in the old days when we shared a flat in Fulham. Except that in those days, it meant lolling on an old Indian bedspread covered in cigarette burns and smelling of joss sticks. Whereas today we\u2019re lolling on a massive, ancient four-poster bed, with silk drapes and tapestry and wooden paneling that apparently Charles I carved his name in once. Or do I mean Charles II? Some Charles or other anyway.</p><p>Suze is eye-wateringly posh. She lives in a stately home, and ever since her grandfather-in-law died, she\u2019s called Lady Cleath-Stuart, which sounds quite terrifyingly grown-up to me. \u201cLady Cleath-Stuart\u201d sounds like a ninety-year-old battle-ax swishing at people with a riding crop and barking, What? What? Not that I would ever tell Suze this. Anyway, she\u2019s pretty much the opposite of that. She\u2019s tall and leggy with long blond hair, which she\u2019s now chewing in an absent kind of way.</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d she says, fingering the coat. \u201cReally gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great lightweight coat that Sage can just shrug on over jeans or whatever. It\u2019ll really suit the L.A. climate. And then she can wear flats or those boots I showed you before....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing collar.\u201d She touches the gray frayed velvet.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say triumphantly. \u201cI found it in this tiny boutique. The label\u2019s new. It\u2019s Danish. Now look at this skirt.\u201d</p><p>I produce a minute denim skirt with ribbon edging, but Suze is still surveying the coat, her brow crumpled.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve bought this coat for Sage? And all these other things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! That\u2019s the point of being a stylist. I found the skirt in a vintage shop in Santa Monica,\u201d I add. \u201cThe owner customizes all the clothes herself. Look at the buttons!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suze doesn\u2019t even seem to see the buttons. She reaches for a T-shirt, which would be perfect for Sage to wear when she\u2019s hanging out at a coffee shop with Jennifer Garner or somebody.</p><p>\u201cBut, Bex, isn\u2019t all this shopping costing you a lot of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d I echo incredulously. \u201cSuze, it\u2019s not shopping. It\u2019s investing in my job. And I usually get a discount. Sometimes I even get things for free. I just have to tell them that I\u2019m shopping for Sage Seymour, and bingo!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how excited shop owners get when you mention Sage Seymour. They practically throw clothes at you!</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not shopping for Sage Seymour,\u201d says Suze flatly.</p><p>I stare at her, perplexed. Hasn\u2019t she been following what I\u2019m saying?</p><p>\u201cYes, I am! Of course I am! These things aren\u2019t even my size!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she hasn\u2019t asked you to. She doesn\u2019t even know who you are.\u201d</p><p>I feel a twinge of resentment. Suze doesn\u2019t have to remind me. It\u2019s not my fault I have the crappest husband in the world, who refuses to introduce me to his celebrity clients.</p> <p>\u201cShe will know who I am, as soon as Luke introduces us,\u201d I explain patiently. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll get chatting, and I\u2019ll have all these looks ready for her and become her personal stylist. Suze, I\u2019m building a whole new career!\u201d I can see Suze is about to raise another objection, so I carry on hurriedly. \u201cAnd anyway, I\u2019m going to get double the use out of these clothes, because you\u2019re going to wear them and I\u2019m going to take your picture and I\u2019m going to build up a portfolio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d Suze perks up. \u201cYou want me to be your model?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Suze starts looking at the clothes with more interest and reaches for the coat again. \u201cLet\u2019s start with this.\u201d She puts on the coat and I adjust the collar. Suze is so beautiful and willowy, she looks great in anything, and I feel a fizz of excitement at the thought of building up a library of amazing pictures.</p><p>I\u2019ve been totally inspired by reading about Nenita Dietz on the Internet. When she moved to Hollywood twenty years ago, she didn\u2019t know anyone. But she wangled her way onto the set of Love\u2019s Breezing, marched into the office of the head of wardrobe, and wouldn\u2019t leave until he\u2019d looked at her portfolio. He was so impressed, he employed her immediately. And then the star, Mary-Jane Cheney, hired her as a personal stylist, and it all snowballed from there.</p><p>Well, I can do that too. I just need to put together a portfolio and get on a film set somehow.</p> <p>Suze is now wearing the brocade coat, a beret, and a pair of sunglasses, and is posing in front of the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou look fab,\u201d I say. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll do your hair and makeup and we\u2019ll have a proper shoot.\u201d</p><p>Suze comes back to the bed and starts riffling through a bag of skirts. \u201cThese are nice too.\u201d She holds one up against herself and looks at the label. \u201cOh, they\u2019re by Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI phoned his office and they sent a whole bunch over,\u201d I explain. \u201cThey\u2019re from the new collection. You know, Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s assistant asked especially to see a sneak preview?\u201d I add. \u201cDanny told me himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, SJP!\u201d Suze\u2019s head pops up. \u201cIs she in L.A.? Have you met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, and Suze sighs.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you met anyone famous?\u201d</p><p>This is what everyone has been asking me since I got back. Mum, Dad, our neighbors Janice and Martin, everyone. I\u2019m tired of saying, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t met anyone famous.\u201d And the truth is, I did meet someone famous, didn\u2019t I? I mean, I know I promised to keep it a secret. But Suze is my best friend. Telling a best friend doesn\u2019t count.</p> <p>\u201cSuze,\u201d I say, lowering my voice. \u201cIf I tell you something, you can\u2019t tell a soul. Not Tarkie, not anyone. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she says, her eyes wide. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Lois Kellerton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois Kellerton?\u201d She sits straight up. \u201cOh my God! You never told me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now! But I didn\u2019t just meet her....\u201d</p><p>Suze is the best person to share stuff with. As I tell her about seeing Lois Kellerton shoplifting and about chasing her down the street, she gasps and puts her hand to her mouth and says, \u201cNo way,\u201d several times.</p><p>\u201c... and I promised not to tell anyone,\u201d I conclude.</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t blab,\u201d says Suze at once. \u201cAnyway, who would I tell? The children? The sheep? Tarkie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We both start giggling. Tarkie probably has no idea who Lois Kellerton is, even.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so weird,\u201d Suze adds, her brow creased in thought. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Why would a big movie star like that steal socks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told you everything yet,\u201d I say, and reach into my pocket. \u201cLook what arrived at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>I still can\u2019t believe this happened. It was on the last day of our trip, when I was having a small private word with the front desk about the minibar bill. (I didn\u2019t necessarily want Luke seeing how many Toblerones I\u2019d eaten.) The concierge caught sight of me and said, \u201cAh, Mrs. Brandon, this has just arrived for you.\u201d</p> <p>It was a smart white package, and inside was a small silver box engraved with three words: Thank you Becky. There was no note. But I instantly knew who it was from. She must have tracked me down. Or I guess her people did.</p><p>Now I hand it to Suze, who turns it over in her fingers wonderingly.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says at last. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is, like, a bribe.\u201d</p> <p>Bribe?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bribe!\u201d I say, stung.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Suze backtracks at once. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean \u2018bribe.\u2019 I meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thank-you,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cLook. It says, Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! That\u2019s what I meant. A thank-you.\u201d She nods several times, but now the word \u201cbribe\u201d is circling around my brain.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, what was she like?\u201d Suze demands. \u201cWhat did she look like? What did she say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust thin, really. Stressed-out-looking. I hardly spoke to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in good shape, you know,\u201d Suze says. \u201cApparently her latest movie is beset with problems. It\u2019s millions over budget and the buzz isn\u2019t good. She\u2019s taken on the role of producer for the first time, but she\u2019s bitten off more than she can chew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d Suze nods knowledgeably. \u201cInsiders on set claim the star\u2019s high-handed approach has made her enemies among the crew. No wonder she\u2019s stressed out.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Suze in astonishment. Has she memorized every single gossip magazine?</p><p>\u201cSuze, how do you know all this stuff? Have you been watching Camberly on cable again?\u201d I say severely.</p><p>Camberly is the hottest show in the States right now. Everyone is saying Camberly is the new Oprah, and her interviews get huge press every week, and they show them on E4 in England. Suze twisted her ankle a couple of weeks ago and she got totally addicted, especially to the gossip segment.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to do something while my best friend is in L.A.!\u201d says Suze, suddenly sounding disconsolate. \u201cIf I can\u2019t go there, at least I can watch interviews about it.\u201d She gives a gusty sigh. \u201cOh, Bex, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to be in Hollywood and meet movie stars all the time and I\u2019m stuck here. I\u2019m so envious!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnvious?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cHow can you be envious of me? You live in this place! It\u2019s fantastic!\u201d</p><p>Suze\u2019s husband, Tarquin, is even grander than Suze, and when his grandfather died, they inherited this monster house, Letherby Hall. It\u2019s seriously vast. They have guided tours and a ha-ha and everything. (To be honest, I\u2019m still not sure which bit is the ha-ha. Maybe one of the twiddly bits on the roof?)</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t sunny,\u201d objects Suze. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t any movie stars. And all we do is have endless meetings about repairing eighteenth-century moldings. I want to go to Hollywood. You know, I always wanted to be an actress. I played Juliet at drama school.\u201d She sighs again. \u201cI played Blanche DuBois. And now look at me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m always very tactful about Suze\u2019s \u201cdrama school.\u201d I mean, it wasn\u2019t exactly RADA. It was the kind where your father pays huge fees and you spend the spring term at the school skiing chalet in Switzerland and no one actually goes into acting, because they\u2019ve got a family business to inherit or something. But, still, I do feel for her. She is at a bit of a loose end, knocking around this massive house.</p><p>\u201cWell, come out!\u201d I say excitedly. \u201cGo on, Suze, come to L.A.! Have a little holiday. We\u2019d have such a laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ...\u201d Her face is torn a million ways. I can see exactly what she\u2019s thinking. (This is why she\u2019d make a brilliant actress, in fact.)</p><p>\u201cTarkie can come too,\u201d I say, to forestall her objections. \u201cAnd the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she says hesitantly. \u201cExcept we\u2019re supposed to be focusing on business expansion this year. You know we\u2019re starting weddings? And Tarkie wants to create a maze, and we\u2019re revamping the tea rooms....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can still have a holiday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She looks doubtful. \u201cYou know the pressure he feels.\u201d</p><p>I nod sympathetically. I do actually feel for old Tarkie. It\u2019s quite a burden, inheriting a stately home, with your whole family looking on beadily to see if you manage it properly. Apparently, every Lord Cleath-Stuart has added something special to Letherby Hall, through all the generations, like an east wing, or a chapel, or a topiary garden.</p><p>In fact, that\u2019s why we\u2019re all here today. Tarkie\u2019s launching his first major addition to the house. It\u2019s called The Surge, and it\u2019s a fountain. It\u2019s going to be the highest fountain in the whole county and will be a big tourist attraction. Apparently he had the idea when he was ten, drew it in his Latin book, and kept it ever since. And now he\u2019s built it!</p> <p>Hundreds of people are coming to watch it being switched on, and the local TV station has interviewed him, and everyone is saying this could be the making of Letherby Hall. Suze says she hasn\u2019t seen Tarkie this nervous since he competed in the junior national dressage when they were both children, that time when he mucked up his half pass (which is apparently bad) and his father, who lives for horses, nearly disowned him as a result. So let\u2019s hope things go better this time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work on Tarkie.\u201d Suze swings her legs off the bed. \u201cC\u2019mon, Bex. We\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>The only disadvantage of living in a house like this is it takes you about six hours just to get from the bedroom to the garden. We walk through the Long Gallery (lots of ancient portraits) and the East Hall (lots of ancient suits of armor) and cut across the massive Great Hall. There we pause and breathe in the musty, woody aroma. Suze can burn as many Diptyque candles as she likes, but this room will always smell of Old House.</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d says Suze, reading my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSpectacular.\u201d I sigh.</p> <p>We\u2019re talking about the birthday party that I threw for Luke, right here, what seems like no time ago. As if on cue, we both lift our eyes to the tiny first-floor balcony where Luke\u2019s mother, Elinor, stood, hidden, watching the proceedings. Luke never knew she was there, nor that she basically funded and helped to arrange the whole thing. She\u2019s sworn me to secrecy, which makes me want to scream with frustration. If only he knew that she paid for his party. If only he knew how much she\u2019d done for him.</p><p>To call Luke\u2019s relationship with his mother \u201clove\u2013hate\u201d would be an understatement. It\u2019s \u201cadore\u2013loathe.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cworship\u2013despise.\u201d At the moment we\u2019re on \u201cdespise,\u201d and nothing I can say will shift his opinion. Whereas I\u2019ve quite come round to her, even if she is the snootiest woman in the world.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen her?\u201d asks Suze.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot since then.\u201d</p><p>Suze looks troubled as she gazes around the room. \u201cWhat about if you just told him?\u201d she says suddenly.</p><p>I know Suze hates the secrecy as much as I do, because Luke has totally got the wrong end of the stick and thinks she and Tarkie paid for the party.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I promised. She\u2019s got this whole thing about not wanting to buy his love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrowing someone a party isn\u2019t buying their love,\u201d protests Suze. \u201cI think she\u2019s all wrong. I think he\u2019d be touched. It\u2019s so stupid!\u201d she says with vehemence. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste! Think of all the time you could spend together, and with Minnie too....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinnie misses her,\u201d I admit. \u201cShe keeps saying, \u2018Where Lady?\u2019 But if Luke even knew they\u2019d been seeing each other, he\u2019d flip out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamilies.\u201d Suze shakes her head. \u201cThey\u2019re just the end. Poor old Tarkie\u2019s in a total tizz about the fountain, just because his father\u2019s here. I said to him, \u2018If your dad can\u2019t say anything positive, he should have stayed in Scotland!\u2019 \u201d She sounds so fierce, I want to laugh. \u201cWe must hurry,\u201d she adds, glancing at her watch. \u201cThe countdown will have begun!\u201d</p><p>Suze\u2019s \u201cgarden\u201d is basically an enormous great park. There are huge lawns and acres of topiary and a famous rose garden and loads of special plants that I now can\u2019t remember. (I\u2019m definitely going on the proper tour one day.)</p><p>We head down from the big graveled terrace to find that crowds are already gathering on the lawn and setting up deck chairs among the trees. Music is playing from loudspeakers, waitresses are circling with glasses of wine, and a massive electronic countdown board reads 16:43. There\u2019s a rectangular lake directly in front of the house, and that\u2019s where The Surge is. I\u2019ve only seen an artist\u2019s impression of it, but it\u2019s really pretty. It shoots straight up about a zillion feet and then falls down in a graceful arc. Then it swings backward and forward, and at the end it shoots little droplets into the air. It\u2019s so clever, and there are going to be colored lights in the evenings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we get near, we find a cordoned-off area for VIP visitors, where my mum and dad have commandeered a prime position, along with our neighbors Janice and Martin.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d exclaims Mum. \u201cJust in time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! We\u2019ve missed you!\u201d Janice gives me a hug. \u201cHow was L.A.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally, love?\u201d Janice clicks her tongue disbelievingly, as though I\u2019m putting a brave face on some personal tragedy. \u201cBut the people. All those plastic faces and whale pouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean trout pouts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd drugs,\u201d puts in Martin ponderously.</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be careful, Becky,\u201d he adds. \u201cDon\u2019t let them suck you into their way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnhappiest city on the planet,\u201d agrees Janice. \u201cIt said so in the paper.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re both staring at me mournfully, as though I\u2019m about to be carted off to a penal colony on Mars.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant city,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019ll see Jess,\u201d says Janice, as though this is the only possible ray of light. \u201cHow far\u2019s Chile from L.A.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ...\u201d I try to sound knowledgeable. \u201cNot far. Same general area.\u201d</p><p>My half sister, Jess, is married to Janice and Martin\u2019s son, Tom, and they\u2019re out in Chile, where they\u2019re planning to adopt a little boy. Poor Janice is trying to wait patiently, but apparently it could be a year before they come back.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to them, love,\u201d Dad chimes in cheerfully. \u201cL.A. is a fine city. I still remember the glint of the Cadillacs. The surf on the sand. And the ice-cream sundaes. Look out for those, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod patiently. \u201cIce-cream sundaes.\u201d</p><p>Dad spent a summer driving around California before he got married, so his version of L.A. is basically from 1972. There\u2019s no point saying, No one eats ice-cream sundaes anymore; it\u2019s all about flavored fro-yo.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, Becky,\u201d Dad adds, \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of favors to ask you.\u201d He draws me to one side, away from the others, and I look up at him curiously.</p><p>Dad\u2019s aged a bit recently. His face is craggier and there are little white hairs tufting out of his neck\u2014although he can still vault over a gate quite athletically. I know this because he was showing off to Minnie earlier today in one of Suze\u2019s fields, while Mum cried out, \u201cGraham, stop! You\u2019ll do yourself an injury! You\u2019ll break a metatarsal!\u201d (Mum has recently found a new daytime TV show, Doctor\u2019s Surgery Live, which means that she now thinks she\u2019s an expert on all things medical and keeps dropping words like \u201cplatelets\u201d and \u201clipoproteins\u201d into the conversation, even when we\u2019re just talking about what to have for supper.)</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the first thing is this.\u201d He takes from his breast pocket a small paper bag and pulls out an ancient autograph book with a picture of a Cadillac on the front and California in white swirly writing. \u201cRemember this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p> <p>Dad\u2019s autograph book is a family tradition. It gets pulled out every Christmas, and we all politely listen as he tells us about all the signatures. They\u2019re mostly autographs of obscure TV stars from American shows that no one\u2019s ever heard of, but Dad thinks they\u2019re famous, so that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>\u201cRonald \u2018Rocky\u2019 Webster,\u201d he\u2019s saying now, turning the pages fondly. \u201cHe was a big star then. And Maria Pojes. You should have heard her sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod politely, even though I\u2019ve heard these names a million times and they still mean nothing to me.</p><p>\u201cIt was my friend Corey who spotted Maria Pojes drinking in a hotel bar,\u201d Dad\u2019s saying. \u201cOur first night in L.A. He dragged me over, offered to buy her a drink....\u201d He laughs reminiscently. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t accept it, of course. But she was sweet to us. Signed our books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I nod again. \u201cFantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so ...\u201d To my surprise, Dad presses the open autograph book into my hand. \u201cOver to you, Becky. Fill her up with some new blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cDad, I can\u2019t take this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf the book\u2019s empty.\u201d He points at the blank pages. \u201cYou\u2019re off to Hollywood. Finish the collection.\u201d</p><p>I look at it nervously. \u201cBut what if I lose it or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t lose it. But you\u2019ll have adventures.\u201d Dad\u2019s face flickers oddly. \u201cOh, Becky, love, I am envious. I\u2019ve never known anything like those adventures I had in California.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike the rodeo?\u201d I say. I\u2019ve heard that story a zillion times.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d He nods. \u201cAnd ... other things.\u201d He pats my hand, twinkling. \u201cGet me John Travolta\u2019s signature. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other favor?\u201d I say, putting the autograph book carefully into my bag.</p><p>\u201cJust a small thing.\u201d He reaches into his pocket and produces a slip of paper. \u201cLook up my old friend Brent. He always lived in Los Angeles. This is his old address. See if you can track him down. Say hello from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d I look at the name: Brent Lewis. There\u2019s an address in Sherman Oaks and a phone number. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call him up?\u201d I suggest. \u201cOr text him? Or Skype! It\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>As I say the word \u201cSkype,\u201d I can see Dad recoiling. We once tried to Skype Jess in Chile, and it wasn\u2019t exactly a resounding success. The picture kept freezing, so we gave up. But then the sound suddenly came back on and we could hear Jess and Tom having a row about Janice while they made their supper. It was all a bit embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cNo, you go and say hello,\u201d says Dad. \u201cIf he wants to, we can take it from there. Like I say, it\u2019s been a long time. He may not be interested.\u201d</p><p>I really don\u2019t get the older generation. They\u2019re so reticent. If it were me getting in touch with my old friend from all those years ago, I\u2019d be sending them a text instantly: Hi! Wow, it\u2019s been decades! How did THAT happen? Or I\u2019d track them down on Facebook. But Dad and Mum just aren\u2019t into it.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, and put the piece of paper into my bag too. \u201cWhat about your other two friends?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCorey and Raymond?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThey live too far away. Las Vegas, Corey is. I think Raymond\u2019s in Arizona somewhere. I\u2019ve stayed in touch with them ... at least, I have in a way. But Brent just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame you didn\u2019t have Facebook back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you so much! They\u2019re a new present from my husband.\u201d Mum\u2019s voice rises above the hubbub, and I turn to look. Some lady I don\u2019t recognize is admiring her pearls, and Mum is preening in delight. \u201cYes, lovely, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>I grin at Dad, who winks back. Mum was so thrilled with her pearls. They\u2019re antique, from 1895, with a ruby clasp set in diamonds. (I helped her go shopping for them, so I know all the details.) Dad\u2019s BB was bigger than usual this year, so we all went a bit mad.</p><p>BB is our family shorthand for \u201cBig Bonus.\u201d Dad worked in insurance for years, and now he\u2019s retired. But he still does consulting work, and it\u2019s amazingly well paid. He goes off a few times a year in a suit, and then once a year he receives a bonus check and we always get a treat. This year it was particularly good, because Mum got her pearls, and he bought me an Alexis Bittar necklace and Minnie a new dollhouse. Even Luke got a beautiful pair of cuff links.</p> <p>Luke always says to me that Dad must have some sort of niche specialist knowledge that is really valuable, because he commands such high fees. But he\u2019s so modest about it. You\u2019d never know.</p><p>\u201cMy clever husband.\u201d Mum kisses Dad fondly.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, my love!\u201d Dad beams back. Dad bought himself a new tweed jacket with his share of the BB, and he looks really good in it. \u201cNow, where\u2019s this famous fountain?\u201d</p><p>A few feet away, Tarquin is being interviewed for the TV. Poor Tarkie. He\u2019s not cut out to be a media star. He\u2019s wearing a checked shirt that makes his neck look bonier than ever, and he keeps wringing his hands as he speaks.</p><p>\u201cAhm,\u201d he keeps saying. \u201cAhm, we wanted to ... ahm ... enhance the house....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody stupid idea,\u201d comes a gruff voice behind me.</p><p>Oh God, it\u2019s Tarkie\u2019s dad, the Earl of Whatsit, stalking up. (I can never remember where he\u2019s earl of. Somewhere Scottish, I think.) He\u2019s tall and lanky with thin, graying hair and an Aran jersey, just like Tarkie wears. I\u2019ve never spoken to him properly, but he\u2019s always seemed pretty scary. Now he\u2019s glowering at the lake and jabbing a weather-beaten finger at it. \u201cI said to the boy, that view\u2019s been unspoiled for three hundred years. Why on earth would you want to go messing with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to do fireworks on the lake in winter,\u201d I say, wanting to stand up for Tarkie. \u201cI think it will be beautiful!\u201d</p> <p>The earl gives me a withering look and turns his attention to a plate of canap\u00e9s being offered to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSushi, sir,\u201d says the waitress.</p><p>\u201cSushi?\u201d He peers at her with bloodshot eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRice and raw salmon, sir. Japanese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody stupid idea.\u201d</p> <p>To my relief he stalks off again, and I\u2019m about to take a piece of sushi myself, when I hear a familiar earsplitting noise.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Pleeeease!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. It\u2019s Minnie.</p><p>For a long time, my daughter\u2019s favorite word was \u201cmine.\u201d Now, after intensive training, we\u2019ve got her on to the word \u201cplease.\u201d Which you\u2019d think would be an improvement.</p><p>I swivel around wildly and finally spot Minnie. She\u2019s balanced on a stone bench, tussling with Suze\u2019s son Wilfrid over a red plastic truck.</p> <p>\u201cPleeease!\u201d she\u2019s yelling crossly. \u201cPleeease!\u201d Now, to my horror, she starts hitting Wilfrid with the truck, yelling with each blow: \u201cPlease! Please! Please!\u201d</p><p>The trouble is, Minnie hasn\u2019t really absorbed the spirit of the word \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinnie!\u201d I exclaim in horror, and run toward her across the lawn. \u201cGive the truck to Wilfie.\u201d Luke is coming toward her, too, and we exchange wry looks.</p><p>\u201cPlease truck! Pleeease!\u201d she cries, clutching it harder. A few people gathered around start to laugh, and Minnie beams at them. She is such a show-off, but she\u2019s so adorable with it, it\u2019s hard to stay cross.</p><p>\u201cHey, Becky,\u201d says a cheerful voice behind me, and I turn to see Ellie, who is Suze\u2019s nanny and absolutely brilliant. (There\u2019s also Nanny, who looked after Tarkie when he was little and has never left. But she just potters around and tells people to wear undershirts.) \u201cI\u2019m taking the other children to watch from the steps there.\u201d She points at a bank on the other side of the lake. \u201cThey\u2019ll get a better view. Does Minnie want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I say gratefully. \u201cMinnie, if you want to go to the steps with the others, you have to give the truck to Wilfie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSteps?\u201d Minnie pauses at this new word.</p><p>\u201cYes! Steps! Exciting steps.\u201d I grab the truck from her and give it back to Wilfie. \u201cGo with Ellie, sweetheart. Hey, Tarquin!\u201d I call, as I see him hurrying by. \u201cThis all looks spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tarquin seems a bit desperate. \u201cWell, I hope so. There\u2019s a water-pressure problem. Whole area\u2019s affected. Terrible timing for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn it up,\u201d Tarkie says feverishly into his walkie-talkie. \u201cWhatever it takes! We don\u2019t want a feeble little gush, we want a spectacle!\u201d He looks up at us and grimaces. \u201cFountains are trickier blighters than I realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be great,\u201d Luke says reassuringly. \u201cIt\u2019s a marvelous idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope so.\u201d Tarkie wipes his face, then checks the countdown clock, which reads 4:58. \u201cCrikey. I must go.\u201d</p><p>The crowd is getting bigger and there are now two local TV news crews interviewing people. Luke takes a couple of glasses of wine and hands me one, and we clink glasses. As we near the cordoned-off VIP area, I can see Suze talking animatedly to Tarquin\u2019s business manager, Angus.</p> <p>\u201cTarkie must surely have business interests in the States,\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cI\u2019m certain he needs to do a trip out there. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary, Lady Cleath-Stuart,\u201d Angus says, looking surprised. \u201cAll the U.S. investments are taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have any investments in California?\u201d persists Suze. \u201cLike an orange grove or something? Because I think we should visit them. I\u2019ll go, if you like.\u201d She looks over at me and winks, and I beam back. Go, Suze!</p><p>The earl and countess are making their way to the front of the crowd now, forging a path with their shooting sticks and staring critically at the lake.</p><p>\u201cIf he wanted to build something,\u201d the earl is saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with a folly? Tuck it away somewhere. But a fountain? Bloody stupid idea.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him angrily. How dare they come along and be so critical?</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cI believe this fountain will be a major landmark in the country for centuries to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do, do you?\u201d He fixes his baleful gaze on me, and I lift my chin. I\u2019m not afraid of some old earl.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cToday will be unforgettable. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty! Fifty-nine!\u201d the loudspeaker guy starts chanting, and I feel a rush of excitement. At last! Tarkie\u2019s fountain! I clutch Suze\u2019s hand and she beams back excitedly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwenty-three ... twenty-two ...\u201d The whole crowd is chanting by now.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tarkie?\u201d I say over the noise. \u201cHe should be here to enjoy it!\u201d</p><p>Suze shrugs. \u201cMust be with the technical guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive ... four ... three ... two ... one ... ladies and gentlemen ... The Surge!\u201d</p> <p>A roar of cheers breaks out as the fountain spurts up from the middle of the lake and hits the height of ...</p><p>Oh. OK. Well, it\u2019s about five feet. It\u2019s not that high for a fountain called The Surge. But maybe it\u2019ll go higher?</p><p>Sure enough, it slowly rises up to about twelve feet, and there\u2019s a renewed cheering from the crowd.

What did I tell you, Marjorie?\u201d</p><p>Now there\u2019s as much laughing in the crowd as there is cheering.

It\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s fantastic! It\u2019s\u2014ahh!\u201d I break off with a strangled yell.</p><p>Something\u2019s gone wrong. I don\u2019t know what. But this isn\u2019t right.</p><p>A mass of water is falling at speed toward us, like a water cannon. We stare, transfixed\u2014then it splats all over three people behind me, and they start screaming. A moment later, the fountain fires another water bomb into the air, and we all start holding our hands above our heads. Another moment later and there\u2019s another splat, and two more people are drenched.</p><p>\u201cMinnie!\u201d I call anxiously, waving my arms. \u201cGet away!\u201d But Ellie is already shepherding the children back up the steps.</p><p>\u201cWomen and children to safety!\u201d the earl is thundering. \u201cAbandon ship!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s mayhem. People are running in all directions, trying to dodge the falling water. I manage to get up the slippery bank, then suddenly see Tarkie, standing apart from the crowd, his shirt soaked.</p><p>\u201cOff! Off!\u201d he\u2019s shouting into his walkie-talkie. \u201cTurn everything off!\u201d</p> <p>Poor Tarkie. He looks stricken. He looks like he might cry. I\u2019m about to go and give him a hug when Suze comes running up, her eyes glowing with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cTarkie, never mind.\u201d She throws her arms around him. \u201cAll the best inventions have glitches at first.\u201d</p><p>Tarkie doesn\u2019t reply. He looks too devastated to speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d Suze tries again. \u201cIt\u2019s just one fountain. And the idea is still brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant? Catastrophe, more like.\u201d The earl is stepping forward over the puddles. \u201cWaste of time and money. How much did this fiasco cost, Tarquin?\u201d He\u2019s jabbing with his shooting stick as he talks. I feel like jabbing him. \u201cThought your fountain was supposed to entertain the troops, not drown the troops!\u201d He gives a short, sarcastic laugh, but no one else joins in. \u201cAnd now that you\u2019ve bankrupted the place and made us a laughingstock, maybe you\u2019d like to take a few lessons in running a historic house properly? What?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Tarquin and flinch. He\u2019s turned puce with humiliation, and his hands are nervously rubbing against each other. My chest starts heaving with indignation. His father is awful. He\u2019s a bully. In fact, I\u2019m drawing breath to tell him so when a voice chimes in.</p><p>\u201cNow, now.\u201d My head jerks up in surprise: It\u2019s Dad, pushing his way through the throng, wiping his dripping forehead. \u201cLeave the boy alone. All great projects have stumbling blocks along the way. Bill Gates\u2019s first company failed completely, and look where he is now!\u201d Dad has reached Tarquin and pats him kindly on the arm. \u201cYou had a technical hitch. It\u2019s not the end of the world. And I think we can all see, this is going to be a fine sight when the details are perfected. Well done to Tarquin and all the Surge team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With deliberate resolve, Dad starts to applaud, and after a few seconds, the crowd joins in. There are even a few \u201cwoohoos!\u201d</p><p>Tarquin is gazing at Dad with something close to adoration. The earl has retreated, looking all cross and left out, which is no surprise, as everyone is totally ignoring him. On impulse, I hurry forward and give Dad a hug, nearly spilling my wine as I do so.</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019re a star,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd, Tarkie, listen, the fountain\u2019s going to be amazing. It\u2019s just teething troubles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d echoes Suze. \u201cIt\u2019s just teething troubles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind.\u201d Tarquin gives a heavy sigh. He still looks fairly suicidal, and I exchange anxious looks with Suze. Poor Tarkie. He\u2019s worked so hard for months. He\u2019s lived and breathed his precious fountain. And whatever Dad says, this is a huge humiliation. I can see both TV crews still filming, and I just know this is going to be the comedy \u201cAnd Finally\u201d piece on the news.</p><p>\u201cDarling, I think we need a break,\u201d Suze says at last. \u201cClear our minds and have a rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA break?\u201d Tarquin looks uncertain. \u201cWhat sort of break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA holiday! Some time away from Letherby Hall, the fountain, all the family pressure ...\u201d Suze flashes a mutinous glare at the earl. \u201cAngus says we need to make a trip to L.A., to check on our investments.

The pictures of him doing bench presses in the blue tight shorts are to DIE for.... )</p><p>I\u2019ll keep you up to date with my journey. Next stop Greenland!!! Love you all.</p> <p>Danny xxx</p><p>It\u2019s two weeks later. And I live in Hollywood. I, Becky Brandon, n\u00e9e Bloomwood, live in Hollywood. I live in Hollywood! I keep saying it out loud to myself, to see if it feels any more real. But it still feels like I\u2019m saying, I live in fairyland.</p><p>The house we\u2019re renting in the Hollywood Hills is made mostly of glass and has so many bathrooms, I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re supposed to do with all of them. And there\u2019s a walk-in wardrobe and an outdoor kitchen. And a pool! And a pool guy! (He comes with the house and he\u2019s fifty-three with a paunch, sadly.)</p><p>The most amazing thing is the view. Every night we sit on our balcony and look at all the twinkling lights of Hollywood, and I feel as if we\u2019re in a dream. It\u2019s a weird place, L.A. I can\u2019t quite get a grip on it. It\u2019s not like European cities, where you get to the center and think, Ah yes, here I am in Milan/?Amsterdam/?Rome. In L.A., you drive around endless great big roads and you peer out of the windows and think, Are we there yet?</p><p>Also, the neighbors are not very neighborly. You don\u2019t see anyone. People don\u2019t peep over their fences and chat. They just drive in and out of their electronic gates, and by the time you\u2019ve chased after them, shouting, Hi! My name\u2019s Becky! D\u2019you want a cup of ... they\u2019ve gone.</p><p>We have met one neighbor, who\u2019s a plastic surgeon called Eli. He seemed very friendly, and we had a nice chat about rental prices and how he specializes in \u201cmicro-lifts.\u201d But all the while, he was eyeing me up with this critical stare. I\u2019m sure he was working out what he\u2019d do to me if he had me on the operating table. And apart from him, I haven\u2019t met anyone else in the street yet.</p><p>Anyway. Never mind. I will meet people. Of course I will.</p><p>I step into a pair of raffia wedges, toss my hair back, and survey my reflection in our massive hall mirror. It rests on top of a huge carved chest, and there are two monster armchairs opposite on the Mexican tiled floor. Everything in this house is massive: the squashy L-shaped sofa in the living room, which seats about ten; the four-poster bed in the master bedroom, which Luke and I practically get lost in; the vast, separate kitchen with its three ovens and vaulted brick ceiling. Even all the doors are huge, studded Mediterranean-looking affairs, made of reclaimed wood and with working locks. (I\u2019ve removed all the keys, though they\u2019re picturesque. Minnie and keys really don\u2019t mix.) It is a gorgeous house, I have to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But today my priority is not the house; it\u2019s my outfit. I focus on it intently, searching for flaws. I haven\u2019t felt so jittery about my look for ages. OK, let\u2019s do a rundown. Top: Alice &amp; Olivia. Jeans: J Brand. Tasseled bag: Danny Kovitz. Cool hair-slidey thing: found at vintage market. I try a few poses, walking back and forth. I think I look good, but do I look good for L.A.? I reach for a pair of Oakleys and try them on. Then I try a pair of oversize Tom Ford sunglasses instead. Hmm. Not sure. Fabulous statement ... or too much?</p><p>My stomach is swooping with nerves, and the reason is, today is a huge day: I\u2019m taking Minnie to her preschool. It\u2019s called the Little Leaf Preschool, and we\u2019re very lucky to have got a place there. Apparently several celebrity kids go there, so I\u2019m definitely volunteering for the PTA. Imagine if I got in with the in crowd. Imagine if I got to organize the school fete with Courteney Cox or someone! I mean, it\u2019s possible, isn\u2019t it? And then she\u2019d introduce me to all the Friends cast ... maybe we\u2019d go out on a boat or something amazing....</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke\u2019s voice breaks into my thoughts, and he comes striding into the hall. \u201cI was just looking under the bed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d I interrupt him urgently. \u201cWhich sunglasses shall I wear?\u201d</p> <p>Luke looks blank as I demonstrate first the Oakleys, then the Tom Fords, and then a pair of tortoiseshell Topshop ones, which are totally fab and only cost \u00a315, so I bought three pairs.</p><p>\u201cIt hardly matters,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just the school run.\u201d</p><p>I blink at him in astonishment. Just the school run? Just the school run? Doesn\u2019t he read Us Weekly? Everyone knows the school run is the thing! It\u2019s where the paparazzi snap celebrities acting like normal parents. It\u2019s where people rock their casual looks. Even in London, all the mothers look one another up and down and dandle their bags on their arms in a showy-offy way. So how much more pressured will it be in L.A., where they all have perfect teeth and abs and half of them are genuine celebs?</p><p>I\u2019m going for the Oakleys, I decide, and slide them on. Minnie comes running into the hall, and I take her hand to survey our reflection in the mirror. She\u2019s in a cute little yellow sundress and white sunglasses, and her ponytail is held back with an adorable bumblebee. I think we\u2019ll pass. We look like an L.A. mother and daughter.</p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d I say to Minnie. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have such a lovely time at preschool! You\u2019ll play games and maybe make lovely cupcakes with sprinkles on....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Luke tries again. \u201cI was just looking under the bed and I found this.\u201d He holds up a garment carrier. \u201cIs it yours? What\u2019s it doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I adjust Minnie\u2019s ponytail, playing for time. Damn. Why is he looking under the bed? He\u2019s a busy L.A. mover and shaker. How does he have time to look under beds?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Sage,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cFor Sage? You\u2019ve bought Sage a full-length fake-fur coat?\u201d He stares at me in astonishment.</p><p>Honestly, he hasn\u2019t even looked at it properly. It\u2019s not full length; it\u2019s to mid-thigh.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll suit her,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019ll go with her hair color. It\u2019s a really different look for her.\u201d</p><p>Luke appears absolutely baffled. \u201cBut why are you buying her clothes? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her yet,\u201d I correct him. \u201cBut you are going to introduce us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo! You know I want to get into styling, and Sage would be a perfect client. So I\u2019ve been putting some looks together for her. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Luke\u2019s face changes. \u201cThere were some other bags under the bed too. Don\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>I curse myself silently. I should never, ever put anything under the bed.</p><p>\u201cIs that all shopping for Sage?\u201d</p> <p>He looks so aghast, I feel defensive. First Suze, now Luke. Don\u2019t they understand anything about setting up a business? Don\u2019t they understand that to be a clothes stylist you need clothes? They wouldn\u2019t expect me to be a tennis player and not have a tennis racket.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018shopping\u2019! It\u2019s essential business expenses. It\u2019s like you buying paper clips. Or photocopiers. Anyway, I\u2019ve used all those clothes for my portfolio too,\u201d I add robustly. \u201cI took some brilliant pictures of Suze. So, actually, I\u2019ve saved money.\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t seem convinced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow much have you spent?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should talk about money in front of Minnie,\u201d I say primly, and take her hand.</p><p>\u201cBecky ...\u201d Luke gives me a long, sort of sighing look. His mouth is tucked in at one side and his eyebrows are in a \u201cV\u201d shape. This is another of Luke\u2019s expressions I\u2019m familiar with. It means: How am I going to break this to Becky without her overreacting?</p><p>(Which is very unfair, because I never overreact.)</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t answer straightaway. He walks over to one of the monster armchairs and fiddles with a striped Mexican throw. You might almost say that he\u2019s putting the armchair between himself and me.</p><p>\u201cBecky, don\u2019t get offended.\u201d</p><p>OK, this is a rubbish way to start any conversation. I\u2019m already offended that he thinks I\u2019m someone who could get offended. And anyway, why would I be offended? What\u2019s he going to say?</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been hearing some really good stuff about a place called ...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cGolden Peace. Have you heard of it?\u201d</p><p>Have I heard of it? Anyone who\u2019s ever read People magazine has heard of Golden Peace. It\u2019s the place where they wear bracelets and do yoga and where celebrities dry out and then pretend they were just a little tired.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have. The rehab place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only rehab,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThey do a lot of programs and deal with all kinds of ... disorders. The guy I was talking to has a girlfriend who was a terrible hoarder. It was ruining her life. She went to Golden Peace and they really sorted out her issues. And I wondered if somewhere like that could be helpful. For you.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a moment to realize what he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cMe? But I\u2019m not a hoarder. Or an alcoholic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but you do ...\u201d He rubs his nose. \u201cYou have had a history of spending issues, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>I inhale sharply. That\u2019s below the belt. Waaay below the belt. So I\u2019ve had a few minor problems in my time. So I\u2019ve had a couple of teeny financial blips. If I were an FTSE company, you\u2019d call them \u201ccorrections\u201d and just shove them at the back of the annual report and forget about them. Not drag them up at every opportunity. Not suggest rehab.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, I\u2019m an addict now? Thanks a lot, Luke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making these accusations in front of our child.\u201d I clasp Minnie to me dramatically. \u201cWhat, you think I\u2019m an unfit mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Luke rubs his head. \u201cIt was just an idea. Nanny Sue suggested the same, remember?\u201d</p><p>I glare at him balefully. I don\u2019t want to be reminded of Nanny Sue. I\u2019m never hiring a so-called \u201cexpert\u201d again. Her brief was to help us with Minnie\u2019s behavior, and what did she do? Turn the spotlight on me. Start talking about my behavior, as if that\u2019s got anything to do with anything.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Golden Peace is an American place.\u201d I suddenly think of a winning argument. \u201cI\u2019m British. So.\u201d</p> <p>Luke looks perplexed. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cIf I had issues, which I don\u2019t, they\u2019d be British issues. Totally different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant Grana,\u201d chimes in Minnie. \u201cWant Grana make cupcakes. Please. Pleeeease.\u201d</p><p>Both Luke and I stop mid-flow and turn in surprise. Minnie has sunk down crosslegged onto the floor and looks up, her bottom lip trembling. \u201cWant Grana make cupcakes,\u201d she insists, and a tear balances on her lashes.</p><p>\u201cGrana\u201d is what Minnie calls my mum. Oh God, she\u2019s homesick.</p><p>\u201cDarling!\u201d I put my arms round Minnie and hug her tight. \u201cSweetheart, lovely girl. We all want to see Grana, and we\u2019ll see her very soon, but right now we\u2019re in a different place and we\u2019re going to make lots of new friends. Lots of new friends,\u201d I repeat, almost to convince myself.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s this come from?\u201d murmurs Luke above Minnie\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI suppose because I mentioned making cupcakes with sprinkles, and she often makes cupcakes with Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinnie, my love.\u201d Luke comes down onto the floor, too, and sits Minnie on his knee. \u201cLet\u2019s look at Grana and say hello, shall we?\u201d He\u2019s taken my phone from off the carved chest and summons up my photos. \u201cLet\u2019s see ... there she is! Grana and Grandpa!\u201d He shows Minnie a picture of Mum and Dad dressed up for a flamenco night at their bridge club. \u201cAnd there\u2019s Wilfie ...\u201d He scrolls to another picture. \u201cAnd Auntie Suze ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the sight of Suze\u2019s cheerful face beaming out of my phone, I feel a tiny pang myself. The truth is, although I keep denying it to Luke, I am feeling a bit lonely here in L.A. Everyone feels so far away, there aren\u2019t any neighbors to speak of, and I don\u2019t have a job....</p><p>\u201cSay, Hello, Grana!\u201d Luke is cajoling Minnie, and after a moment she gives a little wave at the phone, her tears gone. \u201cAnd you know what, darling? It may seem a bit scary here to begin with. But soon we\u2019ll know lots of people in Los Angeles.\u201d He taps the screen. \u201cSoon this phone will be full of pictures of all our new friends. It\u2019s always hard at first, but we\u2019ll settle in, I\u2019m sure we will.\u201d</p><p>Is he talking to Minnie or me?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go.\u201d I smile gratefully at him. \u201cMinnie has toys to play with and I have new friends to make.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAttagirls.\u201d He hugs Minnie, then stands up to kiss me. \u201cYou knock \u2019em dead.\u201d</p><p>Minnie\u2019s preschool is somewhere off Franklin Avenue, and although I\u2019ve driven there before, I arrive a bit flustered. God, driving in L.A. is stressy. I haven\u2019t got used to our rental car yet, at all. The controls seem to be in weird places, and I keep hooting the horn by mistake. And as for driving on the right-hand side, well, that\u2019s just wrong. It\u2019s unnatural. Plus, the roads in L.A. are far too big. They have too many lanes. London is far cozier. You know where you are.</p><p>At last I manage to park the car, which is a Chrysler and also far too big. Why couldn\u2019t we have rented a Mini? I exhale, my heart still thumping, and turn to face Minnie, strapped into her car seat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here! Preschool time! Are you excited, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot American driver,\u201d replies Minnie equably.</p> <p>I stare at her, aghast. Where did she get that from? I did not say that. Did I?</p><p>\u201cMinnie, don\u2019t say that! That\u2019s not a nice word. Mummy didn\u2019t mean to say it. Mummy meant to say ... lovely American cars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d says Minnie, ignoring me. \u201cIdiot American driver, Idiot American driver ...\u201d She\u2019s singing it to the tune of \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\u201d \u201cIdiot American dri-ver ...\u201d</p><p>I cannot arrive on our first day at L.A. preschool with Minnie singing \u201cIdiot American Driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot American dri-ver ...\u201d She\u2019s getting louder and louder. \u201cIdiot American driiiiii-ver ...\u201d</p><p>Could I pretend it\u2019s a quaint old British nursery rhyme?</p> <p>No.</p><p>But I can\u2019t sit here all day either. Other mothers with small children are getting out of their massive SUVs, all along the street. And we were supposed to arrive early today.</p><p>\u201cMinnie, while we\u2019re walking to preschool, you can have a biscuit!\u201d I say, raising my voice. \u201cBut we have to be very, very quiet, like mice. No singing,\u201d I add for emphasis.</p><p>Minnie stops singing and eyes me suspiciously. \u201cBiscuit?\u201d</p><p>Result. Phew.</p><p>(And, OK, I know it\u2019s bad to bribe your children, so I\u2019ll just feed her some extra green beans later, which will cancel it out.)</p><p>Hastily, I jump out of the car and unstrap her. I hand her a chocolate chip cookie from my emergency stash and we start walking along the pavement.</p><p>I mean sidewalk. I must get used to that.</p> <p>As we near the preschool, I\u2019m looking all around for paparazzi, but I can\u2019t see any. But, then, they\u2019re probably all hiding in bushes. There are a few mothers leading small children in through the gates, and I subtly scan their faces as we walk in with them.</p><p>Hmm. I don\u2019t think any of them are celebs, although they\u2019re all toned and tanned, with shiny hair. Most of them are in workout gear, and I make a mental note to wear that tomorrow. I so want to fit in. I want Minnie to fit in and for both of us to make lots of friends.</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d</p><p>Erica is greeting us, and I smile in relief to see a familiar face. Erica is about fifty, with straight red hair and very colorful clothes, like a character from a children\u2019s film. She\u2019s leader of the toddler program and has already sent me lots of emails about \u201ctransition\u201d and \u201cseparation\u201d and the \u201cjoy of learning and self-discovery,\u201d which I think means dressing up, only I don\u2019t quite dare ask.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to your first day at Little Leaf, Minnie!\u201d she adds, and escorts us into the Toddlers\u2019 Learning Center, which is basically a room full of toys, like any playgroup in England, only here they call them \u201cdevelopmental aids.\u201d \u201cDid you manage to park all right?\u201d she adds, as she hangs Minnie\u2019s water bottle on her peg. \u201cI know some folks have had issues this morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, we were fine, thanks,\u201d I say. \u201cNo problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the brake?\u201d says Minnie suddenly, and beams at Erica. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bloody brake in this bloody stupid car?\u201d</p><p>My face flushes bright red. \u201cMinnie!\u201d I say sharply. \u201cStop that! Where on earth did you\u2014 Gosh, I\u2019ve got no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot American dri-vers,\u201d Minnie starts singing to \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle\u201d again. \u201cIdiot American dri-vers ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMinnie!\u201d I practically yell. \u201cStop! No singing!\u201d</p><p>I want to die. I can see Erica hiding a smile, and a couple of assistants are looking over. Great.</p><p>\u201cMinnie\u2019s obviously a very receptive child,\u201d says Erica politely.</p><p>Yes. Far too bloody receptive. I am never saying anything in front of Minnie, ever again.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I try to regain my cool. \u201cGosh, what a lovely sandpit. Go on, Minnie! Play with the sand!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, as I explained to you, we at Little Leaf follow a transitional separation program,\u201d says Erica, watching as Minnie plunges her hands joyfully into the sandpit. \u201cThis is the start of Minnie\u2019s great journey of independence as a human in this world. These are her first steps away from you. They need to be at her own pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I\u2019m slightly mesmerized by Erica. She sounds like she\u2019s describing an epic trip round the world, not just a toddler going to playgroup.</p><p>\u201cSo I ask you, Rebecca, to stay by Minnie\u2019s side this first morning. Shadow her. Reassure her. Identify the exciting new discoveries she\u2019s making; see the world at her level. Minnie will be wary to begin with. Introduce her gradually to the concept of life away from Mommy. Watch her slowly blossom. You\u2019ll be amazed by her progress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Fantastic.\u201d I nod earnestly.</p><p>I can see another mother nearby, sitting with her blond curly-headed boy. The mother is pin-thin and dressed in several layers of T-shirts (I happen to know that each one of those T-shirts costs a hundred dollars, something that Mum would never understand in a million years), and she\u2019s watching intently as the little boy daubs paint on a sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cInteresting colors, Isaac,\u201d she\u2019s saying seriously. \u201cI like the world you\u2019ve made.\u201d As he smears paint on his face, she doesn\u2019t flicker. \u201cYou\u2019re expressing yourself on your own body,\u201d she says. \u201cYou made that choice, Isaac. We can make choices.\u201d</p> <p>Blimey. They do take everything seriously here. But if I\u2019m going to fit in, I\u2019ll have to be like that too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be around if you need me.\u201d Erica smiles. \u201cEnjoy this first morning of simultaneous discovery!\u201d</p><p>As she heads over to another child, I turn my phone off. I\u2019m feeling quite inspired by Erica. I\u2019m going to be totally focused on Minnie and her morning.</p><p>OK. Here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s all very well, Erica saying, \u201cStay with Minnie.\u201d I honestly want to. I want to be like a mother dolphin and its young, gliding along together in a beautiful duo, simultaneously discovering the world.</p><p>But the thing about mother dolphins is, they don\u2019t have Legos to trip over, or playhouses to get in their way, or toddlers who can\u2019t make up their mind which direction to go in. It took about three seconds for Minnie to get bored with the sandpit and rush outside to the yard to play on a trike. I\u2019d just about got outside, stumbling over a box of blocks, when she changed her mind, dashed back in, and grabbed a dolly. Then she ran outside to hurl the dolly down the slide. She\u2019s been in and out about ten times. I\u2019m puffed out, just keeping up with her.</p><p>All the time, I\u2019ve tried to keep up a stream of encouraging, reassuring chatter, but Minnie could not be less interested. All her anxiety from this morning seems to have disappeared, and when I tried to hug her tight just now, she wriggled away, exclaiming, \u201cNo hug, Mummy! Toys!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re discovering ... er ... gravity!\u201d I say, as she drops a toy bear on the floor. \u201cBrilliant, darling! Now are you going to express yourself through water?\u201d Minnie has headed over to the water tray and is swishing it around with abandon. \u201cYou\u2019ve made the choice to splash yourself ... Argh!\u201d I cry out as Minnie sloshes water into my face. \u201cYou\u2019ve made the choice to get me wet too. Wow. That was an ... interesting choice.\u201d</p><p>Minnie isn\u2019t even listening. She\u2019s run over to the playhouse, which is quite adorable, like a little gingerbread cottage. Hastily, I follow her, almost tripping on the squidgy colorful alphabet matting.</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re in the house!\u201d I say, racking my brains for something to say. \u201cYou\u2019re discovering ... er ... windows. Shall I come in too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Minnie, and slams the door in my face. She looks out of the window and scowls. \u201cNo Mummy! Minnie house!\u201d She bangs the shutters closed, and I sink onto my heels. I\u2019m exhausted. I can\u2019t think of any other discoveries to identify to Minnie. I want a cup of coffee.</p><p>I pick up a toy with wooden beads strung along colored wires and idly start to fiddle with it. It\u2019s quite a good game, actually. You have to get the different-colored beads into the four corners, which is harder than it sounds....</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p><p>Guiltily, I jump, dropping the game onto the play mat. \u201cOh, hi, Erica!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Minnie doing?\u201d Erica beams. \u201cIs she learning to take those gradual steps away from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s playing in the house,\u201d I say with a smile, and open the shutters\u2014but the house is empty. Shit. \u201cWell, she was in the house....\u201d I cast my eyes around wildly. \u201cOh, there she is.\u201d</p><p>Minnie has linked arms with another little girl and is marching her round the room singing \u201cMy Old Man\u2019s a Dustman,\u201d which my dad taught her. I try to follow them, but it\u2019s not easy, what with all the toddler trucks and jumbo foam blocks all over the place.</p><p>\u201cWell done, darling!\u201d I call. \u201cYou\u2019re expressing yourself through song! Er ... do you want to tell Mummy how you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Minnie, and before I can catch her, she runs out into the yard, climbs to the top of the slide, and gazes down triumphantly.</p> <p>I glance at Erica, who looks lost for words.</p><p>\u201cMinnie\u2019s a very ... self-assured child,\u201d she says at last. \u201cVery independent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes.\u201d</p><p>We both watch as Minnie whirls a skipping rope round her head like a lasso. Soon all the other children on the slide are copying her and shouting, \u201cMy old man\u2019s a dustman! My old man\u2019s a dustman!\u201d even though they probably don\u2019t even know what a dustman is. They probably call it a \u201cgarbage collector\u201d or \u201crefuse sanitator\u201d or something.</p><p>\u201cMinnie seems to be transitioning with great confidence,\u201d says Erica at last. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to sit in the parents\u2019 lounge, Rebecca. This is a facility for our parents of children who are at the latter stages of the transition program. It provides proximity yet independence and helps the child attain a sense of self while feeling secure.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t follow a word of that. All I heard was \u201csit in the parents\u2019 lounge,\u201d which has got to be better than chase after my daughter, tripping over toy trucks and feeling like a moron.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe also find it a useful forum for parents to exchange views on parenting issues. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re burning with questions on curriculum ... socialization ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I perk up. \u201cActually, I was wondering, do the mothers have lots of coffee mornings, parties, that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>Erica shoots me an odd look. \u201cI meant socialization of the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cThe children. Of course.\u201d</p><p>As we near the pale wooden door marked PARENTS\u2019 LOUNGE, I feel suddenly excited. At last! A chance to make some friends. What I need to do is launch myself wholeheartedly into school life and volunteer for everything, and then I\u2019m bound to meet some nice people.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Erica swings open the door to reveal a room furnished with brightly colored foam chairs, on which are sitting three women, all dressed in workout gear. They\u2019re chatting avidly but stop and turn with friendly smiles. I beam back, noticing already that one of them has that cool embroidered bag I was looking at in Fred Segal.</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce Rebecca,\u201d Erica is saying. \u201cRebecca is new to L.A., and her daughter, Minnie, is joining our toddler program.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I wave round the room. \u201cLovely to meet you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Erin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSydney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarola. Welcome to L.A.!\u201d Carola, who has dark curly hair and lots of interesting-looking silver jewelry, leans forward as Erica leaves the room. \u201cHow long have you been living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long. We\u2019re here temporarily for my husband\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you got a place at Little Leaf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cWe were so lucky!\u201d</p><p>Carola stares at me blankly for a moment, then starts shaking her head. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t understand. No one just gets a place at Little Leaf. No one.\u201d</p><p>The others are nodding their heads emphatically. \u201cNo one,\u201d echoes Erin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d chimes in Sydney.</p><p>I want to point out that if no one gets a place at Little Leaf, what are all their children doing here? But they all look too intense. Clearly this is a serious subject.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t just \u2018get a place,\u2019 \u201d I explain. \u201cMinnie had to do a pre-test. And I think my husband made a donation,\u201d I add a little awkwardly.</p><p>Carola is staring at me as though I understand nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWe all do the pre-test,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all make donations. What else did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wrote five letters,\u201d says Erin with grim satisfaction. \u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve pledged to build a rooftop garden for the school,\u201d says Sydney. \u201cMy husband and I have already engaged the architect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe coached Alexa in karate,\u201d adds Carola. \u201cShe\u2019s here on a sports scholarship.\u201d</p><p>I stare at them all, openmouthed. Are these people nuts? I mean, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a good preschool and everything. But, at the end of the day, it\u2019s still just children hitting one another with Play-Doh.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we just turned up,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>The door swings open and a woman with chestnut hair bounces in. She has merry dark eyes and is wearing a stylish blue swingy top over jeans, covering the teeniest little pregnancy bump.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says, coming straight up to me. \u201cI\u2019m Faith. You\u2019re Rebecca, right? Erica told me we had a newcomer in our midst.\u201d</p><p>She has a gorgeous lilting Southern accent, which to my ear sounds as though it\u2019s from Charleston. Or Texas. Or maybe ... Wyoming? Is that Southern?</p><p>Do I mean Wisconsin?</p><p>No. No. That\u2019s the cheese state. Whereas Wyoming is ...</p> <p>OK, the truth is, I have no idea where Wyoming is. I must do Minnie\u2019s United States jigsaw puzzle and actually look at the names.</p><p>\u201cHi, Faith.\u201d I smile back and shake her hand. \u201cLovely to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre these girls looking after y\u2019all?\u201d</p><p>Y\u2019all. I just love that. Y\u2019all. Maybe I\u2019ll start saying \u201cy\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sure are!\u201d I say, putting a little twang in my voice. \u201cThey surely are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we want to know is, how did she get a place?\u201d Carola appeals to Faith. \u201cShe walks in here off the street, writes the check, and she\u2019s in. I mean, who does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Queenie put in a good word for her?\u201d says Faith. \u201cBecause she was British? I think Erica said something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhh.\u201d Carola exhales like a deflating balloon. \u201cThat\u2019s it. OK, now I understand. You were lucky.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen to everybody. You need to thank Queenie. She did you a big favor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, who\u2019s Queenie?\u201d I say, trying to keep up.</p><p>\u201cOur president of the PTA,\u201d explains Sydney. \u201cShe has a daughter in the toddler program too. You\u2019ll love her. She\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s super-fun.\u201d Faith nods. \u201cShe\u2019s British too! We call her Queenie because she talks like the Queen of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe organizes awesome social events,\u201d says Carola.</p><p>\u201cAnd she runs a moms\u2019 yoga class on Wednesday mornings. Knocks us all into shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds amazing!\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely come!\u201d</p><p>My spirits are higher than they\u2019ve been since we arrived in L.A. At last I\u2019ve found some friends! They\u2019re all so welcoming and fun. And this Queenie sounds fab. Maybe she and I will really hit it off. We can compare notes on living in L.A. and share pots of Marmite.</p><p>\u201cHow long has Queenie lived in L.A.?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot too long. A couple of years, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had quite the whirlwind romance,\u201d puts in Faith. \u201cShe and her husband met on a Tuesday and were married by that Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d Faith laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a great story. You\u2019ll have to ask her about it.\u201d She glances out of the window into the car park. \u201cOh, here she comes now.\u201d She waves and beckons at someone, and I sit up expectantly.</p><p>\u201cQueenie!\u201d exclaims Carola as the door opens. \u201cCome meet Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for helping us\u2014\u201d I begin, as the door swings farther open. And then my words dry up on my lips and I feel my entire body shrivel. No. No.</p><p>A little whimper escapes my lips before I can stop it, and Carola shoots me an odd glance. \u201cRebecca, meet Queenie. Alicia, I should say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s Alicia Bitch Long-legs.</p><p>Here. In L.A. In Minnie\u2019s school.</p><p>I feel pinioned with shock. If I weren\u2019t sitting down, I think my legs would collapse.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rebecca,\u201d she says softly, and I give a little shudder. I haven\u2019t heard that voice for years.</p> <p>She\u2019s as tall and skinny and blond as ever, but her style has changed. She\u2019s wearing drapey yoga pants and a gray top and Keds. I\u2019ve never seen Alicia in anything other than heels. And her hair is caught in a low ponytail, which is also very different. As I run my eyes over her, I notice a white-and-gold twisted bracelet on one wrist. Isn\u2019t that the bracelet they wear at Golden Peace?</p><p>\u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d says Sydney, with interest.</p><p>I want to break into hysterical laughter. Do we know each other? Well, let\u2019s see now. Over the last few years, Alicia has tried to ruin my career, my reputation, my husband\u2019s business, and my wedding. She\u2019s undermined me and looked down on me at every turn. Just seeing her is making my heart race with stress.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I manage. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you recommended Rebecca!\u201d Carola still seems obsessed by this. \u201cI was just saying, how on earth did she get a place on such short notice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a word with Erica,\u201d says Alicia.</p><p>Her voice is different, I realize. It\u2019s lower and calmer. In fact, her whole demeanor is calmer. It\u2019s creepy. It\u2019s like she\u2019s had Botox of the soul.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a sweetie pie?\u201d Faith puts an arm fondly round Alicia\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLucky Rebecca to have such a pal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were telling Rebecca all about you,\u201d puts in Carola. \u201cTurns out we didn\u2019t need to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed a lot since I saw you last, Rebecca.\u201d Alicia gives a soft laugh. \u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so shocked, I actually gasp. When was that? How can she ask that? Isn\u2019t it etched into her brain forever, like it is in mine?</p> <p>\u201cAt my wedding,\u201d I manage to gulp. When you were being escorted out, kicking and screaming, having tried to ruin the whole thing.</p><p>I\u2019m waiting for a flash of understanding, remorse, acknowledgment, something. But her eyes have a weird, bland quality to them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says thoughtfully. \u201cRebecca, I know we have some issues which we should try to put behind us.\u201d She puts a hand gently on my shoulder, and I immediately recoil. \u201cMaybe we could have a cup of mint tea together and talk it through, just the two of us?\u201d</p><p>What? All those terrible things she did boil down to \u201cissues\u201d?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ... You can\u2019t just ...\u201d I break off, my throat dry, my heart thumping, my thoughts all over the place. I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>No is what I want to say. You must be joking is what I want to say. We can\u2019t put all that behind us.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not on home turf. I\u2019m standing in the parents\u2019 lounge at a preschool in L.A., surrounded by strangers who think that Alicia is a sweetie pie who\u2019s done me the most massive favor in the world. And now a new feeling creeps over me. A horrible, cold realization. These women are all Alicia\u2019s friends. Not my friends\u2014Alicia\u2019s friends. It\u2019s her crowd.</p><p>The thing about Alicia is, she\u2019s always managed to make me feel about three inches tall. And even now, even though I know I\u2019m in the right and she\u2019s in the wrong, I feel like I\u2019m diminishing by the second. She\u2019s in the cool gang. And if I want to join it, I\u2019m going to have to be friendly to her. But I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t. I can barely even look at her, let alone go to her \u201cmoms\u2019 yoga class.\u201d</p> <p>How can they all be fooled by her? How can they call her \u201csweet\u201d and \u201csuper-fun\u201d? An overwhelming feeling of disappointment engulfs me. For a moment I was so excited. I thought I\u2019d found a way in. And now I find Alicia Bitch Long-legs is standing at the entrance, barring the way.</p><p>The door swings open and Erica comes in, her colorful shawl trailing behind her like a sail.</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI\u2019m glad to say that Minnie is doing extremely well. She\u2019s acclimatized remarkably quickly and seems to be making friends already. In fact, she\u2019s a natural leader.\u201d Erica beams at me. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have a little tribe following her in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d I manage a wide smile. \u201cThank you so much. That\u2019s fantastic news.\u201d</p><p>And it is. It\u2019s a massive relief to think that Minnie feels at home in L.A. and is happy and is making friends. I mean, I\u2019m not surprised. Minnie\u2019s so confident and charms everyone she meets, it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s landed on her feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as I look around at Alicia and all her disciples, I can\u2019t help thinking: What about me?</p><p>For the next few days I\u2019m in a total state of shock that Alicia Billington has turned up in L.A. Except she\u2019s not Alicia Billington anymore; she\u2019s Alicia Merrelle. It all gets worse, as I found out when I Googled her yesterday. She\u2019s filthy rich and well known all over L.A. because she\u2019s married to the founder of Golden Peace. The actual founder himself. He\u2019s called Wilton Merrelle, and he\u2019s seventy-three, with a goaty gray beard and those fixed, stretched eyes you get when you have too much plastic surgery, and they met on a beach in Hawaii. A beach. Who meets their husband on a beach? They have a daughter called Ora, who is a month younger than Minnie, and they are, according to one interview, hoping to expand their family.</p><p>As soon as I started Googling, I found all these articles about the super-stylish homemaker with her British wit and charm. I sent them to Suze and she sent back a one-word email\u2014WHAT?????\u2014which made me feel better. Suze has no time for Alicia. And neither does Luke (which is no surprise, bearing in mind she once tried to steal all his clients and ruin his company. Oh yes, whilst trashing my reputation in the newspapers at the same time. Luke and I actually split up because of it. It was awful). When I told him, he just grunted and said, \u201cMight have known she\u2019d land on her Manolos.\u201d</p><p>But the trouble is, everyone else here thinks she\u2019s adorable. I haven\u2019t seen her again at Little Leaf, thank goodness, but I\u2019ve had to endure about six conversations with other mothers about how great it is that Queenie and I are old friends (friends!) and isn\u2019t she divine and am I coming to her spa party?</p> <p>I can\u2019t cope with an Alicia Bitch Long-legs spa party. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>Anyway. Never mind. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll make friends another way. There are lots of other ways. And, in the meantime, I\u2019m going to focus on my new career.</p><p>I have a plan at the ready, and it starts today. I\u2019ve been totally inspired by the story of Nenita Dietz marching into the wardrobe department and landing herself a job. So today I\u2019m going to do the tour at Sedgewood Studios, which is where Nenita Dietz works, and I\u2019m going to sneak away and find her. Luke has even got me a free VIP ticket through some contact of his, although I haven\u2019t mentioned my plan to him. I\u2019ll wait till I have success first. Then he\u2019ll see.</p><p>I\u2019ve put together a collection of my work as a personal shopper: look books, photos of clients, even a couple of sketches, all zipped up in a leather portfolio. I\u2019ve also put together a critique of some recent Sedgewood Studios films, to show that I\u2019m movie-minded. (Like, for example, that alien film they made, Darkest Force. They really could have had better costumes in that. The space uniforms were so clunky. By the year 2154, surely we\u2019ll be going into space in skinny jeans, with tiny little helmets designed by Prada or someone?)</p><p>I\u2019ve also done extensive research on Nenita Dietz, because I want to make sure we hit it off straightaway. I\u2019m wearing a really cool dress by Rick Owens, which is a label she likes, and I\u2019m wearing Chanel No. 5, which is apparently her favorite scent, and I\u2019ve Googled Martinique, which is where she goes on holiday. All I have to do is meet her and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along.</p> <p>As I wait to join the VIP tour, I feel a fizz of excitement. My life could turn a massive new corner today! I\u2019m standing by the famous gates, which are huge and ornate, with \u201cSedgewood Studios\u201d in iron letters at the top. Apparently if you kiss them, your deepest wish will come true, and lots of tourists are kissing them and filming one another. Honestly, what a load of rubbish. Like a gate could help. Like a gate could really have any secret powers. Like a gate could\u2014</p><p>Oh, come on. I might as well. Just to be on the safe side. I\u2019m kissing it and whispering, \u201cGet me a job, please, please, lovely gate,\u201d when a side entrance opens.</p><p>\u201cCome forward for the VIP tour!\u201d A girl in a headset starts ushering us through and scanning our passes. I follow the crowd of tourists and soon find myself on the other side of the gates, in the studio lot. I\u2019m here! I\u2019m in Sedgewood Studios!</p><p>I quickly look around, trying to get my bearings. There\u2019s an endless road stretching ahead, lined with pretty Art Deco buildings. Beyond that is a lawned area, and I can see more buildings in the distance. I couldn\u2019t track down a map of the studio lot online, so I\u2019m going to have to find my own way.</p><p>\u201cThis way, ma\u2019am.\u201d A young man with blond hair, a dark jacket, and a headset is approaching me. \u201cWe have one more space on our cart.\u201d</p><p>I turn to see that a whole fleet of golf carts have turned up, and all the tourists are getting on. The blond guy is gesturing to the backseat of a cart that seats six people and is nearly full.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t want to get on. I want to find the wardrobe department. But I guess I have no choice.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I smile at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I climb onto the back of the cart and buckle up, next to an old lady in pink seersucker shorts who is filming everything with a video recorder. She even swings round to take a shot of me, and I do a little wave. The blond guy has got into the front of the cart and is handing out headphones.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d His voice booms into my ears as soon as my headphones are on. \u201cMy name is Shaun, and I\u2019ll be your guide for today. I\u2019m gonna take you on a fascinating tour of Sedgewood Studios, past, present, and future. We\u2019ll see the places where all your favorite shows and movies have been filmed. And while we\u2019re on our tour, keep your eyes peeled, and you might spot one of our stars at work. Yesterday I was beginning a tour just like this one, when who should we see strolling by but Matt Damon!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMatt Damon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis films are awesome!\u201d</p><p>At once, everyone starts looking around excitedly, as if he might appear again, and one man even starts snapping his camera at empty space.</p><p>This is like being on safari. In fact, I\u2019m amazed they don\u2019t do celebrity safaris. I wonder who the \u201cbig five\u201d would be. Brad Pitt, obviously, and Angelina. And imagine if you saw the whole family together. It would be like when we came across a lioness feeding her cubs in the Maasai Mara.</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019re gonna travel back in time, to the glory days of Sedgewood,\u201d Shaun is saying. \u201cI\u2019m gonna share with you some magical moments in film history. So sit back and enjoy!\u201d</p><p>The golf cart moves off, and we all look around politely at the white buildings and the lawns and the trees. After a while we stop, and Shaun shows us the fountain where Johnno proposed to Mari on We Were So Young, in 1963.</p><p>I never saw We Were So Young. In fact, I\u2019ve never even heard of it, so that doesn\u2019t mean an awful lot to me. Quite a nice fountain, though.</p><p>\u201cAnd now on to our next highlight!\u201d Shaun says as we all get back on the cart. He starts it up and we drive for ages, past more white buildings, lawns, and trees. We turn a sharp corner and we all look excitedly to see what\u2019s next ... but it\u2019s more white buildings, lawns, and trees.</p><p>I suppose I knew this is what a studio lot looked like. But I can\u2019t help feeling it\u2019s a bit ... meh. Where are the cameras? Where\u2019s the guy shouting \u201cAction\u201d? And, more important, where\u2019s the wardrobe department? I really wish I had a map, and I really wish Shaun would stop. As if reading my mind, he pulls to a halt and turns to face us, his face glowing with professional animation.</p><p>\u201cEver wondered, where was the famous grating that Anna lost her ring down in the movie Fox Tales? Right here, on the Sedgewood Studios lot! Come and take a closer look.\u201d</p> <p>Obediently, we all get off the cart and have a look. Sure enough, on a nearby fence, there\u2019s a framed still from some black-and-white film of a girl in fox furs dropping a ring down a grating. To my eye, it\u2019s just an old grating. But everyone else is taking pictures of it, jostling for a good view, so maybe I should too. I take a couple of snaps, then edge away from the group while they\u2019re all engrossed. I walk to the corner and squint up the road, hoping to see a sign saying WARDROBE or COSTUME DESIGN, but it\u2019s only more white buildings, lawns, and trees. Nor can I see a single film star. In fact, I\u2019m starting to doubt whether they really come here at all.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d Out of nowhere, Shaun has appeared, looking like a special agent in his dark jacket and headset. \u201cMa\u2019am, I need you to stay with the group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. OK.\u201d Reluctantly, I follow him back to the cart and get on. This is useless. I\u2019m never going to meet Nenita Dietz stuck on a cart.</p><p>\u201cTo your right, you\u2019ll see the buildings that house some of the most famous film-production companies in the world,\u201d Shaun is booming down the earpiece. \u201cThey all produce films right here on the Sedgewood lot! Now we\u2019re heading to the gift shop....\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m peering out of the cart as we trundle along, reading every sign we pass. As we pause at an intersection, I lean out, squinting, to read the signs on the buildings. Scamper Productions ... AJB Films ... Too Rich Too Thin Design\u2014oh my God, that\u2019s her! That\u2019s Nenita Dietz\u2019s company! Right there in front of my eyes! OK. I\u2019m off.</p><p>With a burst of excitement, I unbuckle my belt and start clambering off the cart, just as we start moving. The momentum sends me sprawling onto the grass, and everyone on the cart screams. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d one woman exclaims. \u201cAre these carts safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I call. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine!\u201d I hastily get to my feet, brush myself down, and pick up my portfolio. Right. New career, here I come.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d Shaun has appeared by my side again. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi, Shaun.\u201d I beam at him. \u201cI\u2019d like to get off here, actually. I\u2019ll make my own way back, thanks. Brilliant tour,\u201d I add. \u201cI loved the grating. Have a good day!\u201d</p><p>I start to walk away, but, to my annoyance, Shaun follows me.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t allow you to walk unsupervised through the lot. If you would like to leave the tour, one of our representatives will guide you back to the gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI know the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is necessary, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut honestly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a working lot, and unauthorized visitors must be accompanied at all times. Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>His tone is implacable. Honestly. They take it all so seriously. What is this, NASA?</p><p>\u201cCould I go to the ladies?\u201d I say in sudden inspiration. \u201cI\u2019ll just pop in to that building there. I\u2019ll only be a sec....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ladies\u2019 room at the gift store, which is our next stop,\u201d says Shaun. \u201cCould you please rejoin the cart?\u201d</p><p>His face hasn\u2019t flickered once. He means business. If I make a run for it, he\u2019ll probably rugby-tackle me to the ground. I want to scream with frustration. Nenita Dietz\u2019s design company is right there. It\u2019s yards away.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say at last, and morosely follow him back to the cart. The other passengers are looking at me with wonder and incomprehension. I can almost see the thought bubbles above their heads: Why would you get off the cart?</p><p>We whiz off again, past more buildings and round corners, and Shaun starts talking about some famous director who used to sunbathe nude in the 1930s, but I don\u2019t listen. This is a total failure. Maybe I need to come again tomorrow and try a different tack. Sneak away at the start before I\u2019ve even got on a cart. Yes.</p><p>The only tiny positive is, there\u2019s a shop. At least I can buy souvenirs for everyone. As I wander around the gift store, looking at tea towels and pencils with miniature clapper boards on them, I can\u2019t help sighing morosely. The old lady who was sitting next to me comes over and picks up a novelty megaphone paperweight. She glances at Shaun, who is supervising us all with a close eye. Then she moves nearer to me and says in a lowered voice, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. He\u2019ll suspect something. Just listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say in surprise. I pick up a Sedgewood Studios mug and pretend to be engrossed in it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get off the cart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to break into movies,\u201d I say, practically whispering. \u201cI want to meet Nenita Dietz. Her office was right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought it was something like that.\u201d She nods in satisfaction. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing I would have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I was stagestruck. But what was I going to do? I was a kid in Missouri. My parents wouldn\u2019t let me sneeze without permission.\u201d Her eyes dim a little. \u201cI ran away when I was sixteen. Got as far as L.A. before they tracked me down. Never did it again. I should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI mean ... I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d She seems to come to. \u201cBut you can. I\u2019ll create a diversion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cA diversion,\u201d she repeats a little impatiently. \u201cKnow what that means? I distract \u2019em, you get away. You do what you gotta do. Leave Shaun to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I clasp her bony hand. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over to the door.\u201d She nods her head. \u201cGo. I\u2019m Edna, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca. Thank you!\u201d</p><p>My heart beating hard, I head toward the door and linger by a display of We Were So Young aprons and baseball caps. Suddenly there\u2019s an almighty CRASH! Edna has collapsed theatrically to the floor, taking an entire display of crockery with her. There are screams and shouts, and all the staff in the place, including Shaun, are rushing forward.</p><p>Thank you, Edna, I think as I creep out of the shop. I start to hurry along the street, running as fast as I can in my H&amp;M wedges (really cool black-and-white print; you\u2019d never think they cost only twenty-six dollars). After I\u2019ve gone a little way, I slow down, so as not to look suspicious, and turn a corner. There are people walking along and riding bikes and driving around in golf carts, but none of them has challenged me. Yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The only trouble is, I have no idea where I am. All these bloody white buildings look the same. I don\u2019t dare ask anyone where Nenita Dietz\u2019s office is\u2014I\u2019ll draw too much attention to myself. In fact, I\u2019m still half-expecting Shaun to come whizzing up beside me in a golf cart and perform a citizen\u2019s arrest.</p><p>I round another corner and stop in the shade of a big red canopy. What do I do now? The lot is huge. I\u2019m totally lost. A golf cart full of tourists passes by and I shrink away into the shadows, feeling like a fugitive avoiding the secret police. They\u2019ve probably circulated my description to all the golf-cart drivers by this point. I\u2019m probably on the Most Wanted list.</p><p>And then suddenly something rattles past me, and I blink at it in astonishment. It\u2019s something so shiny and colorful and wonderful, I want to whoop. It\u2019s a gift from God! It\u2019s a rail of clothes! It\u2019s a girl pushing a rail of clothes in plastic bags. She steers them expertly along the pavement, her phone in her other hand, and I hear her saying, \u201cOn my way. OK, don\u2019t stress. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea who she is or what she\u2019s doing. All I know is, where there are clothes, there\u2019s a wardrobe department. Wherever she\u2019s going, I want to go too. As discreetly as I can, I begin to follow her along the street, ducking behind pillars for cover and shielding my face with my hand. I think I\u2019m being fairly unobtrusive, although a couple of people give me odd looks as they pass by.</p> <p>The girl winds round two corners and through an alley, and I stay on her tail. Maybe she works for Nenita Dietz! And even if she doesn\u2019t, there might be other useful people I could meet.</p><p>At last she turns at a set of double doors. I wait a moment, then cautiously push my way in after her. I\u2019m standing in a wide corridor lined with doors, and ahead of me the girl is greeting a guy in a headset. He glances at me, and I hastily duck down a short side corridor. A bit farther on I peep through a glass panel and stifle a gasp. It\u2019s the Holy Grail! It\u2019s a room filled with tables and sewing machines and, all round the walls, rails of clothes. I have to have a look. The place is empty, thank God, so I push the door open and tiptoe in. There are period dresses lined up against one side, and I riffle through them, fingering all the gorgeous little pin tucks and ruffles and covered buttons. Imagine working on a period film. Imagine choosing all those stunning dresses. And look at the hats! I\u2019m just reaching for a poke bonnet with a broad ribbon trim when the door opens and another girl in jeans and a headset looks in.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demands, and I start guiltily. Shit.</p><p>My mind is racing as I put the bonnet back. I can\u2019t get chucked out now, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll have to wing it.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi there.\u201d I try to sound pleasant and normal. \u201cI\u2019m new. Just started. That\u2019s why you haven\u2019t seen me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She frowns. \u201cIs anyone else around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... not right now. Do you know where Nenita Dietz is?\u201d I add. \u201cI have a message for her.\u201d</p><p>Ha! Neatly done. Next I can say, Can you just remind me where her office is? and I\u2019ll be in.</p><p>The girl\u2019s brow wrinkles. \u201cAren\u2019t they all on location still?\u201d Location? My heart sinks. It never occurred to me she might be on location.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they got back yesterday. I don\u2019t know.\u201d The girl doesn\u2019t seem remotely interested in Nenita Dietz. \u201cWhere are they all?\u201d She\u2019s looking impatiently round the empty room, and I realize she must mean whoever normally works here.</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen them.\u201d I think I\u2019m busking this conversation pretty well. It just goes to show: All you need is a bit of confidence.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t they realize we\u2019re making a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say sympathetically. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have time to chase people down.\u201d She sighs. \u201cOK, you\u2019ll have to do it.\u201d She produces a white cotton shirt with a frilly collar.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say blankly, and the girl\u2019s eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cYou are a seamstress?\u201d</p><p>My whole face freezes. A seamstress?</p> <p>\u201cEr ... of course,\u201d I say after what seems like an eternity. \u201cOf course I\u2019m a seamstress. What else would I be?\u201d</p><p>I need to get out of this room. Quickly. But before I can move, the girl is handing me the shirt.</p><p>\u201cOK. So this is for the older Mrs. Bridges. I need a hem in the bottom, half an inch. You should use slip stitch for these garments,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019m sure Deirdre told you that. Did she show you the attachment?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I try to sound professional. \u201cSlip stitch. Actually, I\u2019m just on my way to get a coffee, so I\u2019ll do that later.\u201d I put the shirt down next to a sewing machine. \u201cLovely to meet you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d the girl erupts, and I jump in fright. \u201cYou won\u2019t do it later; you\u2019ll do it now! We\u2019re shooting! This is your first day and you come in with that attitude?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so scary I take a step back.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I gulp.</p> <p>\u201cWell, do you want to start?\u201d The girl nods toward the sewing machines, then folds her arms. I have no way out of this. None.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause, and take a seat in front of one of the sewing machines. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve seen Mum using a sewing machine. And Danny. You just put the material under the needle and push the pedal. I can do this.</p><p>My face hot, I cautiously insert the shirt into the sewing machine.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to pin it?\u201d says the girl critically.</p> <p>\u201cEr ... I pin as I go,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way I do it.\u201d Experimentally, I press the pedal, and thankfully the sewing machine whirs along vigorously as though I\u2019m an expert. I reach for a pin, shove it into the fabric, then sew a bit more. I think I look pretty convincing, as long as the girl doesn\u2019t come anywhere near me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to pick this up in a minute?\u201d I say. \u201cI could bring it to you, maybe?\u201d</p><p>To my relief, there\u2019s a crackling sound from her headset. She shakes her head impatiently, trying to listen, then steps outside the room. At once I stop sewing. Thank God. Time to make a run for it. I\u2019m halfway out of the chair when the door swings back open and, to my horror, it\u2019s the girl again.</p><p>\u201cThey want some pin tucks down the front as well. Did you finish the hem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I swallow. \u201cNearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, finish it and put in the pin tucks.\u201d She claps her hands. \u201cCome on! They\u2019re waiting! Now!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod and hastily start up the sewing machine again. \u201cPin tucks. Coming up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd two extra sleeve tucks at the shoulder. You can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeve tucks. No problem.\u201d</p><p>I briskly sew a seam, then turn the blouse and sew another seam. She\u2019s still watching me. Why is she still watching me? Doesn\u2019t she have anywhere else to go?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll just ... put those tucks in.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m pushing the shirt back and forth, crisscrossing seams all over it. I don\u2019t dare stop; I don\u2019t dare look up. I\u2019m just willing the girl to leave. Go, please go ... please, please go ...</p><p>\u201cAre you nearly done?\u201d The girl listens to her headset. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for it.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m in a never-ending sewing nightmare. The shirt is a mishmash of random wavery stitches; in fact, I\u2019ve actually stitched the whole thing together. I\u2019m sewing more and more feverishly, backward and forward, praying that something gets me out of this....</p> <p>\u201cHello? Excuse me?\u201d She raises her voice over the sound of the sewing machine. \u201cCan you hear me? Hey!\u201d She bangs a hand on the table. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I look up as though hearing her for the first time. \u201cSorry. I was just sewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shirt?\u201d She holds out her hand.</p><p>I stare steadily back at her. The blood is pulsing in my ears. Any minute now she\u2019s going to grab the shirt from the sewing machine and it will all be over. And she won\u2019t let me leave and I\u2019ll be arrested by the studio secret police in dark jackets and my whole plan will fail before it\u2019s even begun.</p><p>\u201cActually ... I think I\u2019m going to change career,\u201d I say in desperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The girl gapes at me.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve had a sudden realization. I don\u2019t want to be a seamstress anymore; I want to work with animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnimals?\u201d She seems absolutely poleaxed, and I take advantage of this fact to get up and start edging past her to the door.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m going to go to Borneo and work with gorillas. It\u2019s always been my dream. So, er, thank you for the opportunity.\u201d I back out of the room. \u201cSay thank you to Deirdre too. You\u2019ve all been lovely to work with!\u201d</p><p>The girl is still staring at me, openmouthed, as I hurry out of the double doors. I can hear her calling something, but I don\u2019t stop to listen. I have to get out.</p><p>THE MISSOURI ECHO</p><p>ST.

Instead, she came away with a part in a major Sedgewood production, Fought the Day, a World War II weepie that begins production next month.</p><p>The Missouri senior found herself being screen-tested by director Ron Thickson after an encounter in the gift store. \u201cI was browsing for a gift when an old lady tumbled to the ground,\u201d commented Thickson. \u201cAs I ran to help her, I caught sight of her face, and she matched perfectly my vision of Vera, the hero\u2019s grandmother.\u201d Edna was screen-tested later that day and has been offered the small role.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ecstatic beyond belief. I\u2019ve always wanted to act,\u201d commented Edna. \u201cI have to thank Rebecca,\u201d she added, but would not elaborate on who \u201cRebecca\u201d is.</p> <p>What a disaster. I never got to meet Nenita Dietz. I never got to meet anyone. When I got outside, I was so flustered, I almost ran all the way to the exit, looking behind me all the time for the men in dark jackets. I didn\u2019t even buy any souvenirs, so the whole thing was a total waste. And then Luke wanted to hear all about it, and I had to pretend I\u2019d had a brilliant time.</p><p>As I get Minnie ready for Little Leaf the next day, I\u2019m still downcast. And my misery has been increased about a million-fold because we\u2019ve had an email saying Alicia wants to address all the parents today about a fund-raiser, so could we all please stay behind after drop-off for an informal gathering.</p><p>Which means, after managing to avoid her these last few days, I\u2019ll have to face her again. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to keep my cool.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d I say to Minnie as I plait her wispy little locks into a braid.</p><p>\u201cCup of tea,\u201d replies Minnie seriously, and passes me a plastic cocktail glass. We\u2019re sitting on the terrace outside, which is where Minnie chooses to get dressed most mornings (I can\u2019t blame her, with this lovely sunshine), and all her teddies and dolls are sitting around, with a cocktail glass each. As Luke steps out of the house, briefcase in hand, he looks aghast at the sight.</p> <p>\u201cIs this Alcoholics Anonymous for teddies?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I giggle. \u201cThey\u2019re our garden cocktail glasses. Minnie found them in the outdoor kitchen. They won\u2019t break, so I let her play with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, cup of tea,\u201d says Minnie, handing him a cocktail glass.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Luke. \u201cA quick cup of tea.\u201d He crouches down and takes the glass from her. A moment later, his gaze focuses on the teddy in front of him. Damn. I know what he\u2019s seen. I should have hidden it.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d he says. \u201cIs that bear wearing my Asprey cuff links? The ones you gave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d I assume an innocent expression. \u201cLet me see. Ah. Yes, I believe it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd my Cartier watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that doll has got my old college tie on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it?\u201d I\u2019m trying not to giggle. \u201cWell, Minnie wanted to dress her toys up. You should be flattered she chose your things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Luke grabs his watch off the bear, ignoring Minnie\u2019s protests. \u201cI don\u2019t notice you volunteering any of your priceless jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cuff links aren\u2019t priceless!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re priceless to me because they came from you.\u201d He raises his eyebrows at me and I feel a little flicker, because although I know he\u2019s teasing me, I also know he means it.</p><p>\u201cDrink tea, Daddy!\u201d says Minnie sternly, and Luke puts his cocktail glass to his lips obediently. I wonder what all his board members in London would say if they could see him now.</p> <p>\u201cLuke ...\u201d I bite my lip.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t planning on bothering him with my problems, but I can\u2019t help myself. \u201cWhat am I going to do about Alicia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d says Luke tersely, and raises his eyes to heaven. \u201cGod help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! But here she is, and I\u2019m going to see her today at preschool, and everyone thinks she\u2019s marvelous, and I want to yell, If only you knew what an evil witch she is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d says Luke, looking amused. \u201cNot in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK for you! You\u2019re really good when you meet people you don\u2019t like. You just go all calm and stony. I get flustered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think dignified. That\u2019s my best advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDignified!\u201d I echo despairingly, and Minnie perks up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDigna-dive,\u201d she enunciates carefully, and Luke and I both laugh, whereupon she says it again, beaming back at us. \u201cDigna-dive. Digna-dive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d says Luke. \u201cDigna-dive. I have to go.\u201d He rises to his feet, swiping his Asprey cuff links off the teddy bear as he does so. I take a pretend swig of my tea, wishing it were a real cocktail, and that Luke could take the day off, and that Alicia lived in Timbuktu. \u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t fret,\u201d says Luke, as though reading my thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Chin up, eyes flinty.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling, as that\u2019s exactly how he looks when he\u2019s angry with someone but isn\u2019t about to make a scene.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I put an arm round him and kiss him. \u201cYou\u2019re the most digna-dive person I know.\u201d</p> <p>Luke clicks his heels and bows like an Austrian prince, and I laugh again. I truly do have the best husband in the world. And I\u2019m not biased at all.</p><p>As I arrive at Little Leaf, I\u2019m resolved. Luke has inspired me. I\u2019m going to be totally serene and not let Alicia get to me. Minnie prances off straightaway to play with her friends, and I head for the parents\u2019 lounge, which is where Alicia is apparently giving her talk. I can hear a vacuum cleaner operating inside, so I assume the room isn\u2019t ready yet and lean against the wall to wait. A few moments later I hear footsteps, and Alicia appears round the corner, immaculately dressed as ever in yoga wear and holding what looks like a brand-new Herm\u00e8s bag.</p><p>OK, here I go. Chin up. Eyes flinty. Stay calm.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say, trying to sound detached yet engaged, yet unflustered, while maintaining the moral high ground. All in two syllables.</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Alicia gives a nod and leans against the wall directly opposite me. I feel as though we\u2019re in some weird game of chess, only I don\u2019t know what the next move is.</p> <p>Anyway. It\u2019s not chess, I tell myself. This isn\u2019t a battle. I\u2019m not even going to think about Alicia. I\u2019m going to ... check my phone. Yes. As I start to read through a bunch of messages I\u2019ve read before, I see that Alicia is doing the same thing, opposite. Only she keeps laughing softly and shaking her head and exclaiming, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding! Oh, hilarious,\u201d as though to demonstrate what an entertaining life she leads.</p><p>I\u2019m furiously telling myself not to notice her, not to think about her\u2014but I can\u2019t help it. Our mutual past keeps flashing through my head like a film. All the times she\u2019s undermined me, all her scheming, all her bitchiness ...</p><p>My chest is starting to rise and fall in indignation, my fingers are clenching, my jaw is tightening. After a few moments, Alicia clearly notices, because she puts down her phone and surveys me as though I\u2019m an interesting curiosity.</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d she says, in that new-agey, softly-softly way she has that makes me want to slap her. \u201cI know you\u2019re hostile toward me.\u201d</p><p>She pronounces it \u201chostel\u201d now. Of course she does.</p><p>\u201cHostile?\u201d I stare at her incredulously. \u201cOf course I\u2019m hostile!\u201d</p> <p>Alicia says nothing but just sighs, as though to say, How sad that you feel this way, but I have no idea why.</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d I say evenly. \u201cDo you actually remember the way you\u2019ve behaved toward me over the years? Or have you blanked it all out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you a little about my journey,\u201d says Alicia seriously. \u201cWhen I met Wilton, I was in a very unhappy place. I believed I was deficient in every possible way. He helped me to self-actualize.\u201d</p><p>Argh. Self-actualize. What does that mean, even? Self-obsess, more like.</p><p>\u201cThe old Alicia was in a very toxic cycle.\u201d She looks wistful.</p><p>\u201cThe old Alicia was still a child in many ways.\u201d She\u2019s talking as though \u201cthe old Alicia\u201d has nothing to do with her.</p><p>\u201cThat was you,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cI know our relationship in the past was maybe ...\u201d She pauses as though to select the right word. \u201cUnbalanced. But now that I\u2019ve righted the scales, we should move on, no?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRighted the scales?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cWhat scales?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else did I recommend your daughter to Little Leaf?\u201d she says, looking supremely pleased with herself.</p><p>The pieces suddenly fall into place in my head.</p><p>\u201cYou recommended Minnie ... what, to make amends?\u201d</p><p>Alicia simply bows her head with a faint smile, as though she\u2019s Mother Teresa giving me benediction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she says.</p><p>Welcome? I\u2019m prickling all over in horror. I feel like striding into the toddler playground, plucking out Minnie, and leaving Little Leaf forever. Except that would be unfair to Minnie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you think we\u2019re quits now?\u201d I say, just to make sure I\u2019ve got this right. \u201cYou think everything\u2019s square?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the way you see it, then that works.\u201d She shrugs easily. \u201cFor me, the world isn\u2019t so linear.\u201d She gives me a patronizing smile, like she used to when she was in financial PR and I was a journalist and her suit was more expensive than mine and we both knew it.</p><p>\u201cForget linear!\u201d My thoughts are so scattered and furious, I\u2019m finding it hard to articulate them. Let alone stay digna-dive. \u201cJust answer me one question, Alicia. Are you actually sorry for anything you did to me? Are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>The words hang in the air like a challenge. And as I stare at her, my heart is suddenly pounding in expectation. My cheeks are hot and I feel like a ten-year-old on the playground. After all the damage she caused Luke and me. If she really wants to make amends, she has to say sorry. She has to say it and mean it. I\u2019m holding my breath, I realize. I\u2019ve been waiting to hear this for a long time. An apology from Alicia Bitch Long-legs.</p> <p>But there\u2019s silence. And as I look up to meet her blue eyes, I know she\u2019s not going to do it. Of course she isn\u2019t. All this talk of amends. She isn\u2019t sorry a bit.</p><p>\u201cRebecca ...\u201d she says thoughtfully, \u201cI think you\u2019re obsessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think you\u2019re still an evil witch!\u201d The words burst from me before I can stop them, and I hear a loud gasp from behind me. I wheel round to see a cluster of mothers standing behind us in the corridor, all with eyes wide and some with hands to their mouths.</p><p>My heart plummets. They all heard me. And they all love Alicia. They would never understand in a million years.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, I know you didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d says Alicia at once, in her most syrupy, new-agey voice. \u201cYou\u2019re at a stressed time in your life; it\u2019s understandable. We\u2019re all here for you....\u201d She reaches for my hand, and, in a slight daze, I let her hold it.</p> <p>\u201cQueenie, sweetheart, you\u2019re so understanding!\u201d exclaims Carola, shooting me daggers.</p><p>\u201cQueenie, are you OK?\u201d chimes in Sydney as she walks into the parents\u2019 lounge. As the other mothers file past, everyone has a kind word for Alicia and everyone avoids looking at me. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got an infectious disease.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d I mutter, and pull my hand away from Alicia\u2019s cool grasp.</p><p>\u201cNot coming to the talk, Rebecca?\u201d says Alicia sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d I say, and turn on my heel. \u201cThanks anyway.\u201d As I stride away down the corridor, my head is high, but my face is puce and I\u2019m dangerously near tears. I failed and Alicia won again. How come she won again? How is this fair?</p><p>As I get back home, I feel at my lowest ebb since we\u2019ve arrived in L.A. It\u2019s all going wrong, in every direction. I\u2019ve failed on my mission to meet Nenita Dietz. I\u2019ve failed on my mission to make lots of new friends. Everyone at Little Leaf will think I\u2019m some awful psycho.</p> <p>I\u2019m just going into the kitchen and wondering whether to pour myself a glass of wine when my phone rings. To my surprise, it\u2019s Luke. He doesn\u2019t usually phone in the middle of the day.</p><p>\u201cBecky! How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>He sounds so warm and kind and familiar that for an awful moment I think I might burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI just saw Alicia,\u201d I say, slumping into a chair. \u201cTried to be digna-dive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know how you said not to call her an evil witch? I called her an evil witch.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s laugh is so hearty and reassuring, I feel better at once.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIgnore her. You\u2019re so much bigger than her, Becky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but she\u2019s at school every day, and everyone thinks she\u2019s lovely ...\u201d I trail off feebly. Luke doesn\u2019t really get the whole school-gate thing. Whenever he picks Minnie up, he strides straight to the door and leads her away and doesn\u2019t even seem to notice that there are any other parents. Let alone what they\u2019re wearing or gossiping about or what sidelong looks they\u2019re shooting at whom.</p><p>\u201cAre you at home?\u201d he says now.</p><p>\u201cYes, just got back. Why, have you forgotten something? D\u2019you want me to bring it in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Luke pauses. \u201cNow, Becky, I want you to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am relaxed!\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cWhy do you keep telling me to relax?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s been a change of plan. I\u2019m coming back home to hold a meeting at the house. With ...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cWith Sage.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as if lightning zings through me. I sit bolt upright, every nerve alive. My misery has vanished. Alicia suddenly seems irrelevant to my life. Sage Seymour? Here? What shall I wear? Have I got time to wash my hair?</p><p>\u201cWe probably won\u2019t see you,\u201d Luke\u2019s saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably just go into the library. But I wanted to warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cDo you want me to sort out some snacks? I could make cupcakes. Quinoa ones,\u201d I add hastily. \u201cI know she likes quinoa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDarling, you don\u2019t need to make any special effort.\u201d Luke seems to think for a moment. \u201cIn fact, maybe you should go out.\u201d</p><p>Go out? Go out? Is he mad?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying here,\u201d I say firmly.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Luke. \u201cWell ... I\u2019ll see you in about half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour! I put the phone down and look around the house in sudden dissatisfaction. It doesn\u2019t look nearly cool enough. I should rearrange the furniture. I have to choose the right outfit, too, and do my makeup again ... but first things first. I grab my phone and text Suze and Mum, my fingers clumsy with excitement: Guess what? Sage is coming to our house!!!</p> <p>Somehow, half an hour later, I\u2019m almost ready. I\u2019ve washed my hair and blasted it with the hair dryer, and I\u2019ve got Velcro rollers in (I\u2019ll quickly take them out when I hear the car). I\u2019ve moved the sofas around in the living room and plumped up the cushions. I\u2019m wearing my new slip dress from Anthropologie, and I\u2019ve memorized the story lines of all Sage\u2019s forthcoming films, which I quickly Googled.</p><p>I have a couple of complete outfits ready for Sage, but I won\u2019t show them to her at once. I don\u2019t want her to feel bombarded. In fact, I\u2019m going to have to do this subtly, as I know Luke won\u2019t appreciate me hijacking his meeting. I\u2019ll just be very casual about it, I decide. I\u2019ll have the brocade coat lying about and she\u2019ll admire it and try it on and it will all snowball from there.</p><p>The sound of an engine comes distantly from the front of the house, followed by that of car doors. They\u2019re here! I put up a hand to smooth down my hair\u2014then suddenly remember my Velcro rollers. Quickly, I pull them out and hurl them one by one behind a big potted plant. I shake out my hair, casually recline on the sofa, and grab Variety, which is a brilliant accessory as it instantly makes you look like a cool movie person.</p><p>I can hear the front door opening. They\u2019re coming in. Stay calm, Becky ... stay cool ...</p><p>\u201c... go into the library, I thought.\u201d Luke is speaking. \u201cSage, meet my wife, Becky.\u201d</p><p>My face starts prickling as three figures appear round the door. Oh my God. It\u2019s her. It\u2019s her! Right here in this room! She\u2019s smaller than I expected, with tiny bronzed arms and that familiar treacly hair. Clothes: teeny white jeans, orange flats, a little gray tank, and The Jacket. The Jacket. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s wearing it! It\u2019s pale buttery suede, and she was wearing it in Us Weekly last week. It was in \u201cWho Wore It Best?\u201d and she won. Of course she did.</p> <p>I\u2019ve met Aran before: He\u2019s Sage\u2019s manager. He\u2019s tall and buff and blond, with blue eyes and slanty eyebrows, and he kisses me politely in greeting.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky,\u201d Sage says pleasantly. \u201cWe spoke on the phone, right? For Luke\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got the most amazing accent. It\u2019s mostly American but with a hint of French, because her mother\u2019s half French and she spent her early childhood in Switzerland. People magazine once called it \u201cthe sexiest accent alive,\u201d and I kind of agree.</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d I gulp. \u201cYes. Hi.\u201d</p><p>I try to think of something else to say ... something witty ... come on, Becky ... but something\u2019s wrong with my head. It\u2019s gone blank. All I can think is, It\u2019s Sage Seymour! In my living room!</p><p>\u201cYou have a nice yard,\u201d says Sage, as though she\u2019s making a really deep pronouncement.</p><p>\u201cThank you. We like it.\u201d Luke strides ahead and pushes open the glass doors to the garden. Sage and Aran follow him out and I follow behind. We all look at the inviting blue of the pool, and I urgently try to think of something to say. But it\u2019s like my brain has been replaced by cotton wool.</p><p>\u201cShall we sit out here?\u201d says Luke, gesturing to our outdoor dining table. It has a massive parasol above it, and the pool guy hoses it every day to keep it clean.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d Sage slides gracefully into a chair, followed by Aran.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s water in the chiller....\u201d Luke hands bottles around.</p><p>\u201cCan I get anyone coffee?\u201d Finally I manage to string two words together.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d says Aran politely.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re fine, Becky,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThanks.\u201d He gives me a nod, which I understand. It means, Leave us alone now. I\u2019ll just pretend I didn\u2019t see it.</p><p>As the three start getting out folders and papers, I hurry back into the house, grab the brocade coat, a belt, and a pair of shoes, and zoom back out into the garden. I arrive breathlessly next to Sage and hold the coat out on one arm.</p><p>\u201cI just bought this,\u201d I say chattily. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Sage surveys the coat. \u201cCute,\u201d she says with a nod, and turns back to a page of photocopied press clippings.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want to try it on?\u201d I say casually. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s your size. It would really suit you.\u201d</p> <p>Sage gives me an absent smile. \u201cNo, that\u2019s OK,\u201d she says.</p><p>I stare at her in slight shock. It\u2019s so beautiful, I was sure she\u2019d want to try it on. Well, maybe she\u2019s not into coats.</p><p>\u201cI bought this belt too.\u201d I quickly proffer the belt. \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d</p><p>The belt is from Danny\u2019s new collection. It\u2019s black suede, with three chunky buckles in green resin. You\u2019d put it on over a simple dress and the whole outfit would pop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s by Danny Kovitz,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d says Sage, but she makes no move to stroke it or touch it, let alone ask to try it on. This is not going as I planned.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re size six and a half, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I say in desperation. \u201cI bought these shoes by mistake. Why don\u2019t you have them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She looks at me in surprise, eyeing my bigger feet.</p><p>\u201cYes! Absolutely! Have them.\u201d I put them on the table. They\u2019re pale-coral-colored sandals by Sergio Rossi, just very simple and gorgeous. In fact, I covet them myself, and it was really hard buying them in Sage\u2019s size, not mine.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d At last! Sage is finally showing some interest. She picks up a sandal and turns it this way and that. \u201cMy sister would love these. We\u2019re the same size. I give her all my castoffs. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, dismayed. Her sister? Castoffs?</p><p>A thought suddenly occurs to Sage. \u201cHow come you bought them in the wrong size? Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m aware of Luke\u2019s sardonic gaze from across the table.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d I can feel myself flushing. \u201cUm ... I got confused between British and American sizing. And I never tried them on. And I can\u2019t take them back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. Well, thanks!\u201d She hands the shoes to Aran, who places them in a tote bag at his feet. Feeling crestfallen, I watch them disappear.</p><p>She didn\u2019t admire a single thing I\u2019d bought. She didn\u2019t suggest shopping together or ask for advice on her next red-carpet appearance or any of my fantasies. I can\u2019t help feeling dispirited. But I\u2019m not going to give up. Maybe I just need to get to know her a bit better.</p><p>Luke is circulating a sheet headed Agenda. Everyone\u2019s ignoring me. I can\u2019t hover near the table anymore. But I can\u2019t go tamely back inside the house. Maybe ... I\u2019ll sunbathe. Yes, good idea. I hurry into the house and collect Variety from the living room, then nonchalantly walk to a lounge chair about ten feet away from the table and sit down on it. Luke glances up with a slight frown, but I ignore him. I\u2019m allowed to sunbathe in my own garden, aren\u2019t I?</p><p>I open Variety and read some piece about the future of 3-D franchises, while trying to listen in on the conversation at the table. The trouble is, they\u2019re all talking so quietly. Mum always complains that modern movie stars mumble, and I have to agree. I can\u2019t hear anything Sage is saying. She should have some proper speech and drama lessons. She should project!</p><p>Luke is being equally discreet, and the only one whose voice is resonating through the garden is Aran. Even so, I\u2019m only catching the odd intriguing word.</p><p>\u201c... brand ... positioning ... Cannes ... next year ... Europe ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d chimes in Luke. \u201cBut ...\u201d mumble mumble, \u201cbig budget ... Academy Awards ...\u201d</p><p>Academy Awards? My ears prick up. What about the Academy Awards? God, I wish there were subtitles.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d says Sage with sudden animation. \u201cFuck them. They\u2019re a ...\u201d mumble mumble, \u201cPippi Taylor ... well, their choice ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m nearly falling off my lounge chair, trying to hear. It said in The Hollywood Reporter last week that Sage Seymour had lost out to Pippi Taylor in the last three roles she\u2019d gone for. It also said that Sage was on a downward slide, not that I would mention this. I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s hired Luke\u2014to help turn things around for her.</p><p>\u201c... Lois Kellerton situation ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... have to ignore Lois Kellerton, Sage.\u201d</p><p>Lois Kellerton. I sit up straighter, my mind working frantically. Now I remember. There\u2019s some old feud between Sage and Lois Kellerton. Isn\u2019t there a clip of them on YouTube, yelling at each other backstage at an awards ceremony? But I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s all about.</p> <p>\u201cIgnore that bitch?\u201d Sage\u2019s voice rises indignantly. \u201cAfter everything she did to me? Are you kidding? She\u2019s a ...\u201d mumble mumble ...</p><p>\u201c... not relevant ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... totally relevant!\u201d</p><p>Oh, I can\u2019t bear it. For once, I have something to contribute to the conversation! I can\u2019t keep quiet any longer.</p><p>\u201cI met Lois Kellerton!\u201d I blurt out. \u201cI met her when we were out here house-hunting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Sage glances briefly up toward me. \u201cPoor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that, Becky.\u201d Luke looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cYes, well. It was quite bizarre. You\u2019ll never guess what she was doing.\u201d I feel a flash of triumph as Sage finally gives me her full attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that maniac doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was ...\u201d</p><p>I hesitate for a moment as Lois\u2019s pale, tense face flashes through my mind. Her pleading voice. Her hand on mine. I did promise to keep her secret, I think uncomfortably. And I\u2019ve kept that promise until now. (Except telling Suze. That doesn\u2019t count.)</p> <p>But, on the other hand, why should I protect her? She was breaking the law. Exactly. Exactly! I should really have marched her to the nearest police station. And then she tried to bribe me. Well, I\u2019m not someone who can be bribed. No way. Not Becky Brandon. Besides which ...</p><p>I mean, the point is ...</p><p>OK. The real, honest truth is, I\u2019m desperate to keep Sage\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cShe was shoplifting!\u201d The words pop out of my mouth before I can think about it any more. And if I wanted a reaction, I\u2019m not disappointed.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Sage\u2019s eyes flash, and she bangs the table with her hand. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoplifting?\u201d says Aran in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cCome here. Come!\u201d Sage pats the chair beside her. \u201cTell us all about it.\u201d</p><p>Trying to hide my delight, I hurry over to the table and sink down in the chair next to Sage.</p> <p>Oh God, my thighs are about twice the size of hers. Never mind. I\u2019ll just keep my gaze away from the general thigh direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sage is demanding eagerly. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in a sports shop on Rodeo Drive. She pinched three pairs of socks. I mean, she gave them back,\u201d I add hurriedly. \u201cI think it was just ... you know. A moment of madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you caught her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI chased her down the street,\u201d I admit. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who she was at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hero!\u201d Sage lifts a hand and high-fives me with her tiny, beringed hand. \u201cGo, Becky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea.\u201d Luke looks gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I promised I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve just told us.\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows at me and I feel an uneasy pang, which I squash down. Come on. It\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve blabbed to the whole world.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else, will you?\u201d I look around the table. \u201cIt was only three pairs of socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Sage pats my hand. \u201cYour secret\u2019s safe with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was lucky it was you that caught her and not store security,\u201d says Aran drily.</p><p>\u201cTypical. That witch always lands on her feet.\u201d Sage rolls her eyes. \u201cNow, if it had been me who caught her ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even go there.\u201d Aran gives a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between you two?\u201d I venture timidly. \u201cI know there was some kind of ... argument?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgument?\u201d Sage gives a snort. \u201cMore like a completely unprovoked attack. She\u2019s, like, a total psycho. She has a screw loose, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage.\u201d Aran sighs. \u201cThis is old ground.\u201d He glances at Luke. \u201cMaybe we could move on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!

She said she should have won Best Actress because she looked better than me in her movie. Hello? I was playing a cancer victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I stare at her, shocked. \u201cThat\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what she said? \u2018You don\u2019t get any acting awards for shaving off your hair.\u2019 \u201d Sage\u2019s eyes open wide. \u201cDo you know how much research I put into that role?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnyway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s getting what she deserves now.\u201d Sage\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cDid you hear about this sports film she\u2019s doing? Nightmare. Ten million over budget, and the director walked out. Everyone hates her. She\u2019s gonna go down.\u201d Her phone bleeps and she squints at it. \u201cOh. I have to go. You guys finish up without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go?\u201d Luke stares at her. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just started!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage, hon.\u201d Aran sighs again. \u201cWe cleared your schedule for this. We want to hear what Luke has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she repeats, shrugging. \u201cI forgot I have a class at Golden Peace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, cancel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to cancel it!\u201d she retorts, as though he\u2019s crazy. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you guys later.\u201d I can see Aran and Luke exchanging frustrated looks as she picks up her bag, but I\u2019m more interested in the fact that she\u2019s going to Golden Peace.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you go to Golden Peace a lot?\u201d I ask casually.</p><p>\u201cOh, all the time. It\u2019s amazing. You should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m planning to,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cI\u2019ll see you there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Golden Peace, Becky?\u201d says Luke, deadpan. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I avoid his quizzical gaze. \u201cI\u2019m going to sign up for some classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do it!\u201d says Sage earnestly. \u201cThat place is great. I have, like, huge self-esteem issues, and they\u2019ve really worked on them. I have self-assertion issues, too, self-acceptance issues ... I\u2019m battling some pretty big stuff.\u201d She flicks back her hair. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI\u2019m battling some big stuff too. I have ... er ... spending issues. I want to work on those.\u201d</p><p>I hear a snort from Luke\u2019s direction, which I choose to ignore.</p><p>Sage nods. \u201cThey have a good program for that. It\u2019s just a great place for getting your shit together. I mean, what good is all of this if we don\u2019t love ourselves, right?\u201d She spreads her arms wide. \u201cAnd how can we love ourselves if we don\u2019t get ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I nod too. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve always thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.

Finally I have something to tell Mum and Suze!</p><p>As soon as Sage has left, I hurry into the house and call Suze.</p><p>\u201cHey, Suze!\u201d I blurt out as soon as she answers. \u201cGuess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you guess what!\u201d she replies, her voice bubbling over with excitement. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to L.A.! I\u2019ve swung it with Tarkie. He\u2019s going to have a meeting with his investment people out there. I said to him, \u2018It\u2019s irresponsible to have investments in the States and not even know what they are.\u2019 So at last he agreed. And he really needs a break.\u201d She sighs. \u201cHe\u2019s still devastated about The Surge. Did you see the newspaper write-ups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple.\u201d I wince.</p><p>\u201cHis father keeps sending him newspaper clippings and saying he\u2019s disgraced the Cleath-Stuart name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in horror.</p><p>\u201cPoor Tarkie feels like such a failure. And the stupid thing is, the fountain works now. It\u2019s a brilliant tourist attraction. But everyone just remembers the launch going wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come out to L.A. as soon as you can,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk on the beach and forget all about it, and Tarkie will cheer up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I\u2019m looking into flights right now. I\u2019ve told the school we\u2019re taking the children on an educational sabbatical. L.A. is educational, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDefinitely! So how long are you coming for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Suze. \u201cAt least a month, maybe more. Tarkie needs some serious time off. A week won\u2019t do it. Oh, what was your news?\u201d she adds as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d I say casually. \u201cJust that I met Sage Seymour and we really got on and we\u2019re going to have coffee at Golden Peace.\u201d</p><p>Ha!</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Suze\u2019s voice blasts me away. \u201cCome on, spill! What was she like? What was she wearing? What did\u2014hang on,\u201d she interrupts herself. \u201cDid you say Golden Peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I try to sound nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cThe rehab place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarted by Alicia Bitch Long-legs\u2019s husband?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, are you insane? Why are you going there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ... um ... to go on the spending-addiction program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She actually splutters down the phone.</p><p>\u201cI want to work on my issues.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI have some big stuff to sort out.\u201d</p><p>Somehow when I say it to Suze it doesn\u2019t sound as convincing as it did before.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d she says in derision. \u201cYou just want to hang out with Sage Seymour and all the celebrities!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so what if I do?\u201d I say defensively.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re all weird,\u201d she says, sounding unhappy. \u201cBex, don\u2019t get weird on me, please.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m momentarily silenced. She\u2019s right. They are a bit weird. Alicia\u2019s totally weird. But, then, if I don\u2019t go to Golden Peace, how will I get to have coffee with Sage?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll only listen with one ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... all right.\u201d Suze sighs. \u201cBut don\u2019t get sucked in. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d I cross my fingers.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to admit the truth: I quite want to get sucked in. Because it\u2019s occurred to me that if Sage goes to Golden Peace, who else might go? What career opportunities might there be? What if I meet some famous director and we get talking about the costumes for his next film over herbal tea, or whatever they drink. (Probably coconut water or yam water. Or banana water. Something gross like that.)</p> <p>\u201cBex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I come to. \u201cSorry, Suze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, come on,\u201d she demands. \u201cWhat was Sage wearing? And don\u2019t leave anything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d I sit back happily, settling in for a proper long chat. L.A. is fab and exciting and everything\u2014but I do miss my best friend.</p><p>From: Kovitz, Danny</p><p>To: Kovitz, Danny</p><p>Subject: I\u2019m alive!!!!!!</p><p>dearest friends</p><p>i write this from training camp on the island of kulusuk. i have been here one day and already i know this will be a transformating experience for me. i\u2019ve never felt so alive. i have taken shots of the snow ice and the cute inuit people with their darling clothes. i am ready for the challenge. i am ready to push myself. i am ready to be at one with the soaring powerful nature that is around me. it is a mystical experience. i feel proud and humbled and enlivened and excited. i will see landscapes few people have ever seen. i will push myself to the brink. my new collection will be based on the experience.</p><p>all my love and wish me luck. i will email again from the next camp.</p><p>danny xxxxx</p><p>All I can say is ... wow. I mean, namaste. Or maybe satnam? (I\u2019ve been learning lots of spiritual, yoga-ish words and trying to use them in conversation. Except that \u201csatnam\u201d always makes me think of \u201csatnav.\u201d)</p><p>Why have I never got into mind-body-spirit before? Why did I never do well-being classes in England? Or Navigate Your Inner Terrain? Or Sound Healing for Childhood Damage? I\u2019ve been attending Golden Peace for two weeks now, and it\u2019s transformed my life. It\u2019s just amazing!</p><p>For a start, the place is fantastic. It\u2019s a huge site on the coast, just south of L.A. It used to be a golf club, but now it\u2019s all low sandy-colored buildings and koi lakes and a running track, which I\u2019m totally intending to use sometime. Plus they sell fresh juices, and healthy meals, and there\u2019s free yoga at lunchtime on the beach, and in the evenings they show inspirational movies outside while everyone lolls on beanbags. Basically, you don\u2019t ever want to leave.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in a room with a dark-wood floor and billowing white curtains at the windows and softly fragranced air. All the rooms at Golden Peace smell the same\u2014it\u2019s their signature scent of ylang-ylang and cedar and ... some other healthy thing. You can buy the scented candles at the gift shop. I\u2019ve already bought eight, because they\u2019ll make perfect Christmas presents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All the spending-addiction programs were full when I phoned up, but that doesn\u2019t matter, because this really nice girl, Izola, recommended a whole program of general well-being classes for me. The point is, everyone can work on their soul and inner being, because the spiritual muscle needs exercise like any other. (I read that in the brochure.)</p><p>I do self-esteem group on Mondays, Compassionate Communication on Tuesdays, The Transitive Self on Wednesdays, and this brilliant class called Tapping for Well-Being on Fridays. Right now it\u2019s a Thursday morning, and I\u2019m in Mindfulness for a Positive Life. At the start of the class, the teacher always says how hard mindfulness is and how it will take time to let go of the outside world, and we mustn\u2019t be impatient with ourselves. But, actually, I find it easy. I think I must be a natural.</p><p>The group is quiet, and we\u2019re all meditating on something in the room, which is what we do every week. Luckily, the people at Golden Peace are all really stylish, so there\u2019s always something interesting to meditate on. Today I\u2019m focusing on a gorgeous leather backpack in teal, which the dark-haired girl opposite me has slung below her chair. I want to ask her if they come in slate gray, but perhaps I\u2019ll do that after the class.</p><p>\u201cBrian,\u201d says our teacher, Mona, in a soft voice. \u201cCould you please vocalize for us your mindfulness journey today? What are you meditating on?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen Brian before. He\u2019s tall and buff with quite a prominent nose, which is unusual in L.A., and he brings in a Starbucks, although I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not allowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m focusing on the grain in the wooden floor,\u201d says Brian, in a stilted voice. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the way the wood swirls around and ebbs and flows. I want to think about my ex-wife, but I\u2019m going to push those thoughts away.\u201d He sounds suddenly fierce. \u201cI\u2019m not going to think about her or her lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian, don\u2019t judge yourself,\u201d says Mona gently. \u201cSimply allow your thoughts to return to the floor. Absorb every detail. Every line, every speck, every curve. Be in the moment. Try to reach a heightened sense of awareness.\u201d</p><p>Brian exhales. \u201cI\u2019m in the moment,\u201d he says shakily, his eyes riveted on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Mona smiles. \u201cNow, Rebecca?\u201d She turns to me. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard much from you. How is your meditation going today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d I beam at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you meditating on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bag.\u201d I point. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The dark-haired girl smiles.</p><p>\u201cA bag.\u201d Mona blinks. \u201cThat\u2019s different. Are you focusing on the texture of the bag ... the buckles ... the color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe straps,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cThe straps. Good. Perhaps you could share your meditation with us. Just ... give us a stream of consciousness. Take us where your thoughts are going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cWell, I\u2019m thinking that those straps look really comfortable, but it depends how wide your shoulders are, doesn\u2019t it? So then I\u2019m wondering if I could try it after the class. And I\u2019d prefer it in slate gray because I\u2019ve already got a teal leather bag, but, actually, I might give that to my friend Suze because she\u2019s always liked it, and she\u2019s coming out to visit me. In fact, she\u2019s arriving today! And then I\u2019m wondering if they stock them in Barneys, because I\u2019ve got a gift voucher for there, although I have also seen this really nice jacket for my daughter, Minnie, in the children\u2019s department, which I want to get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca, stop!\u201d Mona holds up a hand, and I come to a halt in surprise. \u201cStop there!\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s wrong? I thought I was doing really well. I was much more interesting than Brian, with his boring old grainy wood.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say politely.</p><p>\u201cRebecca\u2014let\u2019s remind ourselves of what mindfulness means. It means we bring our attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nod. \u201cMy present experience is thinking about that bag,\u201d I explain. \u201cIs it by Alexander Wang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s 3.1 Phillip Lim,\u201d says the girl. \u201cI got it online.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cWhich site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand,\u201d Mona cuts across me. \u201cRebecca, try to focus on just one aspect of the bag. As soon as you notice your mind wandering off, gently bring it back to the object of attention. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my mind didn\u2019t wander off,\u201d I protest. \u201cI was thinking about the bag the whole time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can send you the link,\u201d chimes in the dark-haired girl. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great backpack. You can fit an iPad in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, can I try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The girl reaches for the bag.</p><p>\u201cPeople!\u201d Mona\u2019s voice sounds a little sharp, and she immediately smiles as though to compensate. \u201cPut the bag down! OK! Let\u2019s ... focus. Rebecca, I\u2019m going to recommend that you leave the bag meditation for now. Instead, try to concentrate on your breathing. Become aware of your breath going in and out of your body. Don\u2019t judge it ... don\u2019t judge yourself ... just observe your breath. Can you do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cGreat! We\u2019ll take five minutes\u2019 meditation, all of us. Close your eyes if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>The room lapses into silence, and I dutifully try to focus on my breath. In. Out. In. Out. In.</p><p>God, this is boring. What is there to think about breathing?</p><p>I know I\u2019m not an expert on mindfulness, but surely meditation is supposed to make you feel good. Well, I\u2019d feel much better if I was meditating on a lovely bag than on my breathing.</p> <p>My eyes open and drift to the backpack. No one can tell what I\u2019m meditating on. I\u2019ll say it was my breath. They\u2019ll never know.</p><p>Oh, I really do love it. The zips are so cool. And the point is, I should get it because backpacks are good for your posture. Suze will be delighted if I give her my Marc Jacobs. Surreptitiously, I glance at my watch. I wonder where she is. At the airport, hopefully. Her plane should have landed by now, and I\u2019ve told her to come straight here for lunch. Thank God it isn\u2019t all coconut water; they serve a decent decaf cappuccino and some quite yummy carob brownies, and Suze said she\u2019d bring me out some Lion bars ...</p><p>\u201cAnd gradually bring your thoughts back to the group.\u201d Mona\u2019s voice interrupts my meditation. Around the room, people open their eyes and stretch their legs, and a couple yawn. Mona smiles at me. \u201cHow was that? Did you manage to keep your mind focused, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes!\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>Which is sort of true. My thoughts were focused, just not on my breathing.</p><p>We end with a minute\u2019s silent contemplation and then file out of the room, onto the grounds, blinking as we reenter the bright sunlight. At once, everyone who was in the class switches their phones back on and stares at them intently. That\u2019s mindfulness, if you ask me. We should meditate on our phones. In fact, I might suggest it next week\u2014</p> <p>Yessss! A text bleeps in my phone, and I nearly whoop. It\u2019s from Suze! She\u2019s here!</p><p>OK, here\u2019s the thing about Suze. She\u2019s one of the most beautiful people I know, and I\u2019m not being biased. She\u2019s tall and slim and she has amazing clothes. She can totally shop for Britain and she once nearly modeled for Vogue. But she does tend to spend quite a lot of time in jodhpurs or jeans or some ancient old Barbour, especially now that she lives in the country all the time. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m expecting to see as I hurry toward the entrance gates. Suze in skinny jeans and ballet pumps, with maybe a nice linen jacket, and the children in their usual bumpy corduroy pinafores and shorts, handmade by Nanny.</p><p>What I\u2019m not expecting to see is the vision before me. I have to blink to make sure it\u2019s the Cleath-Stuarts. They look like some celebrity L.A. family. What\u2019s happened?</p><p>Suze looks so spectacular I barely recognize her. For a start, she\u2019s wearing teeny denim shorts. I mean, really, really teeny. Her legs are long and brown, and her pedicured feet are in Havaianas. Her long hair is blonder than usual (has she bleached it?) and she\u2019s wearing the most amazing pair of Pucci sunglasses. The children look super-cool too. The two boys are wearing bomber jackets and gel in their hair, and Clementine is rocking teeny little skinny jeans with a tank top.</p><p>For a moment I can\u2019t do anything except blink in astonishment. Then Suze sees me and starts waving frantically, and I come to life again and rush forward.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made it!\u201d I fling my arms round her, then hug all the children in turn. \u201cSuze, your clothes!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre they OK?\u201d Suze says at once, anxiously, and brushes at her micro-shorts. \u201cI wanted to fit in. Do I look all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look phenomenal! Did you spray that tan on?\u201d I spot an inked dolphin on her ankle and gasp. \u201cSuze, you haven\u2019t gone and got yourself a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s temporary. Everyone\u2019s got tattoos in L.A., so I thought I\u2019d better have one for the trip. And some friendship bracelets.\u201d She waves her arm at me, and I see a stack of about twenty friendship bracelets on her wrist, where normally she has an antique Cartier watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very thorough!\u201d I say, impressed. \u201cYou look totally L.A.

And no, he hasn\u2019t done the same.\u201d She looks suddenly disconsolate. \u201cHe won\u2019t join in. I bought him this really cool ripped T-shirt and cutoffs, but he won\u2019t wear them. I can\u2019t get him out of his shooting coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis shooting coat? In L.A.?\u201d I stifle a giggle. Tarquin\u2019s shooting coat is an institution. It\u2019s made of the family tweed and has about ninety-five pockets and smells of wet dog all year round.</p><p>\u201cExactly! I wanted him to wear a leather bomber jacket, but he refused. He thinks friendship bracelets are stupid and my tattoo is ghastly.\u201d She looks indignant. \u201cIt isn\u2019t ghastly. It\u2019s cool!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d I say reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cI just thought it would be a chance for him to break away, you know?\u201d Suze\u2019s indignation fades to a familiar anxiety. \u201cHe needs to stop moping. He needs to forget about his father and the LHA and all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe LHA?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She grimaces. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? It\u2019s the Letherby Hall Association. They\u2019re members of the public who support Letherby Hall. They\u2019ve started a petition against the fountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim in dismay.</p> <p>\u201cI know. And then another lot of them have started a petition for the fountain. They hate each other. They\u2019re all nuts.\u201d She shudders. \u201cAnyway, forget about that. Are there any celebs here?\u201d Her eyes dart all around as we walk along the path toward the leisure area. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve started coming to Golden Peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cThere are brilliant groups, and yoga, and they serve brownies....\u201d I pause at a paved area with bronze bells set into small stone pillars all around. \u201cThese are Paths of Serenity, by the way,\u201d I add. \u201cYou can ring the bells if you need clarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClarity?\u201d Suze raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes. You know. Clarity in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get clarity in your life from ringing a bell?\u201d She snorts with laughter as she pings one of the bells.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cYou need to keep an open mind, Suze. It\u2019s, like, a vibration thing. The chiming of the bell changes the rhythm of your inner ear, promoting understanding and resolution and ... er ...\u201d Oh God, I\u2019ve forgotten the rest. \u201cAnyway, they sound nice,\u201d I finish lamely.</p> <p>It was Bryce, the personal-growth leader, who explained to me about vibrations and clarity, during my induction session, and I totally understood at the time. I\u2019ll have to ask him to explain again.</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden violent clanging all around us. Suze\u2019s children have decided to have a go at bashing the bells. Ernest, who is my godson, is actually kickboxing his, and it\u2019s nearly coming off its pillar.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Suze says, dragging them away. \u201cToo much clarity! Can we get a cup of\u2014\u201d She stops herself. \u201cA smoothie?\u201d</p><p>Ha. She was going to say \u201ccup of tea.\u201d I know she was.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want a cup of tea, Suze?\u201d I say, to tease her. \u201cAnd a nice digestive biscuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she says at once. \u201cI\u2019d far rather have a fresh juice. With a wheatgrass shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d she says obstinately.</p> <p>She so wants a cup of tea. But I won\u2019t wind her up any more. She can have one when we get home. I\u2019ve bought English tea bags especially, and Cooper\u2019s Oxford Marmalade and Branston Pickle.</p><p>I lead them all to the leisure area, where there\u2019s a caf\u00e9 and a children\u2019s playground. Nearby, some guys are playing volleyball, and about a hundred yards away there\u2019s a tai chi class going on under the trees.</p><p>\u201cHow come they have a playground?\u201d says Suze, as the children all run off to the swings and we sit down at a caf\u00e9 table. \u201cThey don\u2019t have children here, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I say knowledgeably. \u201cBut the residents often have their families to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResidents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. The burned-out drug-addict rehab ones. They live over there.\u201d I gesture at a gated enclosure within the resort. \u201cApparently there\u2019s some major, major A-list star in residence at the moment. But no one will say who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShall we walk past and casually peek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried,\u201d I say regretfully. \u201cThe security people shoo you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are other celebs here, aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Loads!\u201d I\u2019m about to elaborate when I notice a staff member walking nearby. \u201cBut of course that\u2019s all really hush-hush, so I can\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d I add hastily.</p> <p>Actually, the truth is, I\u2019ve only seen a couple of celebs in groups, and they weren\u2019t much to speak of. One was a Victoria\u2019s Secret model and held up our entire self-esteem group by making us sign individual confidentiality agreements. Then she\u2019d spelled her name wrong and we all had to change Brandie to Brandee and initial it. And then she didn\u2019t say anything remotely interesting anyway. I mean, honestly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have coffee with Sage Seymour,\u201d I offer, and Suze wrinkles her brow, dissatisfied.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you going to do that two weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, she\u2019s been busy\u2014\u201d I break off as my eye catches a figure walking toward us.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I breathe. \u201cTarquin looks terrible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know!\u201d says Suze. \u201cExactly! He could at least have worn jeans.\u201d</p><p>But that\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m not looking at his tweed shooting jacket, or his ancient brogues, or the mustard-colored knitted tie around his neck. It\u2019s his face. He looks so wan. And there\u2019s a stooped slant to his shoulders that I don\u2019t remember.</p><p>Luke often gets hassled by his business, too, I find myself thinking. But it\u2019s different. He built his own company up himself. He drove it. He created it. Whereas Tarquin just had a massive empire plonked on his shoulders when his grandfather died. And right now it looks like it\u2019s too heavy for him.</p><p>\u201cTarkie!\u201d I hurry forward to greet him. \u201cWelcome to Hollywood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Ahm.\u201d He raises a meager little smile. \u201cYes. Hollywood. Marvelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarkie, take off your shooting coat!\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou must be boiling. In fact, why not take your shirt off too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake my shirt off? In public?\u201d Tarquin looks scandalized, and I hide a giggle. I\u2019d better not take him to visit Venice Beach.</p><p>\u201cGet some sun! It\u2019s good for you! Look, all those men there have taken their shirts off.\u201d Suze points encouragingly to the volleyball players on the beach, who are mostly dressed in cutoffs and bandannas.</p><p>Suze can be quite bossy when she wants to, and within thirty seconds Tarkie has taken off his shooting coat, his tie, his shirt, and his socks and shoes. To my amazement, he\u2019s quite tanned and muscled.</p><p>\u201cTarkie, have you been working out?\u201d I say in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been helping with the fencing on the estate,\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind taking your shirt off for that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on my own land,\u201d says Tarkie, as though it\u2019s obvious. \u201cSuze, darling, I think I\u2019ll put my shirt back on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Now, put these on.\u201d She hands him a pair of Ray-Bans. \u201cThere! Brilliant.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just about to take pity on Tarquin and offer to get him some Earl Grey tea when the volleyball bounces near us, and Suze leaps up to get it. A bronzed guy in cutoffs and a Golden Peace T-shirt comes running up, and as he draws near I see that it\u2019s Bryce.</p> <p>He\u2019s quite amazing, Bryce. He\u2019s got the most piercing blue eyes you\u2019ve ever seen, and he stares at you very intently before he says anything. I don\u2019t know how old he is\u2014his hair is graying but he\u2019s incredibly lithe and energetic. He doesn\u2019t seem to take any groups, but he wanders round and gets to know people and says things like Your journey begins here and really seems to mean it.</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d His eyes crinkle into a smile. \u201cHow\u2019s your day going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally well, thanks!\u201d I beam at him. \u201cBryce, these are my friends Suze and Tarquin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your ball,\u201d says Suze, handing it to him. She flicks her hair back a little self-consciously, and I can see her sucking in her stomach, not that she needs to.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bryce turns his dazzling smile on her. \u201cWelcome, both of you.\u201d His eyes fall on Tarquin\u2019s shooting coat. \u201cCool jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cAhm. My shooting coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShooting coat.\u201d Bryce\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a great idea. I guess it works in all weathers, right? And great pockets. May I?\u201d Bryce picks up the coat and examines it admiringly.</p><p>\u201cUseful for cartridges,\u201d says Tarkie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou shoot on film?\u201d Bryce glances up, interested. \u201cOld school, huh. Excuse me for asking, but ... do I know your work?\u201d</p><p>I hear Suze give a sudden snuffle of laughter, just as I catch on myself: Bryce thinks Tarkie\u2019s a director. Tarkie! I cannot think of anyone in my life less likely to direct a film.</p><p>\u201cMy work?\u201d Tarquin looks slightly hunted. \u201cYou mean ... the work on Letherby Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetherby Hall.\u201d Bryce frowns. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it, I\u2019m afraid. Was it released worldwide?\u201d</p> <p>Tarquin seems totally baffled. I catch Suze\u2019s eye and try not to burst into giggles.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow.\u201d Bryce bounces the ball a couple of times. \u201cYou want to join in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolleyball.\u201d He gestures at the guys waiting for him on the beach.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tarquin looks taken aback. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo on!\u201d says Suze. \u201cGo on, Tarkie. It\u2019s just what you need after the flight.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Tarquin gets to his feet and follows Bryce down onto the beach. A few moments later he\u2019s in the game, and hitting some pretty good shots, I notice.</p><p>\u201cTarkie\u2019s excellent at volleyball!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, he\u2019s quite good at that kind of thing,\u201d says Suze vaguely. \u201cHe played Fives for Eton. That Bryce is something, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not even watching her own husband. Her eyes are fixed on Bryce. This is what he\u2019s like. Everyone gets a crush on him, male and female alike.</p><p>A waiter comes over and I order lots of different juices for us and the children, and I\u2019m about to ask Suze what she wants to do first, like maybe the Walk of Fame or Rodeo Drive or the Hollywood sign ... when I notice someone out of the corner of my eye. A blond someone, wandering down toward the beach, in white yoga pants and a pink racing-back top.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d I mutter, turning my head away swiftly. \u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Suze immediately swivels her head all around. \u201cSomeone famous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone hideous in every way.\u201d</p><p>Suze suddenly spots her and gasps, \u201cAlicia Bitch Long-legs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d I pull at Suze. \u201cTurn away. Don\u2019t engage. Aloof and flinty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Suze vaguely, without moving.</p><p>I\u2019d related the whole awful Alicia encounter to Suze on the phone, but she was waxing her legs at the same time, and I\u2019m not sure she was listening properly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lost weight,\u201d says Suze critically. \u201cAnd her hair looks really good. I like her top\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop complimenting her! And don\u2019t attract her attention.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s too late. Alicia\u2019s heading our way. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve seen her at Golden Peace, but it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s actually come over to speak to me. In Golden Peace terms, Alicia is virtually royalty. There\u2019s a great big picture of her and Wilton up in the lobby, and when the pair of them walked through the crowded caf\u00e9 last week, everyone was practically bowing. Everyone except me.</p><p>\u201cSuze.\u201d Alicia doesn\u2019t even look at me but greets Suze with her new soft voice, and I see Suze blink in surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Alicia,\u201d says Suze warily.</p><p>\u201cYou must be here visiting Rebecca. Are those your children?\u201d She turns to look at Ernest, Wilfrid, and Clementine, who are running raucously round the slide. \u201cThey\u2019re stunning! And I love those cute little jackets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks!\u201d says Suze. She sounds disarmed, and I scowl inwardly. That\u2019s a typical underhanded trick. Compliment the children.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you here?\u201d adds Alicia.</p><p>\u201cNot sure yet,\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cOnly I was going to say, if you\u2019d like them to go to school during your stay, I could fix it up. Our children go to a very good preschool, don\u2019t they, Rebecca?\u201d She manages to glance toward me without meeting my eye. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a private school nearby, which might do for the older one. I should think he\u2019s quite advanced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Suze blossoms. \u201cHe is quite bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have a word with the principals. It might be fun for them to experience a U.S. education briefly. The semester\u2019s nearly over, but then there are some great summer programs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Suze seems taken aback. \u201cWell, that would be great. But are you sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d Alicia gives her wafty smile again, then turns serious. \u201cSuze, I know our friendship hasn\u2019t always been straightforward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Friendship?

Let\u2019s carry on life\u2019s journey in a different spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Suze seems totally flummoxed. Meanwhile, I\u2019m just staring, rigid with shock. She said sorry? She said sorry to Suze?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know about the schools.\u201d Alicia smiles and touches Suze\u2019s shoulder, as though giving a blessing. She nods gravely to me, then moves off, down toward the beach.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Suze exhales when she\u2019s out of earshot. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to her? That weird voice, and that smile ... and all that stuff about remolding her life ...\u201d She looks at me, giggling, but I can\u2019t join in.</p><p>\u201cShe said sorry to you,\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Suze looks chuffed. \u201cThat was sweet, I thought. And it was nice of her to offer to help with the schools\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I clutch my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! She refused to say sorry to me! After everything she did to Luke and me, she wouldn\u2019t apologize. I asked her to, straight out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d Suze thinks for a moment. \u201cMaybe she was too embarrassed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmbarrassed? Alicia Bitch Long-legs doesn\u2019t get embarrassed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she thought she\u2019d already apologized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sticking up for her.\u201d I stare at Suze in dismay. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d stick up for Alicia Bitch Long-legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sticking up for her!\u201d ripostes Suze. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, people change, and\u2014\u201d She breaks off as our drinks arrive, and the waitress presents us with two Golden Peace gift bags: glossy white with golden rope handles.</p><p>\u201cAlicia asked me to give you these.\u201d She smiles. \u201cA little welcome pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh! Thank you!\u201d says Suze, and starts unpacking hers straightaway. \u201cLook, bath oil ... and a candle ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re accepting it?\u201d I say, scandalized.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d says Suze, rolling her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s an olive branch. She\u2019s changed. You should let people change, Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d I glare at Suze. \u201cIf she\u2019d changed she would apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did apologize!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me!\u201d I practically yell. \u201cNot to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Bex.\u201d Suze pauses halfway through unwrapping some herbal tea bags. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let\u2019s argue. Especially not about Alicia, for goodness\u2019 sake! I think you should have your goody bag and enjoy it. Go on.\u201d She prods me with a teasing smile. \u201cOpen it. I know you want to....\u201d</p><p>Even though I\u2019m still simmering inside, I can\u2019t argue any more with Suze. Especially on her first day here. So I make a huge effort and smile back. I\u2019ll never get her to understand about Alicia, I think dolefully. Maybe no one will ever properly understand except Luke (kind of) and me, and I just have to accept that.</p><p>Reluctantly, I pull the gift bag toward me and open it. I\u2019ve got a candle, too, and some olive-oil soap, and ... wow. A Golden Peace bikini. I\u2019ve seen those in the shop, and they\u2019re a hundred dollars.</p> <p>I mean, it\u2019s nice. But it doesn\u2019t change Alicia.</p><p>\u201cI really want one of those white-and-gold bracelets,\u201d says Suze, eyeing mine. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take some classes. Let\u2019s have a look....\u201d She opens the brochure, which was in the bag, then a moment later puts it down, her eyes wide. \u201cBex, this place costs a fortune! How many times a week do you come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day?\u201d Suze is goggle-eyed. \u201cBut how much does that cost?\u201d She starts flicking through the brochure, gasping at every page. \u201cHave you seen how much a yoga class costs? I pay a fifth of that in London.\u201d</p><p>She seems so flabbergasted, I feel a bit defensive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about money, Suze. It\u2019s about mental health and spiritual well-being and my personal journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d she says skeptically. \u201cWell, have they stopped you shopping too much?\u201d</p><p>I wait for a beat, then answer with a flourish: \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Suze drops the brochure and stares at me with huge blue eyes. \u201cBex, did you say \u2018yes\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Ha. Ha-di-ha. I was waiting for this subject to come up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say smugly. \u201cI had a special one-to-one session yesterday with David, one of the therapists, and we talked through my issues, and he gave me lots of coping mechanisms. I\u2019m a changed person, Suze!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d says Suze weakly. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... what, you walk into a shop and you don\u2019t want to buy anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d I say kindly. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey, Suze. We\u2019re all on a journey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, how does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you! Come on, we\u2019ll go to the gift shop.\u201d</p><p>I drain my juice and leap up, by now totally cheered. I\u2019m longing to show off all my new techniques.

We\u2019ll just be in the shop, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cWe can see the playground from the shop. Come on!\u201d</p> <p>To be honest, I\u2019ve been quite amazed at my own spectacular progress. When David came to find me at lunch one day and suggested a one-to-one session to \u201cdiscuss my shopping issues,\u201d I wasn\u2019t that keen. In fact, I said, \u201cWow, that sounds fab, but actually I\u2019m a bit too busy.\u201d</p><p>Then, when he set up a session anyway, I accidentally-on-purpose forgot to turn up. And then, when he came to find me in yoga, I ... Well. I avoided him.</p><p>OK, I ran away and hid behind a tree. Which I do appreciate was a bit childish. But he tracked me down in the caf\u00e9 later that day and talked really sweetly to me and said if I hated what he said I could ignore it all.</p><p>So at last I had the session. And all I can say is, why did I never do this before? David kept saying, \u201cThese are the first baby steps\u201d and \u201cI know you\u2019ll find these ideas hard,\u201d and I agreed because I sensed that was what he wanted me to say. But, honestly, I found them easy. I must be mentally very strong, or something.</p><p>He talked about \u201cwhy people shop,\u201d and he told me about lots of different techniques that we could work on together, and then he told me how the lessons I\u2019m learning in my other classes, like Mindfulness for a Positive Life and Tapping for Well-Being, all feed into the same picture. And I nodded earnestly and took notes and then we talked about how I could go into the spending-addiction program when a space becomes available.</p><p>But the truth is, I don\u2019t need to go into any spending-addiction program. I\u2019m clearly a very fast learner, because I\u2019ve totally got it. I have control over myself! I can\u2019t wait to show Suze.</p> <p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d I push open the doors to the gift shop. I have to say, it\u2019s the most gorgeous shop. It\u2019s all pale wood and scented candles burning, and everywhere you look is some beautiful, uplifting thing to help you on your journey, like a cashmere yoga hoodie, or a soft leather-bound \u201cthought diary,\u201d or positive affirmations printed on canvases. There\u2019s a jewelry range, which is all made of organic crystals, and there are stacks of books and CDs, and even a range of \u201chealing energy\u201d makeup.</p><p>I look at Suze, waiting for her to say, Wow, what an amazing shop! But she\u2019s just staring at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat now? Do you just look around and think, No, I don\u2019t want any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a process,\u201d I say patiently, and get out my notebook. \u201cFirst of all, I have to think, Why am I shopping? And I have to write it down.\u201d I look at the list of suggestions David gave me. Am I bored? No. Lonely? No. Anxious? No. For a moment I\u2019m stumped. Why am I shopping?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put: To show friend that I don\u2019t shop too much anymore,\u201d I say at last. I write it down and underline it proudly.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing shopping can often be a way of boosting low self-esteem,\u201d I say knowledgeably. \u201cSo I have to boost my self-esteem myself, with affirmations.\u201d I get out the positive-thoughts cards that David gave me and riffle through them. \u201cLike this: I approve of myself and feel great about myself.\u201d I beam at Suze. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great? I\u2019ve got loads of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see!\u201d she says at once, holding out her hand.</p> <p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d I hand her a card that says I accept others as they are, and they in turn accept me as I am. \u201cYou can buy them here,\u201d I add. \u201cAnd you can get really nice T-shirts with the affirmations printed on. Shall we try some on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry on T-shirts?\u201d Suze stares at me. \u201cBex, I thought you\u2019d given up shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t given up shopping.\u201d I almost laugh at her na\u00efve, simplistic attitude. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about, Suze. It\u2019s not about abstinence, it\u2019s about getting into a healthy shopping pattern.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s the lesson that stuck with me from the session yesterday. It\u2019s not about giving up shopping. As soon as David said that, the whole thing made more sense to me.</p><p>\u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t it be healthier not to shop at all?\u201d Suze demands. \u201cI mean, shouldn\u2019t we leave?\u201d</p><p>Suze really doesn\u2019t get it. But, then, she isn\u2019t as tuned in to her inner mental landscape as I am.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very bad idea to give up shopping altogether,\u201d I explain. \u201cYou have to learn to exercise your control muscle. Being in here is like a workout for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Suze looks dubious. \u201cSo what happens next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll just make the purchases I need to, calmly and with meaning.\u201d</p><p>I love that phrase. David kept saying it yesterday: \u201cYou need to learn to shop calmly and with meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t need to buy anything,\u201d objects Suze.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do! I need a book, actually. David told me to buy it. So.\u201d I lead the way over to the cognitive-behavioral-therapy section and reach for a book titled Catching Thoughts: Your Introduction to CBT.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what I do in my group,\u201d I say importantly, pointing at the title. \u201cCognitive behavioral therapy. If I want to buy something and it\u2019s not appropriate, I have to restructure my thoughts. I have to identify my cognitive errors and challenge them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d For the first time, Suze looks genuinely impressed. \u201cIs that hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s quite easy,\u201d I say, flipping through the book. \u201cI\u2019ll get the audio version, too, so I can listen to it when I\u2019m out jogging. And there are some other titles David said I should look at.\u201d</p><p>I start scooping hardbacks into my basket. CBT Thought Diary, CBT for Spending Addiction, The Compulsive Spender\u2019s Journal, Shopaholic: Break the Pattern ... As I pile the books up, I feel a glow of virtue. David was right: I can break free of my old ways. There are some really cool pencils, too, matte black with slogans like Growth and Exhale. I\u2019ll get a pack.</p><p>Suze is watching me, a bit nonplussed. \u201cBut, Bex, how is this different from normal shopping? Where\u2019s the challenging or whatever it is?\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. I\u2019d forgotten about that, just for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cI was coming to that,\u201d I say, a little severely. \u201cYou put the things in your basket and then you challenge yourself.\u201d</p><p>I lift up the top book and stare at it intently. I\u2019m actually a bit hazy about what I should do next, not that I\u2019ll admit that to Suze.</p><p>\u201cI need this book,\u201d I say at last, in a sonorous voice. \u201cThis is my belief. The evidence for this belief is: David told me I should get it. The evidence against it is ... none. So. I will buy it, calmly and with meaning. Amen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen?\u201d Suze gives a sudden giggle.</p><p>\u201cThat just slipped out,\u201d I admit. \u201cAnyway, wasn\u2019t that cool? I\u2019ve totally learned how to challenge myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the pencils now,\u201d Suze says.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I take the pencils out and focus on them. \u201cI need these pencils. This is my belief. The evidence for this belief is: Pencils are always useful. The evidence against is\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stop dead as a thought strikes me. I\u2019ve already bought a pack of these pencils, haven\u2019t I? The first day I came here. What did I do with them?</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence against,\u201d I continue triumphantly, \u201cis that I\u2019ve already got some! So I\u2019m going to put them back!\u201d</p><p>With a flourish, I put the pack of pencils back on the shelf. \u201cYou see? I\u2019m controlling myself. I\u2019m a completely different person. Impressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK. But what about all those books?\u201d Suze nods at my basket. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t need so many.\u201d</p><p>Hasn\u2019t she been listening to anything I\u2019ve been saying?</p><p>\u201cOf course I need them,\u201d I say as patiently as I can. \u201cThey\u2019re essential for my progress. I\u2019m going to buy them calmly and with meaning.\u201d I reach for a gorgeous notepad. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy this calmly and with meaning too. I can keep my dream journal in it. Everyone should keep a dream journal, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Suze still looks dissatisfied as I put it in my basket. \u201cAll right, so suppose you do shop too much,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat do you do then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you use different techniques,\u201d I explain. \u201cLike tapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s tapping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s brilliant,\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cYou tap your face and chin and stuff, and you say mantras, and it frees your meridians and cures you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suze stares at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>Tapping is almost my favorite class. Plus, I think it must be very good for toning the facial muscles, tapping your chin the whole time. I put my basket down and turn to demonstrate.</p><p>\u201cYou tap your forehead and you say, \u2018I know I have bought too much, but I deeply and completely accept myself.\u2019 See?\u201d I beam at her. \u201cEasy.\u201d I tap my chest for good measure, and the top of my head.</p> <p>\u201cBex ...\u201d Suze seems perplexed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re doing it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m doing it right!\u201d</p><p>The trouble with Suze is, she hasn\u2019t had her mind opened, like I have. She hasn\u2019t been exposed to the wealth of mind-spirit enhancement that\u2019s out there.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll learn the ways of Golden Peace after you\u2019ve been here a bit,\u201d I say kindly. \u201cNow, let\u2019s try on T-shirts!\u201d</p><p>I would have thought Suze would be more impressed by Golden Peace. I think she\u2019s got a mental block. She\u2019s prejudiced, that\u2019s what it is. She hasn\u2019t signed up for a single class, and she didn\u2019t even buy a T-shirt. All she keeps saying is, she thinks it\u2019s all really expensive and what\u2019s the point?</p><p>The point? Hasn\u2019t she noticed how transformed I am? Luckily, Tarkie is on my side. He thinks Golden Peace is great, and he\u2019s really bonded with Bryce.</p><p>\u201cWe both think exactly the same way about light pollution,\u201d he\u2019s saying now. It\u2019s breakfast time the next day, and we\u2019re all gathered in the kitchen. \u201cLight pollution is a modern evil, but politicians simply won\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>I can see Suze rolling her eyes, and I give her a little smile. Tarkie is so obsessed about light pollution, he goes around Letherby Hall all the time switching off lights, and Suze creeps after him, switching them back on.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I approach the table triumphantly, holding a plate. \u201cHere\u2019s our healthy L.A. breakfast. It\u2019s a steamed egg-white omelet, made with kale.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence around the table. Everyone is looking at the plate in horror.</p><p>OK, I admit it doesn\u2019t look exactly like an omelet. It\u2019s kind of white and shapeless, and the kale has turned gray-green. But it\u2019s healthy.</p><p>\u201cA steamed omelet?\u201d says Suze at last.</p><p>\u201cI did it in the microwave, in a Ziploc bag,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019s fat-free. Who\u2019d like the first one?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence.</p><p>\u201cAhm ... it looks delicious, I must say.\u201d Tarquin plunges in. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have any kippers, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any kippers!\u201d I say, a bit rattled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Scotland, it\u2019s L.A., and everyone eats steamed omelets.\u201d</p><p>Luke finally looks up from the letter he\u2019s been reading. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he says in horror, then sees my face and adjusts his expression. \u201cI mean ... what\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a steamed omelet.\u201d I prod it disconsolately.</p><p>They\u2019re right; it does look disgusting. And I spent ages separating all the eggs and chopping up all the kale. The recipe was in a book called Power Brunch, and I thought everyone would be really impressed. I don\u2019t dare tell them about the mushroom protein shake, which I\u2019ve got waiting in the blender.</p><p>\u201cBex, where are the egg yolks you didn\u2019t use?\u201d says Suze suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIn a bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t I make an omelet with them?\u201d</p><p>Before I can stop her, Suze is heating up a pan, putting lashings of butter into it, and frying up the most delicious, yellow, crispy omelet I\u2019ve ever seen, together with ribbons of bacon, which she got from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>She puts it on the table, and everyone falls on it. I take a forkful myself and nearly die with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThey should do egg-yolk omelets in restaurants,\u201d says Suze, her mouth full. \u201cWhy\u2019s everyone so obsessed by egg whites anyway? They don\u2019t taste of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d says Suze robustly. \u201cWe feed egg yolks to our lambs and they\u2019re perfectly healthy.\u201d</p><p>Luke is pouring coffee for everyone, Suze is slathering marmalade on a slice of toast, and spirits have generally lifted.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Luke looks around the table. \u201cI\u2019ve had an invitation today. Who fancies coming to a gala benefit at the Beverly Hilton hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d Suze and I exclaim simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for ...\u201d He squints at the letter. \u201cVictims of discrimination. Some new charity.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI read about that!\u201d says Suze in excitement. \u201cSalma Hayek will be there!

Jolly talented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe! She\u2019s jolly talented!\u201d Suze sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll have to coach you before we go. Here, read this, for a start.\u201d She passes him a copy of Us Weekly, just as Minnie and Wilfrid run in to the kitchen.</p> <p>Having the Cleath-Stuarts to stay is brilliant for Minnie. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever had so much fun in her life. She\u2019s wearing two baseball caps, one on top of the other, holding a shoehorn like a riding crop, and \u201criding\u201d Wilfrid like a horse.</p><p>\u201cGo, horsey!\u201d she yells, and pulls on the \u201creins,\u201d which consist of about six of Luke\u2019s belts buckled together. The next minute, Clementine appears, \u201criding\u201d Ernest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s jump, Minnie!\u201d she squeals. \u201cLet\u2019s jump over the sofas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Suze. \u201cStop running about and come and have some breakfast. Who wants toast?\u201d</p><p>I notice she\u2019s diplomatically not even referring to the egg-white omelet. I think we\u2019ll all just pretend it never existed.</p><p>As the children get settled into their seats, I suddenly notice that Minnie has reached out for my phone.</p> <p>\u201cPlease phone,\u201d she says promptly. \u201cPleeeeeease. Pleeeeeeeease!\u201d She hugs it to her ear as though it\u2019s her newborn infant and I\u2019m Herod.</p><p>I\u2019ve given Minnie about three plastic toy phones, but they don\u2019t fool her for an instant. You have to admire her, really. So I always end up giving in and letting her hold my phone\u2014even though I\u2019m paranoid she\u2019s going to drop it in her milk or something.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say. \u201cJust for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d says Minnie into the phone, and beams at me. \u201cHello, Oraaaa!\u201d</p><p>Ora? Ora Bitch Long-legs?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to Ora, darling,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cTalk to someone else. Talk to Page. She\u2019s a sweet little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk Ora,\u201d Minnie says stubbornly. \u201cLove Ora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love Ora!\u201d I snap, before I can stop myself.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Ora?\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cAlicia\u2019s daughter,\u201d I mutter. \u201cOf all the children in all the world for Minnie to become friends with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Bex!\u201d retorts Suze. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous. What is this, the Montagues and the Capulets?\u201d</p><p>Minnie looks from Suze to me, then back again. Then she screws up her face for a scream.</p><p>\u201cLove Oraaaaaaa!\u201d</p><p>All this time, Luke has been tapping away on his BlackBerry. He has this almost mystical power to tune out his immediate surroundings when they consist of Minnie screeching. But now he raises his head.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Ora?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe our entire breakfast table is discussing Alicia Bitch Long-legs\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I say. \u201cMinnie, come here and help me do my toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToast!\u201d Her eyes light up with instant excitement, and I can\u2019t help giving her a little kiss. Minnie thinks spreading butter on toast is the most fun activity in the world, except I have to dissuade her from adding marmalade and chocolate spread and peanut butter. (Luke always says, \u201cLike mother like daughter,\u201d which is absolute nonsense; I don\u2019t know what he means.)</p><p>As I sip my coffee and try to stop Minnie from smearing butter all over her fingers, I find myself watching Luke.

He used to worship her unreasonably; now he loathes her unreasonably. Elinor abandoned him to go and live in the States when he was a child, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever quite forgiven her.

As he leaves the kitchen, he looks like a man sentenced to prison, not a man who\u2019s got a ticket to the coolest party in town.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hopeless,\u201d sighs Suze. \u201cYou know, he can name about a hundred breeds of sheep but not one of Madonna\u2019s husbands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone so out of place.\u201d I bite my lip, trying not to laugh. \u201cTarkie\u2019s not suited to L.A., is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve been on enough holidays to grouse moors,\u201d says Suze. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn. And I love it here.\u201d She pours herself some more orange juice, then lowers her voice. \u201cWhat do you think\u2019s up with Elinor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I lower my voice even further. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s really ill?\u201d</p><p>We look at each other anxiously. I can tell our thoughts are heading in the same direction, then sheering away.</p><p>\u201cHe has to know the truth about the party,\u201d says Suze at length. \u201cHe has to know how generous she was. Just in case ... anything happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do I tell him? He\u2019ll fly off the handle. He won\u2019t even listen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you write it down?\u201d</p><p>I consider this for a moment. I am quite good at letter-writing, and I could make Luke promise to read to the end before shouting. But even as I\u2019m considering it, I know what I truly want to do.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to invite her over,\u201d I say with resolve. \u201cEither before her surgery or afterward, depending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite her where? Here?\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cAre you sure, Bex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I write a letter, he\u2019ll just ignore it. I need the two of them together. I\u2019m going to stage an intervention,\u201d I say with a flourish.</p><p>We were talking about interventions at Golden Peace the other day, and I was the only one who hadn\u2019t been in one. I felt quite left out.</p><p>Suze looks doubtful. \u201cAren\u2019t they for drug addicts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd family disputes,\u201d I say authoritatively.</p><p>I don\u2019t actually know if this is true. But I can always start my own kind of intervention, can\u2019t I? I have a vision of myself, dressed in flowing white clothes, talking in a low melodious voice, and bringing harmony to the fractured souls of Luke and Elinor.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll buy some healing crystals for the occasion. And some scented candles, and a CD of soothing chants. I\u2019ll come up with my own special cocktail of techniques, and I won\u2019t let Luke or Elinor leave until they\u2019ve achieved some sort of resolution. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you get someone specially trained?\u201d Suze is still looking dubious. \u201cI mean, what do you know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoads,\u201d I say, a bit offended. \u201cI\u2019ve picked up a lot from Golden Peace, you know, Suze. I\u2019ve done conflict resolution and everything. To understand everything is to forgive everything,\u201d I can\u2019t resist quoting. \u201cBuddha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, if you\u2019re such an expert, sort out this conflict.\u201d Suze points at Wilfie and Clemmie, who are fighting desperately over some tiny plastic animal.</p><p>\u201cEr ... hey, Wilfie! Clemmie!\u201d I call out. \u201cWho wants a sweetie?\u201d</p> <p>Both children instantly stop tussling and hold out their hands.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d I say smugly.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you\u2019re going to sort out Luke and Elinor?\u201d scoffs Suze. \u201cOffer them sweeties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I say with dignity. \u201cI\u2019ll use a variety of techniques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still think it\u2019s risky.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cVery risky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne cannot refuse to eat simply because there is a risk of being choked,\u201d I say wisely. \u201cChinese proverb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, stop talking like a bloody T-shirt!\u201d Suze suddenly flips out. \u201cI hate this stupid Golden Peace place! Talk about something normal. What are you going to wear for the benefit? And don\u2019t say something stupid, like, Clothes are a metaphor for the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to!\u201d I retort.</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s quite good. I might drop that into a class at Golden Peace. Clothes are a metaphor for the soul.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll get it printed on canvas to give to Suze for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d says Suze suspiciously.</p> <p>\u201cNo reason!\u201d I force my mouth straight. \u201cSo. What are you going to wear to the benefit?\u201d</p><p>Suze can talk about shopping. She can talk about shopping!</p><p>Not only has she bought a new dress for the benefit, she\u2019s bought new shoes, a new necklace, and new hair. New hair. She didn\u2019t even tell me she was doing it. One moment she was \u201cpopping out to the hairdresser\u201d and the next she was walking back in the door with the most luscious, glossy extensions I\u2019ve ever seen. They stream down to her waist in a blond river, and what with that and the tanned legs she looks like a movie star herself.</p><p>\u201cYou look fantastic,\u201d I say honestly, as we stand in front of my mirror. She\u2019s in a beaded shift, the color of a glassy sea, and her necklace has a mermaid on it. I\u2019ve never seen a mermaid necklace before, but now I\u2019m desperate for one too.</p><p>\u201cWell, so do you!\u201d says Suze at once.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I pluck at my dress, which is Zac Posen and very flattering around the waist, though I say so myself. I\u2019ve styled it with my Alexis Bittar necklace, and my hair is in a really complicated updo, all little plaits and waves. Plus, I\u2019ve been practicing how to stand on the red carpet. I found a guide on the Internet and printed it out for both of us. Legs crossed, elbow out, chin tucked in. I take up my pose, and Suze copies me.</p><p>\u201cI look like I\u2019ve got a double chin,\u201d she says fretfully. \u201cAre you sure this is right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019re tucking our chins in too much.\u201d</p> <p>I lift my chin and immediately look like a soldier. Suze, meanwhile, is doing a perfect Posh Spice pose. She has the expression and everything.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d I say excitedly. \u201cOnly smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand like this and smile,\u201d says Suze, sounding strained. \u201cI think you have to be double-jointed to get it right. Tarkie!\u201d she calls as he passes the open door. \u201cCome and practice being photographed!\u201d</p><p>Tarquin has looked shell-shocked ever since Suze appeared with extensions. Now he looks like a condemned man. Suze has forced him into a tailored Prada dinner jacket, complete with narrow black tie and dapper shoes. I mean, he looks very good, for Tarkie. He\u2019s tall and strapping, and his hair has been artfully mussed by Suze. He just looks so ... different.</p><p>\u201cYou should wear Prada all the time, Tarkie!\u201d I say, and he blanches.</p><p>\u201cStand here,\u201d Suze is saying. \u201cNow, when you have your picture taken, you need to tilt your face at an angle. And look kind of moody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be in the photos,\u201d says Tarkie, backing away. \u201cIf it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be! They photograph everyone.\u201d She glances uncertainly at me. \u201cThey do photograph everyone, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cWe\u2019re guests, aren\u2019t we? So we\u2019ll be photographed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel a fizz of excitement. I can\u2019t wait! I\u2019ve always wanted to be photographed on a red carpet in Hollywood. My phone bleeps with a text and I pull it out of my clutch bag.</p><p>\u201cThe car\u2019s here! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Luke?\u201d says Tarquin, who is obviously desperate for some moral support.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting him there.\u201d I spray a final cloud of scent over me and grin at Suze. \u201cReady for your close-up, Lady Cleath-Stuart?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d she says at once. \u201cIt makes me sound ancient!\u201d</p><p>I head into the children\u2019s bedroom, where our babysitter, Teri, is presiding over a massive game of Twister. Minnie doesn\u2019t understand Twister, but she understands rolling around on the mat, getting in everyone\u2019s way, so that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing.</p><p>\u201cNight night!\u201d I plant a kiss on her little cheek. \u201cSee you later!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMummy.\u201d Wilfrid stares at Suze in awe. \u201cYou look like a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling!\u201d Suze hugs him. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I wanted to look like.\u201d</p> <p>Tarquin has edged over and is fiddling with Wilfrid\u2019s toy train. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll stay here and help look after the children,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Suze and I shout in unison.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it,\u201d says Suze, chivying him out of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou might meet Angelina Jolie,\u201d I chime in.</p><p>\u201cOr Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Nick Park,\u201d I say craftily. \u201cYou know? The Wallace and Gromit man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh!\u201d says Tarkie, perking up. \u201cThe Wrong Trousers. Now, that was a jolly good film.\u201d</p><p>The Beverly Hilton is where they hold the Golden Globes. We\u2019re going to the same place they hold the Golden Globes! As our car edges along in early-evening traffic, I can barely keep still.</p><p>\u201cHey, Suze!\u201d I say suddenly. \u201cD\u2019you think it\u2019ll be the exact same red carpet as at the Golden Globes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe!\u201d</p><p>I can tell Suze is as gripped by this idea as I am. She starts rearranging her hair extensions on her shoulders, and I check my lipstick for the millionth time.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to waste this opportunity. There are going to be some A-list celebrities at this party, and if I keep my wits about me, I can do some major networking. I\u2019ve got my cards in my bag, printed with Rebecca Brandon, Stylist, and I\u2019m planning to work every single conversation I can round to fashion. I just need one influential person to hire me, and then word will spread, and my reputation will grow, and ... well, the sky\u2019s the limit.</p><p>It\u2019s just finding that one influential person, which is the tricky bit.</p><p>The car pulls up outside the hotel and I give a little squeak of excitement. There aren\u2019t crowds, like at the Golden Globes, but there are barricades, and banks of photographers, and a red carpet! An actual red carpet! There are big screens with EQUAL printed all over, which is the name of the charity. (It stands for something, but I have no idea what. I don\u2019t think anyone does.) In front of them, an elegant blond woman in a nude dress is posing for the cameras, along with a bearded man in black tie.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I say, nudging Suze. \u201cIs that Glenn Close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the one out of ... you know. That show.\u201d Suze wrinkles her nose. \u201cOh God, what\u2019s her name ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I point ahead at a young guy with spiky hair and a dinner jacket, getting out of his limo. Photographers are clustered round the car, clicking away and calling out, but he\u2019s ignoring them, in a totally cool way.</p><p>\u201cAre you ladies ready?\u201d The limo driver turns to face us.</p><p>\u201cRight. Yes.\u201d I take a deep breath, calming my nerves.</p><p>Suze and I practiced all afternoon in her hire car, getting out and taking pictures of each other, and we\u2019ve totally nailed it. We won\u2019t be flashing our underwear, nor tripping over our heels. Nor will we wave at the camera, which Suze always wants to do.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Suze is grinning tremulously.</p><p>\u201cReady!\u201d</p><p>The limo driver has opened the door on my side. I give my hair a last-minute pat, then take my most elegant step out, waiting for the flash of bulbs, the shouts, the clamor....</p><p>Oh. What?</p><p>Where did all the cameras go? They were here a minute ago. I turn round, discomfited, and see them all clustered around another limo, behind us. Some red-haired girl in blue is getting out of it and smiling prettily around. I don\u2019t even recognize her. Is she a real celebrity?</p><p>Suze emerges from the limo beside me and looks around, bewildered. \u201cWhere are the photographers?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere.\u201d I point. \u201cWith her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looks as disconsolate as me. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019re not celebrities,\u201d I say reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, never mind.\u201d Suze brightens. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got the red carpet. Come on!\u201d Tarquin has got out of the limo, too, and she grabs him by the arm. \u201cRed-carpet time!\u201d</p> <p>As we get close to the hotel, there are loads of people milling about in black tie, but we manage to push our way through to the entrance to the red carpet. I\u2019m fizzing with anticipation. This is it!</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I beam at the security guard. \u201cWe\u2019re guests.\u201d I proffer our invitations, and he scans them dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cThis way, ma\u2019am.\u201d He points away from the celebs to some kind of side route, which a crowd of people in evening dress are filing down.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re going to the benefit,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way to the benefit.\u201d He nods and opens a rope barrier. \u201cHave a good evening.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t get it. Maybe he\u2019s a bit slow.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go this way.\u201d I gesture clearly to the bank of photographers.</p><p>\u201cOn the red carpet,\u201d puts in Suze. She points at our invitation. \u201cIt says Red Carpet Entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the red carpet, ma\u2019am.\u201d He points at the side route again, and Suze and I exchange looks of dismay.</p><p>OK, I suppose strictly speaking there is a carpet. And it is a kind of dull red. But don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s where we\u2019re supposed to go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not red,\u201d objects Suze. \u201cIt\u2019s maroon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there aren\u2019t any photographers or anything. We want to walk on that red carpet.\u201d I point behind him.</p><p>\u201cOnly Gold List guests will be walking that red carpet, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Gold List guests? Why aren\u2019t we Gold List guests?</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d says Tarkie, clearly bored. \u201cShall we go in, have a titchy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the red carpet\u2019s the whole point! Hey, look, there\u2019s Sage Seymour!\u201d Sage is talking earnestly to a TV camera. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d I say to the security guard. \u201cShe wants to say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be a chance to greet her inside the benefit,\u201d says the security guard implacably. \u201cCould you move along, ma\u2019am? People are waiting behind you.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t have any choice. Morosely, we all move through the barrier and start down the Non-Gold List, totally inferior sub-red carpet. I don\u2019t believe it. I thought we\u2019d be on the red carpet with Sage and all the famous people. Not filing along like cattle down some dimly lit maroon carpet that has stains on it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Suze,\u201d I whisper suddenly. \u201cLet\u2019s go round again. See if we can get on the proper red carpet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d says Suze. \u201cHey, Tarkie,\u201d she says more loudly. \u201cI need to adjust my bra. I\u2019ll see you in there, OK? Get us a titchy.\u201d</p><p>She hands him his invitation, then we swing round and begin to hurry back up the non-red carpet. There are so many people piling down by now, in evening dress and jewels and clouds of scent, it feels as if we\u2019re fish swimming against a very sparkly, glamorous tide.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I keep saying. \u201cJust forgot something ... Excuse me ...\u201d</p><p>At last we reach the top of the carpet and pause for a breather. The security guard is still standing at his post, directing people down the maroon carpet. He hasn\u2019t spotted us yet, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re hidden behind a screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cWe cause a diversion.\u201d I think for a moment, then squeal, \u201cOh my God! My Harry Winston earring! Please, everyone! I lost my Harry Winston earring!\u201d</p><p>Every woman in the vicinity stops dead in shock. I can see blood draining from faces. You don\u2019t joke about Harry Winston in L.A.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Winston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many carats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d I say, almost tearfully. \u201cHelp me look!\u201d</p><p>About ten women bend down and start patting the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, help! She lost her earring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my Harry Winston ring once, we had to empty the whole pool....\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s complete mayhem. There are women on their hands and knees, and people trying to get onto the maroon carpet, and men trying to chivy their wives along, and the security guard keeps calling, \u201cMove along, folks! Please move along!\u201d</p><p>At last he drops his rope barrier and comes striding onto the carpet. \u201cFolks, we need to keep moving along.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw!

The carpet\u2019s definitely red. It also feels quite big and empty, which is maybe because all the photographers have turned away. As Suze and I move slowly along, we\u2019re doing our best Hollywood poses, elbows out and everything. But not one cameraman is taking a picture. Some of them are still clustered round the young guy with spiky hair, and the others are chatting or on the phone.</p><p>I mean, I know we\u2019re not exactly famous, but still. I feel quite aggrieved on behalf of Suze, who looks absolutely gorgeous.</p> <p>\u201cSuze, do that bendy-back pose where you peek over your shoulder,\u201d I say, and then hurry over to a photographer with dark hair and a denim jacket who\u2019s leaning on the barrier, yawning.

Really, really hot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d He leafs through a printed crib sheet with faces and names of celebrities. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t think so.\u201d He puts the crib sheet away, then takes out his phone and starts sending a text.</p><p>\u201cOh, take her photo,\u201d I beg, all pretense gone. \u201cGo on! Just for fun.\u201d</p><p>The photographer looks at me as though for the first time. \u201cHow did you get on the red carpet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sneaked on,\u201d I admit. \u201cWe\u2019re visitors to L.A. And if I was a Hollywood photographer, I\u2019d take pictures of normal people as well as celebrities.\u201d</p><p>A tiny, reluctant smile tweaks at the photographer\u2019s mouth. \u201cOh, you would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He sighs and rolls his eyes. \u201cGo on, then.\u201d He lifts his camera and focuses it on Suze. Yessss!</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I squeak, and skitter over the red carpet to join her. OK, quick. Elbow out. Legs crossed. It\u2019s actually happening! We\u2019re actually having our photo taken, in Hollywood, on the red carpet! I smile at the lens, trying to look natural, waiting for the flash ...</p> <p>\u201cMeryl! Meryl! MERYL!\u201d</p><p>In a blink, the lens vanishes from sight. Like stampeding wildebeest, every single photographer, including our guy in the denim jacket, has charged to the far side of the red carpet. I don\u2019t think he took a single shot of us, and now he\u2019s in the thick of the paparazzi, yelling and screaming.</p><p>\u201cOVER HERE, MERYL! MERYL! HERE!\u201d</p><p>The flashes are like strobe lighting. The clamor is extraordinary. And all because Meryl Streep has arrived.</p><p>Well, OK. Fair enough. No one can compete with Meryl Streep.</p><p>We both watch in awe and fascination as she makes her way graciously along the red carpet, surrounded by several flunkies.</p><p>\u201cMeryl!\u201d calls Suze boldly as she comes near. \u201cLove your work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I chime in.</p><p>Meryl Streep turns her head and gives us a slightly bewildered smile.</p><p>Yes! We networked with Meryl Streep on the red carpet! Wait till I tell Mum.</p><p>As we enter the ballroom where the benefit is happening, I\u2019m still on a high. Never mind if no one took our picture, this is exactly what I imagined Hollywood would be like. Lots of people in amazing dresses, and Meryl Streep, and a band playing smooth jazz, and delicious citrusy cocktails.</p><p>The whole place is decorated in pale gray and pink, and there\u2019s a stage on which some dancers are already performing and a dance floor and loads of circular tables. And I can see a goody bag on each chair! My head is swiveling around as I try to catch sight of all the celebs, and Suze\u2019s is doing the same.</p><p>I notice Luke by the bar, and Suze, Tarkie, and I hurry over. He\u2019s standing with Aran and a couple I don\u2019t recognize. He introduces them as Ken and Davina Kerrow, and I remember him telling me about them last week. They\u2019re both producers, and they\u2019re making a film about the Crimean War. Luke and Aran are jockeying to get Sage considered for the part of Florence Nightingale. Apparently, Sage needs a \u201cchange of direction\u201d and \u201crebranding,\u201d and being Florence Nightingale will achieve that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Personally, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s at all suited to being Florence Nightingale, but I\u2019m not going to say that to Luke.</p><p>\u201cSage is very interested in the role,\u201d he\u2019s saying now to Ken, who is bearded and intense and frowns a lot. \u201cI would say she\u2019s passionate about it.\u201d</p><p>Davina is also fairly intense. She\u2019s dressed in a black tuxedo suit and keeps checking her BlackBerry and saying \u201cUh-huh?\u201d when Luke is in the middle of a sentence.</p><p>\u201cSage feels this is a story that must be told,\u201d Luke presses on. \u201cShe really felt the role spoke to her.... Ah, here she is! Just talking about you, Sage.\u201d</p> <p>Ooh! There\u2019s Sage, approaching in a swishy red dress that sets off her treacly hair perfectly. I feel a small thrill of excitement at the idea of introducing her to Suze and Tarkie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hope you are talking about me,\u201d says Sage to Luke. \u201cWhy else do I pay you?\u201d She gives a roar of laughter and Luke smiles politely.</p><p>\u201cJust talking about Florence,\u201d he says. \u201cI was saying how passionate you are about the role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, totally.\u201d Sage nods. \u201cDid you see my new tattoo?\u201d She holds out her wrist, waving her fingers playfully, and Luke flinches.</p><p>\u201cSage, sweetie,\u201d says Aran evenly. \u201cI thought we said no more tattoos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had to have it,\u201d says Sage, looking hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s a swallow. It means peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a dove,\u201d says Aran, and I see him exchange a look with Luke.</p><p>\u201cHi, Sage,\u201d I say casually. \u201cYou look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so kind.\u201d Sage sweeps a dazzling smile over Suze, Tarkie, and me. \u201cWelcome to the benefit. Would you like a photo? Aran, these people would like a photo, could you ...?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, confused. She thinks I\u2019m some random fan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Becky,\u201d I say, turning red with embarrassment. \u201cLuke\u2019s wife? We met at the house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Becky!\u201d She bursts into laughter again and presses a hand on my arm. \u201cOf course. My bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage, I\u2019d like you to meet my friends Suze and Tarquin Cleath-Stuart. Suze and Tarkie, may I present Sage ...\u201d I trail off mid-introduction. Sage has turned away from us and is enthusiastically greeting some guy in a midnight-blue tuxedo.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of awkward silence. I can\u2019t believe Sage has been so rude.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble at last.</p><p>\u201cBex, it\u2019s not your fault!\u201d says Suze. \u201cShe\u2019s quite ... um ...\u201d She stops, and I can tell she\u2019s trying to be diplomatic.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Sage looks hyper to me. Is she high? Now she\u2019s talking loudly about Ben Galligan, who is her ex-boyfriend from about three years ago. He cheated on her while he was making Hour of Terror 5, and he dumped Sage at the premiere, and now his new girlfriend is pregnant. And Sage has never got over it.</p><p>It was all in People magazine, and Luke says most of it is true. But then, annoyingly, when I asked him to tell me exactly which bits were true and which bits weren\u2019t, he said I should stop reading that trash and remember that celebrities are human beings.</p> <p>\u201cIs the rat here?\u201d Sage is looking wildly around. \u201cBecause I swear, I will tear his eyes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage, we talked about this!\u201d says Aran in a low voice. \u201cTonight you\u2019re an ambassador for world equality and justice, OK? You can be a pissed-off ex-girlfriend on your own time.\u201d</p><p>Sage doesn\u2019t seem to be listening. Her eyes are darting wildly about. \u201cSuppose I dump a bottle of wine over him? Think of the exposure. It\u2019ll go viral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of viral we want. Sage, we have a strategy, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really couldn\u2019t tell you who else is in the running,\u201d I can hear Davina Kerrow saying to Luke. \u201cAlthough you can probably guess....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lois,\u201d says Sage, who has overheard this, too, and is scowling. \u201cShe\u2019s up for Florence, I know she is. Can you see Lois as a nurse? A nurse? This is the girl who said, \u2018You don\u2019t get any acting awards for shaving off your hair,\u2019 remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this again.\u201d Aran closes his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe could play a psycho-freak nurse. That would work. Or maybe a kleptomaniac nurse, right, Becky?\u201d she says, flashing me a wild grin.</p><p>I feel a thud of alarm at the word \u201ckleptomaniac.\u201d Sage is talking really loudly, and the place is crowded. Anyone could overhear.</p><p>\u201cUm, Sage.\u201d I move close to her and drop my voice right down. \u201cI told you that about Lois in confidence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d says Sage. \u201cI\u2019m only having some fun, right?

I don\u2019t know how Luke does business with her.</p><p>I turn to make sure that Suze and Tarkie are OK and see that Tarkie is in conversation with Ken Kerrow. OK, this could be interesting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re calling the movie Florence in Love,\u201d Ken Kerrow is saying animatedly. \u201cLike Shakespeare in Love, only more authentic. We\u2019re recasting Florence as an American, but we\u2019re keeping the essence of Florence. Her conflict. Her growth. Her sexual awakening. We think she would have dressed as a boy to get onto the war field. We think she would have been in a passionate love triangle. Think The Age of Innocence meets Saving Private Ryan meets Yentl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Tarkie looks none the wiser. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t seen any of those films, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re jolly good.\u201d</p><p>Ken Kerrow looks profoundly shocked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Yentl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhm ...\u201d Tarkie looks trapped. \u201cSorry ... did you say \u2018Lentil\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYentl!\u201d Ken Kerrow almost shouts. \u201cStreisand!\u201d</p><p>Poor Tarkie. He clearly doesn\u2019t understand a word Ken is saying.</p> <p>\u201cI watch a lot of wildlife documentaries,\u201d he says desperately. \u201cDavid Attenborough. Marvelous man.\u201d</p><p>Ken Kerrow just shakes his head pityingly, but before he can say anything else, Suze swoops in.</p><p>\u201cDarling, let\u2019s go and watch the dancers.\u201d She gives Ken Kerrow a charming smile. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to drag my husband away. Bex, shall we go and watch the dancers?\u201d</p><p>As we\u2019re heading toward the stage, I\u2019m distracted by a sign on one of the tables: SILENT AUCTION PRIZES.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to have a quick look,\u201d I say to Suze. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you in a sec.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an amazing necklace on a stand, which is up for auction, and as I draw near I feel the tugging of lust. God, it\u2019s beautiful, all pale-pink crystals and a hammered-silver heart; I wonder how much ...</p> <p>Oh my God. I\u2019ve suddenly seen the printed label below it. Reserve price $10,000. I hastily back away, in case anyone thinks I\u2019m bidding for it. Ten thousand dollars? Seriously? I mean, it\u2019s a nice necklace and everything, but ... ten thousand dollars? Just for some pink crystals? I don\u2019t even dare go near the pair of watches at the end of the table. Or that gift certificate for a Malibu villa. Maybe I\u2019ll go and watch the dancers with Suze instead. I\u2019m about to turn away when I see a doddery old man making his way slowly along the prizes. He looks quite frail and is keeping his balance by clutching at the table.</p><p>Not a single person has noticed, which makes me feel quite incensed. I mean, what\u2019s the point of coming to a benefit to help people and then ignoring a poor old man who needs help right in front of your eyes?</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, sir?\u201d I hurry forward, but he bats me away.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s very tanned, with perfect teeth and what looks suspiciously like a white toupee, but his hands are gnarled and his eyes are a bit rheumy. Honestly, someone should be looking after him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely event,\u201d I say politely.</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d He nods. \u201cWonderful cause. Discrimination is the blight of our lives. I\u2019m gay, and, let me tell you, the world is not an open place. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agree.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t encountered discrimination yourself. As a woman. And in other ways. Because, in my opinion, no human on this earth is free from discrimination in some way or other.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so full of fervor, I don\u2019t like to contradict him.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019ve been discriminated against in lots of ways. Heaps. All the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me some examples of this shocking behavior.\u201d His rheumy eyes fix eagerly on me.</p><p>My mind is blank. Come on, quick. Discrimination.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously as a woman ... and ...\u201d I cast my mind around. \u201cI once had to take out my earrings to work in a caf\u00e9, so that was discriminating against jewelry ... and ... er ... hobbies can be discriminated against and ... pets ...\u201d I have no idea what I\u2019m saying. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d I end lamely. \u201cWe need to fight it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will.\u201d He clutches my hand. \u201cTogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rebecca, by the way,\u201d I add. \u201cRebecca Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Dix.\u201d He flashes me a white smile. \u201cDix Donahue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hang on. Dix Donahue. That sounds familiar. I glance at a nearby poster and, sure enough, it\u2019s printed in big gray letters: HOST: DIX DONAHUE.</p><p>This is the host? He looks about a hundred.</p><p>\u201cDix!\u201d A plump man with a neat black mustache bears down on us and pumps his hand. \u201cVictor Jamison from EQUAL. I\u2019m a big fan. All set for your introductory speech?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGathering inspiration all the time.\u201d Dix flashes his smile at me, and I beam back. He must be famous in some sort of way. I wonder how? Luke will know.</p> <p>The two men head off, and I drain my glass. I really must find Luke and Suze, but the trouble is, everyone\u2019s started clustering around the stage area and it\u2019s hard to see. The dancers have stopped their routine and the band has fallen silent and there\u2019s an expectant air. Then the band strikes up again, with some tune that everyone recognizes, going by their nods and smiles at one another. Dix Donahue mounts the steps with a hop and a jump\u2014and it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s an entertainer. He seems to sparkle under the lights, even if he is a zillion years old.</p><p>As he starts to tell jokes, I edge my way round the corner of the throng and suddenly see Luke. I\u2019m about to join him when the room goes dark and a spotlight moves around the crowd, and Dix Donahue takes on a grave manner.</p><p>\u201cBut seriously, folks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re here for a very fine cause tonight. Discrimination is an evil and it takes place in all shapes and forms, often in the place you\u2019d expect the least. Later we\u2019ll be hearing from Pia Stafford, who battled workplace discrimination regarding her disability after a car accident.\u201d</p><p>The spotlight falls on a woman in black, who lifts a hand and nods soberly.</p><p>\u201cBut, you know, I was talking to a young lady just now, who had maybe the most unusual tale of discrimination I\u2019ve heard....\u201d Dix Donahue shades his eyes and squints into the audience. \u201cRebecca, where are you? Ah, there!\u201d</p> <p>Does he mean me? I stare up at him in horror. A moment later the spotlight is glaring into my face.</p><p>\u201cRebecca was discriminated against because, of all things\u201d\u2014he shakes his head somberly\u2014\u201cher pet.\u201d</p><p>My eyes nearly pop out of my head. He can\u2019t have taken me seriously. I only said \u201cpets\u201d because I ran out of other things to say.</p><p>They should never have hired a hundred-year-old host. He\u2019s batty.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, let\u2019s hear your story,\u201d says Dix Donahue in a soft, coaxing voice. \u201cWhat was your pet?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, transfixed. \u201cA ... a hamster,\u201d I hear myself saying.</p> <p>\u201cA hamster, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d Dix Donahue starts clapping, and a halfhearted round of applause breaks out. I can see people whispering to one another, looking puzzled, as well they might.</p><p>\u201cAnd what form did the discrimination take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... well ... people wouldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cI was ostracized by my community. Friends turned against me, and my career suffered. My health too. I think it\u2019s up to the government and society to change attitudes. Because all humans are the same.\u201d I\u2019m rather warming to my speech now. \u201cAll of us, whatever religion we practice or color skin we have, or, you know, whether we have a hamster or not ... we\u2019re the same!\u201d</p><p>I make a sweeping gesture and catch Luke\u2019s eye. He\u2019s staring at me from a few yards away, his mouth open.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I finish hastily.</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Dix Donahue leads another round of applause, and this time it feels really genuine. A lady even pats me on the back.</p><p>\u201cOne more question before we move on.\u201d Dix Donahue twinkles at me. \u201cWhat was your hamster\u2019s name, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d Shit. My mind has gone totally blank. \u201cIt was ... er ... called ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErmintrude,\u201d comes Luke\u2019s deep voice. \u201cShe was like family.\u201d</p><p>Oh, ha-ha. Very funny.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ermintrude.\u201d I muster a smile. \u201cErmintrude the hamster.\u201d</p><p>The spotlight finally moves off me, and Dix Donahue comes to the end of his speech, and I look up to see Luke giving me a little wink as he approaches through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a new hamster this Christmas, darling,\u201d he says over the sound of applause. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight the discrimination together. If you can be brave enough, so can I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the last time I make conversation with some random old man just to be kind. As we move back to our table, I\u2019m totally mortified, especially as people keep stopping me to congratulate me and ask about the hamster and tell me about how their kids have a rabbit and they wouldn\u2019t stand for discrimination\u2014it\u2019s shocking in this day and age. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But at last we\u2019re able to sit down, and, on the plus side, the food is delicious. I\u2019m so engrossed in my fillet of beef that I don\u2019t pay much attention to the conversation, which doesn\u2019t matter, because it only consists of both Kerrows droning on to the entire table about this Florence Nightingale film they want to make. They talk like some sort of song duet, overlapping every phrase, and no one else can get a word in. This is another lesson I\u2019m learning in Hollywood. You\u2019d think hearing about a film would be exciting\u2014but it\u2019s deathly. I can tell Suze is just as fed up as I am, because her eyes are glassy, and also she keeps mouthing \u201cbooooriiiing\u201d at me.</p><p>\u201c... locations are the challenge ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... wonderful director ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... problems with the third act ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201c... he really gets Florence\u2019s arc ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... talked to the studio about budget ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... finances lined up. We\u2019re waiting on the last investor, but it depends on some British guy with a crazy name. John John Saint John. Kind of a name is that?\u201d Kerrow spears a mange-tout and eats it ferociously.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you mean John St. John John?\u201d says Suze, suddenly tuning in to the conversation. \u201cHow on earth do you know him? That\u2019s Pucky,\u201d she adds to me. \u201cHave you met Pucky?\u201d God knows if I\u2019ve met Pucky. All Suze\u2019s childhood friends are called things like Pucky and Binky and Minky. They basically blend into one braying, cheery, human Labrador.</p><p>\u201cEr ... maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Pucky.\u201d She turns to Luke. \u201cI know you met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarquin\u2019s investment manager,\u201d says Luke thoughtfully. \u201cYes, I did. Runs the media arm of your business interests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d says Suze vaguely, then beams at Tarkie, who\u2019s returning from the restroom. \u201cDarling, they know Pucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d Tarkie\u2019s face brightens. \u201cExtraordinary coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPucky?\u201d Ken Kerrow looks perplexed.</p><p>\u201cCalled him that ever since prep school,\u201d Tarkie explains. \u201cMarvelous chap. He\u2019s worked with me, what, ten years now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorked with you?\u201d Ken Kerrow\u2019s eyes focus on Tarquin anew. \u201cYou\u2019re in film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilm?\u201d Tarkie looks horrified at the idea. \u201cGood Lord, no. I\u2019m a farmer. You were saying something earlier about an \u2018ark\u2019? Do you mean Noah\u2019s Ark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarquin, can I ask you a question?\u201d says Luke. His mouth is twitching and he looks highly amused at something. \u201cI know you have a few media interests among your investments. Has Pucky ever backed any films for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Tarquin\u2019s expression clears. \u201cAhm. Well. As a matter of fact, yes, he has. Perhaps that\u2019s the connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilms?\u201d Suze stares at him. \u201cYou never told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your investor,\u201d says Luke to Ken Kerrow, and jerks a thumb at Tarquin. \u201cLord Cleath-Stuart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d says Tarkie, flushing red. \u201cTarquin.\u201d</p><p>Ken Kerrow looks as though he\u2019s choked on his fillet steak. \u201cThat\u2019s you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLord?\u201d Sage looks up from her phone for the first time.</p><p>\u201cLord Cleath-Stuart.\u201d Ken Kerrow is gesticulating at his wife. \u201cThis is the Brit backer. You backed Fiddler\u2019s Game,\u201d he adds to Tarquin, in sudden realization. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhm ... yes.\u201d Tarquin looks a little hunted. \u201cThat sounds right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made thirty million dollars its opening weekend. You picked a winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was Pucky,\u201d says Tarkie modestly. \u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t know one film from another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d says Ken Kerrow. \u201cI\u2019m going to find my co-producer. I\u2019d love for you to meet him.\u201d He leaps up and practically sprints to a nearby table, where I can see him whispering frantically to another guy in a tux.</p><p>\u201cTarkie!\u201d exclaims Suze, and bangs the table. \u201cSince when do we invest in films? You should have told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, darling,\u201d says Tarkie anxiously, \u201cyou said you weren\u2019t interested in our investments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant boring things like stocks and shares! Not films\u2014\u201d Suze breaks off and fixes Tarkie with an accusing gaze. \u201cTell me the truth. Have we been invited to premieres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhm ...\u201d Tarkie\u2019s eyes slide around nervously. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask Pucky.

An hour later, it seems as if every single person in the room has dropped by our table to be introduced to Tarkie. Several have pitched movies, several have invited him to screenings, several have tried to set up meetings, and one has suggested flying the whole family to his ranch in Texas. Tarkie is totally an L.A. player. I can\u2019t quite believe it.</p><p>In fact, no one can believe it. Luke has been bursting into laughter a lot\u2014especially when some studio executive asked Tarkie what was his view of the American Pie franchise and Tarkie said, gosh, he wasn\u2019t sure\u2014was it similar to Starbucks? Meanwhile, Tarkie himself looks rather shell-shocked again. I feel a bit sorry for him, actually. He came here to get away from everything, not to be besieged by people after his money.</p><p>I can understand why he spends so much time wandering around moors on his own. At least the deer don\u2019t keep running up, saying they\u2019ve got a fabulous concept they\u2019d love to share with him over breakfast. Now some guy in a gray shiny suit is asking Tarkie if he wants to visit a film set.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re shooting this great drama; it\u2019s set on the high seas. Bring your kids\u2014they\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind.\u201d Tarkie is starting to sound robotic. \u201cBut I\u2019m here for a holiday\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come!\u201d Suze interrupts.</p><p>\u201cTerrific!\u201d The gray-suited guy smiles at her. \u201cWe\u2019d be delighted to welcome you, give you the tour; you can watch some scenes being shot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be an extra?\u201d Suze says boldly.</p><p>The gray-suited man stares at her, apparently baffled.</p><p>\u201cYou want to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe an extra in the film.

I beam delightedly at Suze and she grins back.</p><p>\u201cYour ladyship.\u201d The gray-suited man seems totally perplexed. \u201cYou won\u2019t be comfortable being an extra. The day is long, it\u2019s tiring, the scenes are shot again and again. Why don\u2019t you watch the scene, and then you can meet the cast; we\u2019ll have lunch someplace nice....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be an extra,\u201d says Suze obstinately. \u201cAnd so does Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to watch it, we want to be in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to be in it,\u201d I echo emphatically.</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d The man seems to admit defeat. \u201cOK.

Everyone will see us\u2014ooh, what\u2019s the film about?\u201d says Suze as an afterthought, and the man looks up from where he\u2019s writing his mobile number on a card.</p><p>\u201cPirates.\u201d</p><p>Pirates?

The LHA is not a \u201cbunch of Nazis with nothing better to do than complain about fountains.\u201d We do not \u201cmeet every night in some grim little cavern\u201d nor \u201cplot like the witches in Macbeth.\u201d Our dress sense is, I would suggest, irrelevant.</p><p>I also rebut your assertion that The Surge is \u201cone of the wonders of the world.\u201d It is not.

I\u2019m going to be the best extra ever.</p><p>No, not \u201cextra.\u201d The proper term is \u201cbackground actor.\u201d I\u2019ve found out so much on the Internet about being an extra, I feel really well prepared. For example, you should always bring playing cards or a book in case you get bored. And you shouldn\u2019t wear green, in case they\u2019re using a green screen for CGI. And you should bring a variety of outfits. Although that doesn\u2019t apply in this case, as apparently our costumes will be provided. A limo has also been provided to take us to the film set, which is definitely not standard practice. They\u2019re being super-nice to us because of Suze being married to Tarkie.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m secretly hoping they might be so nice that they give us each a little line to say. I mean, why not? Obviously not big lines or speeches or anything. Just something small. I could say, \u2019Tis true, Cap\u2019n, after the pirate captain makes a speech. And Suze could say, Land ahoy! or Ship ahoy! or Pirate ahoy! Anything ahoy, really. I\u2019ve been practicing a special growly piratess voice in the mirror, and I\u2019ve read an article on acting for film. It says the most common mistake, even for trained actors, is to overact, and that the camera picks up the most infinitesimal movements and magnifies them, so you need to make everything tiny.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure Suze realizes this, because she\u2019s spent the whole of breakfast doing all these loud warm-up exercises and shaking her hands out to \u201cloosen herself up\u201d and saying, \u201cWibble-wobble,\u201d over and over again. But I can\u2019t tell her anything about acting, because she just says, \u201cBex, I went to drama school, remember.\u201d</p> <p>The film is being shot at a soundstage in Burbank, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading right now. Luke is dropping off Minnie today, as well as Suze\u2019s children. (As soon as the Little Leaf headmistress found out who Tarkie was, she fell over herself to offer the Cleath-Stuarts temporary places, and the principal of the nearby private school immediately found room for Ernest too.) We\u2019re sitting in the limo, watching the billboards speed by and grinning madly at each other. This is the most exciting thing I have done in my life, ever.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what the scene\u2019s about\u2014in fact, I don\u2019t really know what the film\u2019s about, because all it says online is, Drama set on the high seas. But I\u2019ve done a bit of practice at swinging a cutlass (I used a kitchen knife), because, you never know, it might be a fight scene.</p><p>\u201cHey, Suze, if I have to fight someone, bagsy it\u2019s you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d agrees Suze at once. \u201cExcept, will the womenfolk fight? They might just look on and jeer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are female pirates,\u201d I say knowledgeably. \u201cWe can be one of those. Look at Elizabeth Swann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to fight Captain Jack Sparrow,\u201d says Suze longingly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in it!\u201d I say for the millionth time. Suze is a bit hung up on Johnny Depp, and I think she was hoping that we were going to be in a new Pirates of the Caribbean. But it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s called The Black Flag, and I don\u2019t recognize the names of any of the stars except April Tremont, who is playing Gwennie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not.

Real film trailers!</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here! There are trailers!\u201d I say in excitement. \u201cOh, Dad, you should see it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds fantastic,\u201d says Dad. \u201cWell, you let me know about Brent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I say, only half paying attention. \u201cSee you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>The driver is giving our names to the gate man. As Suze and I stare out of the window, agog, I see a man in a pirate costume walk to one of the trailers, knock on the door, and go inside.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling.</p><p>As we\u2019re whisked into the complex, my head is swiveling this way and that, trying to take in every detail. It\u2019s all just as I imagined. There are girls with earpieces and clipboards. There\u2019s a guy carrying what looks like a marble statue under his arm. There\u2019s a woman in a crinoline, talking to a man in a leather jacket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d says Suze suddenly. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cSuze, you\u2019ll be great!\u201d The car stops and I squeeze her arm encouragingly. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go and find some coffee. You know, the main thing about being in a film is the catering.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m so right about the catering. After wandering about for a few minutes, we find this great big table marked CRAFT SERVICE and covered with a fabulous array of coffee, tea, biscuits, cupcakes, and even little sushi rolls. As I\u2019m eating my third cherry-almond cookie, a guy in a headset comes up, looking a little hassled.</p><p>\u201cAre you Lady Cleath-Stuart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d says Suze, her mouth full of muffin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dino, the second AD. You were supposed to meet me out front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. We wanted some coffee.\u201d Suze beams at him. \u201cThis hazelnut latte is delicious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Great.\u201d He mutters something into a tiny walkie-talkie, then looks up again. \u201cWell, let me take you to meet Don. He\u2019s our publicist, and he\u2019ll be looking after you today.\u201d</p><p>Don is very dapper and has the strangest cheekbones I\u2019ve ever seen. What has gone on with those? Has he had them filled? Or has he had his cheek fat sucked out? Either way, it hasn\u2019t been a success, not that I\u2019m going to mention this or stare at his face. Much. He ushers us into a massive warehouse-like space and lowers his voice as we pick our way over wires and cables.</p><p>\u201cLady Cleath-Stuart,\u201d he says with reverence, \u201cwe\u2019re delighted to welcome you to the set of The Black Flag. We want today to be as enjoyable and interesting for you as possible. Please, follow me. We thought you\u2019d like to see the set before we take you to wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>Suze is totally a VIP! This is so great! We both hurry after him, dodging past some guys carrying a fake stone wall made out of wood. We head toward a cluster of director\u2019s chairs and a monitor and lots of people with headphones and serious expressions.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we call \u2018video village,\u2019 \u201d Don says in an undertone. \u201cThis is where the director watches the action.

It\u2019s the interior of a library, and two actors are sitting on armchairs. The lady is all dressed up in a velvet crinoline, and the man is in a tailcoat. Bending down, talking to them intently, is a skinny guy in jeans with bright red hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Ant, the director,\u201d murmurs Don. As we\u2019re watching, Ant leaps back to his chair, puts on his headphones, and stares intently into his monitor.</p><p>\u201cRolling!\u201d yells someone from the set.</p><p>\u201cRolling!\u201d several other people echo at once. \u201cRolling!

I would die to have a chair with my name on it. My mind is suddenly seized with an image of a chair reading: BECKY BRANDON, WARDROBE DESIGNER. Just imagine if I started working in movies and I got my name on the back of a chair! I wouldn\u2019t ever want to stand up. I\u2019d walk around with my chair stapled to me.</p><p>The wardrobe designer on this movie is called Ren\u00e9e Slattery. I\u2019ve already Googled her and planned what I\u2019ll say if we meet. I\u2019ll compliment the costumes in Saw Her Too Soon, which is another movie she worked on, and then I\u2019ll talk about the challenges of working with period dress. (I don\u2019t know much about that, but I can busk it.) And then I\u2019ll ask casually if she needs any help, maybe with shopping for grosgrain ribbon, or button boots, or whatever.</p><p>I mean, she\u2019s bound to need help, surely? And then we can start working together and bouncing ideas around, and I\u2019ll edge myself in that way.</p><p>Both Suze and I are given director\u2019s chairs with VISITOR written on the back, and we perch self-consciously on them, watching as they shoot the scene twice more. I can\u2019t actually tell the difference between the takes, not that I\u2019ll admit that. Ant keeps swigging coffee and staring into the monitor and shouting instructions to some guy with a high-up camera to the left.</p><p>Suddenly he swivels round and stares at Suze and me, then says, almost aggressively, to Don, \u201cWho are they? What are they doing on my set?\u201d</p> <p>Don ducks his head down and I can hear him murmuring, \u201cLord Cleath-Stuart ... financier ... special guests ... studio ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, keep them out of the way,\u201d says Ant brusquely.</p><p>Honestly! We\u2019re not in the way! I roll my eyes at Suze, but she has found a script from somewhere and is reading through it, mouthing lines to herself. Suze would really have loved to be an actress. (Or an eventer. Or an artist. Or a newsreader. She\u2019s had lots of career ideas, to be honest.)</p><p>\u201cDylan!\u201d The director suddenly raises his voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d A mousy guy in a gray T-shirt hurries forward.</p><p>\u201cThis is the writer,\u201d Don explains to Suze and me. \u201cHe stays on set in case we need extra dialogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need another line here for Lady Violet,\u201d Ant is saying. \u201cWe need to convey the gravitas of what\u2019s happened but also, like, the dignity of Lady Violet. She\u2019s not going to buckle. She\u2019s going to fight.\u201d He pauses. \u201cOnly in, like, three or four words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dylan is nodding anxiously. \u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>As Ant strides away, Dylan starts scribbling on a yellow legal pad, and I watch him in fascination. He\u2019s creating a film, right here. We\u2019re watching film history being made! Then suddenly an idea comes to me. It\u2019s so good, I almost gasp out loud.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, waving to get Dylan\u2019s attention. \u201cExcuse me. I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but a line came to me, and I thought you could use it. It just popped into my head,\u201d I add modestly.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Bex!\u201d exclaims Suze.</p><p>Dylan sighs. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019 \u201d As I say it out loud, I can\u2019t help feeling proud of myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant!\u201d says Suze. \u201cOnly you should say it with more passion. \u2018With great power comes great responsibility,\u2019 \u201d she repeats in a low, throbbing voice. \u201c \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d I add to Dylan, \u201cShe went to drama school, you know.\u201d</p><p>Dylan is looking at us as though we\u2019re both insane.</p><p>\u201cThat line is from Spider-Man,\u201d he says shortly.</p> <p>Spider-Man?</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I wrinkle my brow. \u201cAre you sure? Because I don\u2019t remember it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure! Jeez!\u201d He crosses out the line he\u2019s writing and scribbles something else.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, discomfited. \u201cRight. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, what about, \u2018With great grief comes great challenge\u2019?\u201d suggests Suze.</p> <p>\u201cOr, \u2018With great trouble comes great fortune,\u2019 \u201d I chime in eagerly. \u201cOr, \u2018With great sadness comes great light.\u2019 \u201d I\u2019m quite proud of this one, but Dylan is looking more and more rattled.</p><p>\u201cCould you let me concentrate, please?\u201d he snaps.</p><p>\u201cOh, OK. Sorry.\u201d Suze and I subside, making faces at each other. We watch, fascinated, as he covers his page with writing, then abruptly heads over to Ant.</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. We\u2019ll try it.\u201d Ant walks onto the set, and I can see him showing the page to the actress in the velvet dress.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just take the line to the actors yourself?\u201d I say as Dylan sits down.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t approach the set.\u201d He sounds shocked at the idea. \u201cThe director approaches the set.\u201d</p><p>He sounds like he\u2019s saying, I don\u2019t approach the throne. Blimey, film sets are complicated places. \u201cSo, I hope you enjoyed your visit,\u201d he adds, clearly forcing himself to be polite. \u201cIt was nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we haven\u2019t finished our visit yet,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be in the film!\u201d adds Suze.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re extras!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d He looks from me to Suze and back again.</p><p>I\u2019m about to say he needn\u2019t look so dubious when Ant appears, scowling at Dylan, and chucks the legal pad at him.</p><p>\u201cYolanda says this is flaccid, and I agree. Can\u2019t you do better than that?\u201d</p> <p>Honestly. What a bully. I bet Dylan\u2019s written a brilliant line. (Although not as good as \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cI was distracted by these two,\u201d says Dylan meanly, gesturing at us, and my sympathy instantly evaporates. He didn\u2019t have to blame us! We were trying to help! Ant glowers at us, then glowers even more at Dylan.</p><p>\u201cWell, give me some more options. We\u2019re taking five.\u201d Ant strides away, and Dylan frowns over his legal pad again, chewing his pen. The atmosphere is quite tense, and I\u2019m relieved when Don appears and beckons us away from the chairs.</p><p>\u201cThe actors are having a break,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I thought you\u2019d like to look over the set before we head to wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>We follow him to the set and step cautiously onto the carpet. We\u2019re standing on a real movie set! It\u2019s quite small but really well designed, with shelves of books and a table with ornaments and a fake window with a velvet curtain.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d says Don as his phone buzzes, \u201cI must take this call.\u201d</p><p>He steps off the set, and Suze sits in Lady Violet\u2019s chair. \u201cKidnapped,\u201d she says in a mournful voice. \u201cKidnapped!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally good!\u201d I say. \u201cD\u2019you think Lady Violet\u2019s dress is a bit bunchy? I think it could be more flattering. I might tell the wardrobe person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnapped!\u201d says Suze again, and stares out to the camera, extending her hands as though she\u2019s on a massive London stage and that\u2019s the audience. \u201cOh my God. Kidnapped! Will our nightmare never end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything looks so realistic,\u201d I say, trailing my hand over a row of fake book spines. \u201cLook at this cupboard.\u201d I rattle the door, but it\u2019s stuck fast. \u201cIt looks so real, but it\u2019s fake, like everything.\u201d I wander over to the little table. \u201cI mean, look at these cakes. They look totally real. They even smell real. It\u2019s so clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be real,\u201d points out Suze.</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re not real. Nothing on a film set is real. Look.\u201d I lift one up confidently and take a bite out of it.</p><p>Shit. It was real. I have a mouthful of sponge and cream.</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze is staring at me in consternation. \u201cThat cake is in the film! You can\u2019t eat it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d I say defensively.</p><p>I feel slightly outraged. They shouldn\u2019t have real cakes on a movie set. It goes against the whole spirit of the thing.</p><p>I look around, but no one seems to have seen me. What shall I do now? I can\u2019t put half a cake down on the table.</p><p>\u201cOK, we\u2019re going again,\u201d comes a booming voice. \u201cClear the set!\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. The actors are returning and I still have half a cake in my hands.</p><p>Maybe they won\u2019t notice.</p><p>I hastily sneak off the set, my hands behind my back, and find a place where I\u2019m almost hidden behind a stone pillar. The two actors are sitting back down on the chairs, and everyone is gathering for a new take.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d A girl dressed all in black comes running onto the set. She squints into the screen of a little camera, then peers at the table. \u201cWhat happened to the other cake?\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p> <p>The actors are looking around blankly, as though they hadn\u2019t even realized there were any cakes in the shot.</p><p>\u201cCake?\u201d says the man at last.</p><p>\u201cYes, cake! There should be six!\u201d She jabs at her camera screen. \u201cWhat happened to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t look at me!\u201d says the man, sounding affronted. \u201cI never saw the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there were five,\u201d says the actress playing Lady Violet.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d says the girl in black tightly. \u201cIf I say there were six, then there were six, and unless you want to reshoot everything we\u2019ve done this morning, then I suggest you don\u2019t move the props around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t move anything around!\u201d retorts Lady Violet.</p><p>I have to confess. Go on, Becky. I force myself to step forward onto the edge of the set and clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cUm, excuse me?\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s here. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>I proffer my hand and everyone stares at the half-eaten crumby cake. My cheeks are flaming with embarrassment, especially when a chunk falls on the floor. I quickly bend to get it, feeling worse than ever.</p><p>\u201cShall I put it back on the table?\u201d I venture. \u201cWe could hide the eaten side....\u201d</p><p>The girl in black raises her eyes to mine disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cYou ate a prop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI thought it was fake, and I was just biting it to prove it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t fake,\u201d puts in Suze. \u201cI told her. I said, no fake cake could be that good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it could!\u201d I object. \u201cThey have amazing modern technology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that amazing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d A thought suddenly occurs to me. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good thing. Because would they actually have that many cakes?\u201d I appeal to Ant. \u201cSix is a lot for two people. You don\u2019t want them to look greedy, do you? You don\u2019t want the audience thinking, No wonder Lady Violet needs a corset, if she\u2019s eating all these cakes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Ant flips out. \u201cGet these girls off my set!\u201d He glares at Don. \u201cI don\u2019t care who they are, they\u2019re banned.\u201d</p><p>Banned? Suze and I exchange shocked looks.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to be extras!\u201d says Suze in dismay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry we disturbed you,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to eat the cake. I won\u2019t eat anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnt, listen a moment,\u201d Don says soothingly. He hurries over and starts murmuring in Ant\u2019s ear.</p><p>I can see Ant shooting us baleful looks, but at last he puffs angrily and says, \u201cFine. Whatever. I need to get going.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m holding my breath as Don returns to us and firmly ushers us away from the set.</p><p>\u201cCan we still be extras?\u201d demands Suze anxiously.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d he says, smiling tensely. \u201cNo problem. Let\u2019s just get you to wardrobe and then ... well. What I would recommend is that in the upcoming scene you take more of a backseat role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, don\u2019t talk to the director,\u201d says Suze. \u201cAnd don\u2019t eat the props.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind of thing.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cHear that, Bex?\u201d Suze nudges me. \u201cNo scoffing the set.\u201d</p><p>OK, I\u2019m going to make amends. I\u2019m going to be really quiet and unobtrusive on set. Or at least as unobtrusive as I can be, bearing in mind I\u2019m in a curly red wig, blackened teeth, a hoop skirt, and a laced bodice, which makes my boobs look ... well, \u201cprominent\u201d would be one word. \u201cRidiculous\u201d would be another.</p><p>My makeup was slapped on in about five seconds by a girl listening to an iPod, but, still, I\u2019m transformed! I look dirty, grimy, wrinkled, and kind of scary. As for Suze, she looks like an old crone. She\u2019s got a black matted wig and some kind of tooth plate, which changes the shape of her mouth, and warts all over her hands. She\u2019s walking around with a limp and, honestly, she looks just like a pirate. I\u2019m not doing a limp, but I think I might do a little palsied shake in my hands. Or a twitch. A very subtle one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019ve been put in a side room and all the other extras are sitting around reading books and looking bored, but I\u2019m roaming about, staying alert. The only slight downside is I haven\u2019t yet managed to speak to anyone about job opportunities in wardrobe. Ren\u00e9e Slattery is nowhere to be seen, and all the wardrobe staff are quite harassed. I asked a question about my petticoat length, and the girl in charge said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Next?\u201d</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter? How can a petticoat not matter?</p><p>Then I asked her how she got into her job, and she said, \u201cI was idiot enough to want to get up at five A.M. my whole life,\u201d which is not an answer, and shooshed me along.</p><p>\u201cBackground actors!\u201d The second AD, Dino, is standing at the door. \u201cBackground actors to set, please!\u201d</p> <p>Ooh! That\u2019s us!</p><p>As we file through the soundstage and onto the set, I feel a sizzle of excitement. It\u2019s really happening! I\u2019m going to be in a film! This set is far bigger than the last one and is the inside of a ship\u2019s cabin. There are about ten extras, including Suze and me\u2014all women\u2014and according to a conversation I overheard just now, this is a key, important scene.</p><p>A key, important scene! What if it becomes one of those really famous movie scenes that gets shown on the telly all the time and I\u2019m in it! What if I get discovered! I feel a ridiculous flicker of hope. I mean, I know I\u2019ve never seriously considered acting as a career, but what if I have the right face for film and I never realized it before?</p><p>I\u2019m gripped by a vivid fantasy in which Ant suddenly stops the shooting and focuses the camera on me, then turns to his assistant and says simply, My God. Look at her cheekbones.</p><p>I mean, OK, I know it\u2019s not that likely. But I do have quite good cheekbones, and everything\u2019s different when you look at it through a camera and\u2014</p> <p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze prods me. \u201cDino\u2019s calling you!\u201d</p><p>I hurry over to Dino and look expectantly at him, hoping he might say something like, I\u2019d like to audition you for the small part of Pirate Princess.</p><p>\u201cOK, you. Cake-eater girl.\u201d He looks up from a list.</p><p>Cake-eater girl?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Becky,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d He\u2019s clearly not listening. \u201cNow, I\u2019m placing you where Ant can\u2019t see you. We don\u2019t want him wound up any further. You\u2019ll be polishing Gwennie\u2019s shoes with this rag, and you stay in this position the whole scene. Keep your face down, away from the camera. Got it? Away from the camera.\u201d He turns away, summoning the next girl, and I stare at him, crestfallen.</p> <p>Away from the camera? But no one will see me. What about my family? I want to wail. How will they know it\u2019s me?</p><p>I feel totally crushed as I get into position, groveling on the floor and clutching a manky old rag. This isn\u2019t what I imagined at all. A girl who looks a bit like April Tremont has sat down on the chair and shoots me an uninterested glance. I guess she\u2019s the stand-in.</p><p>\u201cPeople!\u201d Dino is clapping his hands. \u201cA little background to the scene we\u2019ll be playing. The pirates\u2019 womenfolk are preparing for the marriage ceremony. Gwennie, played by April Tremont\u2014\u201d There\u2019s a burst of applause from some of the extras, and Dino smiles in acknowledgment. \u201cGwennie is being given to the pirate bandit, Eduardo, played by Curt Millson. However, she\u2019s in love with the rival pirate, Captain Arthur, aka captain of the Black Flag, and in this scene we\u2019ll see this fact being discovered by Eduardo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say miserably to the stand-in. \u201cI have to polish your shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She lifts up her skirt and I rub her shoe dispiritedly.</p><p>\u201cOK, we\u2019re going to rehearse!\u201d comes Dino\u2019s voice. \u201cAction!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage to Eduardo,\u201d says the stand-in, in a monotone. \u201cNever while I\u2019m alive.\u201d She takes out a scarf and fondles it. \u201cOh, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBackground actors,\u201d instructs Dino. \u201cI want you to look at the scarf. You\u2019re interested in it.\u201d</p> <p>Obediently, I crick my head to look at the scarf, but Dino immediately says, \u201cNot you, cake-eater girl.\u201d</p><p>Great. Everyone else gets to look at the scarf while I get to grovel on the floorboards. The door swings open with a creak and I hear the tramp of heavy boots.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that pretty thing?\u201d comes a deep, masculine voice. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d says the stand-in.</p><p>Then there\u2019s some sort of tussle, but I can\u2019t see because I don\u2019t dare lift my head. This is so frustrating. I\u2019m longing to see what it\u2019s all about, but I can\u2019t see a bloody thing, stuck down here. I\u2019ll never get to do my twitch, let alone say, \u2019Tis true, Cap\u2019n. It\u2019s so depressing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>I sit back on my heels and wave at Suze, trying not to feel envious.

Not that he seems to notice any of the extras anyway.</p><p>\u201cI want some real violence in this scene,\u201d I hear him saying above my head. \u201cCurt, when you see the insignia of your enemy on Gwennie\u2019s scarf, everything changes. You know she\u2019s in love with Arthur, and it infuriates you. Remember, this scene is the pivot; it\u2019s what drives you to attack the Fleet of Foes; it\u2019s what starts the whole chain of events. OK, guys? Passion. Intensity. Let\u2019s go for a take.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, I can\u2019t help feeling a jolt of excitement. A take! We\u2019re going for a take! It\u2019s happening!</p> <p>An hour later, I\u2019m feeling a teeny bit less excited. We\u2019ve done the scene over and over, and every time I have to keep my head down while all the action goes on above, and I\u2019m getting achy knees from being in this position.</p><p>Plus, the more we do the scene, the less I understand it.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d April Tremont smiles down from where she\u2019s having her makeup touched up. \u201cPretty tough down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine!\u201d I say at once. \u201cFine! Really fab!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoying the scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d I hesitate. I know I should say, Yes, it\u2019s brilliant! But the truth is, I just can\u2019t relate to it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I say at last. \u201cBut you\u2019re really good,\u201d I add quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhich part don\u2019t you get?\u201d says April, looking interested.</p> <p>\u201cWell, why are you playing with your scarf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a memento from my lover, Arthur,\u201d explains April. \u201cIt has his distinctive insignia on it. See?\u201d She holds the scarf out so I can see.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I nod. \u201cBut you\u2019re on Eduardo\u2019s ship. He\u2019s really violent and he hates Arthur. So wouldn\u2019t you keep it hidden? If you really loved Arthur you\u2019d protect him, surely.\u201d</p><p>April Tremont stares at me silently for a few moments. \u201cThat\u2019s a good point,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy am I playing with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re supposed to be quite stupid?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says April sharply. \u201cI\u2019m not. Ant!\u201d She raises her voice. \u201cAnt, come over here!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I tuck my face down into her skirt and try to look as inconspicuous as possible.</p><p>\u201cAnt, I have a problem with my motivation,\u201d says April. \u201cWhy does Gwennie get out the scarf?\u201d</p><p>I sneak a quick glance upward\u2014and Ant is staring at April as though suspecting a trick question.</p><p>\u201cWe went through this already,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s sentimental. She\u2019s thinking of her lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why get the scarf out now, when it\u2019s so dangerous? She\u2019s on an enemy ship. Why would she be so foolhardy?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a few moments, then Ant yells, \u201cDylan! Get over here. Please explain to April the motivation of her character.\u201d</p><p>At once Dylan comes hurrying over, his sneakers squeaking on the floor of the soundstage. \u201cOh OK,\u201d he says, sounding a bit nervous. \u201cWell, Gwennie is thinking of her lover, Arthur. She\u2019s remembering the times they had together. So she gets out the scarf\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d interrupts April.</p><p>\u201cTo remember him by.\u201d Dylan sounds a bit flummoxed. \u201cThat\u2019s her motivation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she can remember him without a scarf. Why would she risk his life for the sake of a scarf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a woman,\u201d says Dylan feebly. \u201cShe\u2019s sentimental.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a woman?\u201d retorts April, sounding suddenly livid. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman? That\u2019s no kind of answer! Just because she\u2019s a woman, it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s an imbecile! I\u2019m not doing it,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cI\u2019m not taking out the scarf. Gwennie isn\u2019t a moron. She wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to take out the scarf!\u201d says Dylan in consternation. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of the scene!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to find a different point for the scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril, sweetie,\u201d says Ant, breathing hard. \u201cYou have to take out the scarf. If Eduardo doesn\u2019t see the scarf, then he won\u2019t launch the attack on the Fleet of Foes. That\u2019s the whole second act. That\u2019s the whole fucking movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d says April obstinately. \u201cBecky\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Ant sounds at the end of his tether. \u201cWho\u2019s Becky?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I raise my head from April\u2019s skirts to see Ant staring at me with a thunderous disbelief.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d I say nervously, and risk a little smile. \u201cFab directing,\u201d I quickly add. \u201cReally inspired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou again?\u201d says Dylan incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Ant expostulates. \u201cYou\u2019re derailing my movie!\u201d He almost looks like he might hit me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cI mean\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should be thanking her!\u201d says April. \u201cThe scene has a big hole in it, and she\u2019s the only one who noticed.\u201d She stands up. \u201cSort out your scene, gentlemen. I\u2019ll be in my trailer. Gilly, Uggs?\u201d</p><p>One of the wardrobe girls hurries forward and unlaces April\u2019s button boots.</p><p>\u201cApril!\u201d says Ant. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t pick it up, the critics will,\u201d she snaps. She steps into a pair of Uggs and strides across the soundstage. She\u2019s leaving. Oh my God.</p><p>\u201cCome back here!\u201d says Ant furiously.</p><p>\u201cFix the scene!\u201d she retorts over her shoulder.</p><p>I can see Ant and Dylan exchanging perturbed looks.</p><p>\u201cApril, be reasonable.\u201d Ant hurries after her. \u201cLook, we\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d</p> <p>As I glance around, all the extras and crew are watching, riveted. What do we do now?</p><p>There\u2019s a hurried confab going on between Dino and some other guy in a headset, then Dino strides toward the set.</p><p>\u201cOK, lunch. Lunch, everybody.\u201d</p><p>At once, the extras all start to head off, and Suze bounds across the set to me, as fast as she can in her big skirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone\u2019s blaming you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stare at her in dismay. \u201cThat is so unfair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re pleased. They might get overtime. Shall we go and get some lunch? They might have some more of that sushi. You know, I might become a full-time extra,\u201d she adds as we walk along. \u201cI\u2019ve learned such a lot. There\u2019s a special agency you join, and there\u2019s plenty of work if you have the right look. You can make good money!\u201d</p><p>Good money? I want to point out to Suze that she already has good money, what with her husband being a squillionaire, only she looks so animated, I don\u2019t like to.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you can ride a horse, that counts as a special skill,\u201d she\u2019s saying when a fresh-faced girl hurries up to us.</p><p>\u201cBecky? Is one of you Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I say, a bit nervously.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tremont would like to see you in her trailer.\u201d</p><p>Suze and I look at each other, agog. A trailer! A proper movie star wants to see me in her trailer!</p><p>\u201cCan my friend come too?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSure. This way.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m slightly disappointed in the trailer, to be honest. I was expecting it to be full of roses and champagne buckets and cards from the producers and maybe some signed photos from George Clooney, not just look like a mini-caravan with magazines and bottles of Evian and energy bars scattered around. April is on the phone as we enter, and I sit down cautiously on a bench-thing next to Suze.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t mind having a trailer, I find myself thinking idly. Imagine if, everywhere you went in life, there was a little trailer waiting for you to go and relax in whenever you felt like it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Imagine taking a trailer shopping.

This is my friend Suze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Suze.\u201d April bestows her radiant smile on Suze, then turns back to me. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were OK. I don\u2019t want you getting any backlash from Ant. You have any trouble with him, you let me know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I say, touched.</p><p>\u201cWell, I owe you.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI should have picked up that issue at the read-through. Or someone should have. Those guys are idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will they do now?\u201d I say in slight trepidation. \u201cHave I really derailed the whole movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheesh, no!\u201d She laughs. \u201cThey\u2019ll write another scene. They\u2019ll fix it. That\u2019s their job. But I\u2019d like to do you a favor in return, if I can.\u201d She looks earnestly at me. \u201cDo you have an agent? Do you need a better one? Would you like a contact? I know how tough it is out there; anything can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t have an agent,\u201d I start to explain. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really what I do\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love an agent!\u201d chimes in Suze. \u201cI want to be an extra. I think it could be my new career.\u201d</p><p>April Tremont surveys us both curiously. \u201cYou\u2019re not actors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to drama school,\u201d says Suze quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve got a diploma. I was highly commended in my modern speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got on the film because of Tarkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarkie\u2019s her husband,\u201d I explain. \u201cHe finances films.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow I find out,\u201d says Suze bitterly.</p><p>\u201cSo everyone was like, \u2018Do you want to watch a film being made?\u2019 and we said, \u2018No, we want to be in it.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSo here we are!\u201d</p><p>We both come to a halt and look expectantly at April. It seems as though she\u2019s having slight trouble following.</p><p>\u201cSo you need an agent,\u201d she says to Suze.</p><p>\u201cYes, please!\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cAnd you need ...\u201d She turns to me. \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a job in styling,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I used to work in Barneys, and I\u2019m trying to make it in Hollywood, but it\u2019s really hard to get a foot in the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBex is brilliant,\u201d says Suze loyally. \u201cShe makes anyone look good. Even my sister-in-law Fenella, who, believe me ...\u201d She makes a face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got good shoulders,\u201d I say. \u201cYou just have to focus on the shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says April thoughtfully. \u201cWell, how about this? I have a friend who\u2019s a stylist and she\u2019s run ragged. I know she\u2019s always looking for talented people to work with her. How about I fix up a meeting for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be amazing!\u201d I gasp. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both be at the Actors\u2019 Society Awards, Friday night. How about I get you a ticket? I\u2019ll get you both a pair of tickets. It\u2019s a fun evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I grin delightedly at Suze. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s name is Cyndi.\u201d April scribbles the name on a piece of paper. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there with her new client. You can meet her too. Maybe you guys will all end up working together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I take the piece of paper. \u201cThanks. Who\u2019s her new client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois Kellerton,\u201d says April, and I freeze. I\u2019m aware of Suze opening her eyes wide, and I try desperately to ignore her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d says April, sensing the tension. \u201cDo you know Lois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cNot at all. No. Never met. Why would I have met Lois Kellerton?\u201d I give a shrill, unnatural laugh.</p><p>\u201cOK. Well, Lois is lovely,\u201d says April. \u201cWe\u2019re friends too\u2014in fact, we\u2019re neighbors. We\u2019ve both lived on Doheny Road forever. You\u2019ll get along great.\u201d</p><p>This is the first time I\u2019ve heard anyone describe Lois as \u201clovely,\u201d and April clearly notices my surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she says.</p><p>I know I should keep my mouth shut, but I can\u2019t resist it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just I heard Lois was ... tricky to deal with?\u201d I venture. \u201cIsn\u2019t her new film running into problems?\u201d</p><p>April sighs. \u201cI wish Lois didn\u2019t have this reputation. She\u2019s a wonderful girl. And the film will be wonderful. It\u2019s the story of the early female athletes, you know, using some original footage from the Olympics. So smart. And, yes, there have been glitches, but every movie has glitches.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to ...

And I never told you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Suze nods fervently, then looks up. \u201cHey, what will Luke say about you meeting Lois? Isn\u2019t Lois Sage\u2019s big nemesis? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be on Team Sage?\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. In the heat of the moment, I\u2019d forgotten all about that. Damn. I reach for an energy bar, thinking hard.

I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLuke will be completely supportive of my career,\u201d I say at last, a bit more firmly than I feel. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t both have to be on Team Sage, do we? We can have Chinese whatsits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suze looks blank. \u201cFortune cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling. \u201cWalls. Where you\u2019re on different sides but it\u2019s OK because you don\u2019t pass on any secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalls?\u201d says Suze mistrustfully. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of walls. You shouldn\u2019t have walls in a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot real walls; Chinese walls.\u201d</p> <p>Suze doesn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cI still don\u2019t like it. I think you should be on the same side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so do I,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cBut what am I supposed to do? I tried styling Sage and she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyle a different celebrity, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? They\u2019re not exactly queuing up for my services, are they?\u201d I feel a bit ratty with Suze, partly because I know she\u2019s got a point. \u201cLook, it\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019ll be like that film where the husband and wife are opposing lawyers in the courtroom, but when they\u2019re at home everything\u2019s fine and lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat film?\u201d says Suze suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cEr ... you know. That one.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m making this up as I go along, but I won\u2019t admit it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d demands Suze.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what it\u2019s called. Look, I\u2019m only in Hollywood once, Suze. I have to at least see if I can make it as a stylist.\u201d As I say the words, I realize how much I\u2019ve been wanting this opportunity, how disappointed I\u2019ve been at all my failures. And now a real, proper chance is within my grasp. \u201cLuke will understand,\u201d I add. \u201cI\u2019ll work it out with him somehow.

Oh, and Juliet. Except we only did three scenes, because Shakespeare IS a bit long.</p><p>SPECIAL SKILLS (E.G., RIDING, JUGGLING): Oh, loads! Riding, tennis, fly-fishing, yoga, making photo frames, flower arranging, folding napkins into shapes, icing cakes (I did a course; Daddy thought I might go into catering).

(Don\u2019t tell Tarkie I said that.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Page 1 of 3</p><p>It\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve dealt with many awkward social encounters in my time; it\u2019ll be fine. I mean, OK, so I\u2019ve never met a movie star who: 1. I\u2019ve caught shoplifting, 2. has a tricky reputation (perhaps undeserved), 3. I know the entire life history of, having Googled her solidly for about three days.</p><p>But still. I expect it\u2019ll go really well. We\u2019ll probably really hit it off and meet up for coffee, go shopping together....</p><p>No. I pull myself up short. Not shopping. I mean, what if she pinches something? What if she asks me to be her accomplice and I don\u2019t know how to say no? I have a sudden hideous vision of the headline:</p> <p>STYLIST AND MOVIE STAR ARRESTED IN BARNEYS, STUFFING DESIGNER SOCKS IN BAGS. SEE PICTURES P. 8, 9, 10.</p><p>Argh. Stop it, Becky. That\u2019s not going to happen. Decision one: If I get to work on Lois\u2019s styling team, then I\u2019ll tell her I never shop with my clients. And if by any chance we do go shopping and she asks me to shoplift something, I\u2019ll ... I\u2019ll pretend I don\u2019t understand and back away. And then run. Yes. Good plan.</p><p>At least I\u2019ve done my research. I know so much about Lois Kellerton, I could write a book about her. I know she started her career at age two in an infomercial about road safety, and she had an agent at age three, and her parents gave up their jobs to focus on her career. Her mother is the driven one and her father is the had-lots-of-affairs-and-ran-off one, so I won\u2019t mention him.</p><p>Nor will I mention Sage. I hadn\u2019t quite realized what a feud they\u2019ve been having. It\u2019s not just the cancer-victim-shaving-head remark that Sage keeps going on about. It started ages ago, when they both arrived at an event in the same vivid green dress, and Sage accused Lois of doing it on purpose. Then Sage didn\u2019t turn up to an AIDS event organized by Lois. She was supposed to be presenting the whole evening, apparently, and Lois said she felt \u201csnubbed and let down\u201d but that she wasn\u2019t surprised that Sage had \u201conce again displayed her innate selfishness.\u201d</p><p>Then, last year, Lois did the Hollywood Walk of Fame and said in her speech, \u201cHollywood is in my DNA.\u201d Whereupon Sage immediately commented on Facebook, God help Hollywood.</p> <p>What\u2019s really sad is that they used to be friends, years ago. They even appeared in a TV show together as children. But Hollywood is a tough place for the twenty-first-century actress, and she learns to look on every other star as an enemy (according to Hollywouldn\u2019t.com, this brilliant blog I found). Apparently, actresses compete over roles, men, ad campaigns, and even plastic surgeons. They set up camps like royal courts and become paranoid about their competitors, even those they\u2019re \u201cfriends\u201d with.</p><p>It all sounds super-stressy. I can\u2019t imagine competing with Suze over a plastic surgeon. Although, to be fair, we did once clash over an Orla Kiely coat which we both wanted to buy on eBay. (Suze got it. But she lends it to me.)</p><p>Anyway, so there are quite a few possible conversational pitfalls, if and when I meet Lois tonight. I won\u2019t mention Sage, or shoplifting (or shopping), or Lois\u2019s dad, or Lois\u2019s latest film, The Spiked Bed (it got bad reviews), or white sugar (she thinks it\u2019s evil). Not that I was planning to mention white sugar, but still. Worth remembering. Topics I can safely mention: Lois\u2019s Golden Globe, kettlebells, macadamia nuts. I\u2019ve written them down in case I get tongue-tied.</p><p>\u201cWhy macadamia nuts?\u201d says Suze, who has been reading the list with interest.</p><p>\u201cBecause Lois loves them,\u201d I say. \u201cIt said so in Health and Fitness. So I\u2019ll pretend to love them, too, and we\u2019ll connect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what can you say about macadamia nuts?\u201d objects Suze.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI\u2019ll say, They\u2019re really nutty, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you say about kettlebells? Have you ever even seen a kettlebell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. Lois has done a kettlebell DVD, so it\u2019s a good conversational topic.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re in my room, getting ready for the Actors\u2019 Society Awards, or ASAs, as everyone calls them. And I can\u2019t help feeling a little bit hyper. I have to get it right tonight. I have to make a good impression. I\u2019ve analyzed Lois\u2019s style endlessly over the last few days, and I\u2019ve got loads of ideas for her. I think she could go far more young and glam. She wears dresses that are too old for her. And who does her hair?</p><p>\u201cI read another piece in Variety today saying Lois\u2019s career is on the skids,\u201d says Suze conversationally. \u201cHair up or down?\u201d She grabs her hair extensions in one hand and piles them in a knot on her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUp. That looks amazing. And it isn\u2019t on the skids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, her price has fallen. Apparently she\u2019s really moody. Shannon\u2019s worked with her. Shannon says she\u2019s permanently on the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShannon\u2019s just jealous,\u201d I snap.</p><p>I\u2019m getting a bit sick of this Shannon. After our departure from The Black Flag, Suze got herself a day\u2019s work as an extra on a TV show called Cyberville and made a new friend called Shannon, who\u2019s been a professional extra for over twenty years. Shannon considers herself an expert on Hollywood, and Suze treats all her views with total reverence and keeps spouting them back to me. I mean, honestly. Just because you\u2019ve been in The Matrix, it doesn\u2019t mean you know everything.</p> <p>\u201cLois just needs an exciting new look,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cWhich I will give her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Luke say about it?\u201d Suze turns, her voice muffled by hairpins in her mouth. \u201cYou never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um.\u201d I play for time by lining my lips carefully, even though I\u2019ve already lined them.</p><p>\u201cHe is OK with it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Suze gives me a sharp look. \u201cBex, you did tell him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d I cast around for the best answer. \u201cThere\u2019s no point telling him yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to tell him!\u201d Suze shoves a sparkly clip into her hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t just join Team Lois and he has no idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even met Lois properly yet,\u201d I retort. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t get on? Then I\u2019ll have told Luke for no reason. I\u2019ll wait till I get hired and then I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to tell Luke yet about meeting Lois. First because I secretly know that Suze is right\u2014Luke might raise objections. And, second, because I want to tell him when I\u2019m already a success. I want to prove that I can make it here on my own.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he sees you making conversation with Lois tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, this isn\u2019t the Cold War! I\u2019m allowed to talk to people! I\u2019ll just say we were chatting. Can you hook me up?\u201d</p><p>As Suze starts pulling at the fabric of my corset dress, my phone bleeps with three new texts, all in a row, and I reach for it on a nearby chair.</p> <p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Suze scolds me. \u201cI can\u2019t hook you if you move around. It\u2019s only a text.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, just Luke?\u201d I say, punching in my code. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s just Tarquin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you would; you say it all the time.\u201d Suze wrenches at my dress. \u201cAre you sure this is the right size?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t answer. I\u2019m staring at my phone in a state of shock.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Suze pokes me. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d I say at last.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElinor. Here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d says Suze in alarm.</p><p>\u201cNo, not now, but soon. In a week or so. I sent her a text, asking her to come, but I never thought she would\u2014\u201d I turn to face Suze, suddenly petrified. \u201cOh God. What shall I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stage an intervention, remember?\u201d says Suze. \u201cBecause you\u2019re so brilliant at conflict resolution, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I swallow. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Somehow it all sounded better in theory. But the idea that Elinor is actually going to get on a plane to L.A., and Luke has no idea, and I\u2019ll have the two of them to manage ...</p><p>\u201cSuze, you have to help me,\u201d I say plaintively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helping you!\u201d she says at once. \u201cCount me out. I always thought it was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a bad idea! It\u2019s just ... it might be more difficult than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were an expert,\u201d says Suze rather unfeelingly. \u201cI thought you had a variety of techniques up your sleeve and Buddha would guide you with his infinite wisdom.\u201d She pauses, then adds, \u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll buy you some more wind chimes, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, honestly, Bex, you must be nuts. What happened about Elinor\u2019s surgery anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was canceled,\u201d I say, reading the third text again. \u201cIt was only a minor procedure on her toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer toe?\u201d Suze stares at me. \u201cI thought she was dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think you should cancel her. Say you made a mistake and you won\u2019t be here.\u201d She prods my shoulder. \u201cTurn around. There\u2019s one more hook to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn round, thinking hard. That\u2019s the obvious option. The easy solution. I could text Elinor back. Tell her not to come; make some excuse. We\u2019ll probably never see her again. But is that really what I want? Is that really for the best for all of us? For Luke? For Minnie?</p><p>Suze fixes the last hook in place. \u201cThere. Done.\u201d Then she adds, \u201cOr you could always say Minnie was ill,\u201d she adds. \u201cI do that all the time if I want to get out of things.

I\u2019m sure I can do it. With or without help,\u201d I say pointedly.</p><p>\u201cWho needs help?\u201d comes Luke\u2019s voice from the corridor, and I stiffen. I hastily turn off my phone and paste on a casual smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I say brightly as he comes in, all smart in black tie. \u201cJust talking about ... kettlebells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous,\u201d says Luke, shooting me an odd look. \u201cWhat is a kettlebell? I keep hearing about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an exercise device,\u201d I improvise. \u201cIt\u2019s modeled on a kettle. And a bell, obviously. Both. So, what time shall we leave?\u201d I add hurriedly.</p> <p>\u201cOh God, is that the time?\u201d Suze suddenly sounds fractious. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tarkie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him.\u201d Luke glances at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to go in about twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Luke wasn\u2019t originally intending to come to the ASAs, but then Sage announced she wanted to go, and her whole entourage had to come too. Apparently she wanted to bring a monkey as a publicity stunt, and Luke had to talk her out of it. A monkey! Imagine if it made a mess everywhere.</p><p>Now Luke\u2019s eye has fallen on a shiny cardboard carrier bag lying on the bed, out of which is poking a diamant\u00e9-encrusted clutch.</p><p>\u201cAnother bag, Becky?\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cI thought the bag you bought at the weekend was so perfect you would use it forever and it would be your signature look and people would call you the Girl with the Lara Bohinc Bag?\u201d</p><p>I feel a dart of righteous indignation. Husbands should not memorize conversations, word for word. It\u2019s against the whole spirit of marriage. But in this case I don\u2019t mind, because whatever he\u2019s thinking, he\u2019s wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThat clutch isn\u2019t for me. I bought it in my role as stylist. It\u2019s tax-deductible,\u201d I add smartly.</p><p>I don\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s true, but it must be, surely?</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course. The styling.\u201d Luke looks quizzical. \u201cHow\u2019s that going, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say robustly. \u201cLots of potential. Lots of irons in the fire.\u201d</p><p>Luke sighs. \u201cBecky, sweetheart, I wish you\u2019d let me help you. I\u2019m sure I could get you a couple of introductions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help!\u201d I reply, stung. \u201cI\u2019m on the case.\u201d</p><p>This is why I don\u2019t want to mention Lois Kellerton yet. I want to show him. The bag\u2019s for Lois, of course. It\u2019s a one-off from a vintage shop and has an Art Deco design that I think she\u2019ll love. Lately, Lois has taken to wearing really subtle, muted shades, which is all very well, but I think she needs to \u201cpop\u201d more, and this bag will be perfect. Especially against all that lovely dark hair. I\u2019m planning to give it to her tonight, as an icebreaker, and hopefully we can take things from there.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Suze is tapping at her phone. \u201cHonestly, this bloody Golden Peace ...\u201d She shoots me an accusing look, which is totally unfair. \u201cI told him to get back in good time,\u201d she mutters as she presses SEND. \u201cHe totally loses track of time. What\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p> <p>I know Suze thinks Tarkie attends Golden Peace far too much. But she\u2019s prejudiced. The truth is, Tarkie is having a brilliant time hanging out with his volleyball gang, being one of the guys. No one pesters him about listed gables or investments in South Africa. Nor do they keep trying to pitch him movie ideas, because that kind of thing is totally banned at Golden Peace. I think it\u2019s the first place he\u2019s ever been where he\u2019s just him. Tarkie. The person.</p><p>From outside comes the sound of car doors slamming. A moment later I hear the front door opening and closing, followed by footsteps in the hall. There we go. I knew Tarkie would turn up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou see? He\u2019s here.\u201d I grab my Lara Bohinc clutch bag and the diamant\u00e9 one. \u201cLet\u2019s have a titchy while he gets ready.\u201d</p><p>Suze is stepping into her teetering high heels, which make her look even taller and more willowy than usual. Her blond hair, piled high in snaky curls, gives her yet more height, and she basically looks amazing: all golden suntanned limbs and fake lashes and imperious frown. No one can frown like Suze. She\u2019s really quite scary, especially when she\u2019s towering above you in her Louboutins. She gets it from her mother, who is equally formidable. Apparently she can trace her ancestry back to Boudicca. (Do I mean Boadicea? The fierce fighty woman anyway.)</p><p>Now Suze grabs her clutch (Tory Burch, snakeskin, on sale at Bloomingdale\u2019s) and strides out of the room, calling, \u201cTarkie! Where have you been? We have to go!\u201d</p><p>I hurry after her along the galleried landing and stop dead at the same time as she does. Tarkie is in the hall below, but he\u2019s not alone. He\u2019s with Bryce, who is looking as tanned and crinkly-eyed as ever. They\u2019re both in baggy surfer shorts and bandannas, and Tarkie is holding a Frisbee. I\u2019ve seen Tarkie holding many weird things in my time\u2014a First World War gun, an antique stuffed owl, an ancient scythe\u2014but somehow seeing him with a Frisbee makes me want to burst into giggles.</p> <p>As I glance at Suze, I can tell she isn\u2019t thrilled.</p><p>\u201cHello, Bryce,\u201d she says, overly pleasant, walking down the stairs. \u201cHow lovely to see you again. Please don\u2019t let us keep you. Tarkie, you\u2019d better get changed.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Suze\u2019s clipped, polite tones are like little shards of glass landing one by one. Her smile is icy, and the atmosphere is distinctly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019d rather not come tonight if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d says Tarkie, apparently oblivious. \u201cBryce\u2019s organized an evening hike with some of the chaps. Sounds rather fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, darling, we\u2019re going to the Actors\u2019 Society Awards. Remember? We arranged it?\u201d Suze\u2019s voice is so flinty that even Tarkie seems to realize something\u2019s up.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Suze, you don\u2019t need me there, do you?\u201d he says pleadingly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be full of ghastly people.\u201d</p><p>Only Tarkie could describe the pick of A-list Hollywood celebrities as \u201cghastly people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do need you there!\u201d exclaims Suze. \u201cAnd I could have done without you disappearing all day too. Where\u2019ve you been anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe played volleyball,\u201d says Tarquin, looking a bit shifty. \u201cAnd we had lunch ... and we talked....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll afternoon?\u201d Suze is sounding shriller and shriller.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d says Bryce charmingly, in that smooth, hypnotic voice of his. \u201cI waylaid Tarquin. We got talking and never stopped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize! It was a wonderful day.\u201d Tarkie turns eagerly to Suze. \u201cSuze, darling, Bryce has so many brilliant insights. I\u2019d love us all to have supper one night. And, Bryce\u2014\u201d He turns back to him. \u201cI\u2019d love to come to that class you were talking about. Meditation, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMindfulness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Sounds ... ahm ... fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m brilliant at that,\u201d I put in helpfully. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to any classes, Tarquin!\u201d snaps Suze.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d says Bryce, surprisingly. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all essential. Tarquin, I think you\u2019re someone who will heal himself through a slow, natural process. Just don\u2019t be afraid to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Ahm ... absolutely.\u201d Tarquin looks uncomfortable. \u201cThe thing is, it\u2019s not terribly easy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Bryce nods. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. But it\u2019ll come. Remember, it doesn\u2019t have to be with anyone. The sea will hear you. The air will hear you.

She\u2019s practically sparking as she squares up to him....</p> <p>Oh my God, does she fancy him? I mean, everyone kind of fancies Bryce\u2014you\u2019d have to be inhuman not to\u2014but does she really fancy him?</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d At last Suze swivels and addresses Tarkie. \u201cWe need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you, Tarquin,\u201d says Bryce, apparently unoffended.</p><p>\u201cCall me, Bryce,\u201d says Tarkie. \u201cIf you and the chaps are playing volleyball, or if there\u2019s another hike ...\u201d He\u2019s so eager and hopeful, he reminds me of a little boy running after the cool kids in the playground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call.\u201d Bryce nods kindly, then turns and leaves.</p> <p>\u201cWell!\u201d Suze exhales as the door closes.</p><p>\u201cInteresting guy,\u201d says Luke noncommittally. \u201cWhat\u2019s his background, Tarquin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Tarkie. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He turns on Suze. \u201cI think you could be a bit more polite to my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your friend,\u201d retorts Suze.</p><p>\u201cHe is! He\u2019s more of a friend than most of the people in my life! He\u2019s cleverer, and kinder, and he understands more\u2014\u201d Tarquin breaks off, and we all gape at him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard Tarkie so impassioned in my life.</p><p>I mean, I\u2019d have to agree. I\u2019ve met Tarquin\u2019s friends, and most of them can only say about six words: \u201cGood shot\u201d and \u201c \u2019Nother titchy?\u201d and \u201cDamned pheasant.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine any of them talking about the soul finding the answers.</p> <p>And if you ask me, Suze is making a big mistake. Why shouldn\u2019t Tarkie blabber his guts out to the sea if it helps him? He was in a real old state before he got out here. At least now he has a glow to his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, then I don\u2019t know how to explain,\u201d Tarquin finishes at last.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t,\u201d says Suze angrily.</p><p>In silence, Tarquin heads up the stairs, his Frisbee dangling at his side. I exchange anxious glances with Luke, then look at Suze. She\u2019s standing with her hands on her hips, her cheeks puffed out defiantly.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I hiss as soon as Tarkie is out of earshot. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just ...\u201d She exhales. \u201cI just don\u2019t like that guy. He winds me up.\u201d</p><p>He winds her up. Well, that proves it. She does fancy him, even if she doesn\u2019t realize it herself. It\u2019s a sexual-chemistry thing, and she\u2019s trying to resist it and is taking it out on poor Tarkie with an irrational prejudice. Boom! Diagnosed!</p><p>Honestly, I should go into psychology. I\u2019ve clearly got a real knack for it.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what Tarkie\u2019s like,\u201d Suze continues. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him much recently. He\u2019s started saying weird things. He\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and that\u2019s a good thing! I want to exclaim. Have you forgotten what a wreck he was? But now isn\u2019t the moment.</p><p>\u201cLook, never mind,\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go out and have some fun and talk about it another time.\u201d</p><p>The truth is, Suze could probably do with some sea-talking natural-healing soul-finding stuff herself. (Only I won\u2019t say that, because she\u2019d probably stamp on my foot, and she\u2019s wearing her spikiest Louboutins.)</p><p>The Actors\u2019 Society Awards are being held at the Willerton Hotel, and according to the program they are for lesser-known actors whose art may not find recognition elsewhere. The trouble is, the whole place is stuffed full of major celebrities, so the poor old \u201clesser-known actors\u201d aren\u2019t getting a look-in. I\u2019ve already seen Diane Kruger and Hugh Jackman and the blond one off that show with the kangaroo. And now the photographers outside are yelling, \u201cTom! Tom!\u201d in a total frenzy, although whether it\u2019s Cruise or Hanks I don\u2019t know.</p><p>(Or Selleck?)</p><p>(Or some other new hot Tom I don\u2019t know about?)</p><p>At least there was only one red carpet this time, not that my feet touched it for more than thirty seconds. All the stars were posing on one side for the photographers, while we lesser mortals were pushed along briskly by men in headsets who were practically holding cattle prods. I mean, I was virtually running, and Suze twisted her ankle.</p><p>\u201cBest Hairspray,\u201d says Suze, nodding at a woman with rock-solid hair.</p><p>\u201cBest Fake Boobs,\u201d I chime in, pointing to a girl striding by in a strapless dress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOoh, look! Best Producer Being Mean to Her Assistant,\u201d says Suze, gesturing at a scrawny woman in a tux, who is talking fiercely through the side of her mouth at a young girl who looks like she might start crying.</p><p>The actual awards don\u2019t start for another whole hour, and as far as I can see, neither Sage nor Lois is here yet. Suze says her ankle is too painful to mill around, and Tarkie has disappeared off with a friend of his from volleyball, so we\u2019re sitting at our table with glasses of wine, giving out our own awards.</p><p>\u201cI saw that girl in the loos.\u201d Suze nudges me as a beautiful red-haired girl walks by. \u201cShe gets Best Use of Concealer. And Best Drying Her Armpits under the Hot-Air Dryer\u2014oh!\u201d She breaks off. \u201cApril! Hello!\u201d</p><p>I swivel round and gulp. There\u2019s April Tremont, looking very slinky in a peacock-blue dress. And standing next to her is ...</p> <p>Oh my God. My heart suddenly starts bumping in my chest.</p><p>\u201cLois, may I introduce Rebecca Brandon\u201d says April. \u201cRebecca, this is Lois Kellerton.\u201d</p><p>Seeing celebrities in real life is like seeing a Magic Eye, I\u2019ve decided. At first they seem totally unreal, like a magazine or a film billboard come to life. Then your eyes gradually adjust and they take on 3-D form. And at last they kind of turn into real people. Kind of.</p><p>Lois\u2019s face is thinner even than it was when I saw her before. Her skin is so fair it\u2019s almost translucent. Her wavy hair is caught up in a loose knot, and she\u2019s wearing a drifty, silky gray dress that makes her look like a shadow.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says softly.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say awkwardly, holding out my hand. \u201cLovely to ... meet you.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand\u2014and I see something snap in her face. She\u2019s realized. She\u2019s recognized me. My stomach clenches in apprehension. How is this going to go?</p><p>All credit to Lois, she\u2019s totally kept her cool. Her pupils haven\u2019t even dilated. No one would have any idea we\u2019ve met before. That\u2019s what acting training does for you, I expect.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d she says slowly.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I swallow. \u201cI\u2019m Becky.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t mention shoplifting, I tell myself firmly. Do not even THINK about shoplifting. The trouble is, the more I tell myself not to think about it, the more I can\u2019t help it. I feel like her secret is dancing up and down inside me, shouting, Let me out!</p> <p>\u201cI love macadamias,\u201d I blurt out in desperation. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Lois looks puzzled, then adds, \u201cSo, you want to be a stylist, April tells me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky is a stylist!\u201d says Suze loyally. \u201cShe used to work at Barneys as a personal shopper. She\u2019s brilliant. I\u2019m Suze, by the way. I\u2019m in the profession too,\u201d she adds grandly. \u201cI\u2019m a background artist.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, what is Suze like? I\u2019m in the profession too.</p><p>\u201cI shopped at Barneys a couple times when I was filming in New York,\u201d says Lois. \u201cI saw ... Janet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanet was my boss!\u201d I try not to sound too excited. \u201cShe taught me everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, OK.\u201d Lois gives me an appraising look. \u201cSo you know what you\u2019re doing, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d April turns to me. \u201cBut Cyndi couldn\u2019t make it after all. I was going to get Becky and Cyndi together,\u201d she explains to Lois.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hide my disappointment. \u201cWell, in the meantime ...\u201d I reach for the Art Deco clutch. \u201cI brought this along for you.\u201d I proffer it to Lois. \u201cI saw it and it seemed like your style; it\u2019s vintage....\u201d I trail off and hold my breath.</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Lois considers the bag. I feel like I\u2019m in the MasterChef final, and Michel Roux Jr. is considering my profiteroles.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Lois declares at last. \u201cI love it. Sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say, trying not to sound too joyful. \u201cWell, it\u2019s from this great vintage shop; I go there all the time. I could easily source some more stuff for you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Lois gives me that ravishing, understated smile of hers, the one she does in Tess, when Angel strips off and does a sexy dance for her. (Did that happen in the book? Something tells me maybe not.)</p><p>She seems totally sweet and low-key. I can\u2019t understand why people think she\u2019s tricksy. Now she\u2019s looking at her phone and frowning. \u201cMy agent. I need to go talk to some people. I\u2019ll be back for this delightful thing.\u201d She puts the bag down on the table. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll talk terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about Cyndi?\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tread on her toes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d Lois gives a laugh. \u201cThe truth is, Cyndi\u2019s really too busy to look after me anyway.

Well, count me as one of them.\u201d She smiles once more, then heads away, across the crowded room.</p> <p>\u201cNext time you go shopping, I\u2019m coming with you,\u201d says April, smiling. \u201cYou can find me a purse like that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! And thank you so much for introducing me to Lois.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure! Thank you so much for pointing out that the scene I was shooting made no sense. They\u2019re still rewriting it, I believe.\u201d She winks at me. \u201cSee you girls later.\u201d</p><p>She melts away into the crowd, and I gleefully turn to Suze.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that? Lois liked the bag! She wants to talk terms!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course she liked the bag!\u201d says Suze, giving me a hug. \u201cWell done, Bex! Lois seems really nice,\u201d she adds consideringly. \u201cI thought she was supposed to be horrible.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to say that that\u2019s exactly what I was just thinking, too, when Luke\u2019s voice hails me.</p><p>\u201cDarling, are you all right?\u201d I turn to see him with Aran, two women I don\u2019t recognize, and Sage, who is wearing a silver dress and matching shoes and her hair in a sixties beehive.</p><p>\u201cIf that bitch gets it,\u201d she\u2019s saying furiously. \u201cIf that crazy bitch gets it ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage, calm down,\u201d Aran murmurs.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d says Luke.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, still glowing. \u201cWe\u2019re having a great time! Hi, Aran; hi, Sage ...\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019m introduced to the two women, Sage flops down on a chair, furiously tapping at her phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I say quietly to Luke.</p><p>\u201cLois Kellerton,\u201d he murmurs back. \u201cFlorence Nightingale.</p><p>I have a feeling Lois is going to get the role. Just don\u2019t mention it, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel an uncomfortable twinge. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>I can feel Suze\u2019s eyes burning into me, and I know what she\u2019s trying to say: I should tell Luke that I\u2019m going to start working with Lois Kellerton. She\u2019s right. I should. Only I\u2019m not quite sure how to do it in front of Sage.</p><p>Could I text him?</p> <p>I get out my phone, open a text, and start typing.</p><p>Luke. I have a new client. It\u2019s Lois Kellerton.</p><p>No. Too blunt. I delete the whole thing and try again.</p><p>Luke, I have an amazing new opportunity, which I don\u2019t want to mention out loud. And I hope you\u2019ll be pleased for me. I THINK you\u2019ll be pleased for me. There may be a very slight conflict of interest, but we can always build Chinese walls, and</p><p>Damn. I\u2019ve run out of room. I\u2019m just backspacing again, when Sage looks up from her own phone.</p><p>\u201cCute purse,\u201d she says, spying the Art Deco bag and pulling it toward her. \u201cIs that yours, Becky?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Shit.</p><p>\u201cOh. Um ...\u201d As I\u2019m working out how to answer, Luke plunges in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of Becky\u2019s work purchases,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know she\u2019s a stylist, Sage? She\u2019s worked at Barneys and at a major store in London. Remember, I was telling you about her work yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d says Aran, looking up from his phone. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get you to shut up about it.\u201d He winks at me, then resumes tapping at his phone.</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling touched. I had no idea Luke was bigging up my work.</p><p>Sage\u2019s brow has wrinkled as though she\u2019s recalling a distant memory from a past life. \u201cSure,\u201d she says vaguely. \u201cYou told me. So who is this purse for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it might, in fact, be for you!\u201d Luke\u2019s eyes twinkle. \u201cAm I right, Becky?\u201d</p><p>No. Nooooooo!</p><p>Disaster. Total disaster. Why didn\u2019t I hide it under the table?</p><p>\u201cUm ...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Sage\u2019s face lights up. \u201cHow cool. It matches my dress.\u201d</p><p>Is she crazy? It\u2019s totally the wrong silver.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is\u2014it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I reach for the bag, but it\u2019s too late. Sage has stood up and is trying it out, posing as though she\u2019s on the red carpet. I meet Suze\u2019s eyes\u2014and she looks as horrified as I feel.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve scored a hit, Becky,\u201d says Luke, delighted. \u201cBravo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, it\u2019s for a client,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ve promised it to her.

Luke,\u201d I say with a small gulp. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the bar.\u201d</p><p>As we make our way to the bar, I\u2019m lurching between two feelings. Glee that I\u2019ve finally got a client, and dread at having to tell Luke. Glee\u2013dread, glee\u2013dread ... My head is spinning and my hands are clenched and my legs are shaking, and altogether I\u2019m glad when we reach the bar.</p> <p>\u201cLuke, I have something to tell you,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cIt\u2019s good but it\u2019s not good. Or it may not be good. Or ...\u201d I\u2019ve run out of possibilities. \u201cI need to tell you,\u201d I finish lamely.</p><p>Luke eyes me for a moment without saying anything. \u201cIs this a stiff drink kind of a something?\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cIt could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo gimlets,\u201d he instructs the barman. \u201cStraight up.\u201d</p><p>Luke quite often orders for me, which is because I can never decide what to have.

Phoning for Chinese honestly takes about an hour in our house.)</p><p>\u201cSo, the good news is, I\u2019ve got a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said.\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows. \u201cWell done!

Lois wore the same dress as Sage to an event, and then Sage bailed out of this charity thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Luke cuts me off. \u201cIt\u2019s over. And as for your career, you are an independent woman, and if Sage has any problem at all with you working for Lois Kellerton, she can answer to me. OK?\u201d</p><p>He sounds so forthright, I feel a glow of pleasure. I knew all along he\u2019d support me. (Well, I kind of knew.) Our drinks arrive, and Luke lifts his up to clink mine.</p><p>\u201cTo you, Becky. First client in Hollywood. Bravo. I hope for your sake she\u2019s not as nutty as my client.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling. It\u2019s so unlike Luke to dis his clients\u2014he\u2019s usually far too discreet.</p><p>\u201cSo, is Sage difficult to work with?\u201d</p><p>Luke closes his eyes briefly and takes a swig of his drink. As he opens them, he\u2019s smiling wryly. \u201cTrapped inside that gorgeous, curvaceous body is a spoiled teenage girl with arrested development and the biggest sense of entitlement I\u2019ve ever come across. And I\u2019ve worked with bankers,\u201d he adds, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worse than bankers?\u201d I say, playing along.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks she should be able to do exactly as she likes. All the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t movie stars do what they like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome can. When they reach a certain level.\u201d Luke takes another gulp. \u201cSage thinks she\u2019s Hollywood royalty. But she\u2019s not. Not yet. Her trouble is, she had very easy, very early success, and nothing since has quite matched up to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how can she get that success again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. But it\u2019s a work in progress.\u201d Luke has that wry smile again. \u201cBelieve me, even the most obnoxious hedge-fund types in London are less of a pain in the butt than Sage Seymour. When I speak to boards of directors, they listen. We agree to an action plan. We put it in motion. When I speak to Sage ... who knows if she\u2019s even listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Aran thinks you\u2019re brilliant,\u201d I say. \u201cHe told me so the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAran\u2019s great.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cWe see eye to eye, at any rate.\u201d He lifts his glass up again. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why, my darling, I hope for your sake that your client is less nutty than mine.\u201d</p> <p>I grin at him as I sip my drink. It\u2019s nice to have a proper chat, the two of us. These last few weeks have been such a whirlwind; I\u2019ve barely seen Luke, let alone spent time together as a couple. I\u2019m about to share this thought with Luke when a guy in a tuxedo with long, glossy dark hair passes by. He must surely have used hair straighteners and about a whole bottle of product. I glance at Luke and see that he\u2019s noticed the guy too.</p><p>\u201cShall I grow my hair like that?\u201d he says, his mouth barely twitching.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say with emphasis. \u201cDefinitely! I loved it when you had long hair.\u201d I lean over to stroke his hair. \u201cI adore your hair. The more of it, the better.\u201d</p><p>When we went on honeymoon, Luke let his hair grow and even had little plaits. But as soon as we got back to London, he whipped it all off again. I\u2019ve always thought that Long-hair Luke was slightly different from Short-hair Luke. More relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYou should wear long hair and flip-flops to work,\u201d I suggest. \u201cThat\u2019s the L.A. way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBritish men don\u2019t wear flip-flops to work,\u201d he says firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an Angeleno now,\u201d I retort.</p><p>\u201cHardly!\u201d says Luke, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, nearly. And Minnie\u2019s definitely a mini-Angeleno. She loves coconut water. And you know she has lessons in yoga at preschool? She\u2019s two and she\u2019s doing kundalini yoga. They start by studying Sanskrit and they waft saffron scent through the air, and then the teacher asks each of them to vocalize what the session means to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Minnie say?\u201d asks Luke, with interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only sat in on one session,\u201d I admit. \u201cShe said, \u2018Bum bum bum.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Bum bum bum.\u2019 \u201d Luke splutters into his drink. \u201cOur articulate child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty accurate!\u201d I\u2019m starting to laugh myself. \u201cThey were doing downward dog. You should do kundalini yoga, too, you know,\u201d I add to Luke teasingly. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve grown your hair down to your waist and bought a pair of baggy trousers, you\u2019ll fit in perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want to fit in perfectly, Becky?\u201d As Luke holds my gaze, he seems to be asking me a bigger question.</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cYes. Of course. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d says Luke, after a pause. \u201cStrange place, this. Some bits I relate to. Others, not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everywhere\u2019s like that,\u201d I point out. \u201cRemember when you did that job with those designers in Hoxton? You kept telling me how different they were from City people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d He grins and finishes his gimlet. \u201cHad you better go and see to your client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be my client if I can\u2019t get that clutch bag back off Sage,\u201d I say, anxiously scanning the crowds of people. \u201cCan you somehow distract Sage and I\u2019ll grab it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do. Come on.\u201d</p><p>As we start back across the ballroom, there\u2019s a booming fanfare over the loudspeaker system and a deep voice says, \u201cLadies and gentlemen! The Actors\u2019 Society Awards are about to start. Please take your seats.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m searching all around for a flash of silver, but without any joy. People are pressing back into the ballroom from outside, and it\u2019s getting pretty chock-full. And now there\u2019s a crush of photographers as some major celeb enters the room.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d comes the boomy voice again. \u201cPlease take your seats for tonight\u2019s awards!\u201d</p><p>I feel a tap on my shoulder and wheel round sharply, hoping it\u2019s Sage. But it\u2019s Lois.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I was looking for you,\u201d she says in that soft voice. \u201cWe were interrupted.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t reply. I\u2019m staring in shock. She\u2019s holding the Art Deco clutch. How did that happen? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>\u201cIt was lying on a table. You know, there was a champagne glass balanced on top of it.\u201d She smiles in mock reproof. \u201cYou should take better care of such a lovely thing. I have to go present an award, but I\u2019ll see you later, OK?\u201d She twinkles at me, then hurries off.</p><p>In a slight daze, I return to our table and sink into my seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d demands Suze. \u201cYou\u2019ve been ages!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. Luke\u2019s fine with everything and Lois has got the clutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely done,\u201d applauds Luke.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I beam at him, finally relaxing. \u201cSo, what are these awards all about?\u201d I reach for the program and flip through it. \u201cBest Debut. Suze, you could win that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should have Best Background Artist,\u201d says Suze, looking up from her program in dissatisfaction. \u201cWe\u2019re the backbone of the film industry. Why don\u2019t we have our own Oscar? Tarkie!\u201d she exclaims as he sits down. \u201cI want you to sponsor a new awards ceremony. For background actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhm ...\u201d Tarquin looks wary. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe big corporations don\u2019t care about us. But where would they be without the talent and commitment of the background artist?\u201d Suze sounds like she\u2019s about to organize a rally. \u201cWhere would their blockbusters be then? We need recognition. We need respect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to win a prize,\u201d I put in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about that,\u201d she says severely. \u201cI\u2019m simply speaking out on behalf of my community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would win a prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might do.\u201d She preens herself. \u201cWe could have statues like the Oscars, but silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd call them \u2018Suzes.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up!\u201d She pokes me. \u201cAlthough actually ... why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d The deep boomy voice is back, and spotlights start circling the whole room. \u201cWelcome to this year\u2019s Actors\u2019 Society Awards. Please welcome your host, Billy Griffiss!\u201d</p><p>Applause breaks out as music erupts from the loudspeakers, and Billy Griffiss comes running down a set of lit-up steps, onto the stage. (I\u2019m not exactly sure who he is. Maybe a comedian.) He starts his speech, but I\u2019m only half listening.</p><p>\u201cSage!\u201d says Aran, as she approaches the table, all glittery under the circling spotlights. \u201cWe lost you there. You need a drink, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for my purse,\u201d says Sage, looking cross. \u201cI just had it. I put it down, and it was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d says Suze quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it went with your dress, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now, to present our first award, may I introduce a young lady who has done more for the share price of Kleenex than any other actor. We\u2019ve seen her on the scaffold, we\u2019ve seen her marooned in space, and now we\u2019re going to see her right here. The queen of the weepie ... Miss Lois Kellerton!\u201d</p><p>The theme tune to Tess blasts through the loudspeakers, and Lois appears at the top of the lit-up steps. She looks slim and ethereal and beautiful ... and she\u2019s holding the Art Deco bag.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>OK. Think. Quickly. The important thing is that Sage doesn\u2019t look at the stage and see the clutch.</p><p>\u201cSage!\u201d I say wildly. \u201cI need to speak to you. Now.\u201d</p><p>I can see Suze clocking the silver bag in Lois\u2019s hand, and her eyes widen in comprehension.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Suze rubs at her chest vigorously. \u201cI don\u2019t feel great. Sage, have I got a rash? Could you look at my skin?\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, Sage peers at Suze\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she says, and turns back to the stage.</p><p>\u201cSage!\u201d I hurry over to her chair and kneel down, forcing her to look away from the stage. \u201cI\u2019ve had a brilliant idea for a dress! With a fishtail and a kind of ... bodice ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d Sage turns away. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. I want to watch Lois mess this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the nominees are ...\u201d Lois is saying. She\u2019s standing at the lectern by now, and the clutch is resting on top of it in plain view.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so skinny,\u201d Sage is saying pityingly, plumping up her own cleavage. \u201cShe has such a sad little body. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d Her eyes suddenly narrow. \u201cWait. Is that my purse?\u201d She gasps so loudly, heads turn at the next table. \u201cIs that my purse? Did that witch steal my purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say hastily. \u201cIt was just a mix-up, I\u2019m sure....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMix-up?

Sage is striding to the stage, her eyes flashing. To my disbelief, she mounts the podium, her dress sparkling under the spotlights.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my purse,\u201d she says, grabbing it off the lectern. \u201cYou\u2019re a thief, Lois. A common little thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Aran bangs his head down on the table, as all the photographers rush forward and start snapping.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal anything.\u201d Lois looks flabbergasted. \u201cThis was given to me by my stylist, Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave it to me,\u201d Sage retorts, opening it up. \u201cOh, look. My phone. My lipstick. My lucky charm. Now are you going to tell me this is your purse?\u201d</p><p>Lois stares in bewilderment at Sage\u2019s stuff. Then she glances up, her eyes huge and anxious.</p> <p>\u201cI was given it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>My legs trembling, I rise to my feet and call out, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault! I promised it to both of you! I\u2019m really sorry ...\u201d</p><p>But no one takes any notice, even though I\u2019m waving my arms, trying to get their attention.</p><p>\u201cNow, ladies, I\u2019m sure this is just a misunderstanding,\u201d Billy Griffiss is saying. \u201cIt reminds me of the calendar thief. Did you hear about him? He got twelve months and they say his days are numbered.\u201d He laughs loudly at his own joke, but if he\u2019s hoping for anyone to join in, he\u2019s out of luck. Everyone is watching Sage, riveted. Two guys in headsets have approached her, but she keeps batting them off.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I try waving my arms again. \u201cSage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople should know the truth about you, Lois,\u201d she spits. \u201cYou act so high and mighty, but you\u2019re nothing but a criminal. You\u2019re a thief! You\u2019re a shoplifter!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a shocked murmuring from the audience at this. Someone shouts, \u201cBoo!\u201d and someone else, \u201cGet her off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now.\u201d Billy Griffiss sounds pretty shocked too. \u201cI think that\u2019s enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! She\u2019s a shoplifter! From ... Pump!, wasn\u2019t it, Lois?\u201d</p><p>Lois looks like she wants to throw up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s CCTV footage,\u201d says Sage in satisfaction. \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d says Lois in a trembling voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Becky saw her. Becky, you saw Lois shoplifting, didn\u2019t you? Tell them! This is the witness!\u201d She gestures theatrically at me.</p><p>I\u2019m still on my feet, so I\u2019m totally identifiable. In one instant, everyone in the room seems to have turned to look at me. Photographers are pointing their cameras this way. A few flashes are already going off, and I blink.</p> <p>\u201cYou saw Lois shoplifting, didn\u2019t you?\u201d says Sage, her voice rising clearly through the room, her smile curving cruelly. \u201cTell them, Becky. Tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>Blood is rushing in my ears like a freight train. I can\u2019t think properly. The whole world is looking at me and I need to decide what to do and I\u2019m too confused and the seconds are ticking by....</p><p>I\u2019ve lied plenty of times in my life. I\u2019ve said my leg was broken when it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve said I had glandular fever when I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve said my boots cost \u00a3100 when it was actually \u00a3250. But those were lies about me. I\u2019ve never lied about someone else.</p><p>I can\u2019t tell the world Lois is a shoplifter.</p><p>But I can\u2019t tell the world she isn\u2019t a shoplifter.</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d I glance desperately at Lois. \u201cI ... No comment.\u201d</p><p>I sink down in my chair, feeling ill.</p><p>\u201cThat proves it!\u201d Sage crows. \u201cLook at the CCTV footage! Becky saw it all. She\u2019s your witness. Get her on the stand!\u201d She curtsies to the audience and sweeps off the stage.</p><p>Aran and Luke are just staring at each other, aghast.</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Luke reaches over and squeezes my hand hard. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d I swallow. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an impossible situation.\u201d Luke\u2019s mouth is tight with anger. \u201cA situation you shouldn\u2019t have been put in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d Aran glances up at the photographers heading our way.

To your right, please!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve always wondered what it\u2019s like to be in the glare of the paparazzi. Now I know. It\u2019s like being in a thunderstorm. It\u2019s all white light and noise and whooshing in my ears. Voices are calling at me from all directions. I don\u2019t know which way to look or what to do. All I\u2019m aware of is my name, being shouted out, over and over.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeckeeeeeee!\u201d</p><p>I suppose in the old days, we would have waited for the first editions to come out. We might even have got some sleep. But this is the twenty-four-hour Internet age. The news was right there, instantly.</p><p>It\u2019s 6:00 A.M. now, and none of us has been to bed. I\u2019ve read about two hundred different pieces online. I can\u2019t stop. The headlines have been changing every hour, as more bits of news filter in:</p><p>Lois is \u201cShoplifter\u201d!!!</p><p>ASA ceremony disrupted</p><p>Sage accuses Lois of theft, interrupts awards</p> <p>Store assistant confirms shoplifting, police \u201cpressing no charges as yet\u201d</p><p>Sage: I feel betrayed by former friend</p><p>And there\u2019s a whole load just about me.</p><p>Witness Becky \u201csaw everything\u201d</p><p>Becky \u201cmay testify in court\u201d</p><p>Stars fight over bag from stylist Becky</p><p>They just go on and on. The most extraordinary one is this one I found on a gossip site:</p><p>Becky \u201cdrank cocktails\u201d before row, bartender reports</p> <p>I mean, for God\u2019s sake. What does that have to do with anything? They might as well write LOIS AND SAGE VISITED BATHROOM ON DAY OF ROW. They probably will write that.</p><p>We\u2019ve all given up saying how bizarre it is. Suze and Tarkie are on the sofa with all the children, eating cornflakes and watching the coverage on E!, which is basically a loop of Sage screaming at Lois and a shot of me looking bewildered. I\u2019ve seen it about forty-seven times. I don\u2019t need to see it any more.</p><p>Luke and Aran are in the kitchen, talking grimly. Somehow they persuaded Sage to stop giving interviews, go home, and promise to go to bed. Aran delivered her personally into the care of her housekeeper, handed over a huge tip, and said, \u201cThis girl needs to sleep.\u201d But I bet she\u2019s stayed up all night too. I bet she loves it.</p><p>As for Lois, I have no idea. Her people surrounded her and hustled her out of the place almost instantly. It was like seeing a caged animal again. Every time I think of it, my insides squirm with guilt.</p><p>\u201cWant watch Barney!\u201d Minnie barges into me, interrupting my thoughts. \u201cWant watch Barney, not Mummy. Not Mummy,\u201d she repeats disparagingly.</p><p>I suppose it is a bit boring, watching your mother on a loop on the TV when you were hoping for a big purple dinosaur.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I lift her up, all cozy in her rabbit dressing gown and slippers. \u201cLet\u2019s find you Barney.\u201d</p><p>I settle her upstairs, watching Barney on our bed with a bowl of sugar-free spelt puffs. (Totally tasteless but, unbelievably, her favorite snack. She really is becoming a child of L.A.) Then I pull back the curtains and do a double take. There\u2019s a camera crew outside our gates. An actual camera crew! The next minute I hear the entrance buzzer sounding. Someone\u2019s pressing it, over and over. I bolt along the landing and start running down the stairs, but Luke is at the bottom, waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer it!\u201d he says. \u201cAran will take care of it.\u201d</p><p>He shepherds me away from the door, into the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to keep a very low profile over the next few days,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is boring, but that\u2019s how these things go. We\u2019ll draft a statement and release it midmorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d I can hear a man\u2019s faint voice from outside. \u201cBecky, we want to offer you an exclusive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I maybe give an interview?\u201d I turn to Luke. \u201cLike, make things clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Luke, as though the idea is anathema. \u201cA statement is enough. We don\u2019t want to feed the frenzy. The more you give them, the more they\u2019ll want. Coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I just need to ... get my lip gloss....\u201d</p><p>I dart into the hall again and run halfway up the stairs. There\u2019s a window from where I can see out to the front, and I peer through the glass. Aran is at the gates, talking to the camera crew. He\u2019s laughing and looks relaxed and even high-fives one of them. I can\u2019t imagine Luke behaving like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, guys,\u201d I hear him say, and then he turns back toward the house. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAran!\u201d I say, as the front door opens. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I walk back down the stairs to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing much.\u201d He smiles easily. \u201cWorld\u2019s press descending, same old same old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they want to interview me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey sure do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t scratch the gates, you miserable bloodsucking lowlife.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling.

I\u2019m not here to advise you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all depends on what you want. And what Luke wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d I say, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Let me explain.\u201d He seems to marshal his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you trying to make it in Hollywood as a stylist. Without a whole lot of success, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou know what people need to make it in Hollywood? They need heat. Right now, you have heat. All that attention, that buzz ...\u201d He gestures out to the front. \u201cThat\u2019s heat. And call me an environmentalist, but I don\u2019t like to see heat go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod uncertainly. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you like it or not, getting ahead in this place isn\u2019t about talent or hard work. OK, maybe ten percent is talent.\u201d He spreads his hands. \u201cThe other ninety percent is catching a lucky break. So here\u2019s your choice. You can see last night as a weird little moment to hush up and move on from\u2014or you can see it as the luckiest break you ever caught.\u201d He focuses on me, his eyes suddenly intense. \u201cBecky, last night was providence giving you a FastPass. You can jump to the head of the line if you want to. You can go the distance. Do you want to?\u201d</p> <p>I stare back, utterly mesmerized by his words. I can jump to the head of the line? Go the distance? Why on earth wouldn\u2019t I want to do that?</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I stutter. \u201cOf course I do! But\u2014but what do you mean, exactly? What should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make a plan. We can use this heat. But you have to know what you\u2019re getting into. You have to be prepared to see it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean use the media?\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cDo interviews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChannel the energy, is all I\u2019m saying. Your profile just went through the roof, but the world knows you as Becky Brandon, Witness to a Shoplifting. How about if you transformed that into Becky Brandon, Celebrity Stylist? Becky Brandon, Hollywood\u2019s Fashion Maven. Becky Brandon, the Go-To Girl for a Great Look. We can brand you any way we like.\u201d</p><p>I stare back at him, too dazzled to speak. Brand? Celebrity stylist? Me?</p><p>\u201cYou know that bag you picked out is all over the Internet?\u201d he adds. \u201cDo you realize how hot you are right now? And if it goes to court, they\u2019ll be all over you. You\u2019ll be the star witness and, believe me, the world will be watching.\u201d</p><p>I feel a fresh tingle of excitement. Star witness! I\u2019ll have to have a whole new wardrobe! I\u2019ll wear little Jackie O. suits every day. And I\u2019ll straighten my hair. No, I\u2019ll put my hair up. Yes! Maybe I could have a different style every day, and people will call me the Girl with the Amazing Updos, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you starting to realize what you have here?\u201d Aran interrupts my thoughts. \u201cPeople would kill for this exposure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but ...\u201d I try to calm my whirling thoughts. \u201cWhat do I do? Now? Today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Aran sounds suddenly more businesslike. \u201cWe sit down and we make a plan. I can pull in some colleagues, you\u2019ll need an agent\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d I say, as reality swoops in. \u201cThis is all too fast.\u201d I lower my voice a little. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand, everything you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s the exact opposite of what Luke was saying. He wants it all to go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Aran nods. \u201cBecky, what you have to remember is, Luke doesn\u2019t see you as a client. He sees you as his wife. He\u2019s very protective of you and Minnie. Of course he is. Me? I see everyone as a client. Or potential client.\u201d He grins. \u201cWe can discuss that later.\u201d</p><p>The buzzer sounds again and I jump.</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d says Aran. \u201cLet them wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, what will all this mean for Sage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage!\u201d He gives a short bark of a laugh. \u201cIf that girl goes any further off the rails, she\u2019ll find herself in the ravine. She\u2019ll be OK. We\u2019ll haul her back on track, Luke and I. She\u2019ll kick and scream and it won\u2019t be pretty. But, then, nothing about Sage is. Except her face. When she\u2019s been in makeup,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see her before that.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cBrutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubbish!\u201d I give a shocked giggle. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d He raises his slanty eyebrows comically.</p><p>He\u2019s so irreverent and so unruffled. It\u2019s like he\u2019s enjoying all of this. I gaze at him, trying to work him out.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem as angry about all this as Luke. Hasn\u2019t Sage messed up your strategy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite possibly. But I like a challenge.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cStars are like any other investment. May go up, may go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lois? Do you think this will ...\u201d I can hardly bear to say it. \u201cRuin her?\u201d I feel a fresh clench of guilt in my stomach. If I\u2019d just kept my mouth closed. If I\u2019d just kept my promise. I\u2019m haunted by the sight of Lois swaying in shock on the stage. She looked so desperate. And it was all my fault.</p><p>\u201cDepends how she plays it,\u201d says Aran cheerily. \u201cShe\u2019s a bright one, Lois. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to come out on top.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s so heartless.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see her?\u201d I exclaim. \u201cShe looked like she was about to collapse! I thought she was going to faint right there on the stage!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably didn\u2019t eat enough at dinner.\u201d Aran\u2019s phone buzzes. \u201cI must go. But we\u2019ll talk. And Becky ...\u201d He gives me a significant look. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it too long. Remember, if you want to capitalize on this moment, you need the heat. And the heat won\u2019t last forever. Hi,\u201d he says into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWait! Aran.\u201d I lower my voice and glance toward the kitchen. \u201cIf you were going to give me some advice on how to play it today ... what would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a moment,\u201d says Aran into the phone, and comes back toward me. \u201cI\u2019m not advising you officially, you understand, Becky.\u201d He also glances toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I practically whisper.</p><p>\u201cBut if I had a client in your situation who wished to make the most of her exposure, I\u2019d advise her to be seen. Get out there. Don\u2019t say anything. Stay dignified, pleasant, going about your daily business. But be seen. Be photographed. And think about what you wear,\u201d he adds. \u201cBe casual but cool. Make your outfit a talking point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>While Aran takes his call, I head to the window on the stairs again and peep out. There are more press gathered outside the gates. Waiting for me. I\u2019m hot! Aran\u2019s words keep going round my head. I mean, he\u2019s right. All this time I\u2019ve been trying to make it in Hollywood, and now here\u2019s a golden opportunity, right in my lap, and if I don\u2019t take advantage of it I may never have the chance again....</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p> <p>Luke\u2019s voice makes me jump. \u201cMade you that cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and smile nervously at him as I take it. \u201cThis is all a bit weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I gesture to the crowd of journalists.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll all die down.\u201d Luke gives me a quick hug. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Minnie and the others watch movies in the basement? Then you don\u2019t even have to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cYes. We could do that.\u201d I glance out of the window again. I can see a camera with NBC on it. NBC!</p><p>My mobile rings yet again, and I pull it out, expecting to see Unknown Number.

Hi, Mum. I\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with you all night! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the car! I told you about our mini-break with Janice and Martin, didn\u2019t I? The Lake District. No signal. But lovely views, although the hotel was a little chilly. We had to ask for extra blankets, but they couldn\u2019t have been more charming about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I try to get a word in. \u201cEr, Mum, something\u2019s happened\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know!\u201d says Mum triumphantly. \u201cWe\u2019d just got on to the M1 when I had a call from someone at the Daily World. She asked, \u2018Do you know your daughter has been causing a sensation in Hollywood?\u2019 Well! I said I had no idea but it didn\u2019t surprise me. I always knew you\u2019d be a sensation. Janice has just found a picture of you on her smartphone. We\u2019ve all had a look. Lovely frock. Where did you get that, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, you didn\u2019t talk to them, did you? Only Luke says not to speak to the press. Just ring off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ring off!\u201d says Mum indignantly. \u201cI wanted to hear all about it, for a start. Such a pleasant girl. She gave me every detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did you talk for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I\u2019d say ... How long was I on the phone, Janice? About forty minutes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForty minutes?\u201d I echo, aghast.</p><p>There\u2019s Luke saying, \u201cDon\u2019t speak to the press,\u201d and even Aran advising me, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d and now Mum has given an in-depth interview to the Daily World.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t say any more!\u201d I instruct her. \u201cNot till you speak to Luke anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to know if you\u2019d ever shoplifted yourself,\u201d says Mum. \u201cThe idea! I said absolutely never, unless you count the time you came home from Hamleys with six pairs of dollies\u2019 shoes in your pockets. But you were only three, bless you. We sent them back in an envelope, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her that!\u201d I wail. God knows what they\u2019ll write now. \u201cMum, can I speak to Dad? Is he driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Martin\u2019s doing this stretch. I\u2019ll put you on.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a scuffling noise, then I hear my father\u2019s voice, deep and reassuring.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my little Becky? Plunged into another kerfuffle, I see! Are the media stationed outside your house as we speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, you know the only thing worse than being talked about, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot being talked about,\u201d I answer, with a smile. Dad always has some little saying for each occasion.</p><p>\u201cIf you need us to fly over and give you our support, I\u2019m sure your mother will be only too happy to buy a new outfit for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I can\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Becky.\u201d His voice changes. \u201cAre you all right?

But can you stop Mum talking to the press?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, apart from foiling shoplifters and becoming a global media sensation, is life all right in Hollywood? Sun not too warm? Sky not too blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all fine.\u201d I laugh again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve had a chance to look up that old friend of mine?\u201d</p><p>Damn. Damn. I totally meant to do that. This is the second time he\u2019s had to remind me. I feel terrible.</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cIt just slipped my mind.

Which, actually, this kind of is. And the point is: I have to win. This is my chance. My big, Hollywood, one-in-a-million, photo-opportunity chance.</p><p>Oh my God. What am I going to wear?</p> <p>OK. It took me an hour and three mirrors and about two hundred pictures on my phone, but I\u2019ve finally worked out the perfect, casual-but-cool outfit for facing the press. My most flattering white Stella McCartney cropped trousers with the little zips. Killer heels by D&amp;G and a bright pink shell top from J.Crew, which will really stand out. And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: these stunning oversize sunglasses, which I found in the same shop where I bought the diamant\u00e9 clutch bag. They\u2019re vintage Missoni, and the frames are pink and green swirls. You can\u2019t miss them. They\u2019ll definitely be a talking point.</p><p>What I must do is make sure I stand in a flattering way as I\u2019m opening the car door. Yes. And say things like, Please leave me alone; no press, please; I\u2019m just going about my day.</p><p>I take out my Velcro rollers, give my lips a final touch-up, and examine my reflection. OK. Good. I must get out there quickly, before the press get bored and decide to leave. Luke has already gone out with Aran to see Sage, and I heard the journalists all shouting as they drove away. And now it\u2019s my turn! I feel like a gladiator about to go into the ring.</p><p>I tracked down an address for Brent Lewis after about six phone calls. Of course his family doesn\u2019t live at the address Dad gave me. But someone there had a number for his mother, and someone at that number said she\u2019d moved to Pasadena, and there they said she\u2019d gone to Florida, and so it went on, till I discovered that she actually died seven years ago. But by then I\u2019d also been given a number for a sister called Leah, and through her I finally got an address for Brent\u2014somewhere called the Shining Hill Home Estate, off San Fernando Road. I\u2019ve looked on the map, and it\u2019s in an area of L.A. I\u2019ve never been to before. But that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve got satnav.</p><p>Minnie is playing some very disorganized ball game with the Cleath-Stuarts in the basement. I put my head round the door and say casually, \u201cI\u2019m just running an errand. See you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine sunglasses,\u201d says Minnie at once, clocking the vintage Missonis. \u201cMiiiiiiine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinnie!\u201d I say sternly. \u201cWe don\u2019t say \u2018Mine\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she amends at once. \u201cPleeeeeeease!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, darling.\u201d I give her a kiss. \u201cThey\u2019re Mummy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleeeeease!\u201d She makes a determined swipe for them. \u201cYou have ... er ...\u201d I cast around and find a toy handbag, which I give to her. \u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>Minnie looks at it disdainfully. \u201cSo over,\u201d she enunciates carefully, and throws it on the floor.</p><p>Oh my God. Did Minnie just say \u201cso over\u201d? I meet Suze\u2019s eyes and we both give shocked giggles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t teach her that,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNor did I!\u201d says Suze.</p><p>I glance at Clemmie\u2014but she\u2019s happily playing in an undershirt with one of Minnie\u2019s skirts on her head.

Just to put some body in. Is there anything wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes focus on my face. \u201cAre you wearing false eyelashes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cWhat is this, the third degree? Anyway, I have to go and run this errand. See you!\u201d</p><p>I turn and rush up the stairs. At the front door I take three deep breaths, then push it open. Here we go. Celebrityville, here I come.</p> <p>At once, a barrage of voices hits me.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Beckeee! This way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, have you been in touch with Lois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! This way!\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. There are twice as many journalists as there were before. The gates\u2014tall, with iron bars and swirls\u2014are about twenty meters away from the front door and there are camera lenses pointing at me through every gap. Just for an instant I want to duck back inside the house\u2014but it\u2019s too late now. I\u2019m out.</p><p>The thing about having lots of photographers pointing their cameras at you is, they might take a picture at any time. I have to do everything in a flattering way. Sucking in my stomach and throwing my shoulders back, I make my way slowly toward the car, trying to ignore all the shouts.</p><p>\u201cBecky, can we have an interview?\u201d one man keeps yelling.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just going about my daily life,\u201d I call, tossing my hair back. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>My car keys are in my pocket and I manage to get them out in a seamless move. I open the car door\u2014making sure that my legs are crossed over in a Victoria Beckham\u2013type pose\u2014then get in. I close the car door and exhale. There. Done.</p><p>Except ... What if none of them got a good shot?</p><p>Should I have gone closer to the gates? Should I have walked more slowly?</p><p>This is my one chance to be photographed by the world\u2019s press in an iconic, defining picture that will be a talking point and launch my career as a Hollywood stylist. I think I need to get out of the car and do it again.</p><p>I ponder hard for a few seconds, then open the car door and get out, as elegantly as I can. Trying to look as though I\u2019m ignoring the photographers, I stroll right to the front of the drive and start to examine a hedge intently.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Beckee! This way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo press,\u201d I say, smoothing down my hair. \u201cNo press, thank you. I\u2019m just going about my daily business.\u201d</p><p>Casually, I take off my sunglasses and do my best pouty, sucked-in-cheeks expression. I swivel this way and that a few times, swinging my arms. Maybe I should open the gates, so they get a better view of my shoes. I zap the gates, and they slowly start to swing open.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d A woman is waving a microphone in my direction. \u201cSharon Townsend, NBC. Tell us about seeing Lois shoplifting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease respect my privacy,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just going about my daily business.\u201d</p><p>A brilliant new idea hits me, and I head over to the car. I heave myself up onto the bonnet, adopt a casual pose, and get out my phone: I can be having a phone call in my own drive, while sitting on my car! What could be more natural than that?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say into the phone. \u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d I cross my legs at a more flattering angle and gesticulate animatedly with my sunglasses. \u201cI know. Awful.\u201d</p><p>The sound of cameras snapping is getting more and more frantic. I can\u2019t help beaming with exhilaration. It\u2019s really happening! I\u2019m famous!</p><p>\u201cBecky, who are your shoes by?\u201d someone yells. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t intrude on my life,\u201d I reply graciously. \u201cI\u2019m just going about my daily business.\u201d I lift up my feet, so everyone can see the cool silver heels, and turn them from side to side.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re by Yves Saint Laurent,\u201d I hear a woman say.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not!\u201d I forget my plan to say nothing and hurry toward the open gates. \u201cThey\u2019re Dolce and Gabbana.

Is Lois an addict?\u201d</p><p>OK, this is getting out of hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d I say, a little shrilly. \u201cI\u2019m just going about my daily business. I have an important errand to run. Thank you for respecting my privacy.\u201d Suddenly I remember about posture. I adjust my legs so they\u2019ll look thinner and put one hand on my hip like a supermodel.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your phone call?\u201d says a sardonic-looking guy in jeans.</p><p>Oh yes. The phone call. I\u2019d forgotten about that.</p><p>\u201cEr ... bye, then!\u201d I say into the phone, and hastily put it away. \u201cThank you,\u201d I add to the journalists. \u201cThank you so much. No press, please.\u201d Feeling a little hassled, I head toward the car, get out my keys, and immediately drop them on the ground. Damn.</p><p>No way am I stooping down in front of a bank of cameras, so I cautiously bend my knees as though in a curtsy, keep my back dead straight, and manage to hoick the keys up. I sink into the car, start the engine, and carefully drive forward. The mob of journalists parts to let the car out, but the flashes and shouts keep coming, and someone even bangs on the roof.</p><p>As I finally escape, I sink back and exhale. That was only five minutes and I\u2019m exhausted. How do celebrities do it?</p><p>Anyway. The point is, I did it. Ten minutes later, my heart has stopped thumping and I\u2019m feeling rather pleased with myself. I\u2019m driving along the Hollywood Freeway, saying aloud, \u201cDrive on the right. Drive on the right,\u201d and my satnav is telling me to keep going straight on. Which is handy, as I\u2019m not in the correct lane to turn off. The whizzy no-hands car phone suddenly buzzes with Luke\u2019s number, and I press green for ANSWER.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart. Hi. Did you get out OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all good,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe press weren\u2019t too aggressive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... no! They were fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just got straight in the car and drove away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI mean, they might have got a few shots of me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did brilliantly, darling. It\u2019s not easy, keeping your cool when you\u2019re surrounded by cameras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Sage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cManic,\u201d says Luke. \u201cShe\u2019s had lots of offers already, and she wants to say yes to all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffers of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou name it. Interviews, film roles, nude magazine spreads, endorsement campaigns. All what you might call low rent. Very much not what our strategy was all about. Not that she can see that.\u201d</p><p>He sounds so exasperated, I want to giggle. I should imagine Sage Seymour is a bit of a change, after he\u2019s been used to dealing with sensible businessmen in suits.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.

I want to grab my chance while I\u2019m hot.</p><p>But Luke wouldn\u2019t understand, because he\u2019s totally warped by his job. I\u2019ve heard his personal views before, when he\u2019s had a couple of glasses of wine.

I missed my exit. It\u2019s all Luke\u2019s fault.</p><p>\u201cLook, I have to go,\u201d I say. \u201cI need to concentrate on the road. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d</p><p>I ring off, feeing all cross and prickly. Any other husband would be proud of his wife. I want to talk to Aran.

I have no idea where I am, except that I\u2019m going in the wrong direction. Truthfully, I\u2019m still a bit hazy about most of L.A. I mean, how on earth are you supposed to get to know the whole city? L.A. is so big. It\u2019s about the size of France.</p><p>OK, maybe not France. Maybe Belgium.</p><p>Anyway, I need to step on it. Finally I reach a point where I can U-turn. I swing the car round, ignoring the hoots from some other totally unreasonable drivers, who shouldn\u2019t have been driving so fast, and set off: this time in the right direction. Shining Hill Home Estate, here we come!</p><p>As I get near my destination, I\u2019m looking out for some beautiful shining hill, but I can\u2019t see one. All I can see is a great big road with motels on either side, and lorries thundering past, and billboards. This isn\u2019t at all what I was expecting. After a while, my satnav takes me off the main road and up an even less inspiring side road, and I peer round warily. There aren\u2019t any mansions. There aren\u2019t any expensive cars. There\u2019s a crummy-looking gas station and a motel offering rooms for thirty-nine dollars. Is this really where Dad\u2019s friend lives?</p><p>\u201cDestination two hundred yards ahead on the right-hand side,\u201d my satnav is saying. \u201cDestination one hundred yards ahead.

The satnav is right: I\u2019ve arrived at Shining Hill Home Estate. But it\u2019s not a mansion. It\u2019s a trailer park. There\u2019s a faded sign chained onto a galvanized pair of gates, and beyond it I can see rows of mobile homes stretching into the distance. I check my piece of paper again: 431 Shining Hill Home Estate. Brent Lewis must live in trailer number 431.</p><p>Part of me wants to phone Dad instantly and tell him how wrong he\u2019s got it about his friend, but I decide to investigate first, so I lock the car and proceed cautiously into the trailer park. No one stops me, and I soon work out where 431 is, from a map on a board. As I make my way down a line of trailers, I get stares from some people sitting outside their mobile homes, and I can\u2019t help glancing around curiously myself. Some of the trailers are really nice-looking and well kept, with plants and pretty curtains, but some are awful. One has broken patio furniture piled high outside it, almost blocking the door. Another has the sound of screaming coming from it. Another has all its windows broken in.</p><p>I arrive at number 431 and approach it. It\u2019s a very plain trailer\u2014not run-down but not very appealing either. The door is shut and the blinds are down, and there are no signs of life. There\u2019s a piece of paper taped to the door, and I glance at it as I knock. It says: Notice of Eviction.</p><p>I scan the notice, which is all about Mr. Brent Lewis of 431 Shining Hill Home Estate and his failure to pay six months\u2019 overdue rent and the steps which must therefore be taken, signed Herb Leggett, Manager.</p> <p>\u201cYou a friend of Brent?\u201d A voice hails me, and I turn to see a skinny woman standing on the steps of the trailer opposite. She\u2019s wearing black jeans with her hair thrust into a ponytail and is holding a small boy on her hip.</p><p>\u201cIs Brent around?\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not a friend exactly, but I\u2019d like to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a social worker?\u201d Her eyes narrow. \u201cPolice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, shocked. \u201cNothing like that. I\u2019m just ... my dad knew him years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou British?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. My dad is too.\u201d</p><p>The woman sniffs and nods. \u201cWell, you just missed him. He took off yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He took off? Oh God. What\u2019s Dad going to say?</p><p>\u201cDo you have a forwarding address?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSaid his daughter was stopping by next week, to clear things out. I can ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you?\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cI\u2019m Becky Brandon; this is my number....\u201d I get out one of my business cards and hand it to her. \u201cIf she could ring me, that would be great, or maybe you could ring me. Or ...\u201d</p> <p>The woman shrugs again and tucks the card into her jeans. Immediately the small boy pulls it out and throws it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I leap forward. \u201cI mean ... let\u2019s not lose that. Shall I put it somewhere safe for you?\u201d</p><p>The woman shrugs yet again. I really don\u2019t have high hopes that she\u2019s going to talk to Brent\u2019s daughter. All the same, I tuck the card safely into the window frame of her door.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll look forward to hearing from Brent\u2019s daughter,\u201d I say as brightly as I can. \u201cOr you. Whichever. I\u2019d be really grateful. Anyway ... er ... lovely to meet you. I\u2019m Becky, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said.\u201d She nods but doesn\u2019t volunteer her own name.</p><p>I can\u2019t keep babbling on at this woman, so I give her one last friendly smile and turn on my heel to leave. I still can\u2019t believe this is where Dad\u2019s friend has ended up. It\u2019s such a shame.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m on the road again, I dial Dad\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDarling! Did you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d I wince. \u201cDad, I\u2019m afraid you were wrong. Brent Lewis has been living in a trailer park, and now he\u2019s just been evicted because he didn\u2019t pay his rent. I couldn\u2019t get an address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d Dad gives a short laugh. \u201cDarling, that\u2019s not right. It can\u2019t be the same Brent Lewis. I\u2019m sorry you wasted your time, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was the address I got from his sister. It must be him.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a longish silence.</p><p>\u201cHe lives in a trailer park?\u201d says Dad at last.</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean, his trailer\u2019s quite nice,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cNot broken or anything. But now he\u2019s been evicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be right.\u201d Dad sounds almost angry. \u201cYou must have got it wrong, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got it wrong!\u201d I say, nettled. What does he think I am, an idiot? \u201cI saw the eviction notice myself. Brent C. Lewis. It didn\u2019t say what the \u2018C\u2019 was for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cConstantine.

Who knows what happened in Brent Lewis\u2019s life? He could have gone into business, he could have had six divorces, he could have turned into a criminal\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says hotly. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened. This shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t understand!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cIf he was such a close friend of yours, why didn\u2019t you stay in touch?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and I sense I\u2019ve touched a nerve. I feel a bit mean, confronting Dad like that, but, honestly, he drives me mad. First he won\u2019t use Skype or Facebook or anything normal. Then he sends me off on a wild-goose chase to see his friend, and then when I report back, he doesn\u2019t believe me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you his sister\u2019s number if you like,\u201d I say. \u201cBut honestly, I\u2019d just forget about it if I were you.\u201d</p><p>My screen starts flashing with the word Aran and I realize I\u2019ve got a call waiting.</p> <p>\u201cDad, I have to go,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, OK? I\u2019m sure Brent Lewis is fine,\u201d I add, trying to sound reassuring. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about him anymore.\u201d I ring off and press ANSWER. \u201cAran! Hi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d His easy voice comes down the phone. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing? You shaken off the paparazzi yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about!\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, that was quite the photo-call you had this morning. Cute outfit. Great sunglasses. You made a splash. Good work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I beam. I knew Aran would appreciate my efforts.</p><p>\u201cAs a result, the phone has been ringing off the hook.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I feel a tweak of excitement. \u201cWhat, like, journalists? Fashion editors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJournalists, producers, all kinds of people. Like I said, you\u2019re hot. And I have a great offer for you. I took the liberty of dealing with it myself, although if you like, I can hand over everything to Luke\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer a bit too quickly. \u201cI mean ... he\u2019s my husband. He\u2019s a bit too close, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. So, the offer is a segment on Breakfast Show USA. The producer just called, and she\u2019s very anxious to have you on the show. I told her you\u2019re a stylist and she said great. They\u2019re very happy for you to film a styling segment. New trends, new looks, whatever. We\u2019ll work out the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I feel breathless. A styling segment on Breakfast Show USA. This is huge. This is mammoth!</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re going to need an agent,\u201d Aran is saying. \u201cI\u2019m going to set up a meeting with our friends at CAA. My assistant will call you with the details, OK?\u201d</p><p>CAA! Even I know that CAA is the biggest name in Hollywood. They represent Tom Hanks. They represent Sting! I feel giddy. Never in a million years did I expect to be catapulted into all of this.</p><p>\u201cDoes Luke know everything?\u201d A sudden thought strikes me. \u201cSure, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I feel a bit hurt. It\u2019s my decision. What kind of lame response is that? Why didn\u2019t he say, My God, this is amazing, I always knew my wife would be a star? Why isn\u2019t he on the phone telling me my whole life is going to change here and he\u2019ll be with me every step of the way?</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your decision?\u201d prompts Aran.</p><p>Does he even need to ask?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yes, of course!\u201d I say joyfully. \u201cIt\u2019s yes! It\u2019s a great big yes!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been anywhere like CAA in my life. The building is like some sort of spaceship in which all the men are from Men in Black and all the girls are from Vogue and all the sofas are from Architectural Digest. Just sitting in the lobby for five minutes was a better Hollywood experience than the entire Sedgewood Studios tour. I saw three girls from Gossip Girl, and a cool rapper guy feeding his tiny puppy with a milk dropper, and two famous TV comedians having a huge sotto voce row about something called \u201cback end,\u201d while continuing to smile at a very pretty girl at reception. (I\u2019m not sure of their names. I think maybe they\u2019re both called Steve Something.)</p><p>And now I\u2019m sitting in this very smart boardroom-type place, at a smooth, pale wooden table, and listening to two women talk to me. One\u2019s called Jodie and one\u2019s called Marsha, and they\u2019re both \u201ctalent\u201d agents. Apparently I\u2019m the \u201ctalent.\u201d Me! Talent! Wait till I tell Luke that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019re very smart and very intense. They\u2019re both dressed immaculately in a sleek-navy-Prada-ish-high-maintenance sort of style. One has got a vast diamond on one finger, and I\u2019m so mesmerized by it, I can barely concentrate on what she\u2019s saying. Except I keep being jerked back to attention by words like \u201cfan base\u201d and \u201cglobal appeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReality,\u201d says the dark-haired woman, who is either Jodie or Marsha. \u201cWhat\u2019s your opinion on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d</p><p>I want to reply, I\u2019ve totally lost my grip on it, but I sense that\u2019s not the right answer. I sip my iced water, which is so freezing it gives me an instant headache. Why do Americans like their drinks so cold? Are they descended from Eskimos or something? Ooh, maybe they are. Maybe they migrated down from Alaska, millions of years ago. It makes total sense. Have I hit on a whole new theory of human evolution?</p> <p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I come back to the room. \u201cDefinitely! Um, what exactly do you mean by reality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reality show,\u201d says Jodie-or-Marsha patiently. \u201cWe think we could package a great show as a vehicle for you, your family, your quirky British friends....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, cameras would be following us around the whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be semi-scripted. It\u2019s less intrusive than you might think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I try to imagine sitting in the kitchen with Luke, acting out a semi-scripted scene for the cameras. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not totally sure my husband would like that,\u201d I say at last. \u201cBut I can ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother format we have available is \u2018BFFs in Hollywood,\u2019 \u201d says Marsha-or-Jodie. \u201cYou would be working with a young actress named Willa Tilton. The concept is, two best friends making it in Hollywood, confiding in each other, shopping for clothes, appearing on the red carpet, getting into scrapes. You would be the married one, and Willa would be the single one. I think it would have a lot of appeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019d work well together as best friends.\u201d Jodie-or-Marsha agrees.</p><p>\u201cBut Willa Tilton isn\u2019t my best friend,\u201d I say, confused. \u201cI\u2019ve never met her. My best friend is called Suze.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe would be your best friend for the camera,\u201d says Marsha-or-Jodie, as though I\u2019m slightly subnormal. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, still confused. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>I take another sip of water, trying to get my head together. Somehow I can\u2019t take any of this seriously. Me? On a reality show? But as I look from Jodie to Marsha (or the other way around), I realize they\u2019re genuine. They wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day unless they meant it.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, we have the Breakfast Show USA segment,\u201d says Jodie-or-Marsha, \u201cwhich will be very high-profile. Now, do you have an assistant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, and the two women exchange looks.</p><p>\u201cYou might think about getting yourself one,\u201d says Marsha-or-Jodie.</p><p>\u201cYour life is going to start feeling a little different,\u201d adds Jodie-or-Marsha.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you have some camera-ready outfits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConsider getting your teeth whitened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you could lose a pound or two.\u201d Marsha-or-Jodie smiles kindly. \u201cJust a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d My head is whirling. \u201cOK. Well ... thanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d Jodie-or-Marsha pushes back her chair. \u201cExciting, huh?\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m walking along one of the museum-style corridors with an assistant called Tori (dressed head to toe in Chlo\u00e9), I hear a little shriek behind me. I turn and see Sage skittering along the corridor, her arms outstretched.</p><p>\u201cBeckeeeeee! I\u2019ve missed youuuuuu!\u201d</p><p>I blink in astonishment. Sage is wearing the skimpiest outfit I\u2019ve ever seen. Her bright-blue polka-dot top is basically a bikini top, and her tiny frayed hot pants are more like underwear.</p><p>Plus, what does she mean, she\u2019s missed me?</p><p>As she throws her arms around me, I inhale the smell of Marc Jacobs Grapefruit and cigarettes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long! We have so much to talk about! Are you done here? Where are you going now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust home,\u201d I say. \u201cI think they\u2019re organizing me a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooo! Ride with me!\u201d She takes out her phone and punches something into it. \u201cMy driver will take you home, and we can chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, are you OK with Sage?\u201d says Tori. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d I say. \u201cBut thanks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re good now,\u201d says Sage to the girl who was accompanying her. \u201cWe\u2019ll see ourselves out. We have to talk!\u201d Sage hits the button for the elevator and links arms with me. \u201cYou are so hot right now. We\u2019re both hot,\u201d she adds with satisfaction, as we get in. \u201cYou know they\u2019re begging me to do Florence Nightingale? Your husband thinks I should take it. But, you know, I have a lot of propositions right now. Playboy offered me a gazillion.\u201d She takes out some gum and offers it to me.</p><p>\u201cPlayboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d She shrieks with laughter. \u201cI need to hit the gym if I\u2019m doing that.\u201d</p><p>I blink in surprise. She\u2019s doing it? I can\u2019t believe Luke or Aran wants Sage to do Playboy.</p> <p>\u201cCute shades,\u201d she adds, looking at my Missonis, which are propped up on my head. \u201cYou were wearing them on Saturday, right? The press was all over them.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. There were pictures of me in my Missonis in all the tabloids and on millions of websites. It\u2019s all so surreal. When I look at the photos, it doesn\u2019t feel like me. It feels like some other person out there, posing as \u201cBecky Brandon.\u201d</p><p>But that is me. Isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Oh God, it\u2019s too confusing. Do celebrities ever get used to being two people, one private and one public? Or do they just forget about the private one? I\u2019d ask Sage, only I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s ever had a private life.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so unique.\u201d Sage is still fixated on my shades. \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re vintage. You can have them, if you like,\u201d I add eagerly, and hand them over.</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Sage grabs them and puts them on, admiring her reflection in the mirrored wall of the lift. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally good.\u201d I tweak her hair a bit. \u201cThere. Lovely.\u201d</p><p>At last! I\u2019m styling a Hollywood film star, just like I wanted to in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart, Becky,\u201d Sage says. \u201cThis is a great fashion story. I\u2019m wearing the shades you had on two days ago. The press will love it. This will be everywhere.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not why I gave them to her, but I suppose she\u2019s right. I suppose she thinks about everything in terms of the press. Is that how I have to start thinking too?</p> <p>We emerge on the ground floor, and Sage leads me straight to a big guy in a blue blazer, who is sitting on a chair in a corner. He has Slavic features and huge shoulders and doesn\u2019t smile. \u201cThis is Yuri, my new bodyguard,\u201d says Sage blithely. \u201cDo you have security, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I laugh. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should totally think about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to hire Yuri after I got mobbed at home. You can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d She glances at her watch. \u201cOK, shall we go?\u201d</p><p>As we head out of the building, I feel a jolt of shock. A cluster of waiting photographers immediately start calling out, \u201cSage! This way, Sage!\u201d They weren\u2019t there earlier.</p><p>\u201cHow did they know you\u2019d be here?\u201d I say in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cYou give them your schedule,\u201d Sage explains in an undertone. \u201cYou\u2019ll get into it.\u201d She hooks her arm more firmly round mine and dimples in a smile. Her long, golden legs look amazing, and the Missoni shades clash brilliantly with her polka-dot top.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d I hear a shout. \u201cBecky, over here, please!\u201d Oh my God, I\u2019ve been recognized! \u201cBeckeee!\u201d</p><p>The shouts are growing into a chorus. All I can hear is, \u201cBecky! Sage! Here!\u201d Sage is playfully adopting pose after pose, most with her arm around me. A couple of tourists approach, and, with a charming smile, Sage scribbles autographs for them. It takes me a moment to realize they want mine too.</p> <p>After a while, a blacked-out SUV appears, and Sage skips along to it, accompanied by Yuri. We get in, the photographers still clustering around us, and the driver maneuvers away.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I sink back into the leather seat.</p><p>\u201cYou should hire security,\u201d says Sage again. \u201cYou\u2019re not a civilian anymore.\u201d</p><p>This is unreal. I\u2019m not a civilian anymore! I\u2019m one of them!</p><p>Sage is flipping though channels on the in-car TV, and she pauses as her own face comes into view, with the headline SAGE SPEAKS OUT.</p><p>\u201cHey! Check it out!\u201d She cracks open a Diet Coke, offers one to me, and turns up the volume.</p><p>\u201cI feel personally betrayed by Lois,\u201d the on-screen Sage is saying. \u201cI feel she\u2019s let me down, not just as a fellow actor but as a woman and as a human. If she has problems, then I feel for her, but she should deal with those in an appropriate manner, not inflict them on others. You know, we were once friends. But never again. She\u2019s let down the entire profession.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit harsh,\u201d I say uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cShe stole my purse,\u201d says Sage, unmoved. \u201cShe\u2019s a psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t steal it.

We sit in silence as a whole bunch of people in a studio discuss whether Sage Seymour\u2019s career will now go stellar, and then, as soon as they\u2019ve finished, Sage flicks to another news piece about herself. I feel more and more uncomfortable, but Sage won\u2019t let me speak. The TV airways seem to be filled with coverage of her, on every channel\u2014until she clicks on to a new channel and Lois\u2019s face suddenly appears.</p><p>\u201cLois!\u201d Sage leans forward animatedly.</p><p>The camera pans away and I see that Lois is being filmed outside her house, which is a huge Spanish-style mansion. She\u2019s wearing a billowy white nightshirt and has bare feet and seems to be shouting at someone, but there\u2019s no sound.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d Sage is gazing at the screen.</p> <p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she inside?\u201d I wince. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look well.\u201d</p><p>Lois looks terrible.

No one knows if they\u2019re going to press charges; no one knows anything yet. I keep expecting to be summoned to a police station, but so far, nothing. When I mentioned it to Aran, he said, \u201cBecky, don\u2019t worry. Your profile is up there, even without a court case.\u201d</p><p>But that\u2019s not what I meant. I was thinking about Lois.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d Her voice suddenly becomes audible. \u201cPlease leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>And now we can hear the shouts from the photographers and journalists outside the gate.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a thief, Lois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take Sage\u2019s bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been charged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a message for the American people?\u201d</p><p>Lois\u2019s eyes are dark and despairing, and she\u2019s biting her lip so hard I can see specks of blood appearing. She looks totally on the edge\u2014just like she did when I first caught hold of her in the street. She goes back inside, the front door slams, and the picture flashes back to a studio, where a woman in a tailored red jacket is watching a screen seriously.</p><p>\u201cAnd there we can see the first shots of Lois Kellerton since this scandal,\u201d she says. \u201cDr. Nora Vitale, you\u2019re an expert on mental health. Would you say Lois Kellerton is experiencing a breakdown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now.\u201d Dr. Nora Vitale is a thin woman in a surprisingly frivolous pink dress, with a serious expression. \u201cWe don\u2019t use the word \u2018breakdown\u2019 these days....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d Sage switches off the TV. \u201cThat\u2019ll be all over Hollywood in twenty seconds. You know what they\u2019re saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying this goes back years. She\u2019s been stealing all her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say in horror. \u201cNo! I\u2019m sure it was just a one-off. She was under great strain, she made a mistake\u2014anyone can make a mistake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Sage shrugs comfortably. \u201cWhatever you think, people are coming forward. People she\u2019s worked with\u2014makeup artists, assistants\u2014saying she stole from them too. She\u2019s going to drown in lawsuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Guilt is squeezing me inside. I\u2019m going hot and cold with remorse. This is all my fault.</p><p>\u201cSo, when am I going to see you again?\u201d To my surprise, Sage throws her arms around me when we stop outside my house. \u201cI want you to style me for my next appearance. Head to foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we have to have lunch. Spago, maybe. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Fab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in this together, Becky.\u201d She squeezes me again, as the back doors magically slide open.</p><p>There\u2019s a cluster of photographers outside my gates. I\u2019m almost getting used to them. I check my reflection in my compact, then carefully slide out of the SUV. I zap open the gates with my remote control and wave goodbye to Sage. The next minute, Minnie is running down the drive toward me. She\u2019s wearing her gorgeous little yellow dress and clutching a painting she must have just done. I\u2019ve kept her off school today, because she was complaining of earache this morning. (Although it could just have been that her headband was too tight.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMummy!\u201d She\u2019s brandishing the painting triumphantly at me as I sweep her into a hug. \u201cSchlowers!\u201d</p><p>At the moment, Minnie is obsessed with flowers, which she calls \u201cschlowers.\u201d She weeps if Luke won\u2019t wear his one-and-only \u201cschlowers\u201d tie, so he puts it on every morning and then takes it off again in the car. Her painting doesn\u2019t look very much like flowers, to be honest, just big red splodges, but I gasp admiringly and say, \u201cWhat beautiful red flowers!\u201d</p><p>Minnie regards the red splodges stonily. \u201cDat not de schlowers. Dat de schlowers.\u201d She jabs her finger at a tiny blue stripe, which I hadn\u2019t even noticed. \u201cDat de schlowers.\u201d Her brows are lowered and she\u2019s giving me an imperious frown. \u201cDAT DE SCHLOWERS!\u201d she suddenly yells, sounding like a commandant ordering an execution.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cSilly me. Of course that\u2019s the schlowers. Lovely!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that your daughter?\u201d To my surprise, Sage has got out of the SUV after me. \u201cI have to say hello. Too cute! Listen to her little British accent! Come here, sweetie.\u201d She lifts Minnie up and swings her around till Minnie starts squealing with delight. The photographers are all clicking away so fast, it sounds like an insect infestation.</p><p>\u201cSage,\u201d I say. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Minnie to be photographed.\u201d</p><p>But Sage doesn\u2019t hear me.

But you can have some.\u201d Sage rummages in her bag and produces another pair of sunglasses. She gives Minnie a kiss on the nose, then puts the sunglasses on her. \u201cAdorable!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSage!\u201d I try again. \u201cStop it! I need to get Minnie inside!\u201d</p><p>My phone suddenly bleeps with a text, and, feeling hassled, I pull it out. It\u2019s from Mum.</p><p>Becky. Very urgent. Mum</p><p>What? What\u2019s very urgent? I feel a spasm of alarm, mixed with frustration. What kind of message is Very urgent? I speed-dial her number and wait impatiently for the connection.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d I say as soon as she answers. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky.\u201d Her voice is wobbling. \u201cIt\u2019s Dad. He\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGone?\u201d I say stupidly. \u201cWhat do you mean, gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to L.A.! He left a note! A note! After all these years of marriage, a note! I\u2019ve been to Bicester Village with Janice for the day\u2014I got a lovely bag at the Cath Kidston outlet shop\u2014and when I came back he\u2019d gone! To America!\u201d</p><p>I stare at the phone, flabbergasted. \u201cBut what\u2014 I mean, where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the note, he said he needed to track down his friend. Brent Lewis? The one you looked up?\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake. Not this again.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say!\u201d Mum\u2019s voice rises hysterically. \u201cI have no idea who this friend is, even!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a slight edge of panic to her voice, which I can understand. The thing about my dad is, he seems like this very straight-down-the-line, normal family man. But there\u2019s a bit more to him than that. A few years ago we all discovered that he had another daughter\u2014my half sister, Jess\u2014about whom nobody had known a thing.</p> <p>I mean, to be fair to Dad, he hadn\u2019t known either. It\u2019s not like he was keeping a massive secret. But I can see why Mum might be a bit paranoid.</p><p>\u201cHe said he had something he needed to \u2018put right,\u2019 \u201d Mum is continuing. \u201c \u2018Put right\u2019! What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cExcept he was very shocked when I told him Brent Lewis lives in a trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t he live in a trailer?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice shrills again. \u201cWhat business is it of Dad\u2019s where this man lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kept saying, \u2018It shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u2019 \u201d I say, remembering. \u201cBut I have no idea what that meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what flight he\u2019s on, or where he\u2019s staying.... Do I follow him? Do I stay here? It\u2019s Becky,\u201d I hear her saying in a muffled voice. \u201cThe sherry\u2019s on the second shelf, Janice.\u201d She returns to the line. \u201cBecky, I don\u2019t know what to do. Janice said it\u2019s his midlife crisis, but I said, \u2018Janice, we already had that with the guitar lessons.\u2019 So what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, calm down. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bound to come to you, Becky. Keep an eye on him, love.

I send the text and turn round, wondering why I can hear laughter. At once my heart plunges in horror.</p> <p>Sage is posing for the cameras in an exaggerated starlet way, and Minnie is copying her perfectly. Her hand is on her hip, her head is cocked at an angle, and she\u2019s tilting her shoulders back and forth, just like Sage. Everyone is roaring and the cameras are snapping.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I say furiously. I scoop Minnie up and press her head against my chest, out of sight. \u201cPlease don\u2019t use those pictures!\u201d I say to the photographers. \u201cShe\u2019s only a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant do waving!\u201d Minnie struggles to escape from my grasp. \u201cWant do WAVING!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more waving, darling,\u201d I say, kissing her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you waving at those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, relax!\u201d says Sage. \u201cShe\u2019d better get used to it, right? Anyhow, she loves the limelight, don\u2019t you, cupcake?\u201d She ruffles Minnie\u2019s hair. \u201cWe need to get you an agent, munchkin. Aren\u2019t you launching your own family reality show, Becky?\u201d she adds to me. \u201cThat\u2019s what Aran said.

My heart is thumping, and my thoughts are all confused. I don\u2019t know what to focus on first; my brain is skittering about so madly. Dad. Reality show. Minnie. Press. Sage. Lois. Dad.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe Dad is coming to L.A. It\u2019s insane. Dad doesn\u2019t belong in L.A.; he belongs at home. In the garden. At his golf club.</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze comes into the hall and eyes me in surprise. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>I realize I\u2019m backed up against the front door as though I\u2019m sheltering from attack.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s coming to L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brilliant!\u201d Her face lights up. \u201cAnd your mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not brilliant. He\u2019s run off and only left a note for Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stares at me incredulously. \u201cYour dad ran off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something going on.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what. It\u2019s all to do with this trip he went on when he was much younger. He\u2019s trying to track down one of his friends from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat trip? Where did they go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I shrug. \u201cRound California and Arizona. They had this map. They went to L.A.... Las Vegas ... maybe Utah too. Death Valley!\u201d I suddenly remember. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures of them in Death Valley.\u201d</p><p>I wish I\u2019d listened a bit harder now. Every Christmas, Dad used to tell me about his trip and pull out his old map with the red dotted line showing where they\u2019d been.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I expect he\u2019ll turn up,\u201d says Suze reassuringly. \u201cHe\u2019s probably just having a midlife crisis.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHe\u2019s had that. He took guitar lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Suze thinks for a moment. \u201cIs there such thing as a later-life crisis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows. Probably.\u201d</p><p>We head into the kitchen and I open the fridge to pour us each a glass of white wine. I don\u2019t care what time it is; I need it.</p><p>\u201cJuice,\u201d says Minnie at once. \u201cJuuuuuuice! Juuuuuuuice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I say, and pour her a cup of organic carrot-and-beetroot juice mix. They got her into it at the preschool. It\u2019s the most revolting thing I\u2019ve ever tasted, and it costs $10.99 for a tiny carton, but apparently it\u2019s \u201cdetoxing and low sugar,\u201d so we\u2019ve been asked to provide it instead of fruit juice. And the worst thing is, Minnie loves it. If I\u2019m not careful, she\u2019s going to turn into some junior Juicing Nazi and I\u2019ll have to hide all my KitKats from her and pretend that Chocolate Oranges are macrobiotic.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019s Tarkie?\u201d I ask as I hand Minnie her juice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d Suze\u2019s jaw tightens. \u201cYou know he\u2019s started going out at six A.M. every day for a personal-validation session with Bryce? I barely see him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. What\u2019s personal validation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Suze erupts. \u201cHow would I know?

At least something is going well.</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing!\u201d I say. \u201cThey said we need to plan my future carefully, and they\u2019ll help me juggle all my offers. And I need to hire security,\u201d I add importantly.</p><p>\u201cHire security?\u201d Suze stares at me. \u201cYou mean like a bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cIt makes sense now I\u2019m famous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am! Haven\u2019t you seen the photographers outside the gates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get bored soon enough. Honestly, Bex, you\u2019re only going to be famous for, like, five minutes. I wouldn\u2019t waste money on a bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes?\u201d I say, offended. \u201cIs that what you think? If you want to know, I\u2019ve been offered a reality show. I\u2019m going to be a global brand. This is only the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a reality show?\u201d She seems gobsmacked. \u201cHas Luke agreed to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ... well, it\u2019s under discussion,\u201d I prevaricate.</p> <p>\u201cDoes Luke know about the bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to know!\u201d I\u2019m feeling more and more scratchy.

In fact, I\u2019m going to sort it out right now.\u201d And I head out of the kitchen, full of indignation. I\u2019ll show Suze. I\u2019m going to phone Aran\u2019s assistant and get the name of the top Hollywood security company and hire a bodyguard.

We\u2019ll get used to this.</p><p>I\u2019m sure every family finds it tricky at first, having a bodyguard.</p><p>It only took twenty-four hours to fix myself up with a security team. The company couldn\u2019t have been more helpful, and they totally understood that I need extra protection now I\u2019m in the public eye. After a bit of discussion we decided that I maybe didn\u2019t need an armed twenty-four-hour squad, but I could start with what they call \u201cmid-level protection.\u201d My team began work this morning, and so far they\u2019ve been brilliant. There\u2019s Jeff and Mitchell, who are both dressed in dark suits and shades. And there\u2019s Echo the German shepherd dog, who was trained in Russia, apparently. We\u2019ve had a briefing meeting to discuss my requirements, and we\u2019ve discussed my itinerary for the day. Now Mitchell is touring the house with Echo in order to check the \u201congoing security of the premises,\u201d while Jeff sits in the kitchen in order to provide \u201cpersonal integrity reinforcement.\u201d</p><p>The only thing is, it\u2019s a bit awkward having Jeff in the kitchen at breakfast. He just sits there at the side of the room and looks unsmilingly at everyone and mutters things into his headset. But we\u2019ll have to get used to it, now we\u2019re a celebrity family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s still no word from Dad, beyond a text he sent Mum late yesterday, saying,</p><p>Landed fine in L.A.

He says he has to start the day with an hour of guided meditation, and it drives Suze mad.</p> <p>\u201cTarkie!\u201d She pokes him. \u201cI said, I might meet my agent this afternoon. Can you pick the children up?\u201d</p><p>Tarkie gives her a blank look and takes another bite of toast. He looks so different these days. He\u2019s tanned, and his hair is cropped really close to his head (Suze hates that too), and he\u2019s wearing a soft gray T-shirt with a logo of the sun on it. I\u2019ve seen them in the gift shop at Golden Peace. There\u2019s a special course called Turn to the Sun and lots of merchandise to go with it, only I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s all about, because I never did it.</p><p>It has to be said, I\u2019m just a tad less into Golden Peace than I was. I think I\u2019ve grown out of it. It\u2019s a natural process: You gain everything you can from a place and then you move on. I mean, I\u2019m totally cured of shopping now, so what\u2019s the point of going back? (Plus the gift shop is online, so if I need anything from it I can just log on.)</p><p>\u201cTarkie!\u201d Suze rips an earbud out of Tarkie\u2019s ear, and he flinches in irritation.</p><p>\u201cSuze, I need to concentrate,\u201d he says, and pushes his chair back with a scraping sound.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t! What does that thing say anyway? Stop listening to your wife? Stop engaging in the real world?\u201d</p><p>Tarkie glares at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a tailor-made meditation recorded by Bryce. He says my psyche is battered by the world and I need to retreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll batter him,\u201d mutters Suze.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so negative?\u201d Tarkie clutches his head. \u201cSuze, you\u2019re toxic. Finally I\u2019m getting my head together and you have to ... to ... to sabotage me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sabotaging you!\u201d Suze yells. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me toxic! Who brought you to L.A. in the first place? Who said you needed a break? Me!\u201d</p><p>Tarkie isn\u2019t paying any attention to her, I realize. He\u2019s focusing on a far corner of the kitchen, breathing deeply.</p> <p>\u201cTarkie?\u201d Suze waves a hand in front of his face. \u201cTarquin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce said this would happen,\u201d he says, as though to himself. \u201cPeople outside the method are afraid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat method?\u201d expostulates Suze.</p><p>\u201cYou need to strip yourself bare to build yourself back up again,\u201d says Tarquin, as though the very fact of having to explain it pains him. \u201cYou need to strip away every level. Do you know how many levels we all have?\u201d He rounds on Suze. \u201cDo you realize how much work I still have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough work,\u201d says Suze savagely.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t! You\u2019re obstructing me!\u201d He sweeps the whole kitchen with his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re all obstructing me!\u201d He shoves his earbud back in his ear, swivels on his heel, and stalks out of the room.</p><p>I\u2019m openmouthed in astonishment. I\u2019ve never seen Tarkie so antagonistic. He was practically snarling at Suze. I mean, in some ways it\u2019s great, because for a long time I\u2019ve felt he was too timid. On the other hand, Suze looks like she wants to murder him. No, correction: She now looks like she wants to murder me.</p><p>\u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d She turns on me.</p> <p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou introduced him to that place! You introduced him to Bryce! Now he\u2019s calling me toxic! His own wife! He won\u2019t talk to me, he won\u2019t listen; he just moons around with that wretched iPod\u2014God knows what it\u2019s saying to him....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably saying really positive, helpful stuff,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI mean, I went to zillions of classes at Golden Peace and I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not vulnerable like Tarkie!\u201d snaps Suze. \u201cHonestly, Bex, I could kill you!\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Jeff is on his feet.</p><p>\u201cAre we having some trouble here?\u201d He advances on Suze, reaching for his holster thing. (It\u2019s not a gun. It\u2019s a baton.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suze stares at him in disbelief. \u201cAre you threatening me?

They adore the new bodyguard team. They\u2019ve been following Mitchell around the garden, and now they come to a halt in front of Jeff. Ernest is leading the way and Clementine is hanging back a little, her thumb in her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your dog?\u201d says Wilfie to Jeff.</p><p>\u201cJeff doesn\u2019t have a dog,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cSarabande at school has got a bodyguard all the time,\u201d says Ernest importantly. \u201cHer father\u2019s a billionaire. Her bodyguard is called Tyrell, and he can do magic tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Suze tightly. \u201cLucky Sarabande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf people attack you, then your bodyguard stops them,\u201d adds Ernie knowledgeably. \u201cHelp! Jeff!\u201d He clutches his throat. \u201cI\u2019m being attacked by aliens! Help!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelp!\u201d chimes in Wilfie. He falls to the floor and starts writhing. \u201cA snake is eating me! Save me! Jeff!\u201d He turns agonized eyes on Jeff. \u201cJeff! My legs have gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, boys,\u201d says Suze, giggling. \u201cWilfie, get up.\u201d</p><p>Jeff hasn\u2019t moved a muscle. He looks supremely unamused. Now Wilfie gets up and surveys him closely.</p><p>\u201cDo you have special powers?\u201d he says. \u201cCan you go invisible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he can\u2019t go invisible,\u201d says Ernie scathingly. \u201cHe can do kung fu. Hai-ya!\u201d He emits a high-pitched cry and starts doing kung fu moves all over the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cCan I sit on your knee?\u201d says Clementine, prodding Jeff\u2019s leg. \u201cCan you tell me a story? Why do you have a mustache? It looks like a caterpillar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClemmie, do you want some orange juice?\u201d I say quickly. \u201cCome and sit at the table.\u201d I\u2019m about to pour her a glass when Jeff leaps to his feet. Before I know it, he\u2019s at the door of the kitchen, barring the way and muttering urgently into his headset.</p><p>\u201cSir, can I ask you to verify your identity?\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cSir, could I ask you to remain there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Luke Brandon,\u201d I hear Luke saying testily, outside the kitchen door. \u201cI\u2019m the master of the house. This is my daughter, Minnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have you on my list, sir. Could you please step to one side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK!\u201d I call hurriedly. \u201cHe\u2019s my husband!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca, he\u2019s not on the list.\u201d Jeff gives me a reproachful look. \u201cWe need everyone to be on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry! I thought he went without saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to personal security, no one goes without saying,\u201d says Jeff severely. \u201cAll right, sir, you may step forward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t put me on the list?\u201d As Luke enters the kitchen, holding Minnie\u2019s hand, he\u2019s goggling with disbelief. \u201cYou didn\u2019t put me on the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to! I mean ... I didn\u2019t think I needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, this is ludicrous. Two bodyguards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage recommended it,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cShe said you can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoggie!\u201d Minnie points joyfully at the window, where Mitchell is leading Echo past, talking feverishly into his headset. \u201cSee doggie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going near that doggie,\u201d says Luke firmly. \u201cBecky, that dog is going to maul Minnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t. She\u2019s under control. She was trained in Russia,\u201d I add proudly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care where she was trained! She\u2019s an attack dog!\u201d</p><p>The buzzer sounds and Jeff instantly stiffens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d He mutters into his headset, \u201cMitch, do you read me? Secure area A for delivery arrival. Repeat, secure area A.\u201d</p><p>As Jeff strides out of the kitchen, Luke and Suze exchange looks.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t live like this.\u201d Luke pours himself a cup of coffee. \u201cBecky, how long have you booked these clowns for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call them clowns! And I\u2019ve booked them for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPackage for you.\u201d Jeff comes back into the kitchen, heaving a large crate with FIRST MOVE SECURITY SOLUTIONS on the side.</p><p>\u201cSecurity Solutions?\u201d Luke stares at the crate. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... er ... some stuff I bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Christ.\u201d He closes his eyes. \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to sound like that! It was recommended by the experts!\u201d I reach for a knife and jimmy off the top of the crate. \u201cThey said I might like to consider investing in extra security for my family. So I bought ...\u201d</p><p>I hesitate as I peer into the crate, slightly losing my nerve. They look a bit more military than I was expecting.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d demands Luke. \u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBody armor.\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cJust as a precaution. Loads of celebrities wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBody armor?\u201d Luke\u2019s voice rises incredulously. \u201cYou mean, bulletproof vests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBulletproof vests?\u201d Suze spits out her tea. \u201cBex, you didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one is for you.\u201d I pull out the Panther model in taupe, which I thought would really suit Suze.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing a bulletproof vest!\u201d she says in horror. \u201cGet that thing away from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did these cost?\u201d Luke is holding up the Leopard model in khaki green, with a finger and thumb.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much they cost,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cWho can put a price on the safety of loved ones? And anyway, there was a special offer. Buy four garments and get a stun gun free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stun gun?\u201d Luke recoils.</p><p>\u201cEvery family should have a stun gun,\u201d I say, more confidently than I feel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone insane.\u201d Luke turns to Suze. \u201cShe\u2019s insane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m not a civilian anymore!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cLife has changed! Don\u2019t you understand that?\u201d</p><p>I feel so frustrated. Why don\u2019t they get it? Sage understands, and the man at the security company totally understood. In fact, he thought I should buy a doorframe X-ray scanner, too, and change all our locks to \u201cpanic hardware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, my darling,\u201d says Luke kindly. \u201cYou are totally and utterly deluded if you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He breaks off as a frantic barking comes from outside. The next minute, Jeff is on his feet, listening furiously to his earpiece.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are,\u201d he says gruffly to me. \u201cWe have a situation.\u201d As he hurries out of the kitchen, I hear him ordering, \u201cDescribe the intruder.\u201d</p><p>Situation? Intruder? My heart spasms in fear.</p><p>Well, if I\u2019m honest, half in fear and half in triumph.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I say to Luke. \u201cYou see? Minnie, darling, come here.\u201d I draw her protectively toward me, my voice quivering. She gazes up at me, her eyes huge and questioning, and I stroke her brow. \u201cChildren, stay away from the windows. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I try to sound brave and positive. \u201cLet\u2019s just keep calm and sing, \u2018My Favorite Things.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>We need a panic room. That\u2019s what celebrities have. And maybe more dogs.</p><p>\u201cIs it a burglar?\u201d Clemmie starts to cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight him,\u201d says Ernest boldly. \u201cHai-ya!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cGet the stun gun out of the crate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d Luke rolls his eyes. He takes a piece of toast out of the toaster and calmly spreads butter on it, then takes a bite. I stare at him in indignant disbelief. Is he heartless? Doesn\u2019t he care about our safety?</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d A male voice is shouting from outside. Oh my God, it\u2019s the intruder. \u201cCall off that dog! Call it off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdentify yourself!\u201d Mitchell\u2019s voice is booming through the air, and Echo is barking more loudly than ever. I can\u2019t help feeling terrified and exhilarated, all at the same time. This is like something off the TV!</p><p>\u201cThe burglar\u2019s here!\u201d Clementine bursts into fresh, terrified sobs, and, after a nanosecond, Minnie joins in.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u201d says Suze, and glances balefully at me. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get us!\u201d Clementine wails. \u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s the sound of scuffling coming from the hall and men\u2019s shouts, then a thump and a furious exclamation from one man, who suddenly sounds just like\u2014</p><p>Hang on a minute. That\u2019s not\u2014</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I yell incredulously, just as Jeff and Mitchell appear at the kitchen door, manhandling my father, as though they\u2019re cops in a movie and he\u2019s the double-crossing vice president who was found trying to climb out of a window.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my dad!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrandpa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found this suspect prowling in the drive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t prowling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of him!\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re all speaking at once, and poor Wilfie has put his hands over his ears.</p><p>\u201cLet go of him!\u201d I yell again, above the hubbub. \u201cHe\u2019s my father!\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Mitchell lets go of Dad\u2019s arm, which he had twisted behind his back. I mean, honestly, how could they think Dad was an intruder? You couldn\u2019t see anyone less suspicious-looking than my dad. He\u2019s wearing summer trousers and a blazer and a panama hat, and he looks as though he\u2019s about to go to a cricket match.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my Minnie?\u201d he says in delight, as Minnie throws herself at him. \u201cHow\u2019s my little sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I demand. \u201cWhy are you here? Mum\u2019s so worried!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure this is your dad?\u201d Mitchell says mistrustfully to me.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not on the list.\u201d Jeff gives me his reproachful look again. \u201cRebecca, we need comprehensive information to work effectively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did he access the drive? How did he open the gates?\u201d Jeff is still frowning suspiciously at Dad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same code as the garage at home,\u201d says Dad cheerily. \u201cI thought I\u2019d chance it, and, hey presto.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always use the same code,\u201d I explain to Jeff. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as my PIN number too. And my mum\u2019s. That way, we can get money out for each other. It\u2019s really handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou use the same code for everything?\u201d Jeff looks aghast. \u201cYour mother has the same code? Rebecca, we talked about code safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say guiltily. \u201cOK. I\u2019ll change it. One of them. All of them.\u201d</p><p>(I\u2019m so not going to change anything. Four numbers is hard enough to remember as it is.)</p><p>\u201cWelcome, Graham.\u201d Luke is shaking Dad\u2019s hand. \u201cWould you like some breakfast? You\u2019ll be staying with us, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, where\u2019ve you been?\u201d I chime in impatiently. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you in L.A.?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the kitchen. Even Jeff and Mitchell look interested.</p> <p>Dad gives me a guarded smile. \u201cI just have some business to take care of. That\u2019s all. I stayed at a hotel last night, and here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brent Lewis, isn\u2019t it? Dad, what\u2019s the mystery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo mystery,\u201d says Dad. \u201cSimply ...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cSomething I have to put right. Might I make myself a cup of tea?\u201d He reaches for the teakettle and peers at it, puzzled. \u201cDoes this go on the stove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how they do it in America,\u201d I explain. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand electric kettles. But, then, they don\u2019t really understand tea either. Here, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d I fill the kettle with water, plonk it on the hob, then immediately text Mum: He\u2019s here!!!</p><p>Dad has sat down at the table with Minnie on his lap and is playing Incy Wincy Spider with her. Soon all the other children are clustering around, too, and he doesn\u2019t even notice me texting. A minute or two later, my phone rings, and it\u2019s Mum.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she demands shrilly. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing? Does he know how worried I\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s really sorry. There\u2019ll be a brilliant explanation, I know it.\u201d Dad glances up, his expression blank, and I make vigorous hand gestures, which are supposed to mean, It\u2019s Mum!</p><p>\u201cWell, put me on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, Dad,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Mum. She wants to talk to you.\u201d I hold out the phone gingerly and take a step backward.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d says Dad, as he takes the phone. \u201cNow, Jane. Jane, listen. Jane.\u201d</p><p>I can hear Mum\u2019s tinny voice coming through the phone in a constant, high-pitched stream. Dad clearly can\u2019t get a word in.</p><p>Suze raises her eyebrows at me, and I shrug back helplessly. I\u2019ve never felt at quite such a loss.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t concern yourself,\u201d Dad is saying. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s simply an issue with a couple of old friends.\u201d He pours boiling water into the teapot. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not coming home on the next flight! I must do this.\u201d He sounds suddenly resolute.</p><p>I look questioningly at Luke, who also shrugs. This is driving me mad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe wants to talk to you, darling,\u201d says Dad, handing the phone back to me.

I\u2019ve Googled him, you know. Can\u2019t find anything. You said he lives in a trailer. Did you actually meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I glance at Dad, who\u2019s sipping tea now.</p><p>\u201cWell, keep an eye on Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m coming out, as soon as I can make arrangements.

At least he did them in the garage.\u201d</p><p>As I put the phone down, I turn to Dad and see that he\u2019s looking at my necklace with a kind of rueful expression. It\u2019s the Alexis Bittar one that he got me with his BB.</p><p>\u201cI love this,\u201d I say, touching it. \u201cI wear it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, darling? That\u2019s good.\u201d He smiles, but there\u2019s something wrong in his smile. I want to scream.

Why don\u2019t you leave him to it? Come on, poppet,\u201d he adds to Minnie. \u201cTeeth. Come on, you lot,\u201d he adds to the Cleath-Stuarts. \u201cYou can all do your teeth too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Luke,\u201d says Suze gratefully. As the children all pile out of the kitchen with Luke, Suze gives the most almighty sigh. She\u2019s staring out of the window, and I can see a little frown between her brows that wasn\u2019t there before.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of L.A.,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for us.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in astonishment. \u201cYes, it is! Look at you! You\u2019re working as an extra, and Tarquin\u2019s a total VIP, and you\u2019re all thin and tanned, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good for us as a family.\u201d She cuts me off. \u201cIn England, yes, we had loads of headaches, but we dealt with them together. I feel like I\u2019m losing Tarkie.\u201d Her voice suddenly wobbles. \u201cBex, I don\u2019t know him anymore.\u201d</p><p>To my horror, her eyes are welling up with tears.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I rush over and give her a hug. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t worry! He\u2019s just going through a funny patch. He\u2019s finding himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t talk to me! He looks at me as though I\u2019m the enemy!\u201d Suze gives a shaky sigh. \u201cBex, when the children are at school, d\u2019you feel like going for a walk and just chatting? We could go to Runyon Canyon, maybe have lunch....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, I would,\u201d I say regretfully. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to go shopping for Sage\u2019s outfit.\u201d</p><p>An odd flicker passes over Suze\u2019s face. \u201cRight.\u201d She breathes out. \u201cOf course. You have to go shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not shopping for me!\u201d I say, stung. \u201cI have my TV segment coming up! I have to source pieces for Sage! I have to go to vintage shops and build up some relationships! It\u2019s a massive job. Suze, this is my big chance. This is it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d she says, in a tone I can\u2019t quite read.</p><p>\u201cAnother time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time.\u201d She nods and gets up from the table.</p><p>I\u2019m left alone in the kitchen with Jeff, and I glance over at him. He\u2019s sitting in silence, staring implacably ahead, but even so, I feel judged.</p><p>\u201cI do have to go shopping,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cThis is my big chance to be a Hollywood stylist.\u201d</p><p>Jeff says nothing. But I know he\u2019s judging me. They\u2019re all judging me.</p><p>This is what it\u2019s like to be a celebrity. Your family doesn\u2019t understand. No one understands. No wonder they say it\u2019s lonely at the top.</p><p>On the plus side, it turns out that shopping for a movie star is the perfect way to shop. I just wish I\u2019d known a movie star before.</p><p>There\u2019s the most fab vintage shop on Melrose Avenue, and the owner, Marnie, is absolutely on my wavelength. By midmorning I\u2019ve been on the fastest, most efficient shopping spree of my life. I\u2019ve bought three new clutch bags, two stoles, and a vintage diamant\u00e9 headdress. I\u2019ve got three evening coats on hold, and five dresses, and this fantastic velvet cloak, which, if Sage doesn\u2019t want, I am totally getting for myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve also bought myself a couple of tiny things\u2014just a sequined evening dress and a few pairs of shoes, because I\u2019ll need them for my new lifestyle. I even used my notebook from Golden Peace, just to make sure I wasn\u2019t shopping in an unhealthy way. In answer to the question Why am I shopping? I wrote Because I am a celebrity stylist now. I mean, you can\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>When I head out of the shop, the blacked-out SUV is waiting by the curb. Mitchell is standing at attention, his shades glinting in the sun, and Jeff escorts me to the SUV door. I can see some shoppers looking at me curiously, and I put my hand up to shield my face, just like a proper A-lister.</p><p>As I get into the SUV, surrounded by bags, I feel elated. I\u2019m totally on track with my new career! The only slight worry I have is that my Breakfast Show USA segment is tomorrow, and I still haven\u2019t heard from them what sort of styling they want. How can I prepare a fashion piece if I don\u2019t have a brief? I\u2019ve left a zillion messages for Aran about this already, but I decide to try him again anyway, and this time he picks up.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Aran,\u201d I say. \u201cListen, did you ever hear back from Breakfast Show USA about what sort of clothes I should prepare? Because it\u2019s tomorrow! I need to get some pieces together!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Aran laughs. \u201cMy bad. Yes, I meant to tell you. They say don\u2019t worry about the clothes. They\u2019ll take care of all that. Your job is just to go on the show and talk.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t worry about the clothes? I stare blankly at the phone. How can I not worry about the clothes when I\u2019m the stylist?</p><p>\u201cBut how will that work? How will I prepare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, you\u2019ll be great,\u201d says Aran. \u201cYou can comment on the clothes, engage in some general chat, get your personality across.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cWell, OK. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>I ring off, still puzzled. This is all very weird. But maybe they do things differently in the States. In fact, maybe I should do some research. I zap on the TV to see if there are any fashion items I can watch, flicking through the channels until an image suddenly stops me. For a moment I can\u2019t even make sense of what I\u2019m seeing.</p><p>It\u2019s a fuzzy picture of Lois\u2019s house in the dark. There\u2019s an ambulance flashing in her driveway and paramedics wheeling a hospital gurney, and the headline is: BREAKING NEWS: LOIS IN SUICIDE BID?</p><p>Suicide?</p><p>Suicide bid?</p><p>Oh God, oh God, oh God ...</p><p>My heart thumping, I turn the volume up and lean forward anxiously to hear the voice-over.</p> <p>\u201cThere are unconfirmed reports that Lois Kellerton was rushed to the hospital last night, in what one commentator described as \u2018the desperate act of a desperate star.\u2019 Over to our reporter Faye Ireland.\u201d</p><p>The picture flashes to a reporter standing outside what I recognize as Lois\u2019s house, talking gravely into a microphone.</p><p>\u201cNeighbors confirm that at around midnight last night, an ambulance was summoned to the house, and one witness saw Lois Kellerton being placed in the ambulance, on a gurney. Sometime in the early hours of the morning, Lois Kellerton appeared to return to the house and has not been seen since.\u201d The screen shows a fuzzy long-lens picture of a figure covered in a sheet being bundled into the house. \u201cFriends have been worried about the state of mind of the award-winning actress since her apparent exposure as a thief.\u201d The picture flashes to the familiar sight of Lois at the ASAs, crumpling in shock on the stage. \u201cMs. Kellerton\u2019s spokesman refused to comment on these latest troubling events. Back to the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now to sports ...\u201d says a woman in a purple dress, and I switch off. I\u2019m quivering all over. I never thought in a million years anything like this would happen. I never imagined\u2014I never expected\u2014</p><p>I mean, it isn\u2019t my fault.</p><p>It isn\u2019t. It really isn\u2019t.</p><p>Is it?</p><p>On impulse, I dial Sage\u2019s number. Of all people, she must know how I feel.

Have you been to see her or called her or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that maniac?\u201d Sage retorts. \u201cYou have to be kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we do something? Like ... I don\u2019t know. Go and apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Sage flatly. \u201cNot happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is her problem, Becky. She\u2019ll sort it out.

But I can\u2019t feel like that. Doubts are crawling all over me like insects. I can\u2019t bear it. I want to do something. I have to do something. Make amends.</p><p>But how can I make amends?</p><p>I close my eyes, thinking hard for a moment, then open them and whip out my phone. I still have April Tremont\u2019s number in my phone, and she answers after the second ring.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t exactly sound delighted to hear from me.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi, April,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cSorry to bother you. It\u2019s just, I saw the news about Lois. I feel terrible about everything that happened, and I\u2019d really like to apologize to Lois and somehow make amends. Maybe help her. Or something ...\u201d I trail off lamely.</p><p>\u201cHelp her?\u201d April\u2019s voice is so sarcastic, it makes me wince. \u201cYou helped enough already, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re her friend,\u201d I say humbly. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m an awful person. But you have to know, I never realized it would turn out like this; I never meant to expose her. And I wondered if you could help me get to see her, maybe? To say sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois isn\u2019t talking to anyone,\u201d says April curtly. \u201cI\u2019ve phoned a million times, but she won\u2019t reply. And even if she were, you\u2019re the last person I\u2019d bring along. Yes, she needs help. She\u2019s needed help for a long time, if you ask me. But not from opportunistic users like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an opportunistic user!\u201d I say in horror.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not doing nicely from this,\u201d snaps April, and rings off.</p><p>I stare at my phone, my cheeks hot, feeling as though I\u2019ve been slapped. As I lift my eyes, I see Jeff\u2019s thick neck ahead of me and feel a fresh twinge of shame. Here\u2019s me, riding along in an SUV with bodyguards and shopping bags, my career transformed. And there\u2019s Lois, being rushed to hospital.</p><p>Jeff hasn\u2019t said a word all this time, but I know he\u2019s been listening. And judging me again. I can see it from the muscles in his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opportunistic,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI could have sold the story weeks ago, couldn\u2019t I? But I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not my fault Sage blabbed. And I\u2019ve wanted to be a Hollywood stylist forever. Can you blame me if I leap at the chance? It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m \u2018opportunistic.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Again Jeff is silent. But I know what he\u2019s thinking.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what can I do now?\u201d I say, almost angrily. \u201cIf April won\u2019t take me to see Lois, then it\u2019s impossible! I can\u2019t say sorry, or offer help, or anything. I don\u2019t even know where she\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off. I\u2019m remembering something that April said when we were sitting in her trailer. We\u2019ve both lived on Doheny Road forever.</p><p>\u201cMitchell,\u201d I say, leaning forward. \u201cChange of plan. I want to go to Doheny Road.\u201d</p><p>It takes us about thirty minutes to reach Doheny Road, and as soon as we arrive it\u2019s obvious which house is Lois\u2019s. Journalists are camped outside the gates and prowling up and down the street, and I can see two vox pop interviews going on. We pull up some way farther on, outside a mansion that looks like a Greek temple.</p><p>\u201cStay in the car, Rebecca,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cWe need to survey the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I try to sound patient as they clunk the car doors shut and head toward Lois\u2019s house, looking conspicuous in their dark suits. All this \u201csurveying\u201d and \u201csecuring\u201d is starting to get on my nerves. Once you get over the novelty, having a bodyguard is a real pain.</p><p>I have to sit for ages while they scout around the whole neighborhood. As they return to the car, their faces are even more sober than usual.</p><p>\u201cThe building is currently compromised with the strong presence of media,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cWe foresee a high-risk situation developing. We recommend you do not proceed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019you mean not go into the house?\u201d I clarify.</p><p>\u201cWe recommend you do not proceed.\u201d Mitchell nods. \u201cAt this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to proceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we recommend that you do not.\u201d</p><p>I glance from Jeff to Mitchell. They look identically serious, with their dark glasses masking any expression they might have (which is probably nonexistent to begin with).</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to proceed,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cOK? I need to see Lois Kellerton. I can\u2019t live with myself if I don\u2019t at least try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Mitchell sternly. \u201cIf you approach the front of the house, we cannot guarantee your security.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a situation,\u201d chimes in Jeff, nodding.</p><p>I look over their shoulders at the crowd of journalists. It is a bit of a mob. They might have a point.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll have to break in at the back,\u201d I say. \u201cWill one of you give me a leg up?\u201d</p><p>Jeff and Mitchell exchange glances.</p> <p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Jeff. \u201cUnder the terms of our contract, we are not permitted to aid you, the client, in any endeavor deemed as lawbreaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so square!\u201d I say in frustration. \u201cDon\u2019t you get bored, driving around in dark jackets and pretending everything\u2019s serious all the time? Well, OK, I\u2019ll do it by myself. And when I\u2019m arrested, I\u2019ll say, Mitchell and Jeff had nothing to do with it, Officer. Happy?\u201d</p><p>I grab my bag, slither out of the car, and start heading toward Lois\u2019s house, my heels clicking on the road.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, wait.\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice follows me.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I turn. \u201cI know, you think I shouldn\u2019t proceed. You\u2019re worse than the bloody satnav.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, then says in a low voice, \u201cThere\u2019s a weak point in the fence by the pool house. CCTV just misses it. Try there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jeff!\u201d I beam at him and blow him a kiss.</p><p>Lois\u2019s property is so huge, it takes ages to find my way to the back. As I hurry along a side road, I start feeling more and more nervous. I\u2019ve never met anyone suicidal before. I mean, not really suicidal. Shouldn\u2019t I have training or something? Anyway, too late now. I\u2019ll just have to be gentle. And uplifting and positive. And apologetic, obviously.</p><p>What if she blames me for everything?</p> <p>I feel an uncomfortable twinge. I really, really want Lois to understand that I didn\u2019t tell everyone. OK, I blabbed to Sage, but I told her to keep it a secret.</p><p>But what if Lois won\u2019t see it? What if she screams at me? What if she picks up a knife and says she\u2019s going to stab herself right there in front of me and I throw myself at her to save her but it\u2019s too late? Oh God ...</p><p>Feeling slightly ill with all these lurid thoughts, I force myself to keep going. At last I arrive at an eight-foot-high fence, with what must be the pool house on the other side. There\u2019s no way I could climb over it on my own, but after walking back and forth a few times, I see what Jeff meant. Two of the slats are loose. I prise them to one side, exposing a gap. I peer at it incredulously. I\u2019m meant to climb through that? What size does he think I am, minus-twenty?</p><p>But there\u2019s no other option, so I bend down and start squeezing myself through the gap. I can feel the wood scraping my back, and my hair gets caught a few times, and for one awful moment I think I\u2019ll be stuck there forever. But at last I manage to pop through. (Simultaneously breaking another two slats. In fact, I\u2019ve kind of wrecked this little area of fence. I expect Lois will sue me for that.)</p><p>The pool house is about the size of my parents\u2019 house in Oxshott. The pool is pretty huge too. Then there\u2019s a kind of ornamental hanging garden, which looks very weird and out of place, and a lawn and a great big terrace with sofas and chairs and then, finally, the house. Which is vast, needless to say.</p><p>OK. What do I do now? I suddenly remember Jeff mentioning CCTV, and it occurs to me that I\u2019m probably being filmed right now. Argh. I need to move fast, before the attack dogs reach me. I hurry to one side of the yard and make my way cautiously toward the house. My heart is beating fast and I\u2019m expecting to be stopped at any moment. But the way I see it, if I can just get to speak to Lois\u2014even for a second\u2014she\u2019ll know I tried. She\u2019ll know I was thinking of her.</p><p>Panting, I reach the terrace and crouch down behind a massive pot containing a fern. Five yards away are the French doors. They\u2019re open. Do I just walk in? What if I freak her out?</p><p>Or maybe I should just write a note. Yes. Much better. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of that before. I\u2019ll write a note and leave it on the terrace and creep away, and then she can read it in her own time. I rummage in my bag for my notebook and pen, which I\u2019ve been using to make styling notes. I carefully tear out a page and write the date at the top.</p> <p>Dear Lois,</p><p>Oh God. What do I write? How do I put it?</p><p>I\u2019m so, so sorry for everything that\u2019s happened. But you must know, I was as shocked as you when Sage exposed you. I told her IN CONFIDENCE.</p><p>I underline the last two words several times, and am sitting back on my heels to take stock, when something attracts my attention. It\u2019s a pair of sunglasses lying on a chair. A pair of Missoni sunglasses. They\u2019re pink and green and swirly, and they look exactly like the ones I gave Sage yesterday morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They can\u2019t be the same ones. Obviously they can\u2019t be. But\u2014</p><p>I stare at the sunglasses, totally baffled. One part of my brain is saying, It\u2019s a coincidence, and the other part is saying, It can\u2019t be a coincidence. At last I can\u2019t bear it any longer. I have to see. I edge forward and grab the sunglasses off the chair\u2014and there\u2019s no doubt about it. They\u2019re the ones I bought. They have the same rubbed-away bit on the gilt \u201cM\u201d and a tiny chip on one arm.</p><p>What are they doing here? Did Sage send them to Lois? But why? And wouldn\u2019t she have mentioned it on the phone earlier? And why would she send sunglasses to Lois anyway?</p><p>My head spinning, I creep forward to put them back\u2014and then freeze. Through the glass of the French doors I can see straight into Lois\u2019s living room. There\u2019s Lois, sitting on a sofa, laughing. And there\u2019s Sage, sitting next to her, passing her a bowl of nachos.</p> <p>My whole body feels paralyzed with shock. Sage? In Lois\u2019s house? But\u2014 but\u2014 but\u2014</p><p>I mean\u2014</p><p>That\u2019s just\u2014</p><p>I\u2019ve leaned so far forward, trying to see, I suddenly lose my balance, and the sunglasses go clattering onto a glass table. Shit. Shit.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d says Sage sharply, and comes to the French doors. \u201cOh my God, Becky?\u201d</p> <p>I stare helplessly up at her, unable to reply. I feel as though the world has turned upside down. An hour ago, Sage was telling me she didn\u2019t want to see Lois. But she must have been in Lois\u2019s house even while she was talking to me. What is going on? What?</p><p>\u201cGet in here,\u201d says Sage, glancing around. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any press following you, are there? What did you do, break in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, getting to my feet, still dazed. \u201cI made a bit of a mess of the fence. Maybe someone should see to that. Sorry,\u201d I add to Lois, who has followed Sage to the French doors. Lois doesn\u2019t look the disheveled mess I was expecting. She\u2019s wearing long pale-green wide-legged trousers and a black halter top, and her hair is smoothed into a side ponytail. She\u2019s also smoking, which is a bit of a shock. Lois Kellerton doesn\u2019t smoke. I\u2019ve read it in magazines a million times.</p><p>\u201cYou look so freaked!\u201d Sage bursts into laughter as she closes the French doors behind me.</p><p>Finally I find my voice. \u201cI am freaked! What do you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Becky,\u201d Sage says kindly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat ... I mean ...\u201d I don\u2019t even know where to begin. \u201cDon\u2019t you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought we hated each other, right?\u201d says Sage.</p><p>\u201cEveryone thinks you hate each other!\u201d I expostulate. \u201cEveryone in the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we kinda do.\u201d Sage pushes Lois, whose mouth turns up in a little smile.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s a game,\u201d Lois says. \u201cWe\u2019re playing the game. The long game,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cLois is really smart,\u201d chimes in Sage.</p><p>They\u2019re both nodding, as though that explains everything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I say, feeling more bewildered than ever. \u201cI just don\u2019t. You have to start from the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh well, the beginning.\u201d Lois leads me into the kitchen, where a huge oak table is covered in laptops, magazines, coffee cups, and take-out boxes. I even see a box of Krispy Kremes, which makes me do a double take. I thought Lois hated white sugar? \u201cThat would be when we were ... what, ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were on Save the Kids together.\u201d Sage nods.</p><p>\u201cThen we had a big fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we made up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m totally lost. \u201cWas that recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! We were, like, sixteen,\u201d says Sage. \u201cI was so mad at Lois, I trashed her car. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Lois shakes her head ruefully. She\u2019s a lot more composed than Sage. In fact, I can\u2019t stop staring at her. Her nails are perfect. Her hands aren\u2019t shaking one little bit as she makes coffee. She doesn\u2019t look anything like a suicidal head case.</p><p>\u201cDid you really try to commit suicide?\u201d I blurt out, and she gives another secretive little smile.</p><p>\u201cBecky, none of this is real!\u201d says Sage. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize that? You\u2019re in on it too now.\u201d She gives me a squeeze. \u201cLois will tell you what to do. She has the whole thing planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say in bewilderment. \u201cWhat whole thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRedemption,\u201d says Lois. \u201cReconciliation ... forgiveness ... Camberly.\u201d She pauses, then says it again with relish, \u201cCamberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamberly.\u201d Sage nods. \u201cWe just heard. We\u2019re doing it, the two of us. A special. It\u2019s gonna be huge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHuge,\u201d Lois agrees.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to plug it everywhere. The big truce. Sage and Lois confront each other.\u201d Sage\u2019s eyes are sparkling. \u201cWho\u2019s not going to watch that? Lois has this whole remorseful-sinner thing going on too. You\u2019re going to wear white, yes?\u201d she adds to Lois.</p><p>\u201cWhite shift and flats,\u201d Lois confirms. \u201cPenitent angel. They may get the store owner on, apparently. So I can apologize to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good TV,\u201d says Sage. \u201cI\u2019m going to offer Lois help,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd we\u2019re both going to cry. I need to talk to you about a dress,\u201d she adds. \u201cSomething innocent-looking. Maybe Marc Jacobs? Maybe, like, a soft pink?\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve practically written a script. They probably will write a script.</p><p>\u201cDo the Camberly people know about this?\u201d I splutter. \u201cThat it\u2019s all fake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sage seems shocked. \u201cNobody knows. Lois even fired her media team to keep them out of the way, so they have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew we had a big chance,\u201d says Lois. \u201cBut my people would never have gone along with it. They\u2019re so conventional.\u201d She shakes her head impatiently.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d I rub my head, trying to get things clear. \u201cSo you\u2019re not really a shoplifter? But I caught you red-handed!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was an experiment,\u201d says Lois. She sits down at the table, one leg crossed elegantly over the other. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to get caught. But it all worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois is really imaginative,\u201d says Sage admiringly. \u201cThe feud was her idea. She came up with the cancer-victim line. She came up with the two green dresses. I mean, those were just tiny little ideas between ourselves. They didn\u2019t get us huge attention. But now this suicide thing is on a whole new level. Genius. It\u2019s put us right back on the front pages.\u201d</p><p>As I look at Lois\u2019s calm face, I feel revulsion. She actually faked a suicide attempt?</p><p>\u201cBut how could you do that? People have been really worried about you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Lois. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. The farther you fall, the more they love you when you bounce back.\u201d She sighs at my expression. \u201cLook. It\u2019s a competitive world. We need exposure. All the public craves is a good story. Don\u2019t you love a good story? Don\u2019t you read Us Weekly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think every word is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, some of it has to be true!\u201d I say hotly. \u201cOtherwise, what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Does it matter? As long as we entertain our audience?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silenced for a while, thinking about all the stories Suze and I have read in the gossip magazines. Does it matter if they\u2019re true or not? Like, I\u2019ve always taken it as gospel truth that the cast of Our Time all hate one another. What if they don\u2019t? What if Selma Diavo isn\u2019t really a bitch? I\u2019ve read about the stars for so long, I feel like I know them. I feel familiar with their worlds and their friends and their ups and their downs. I could probably write a thesis on Jennifer Aniston\u2019s love life.</p><p>But the truth is, all I really know are images and headlines and \u201cquotes\u201d from \u201csources.\u201d Nothing real.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I say as something occurs to me. \u201cIf everyone thinks you\u2019re a suicidal wreck, how will you get any work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll get work,\u201d says Lois. \u201cThe offers are already coming in. Lots of shoplifting roles.\u201d She gives a sudden burst of laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll be punished and then I\u2019ll be forgiven. That\u2019s how Hollywood operates.\u201d</p><p>She looks so relaxed, I feel a spurt of anger. Does she realize how worried I\u2019ve been about her? And I don\u2019t even know her! What about her friends? What about her parents?</p><p>Oh, actually, her parents are dead. And she doesn\u2019t have any friends. (At least, that\u2019s what National Enquirer said. But who can I believe anymore?)</p><p>\u201cI thought you were about to have a breakdown,\u201d I say accusingly. \u201cYou were shaking ... you were collapsing ... you couldn\u2019t even breathe....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an actor,\u201d says Lois with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re actors.\u201d Sage nods. \u201cWe act.\u201d</p><p>I cast my mind back to the Lois I caught shoplifting all those weeks ago\u2014the timid wraith in the hoodie. The trembling hands, the whispering voice, the flinching expression ... That was acting? I mean, OK, I know I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Lois is one of the top actors in the world. But still. She looked so real. I almost want to ask her to do it again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about Luke?\u201d I turn to Sage. \u201cDoes he have any idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Sage, after a pause. \u201cAlthough, he\u2019s smart\u2014he asked me straight out, was any of this fabricated? Of course I told him no. Has he said anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mustn\u2019t know,\u201d says Lois. \u201cHe mustn\u2019t know anything. Every attempt to fool the American public needs a level of plausible deniability.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe President\u2019s Woman,\u201d chimes in Sage, and high-fives Lois.</p><p>I knew I\u2019d heard Lois say that somewhere before. It was when she played the vice president and wore all those pinstripe suits.</p><p>\u201cLuke is our level of plausible deniability,\u201d Lois is saying now. \u201cHe and Aran both. They\u2019re credible, they\u2019re trustworthy....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2019s great,\u201d says Sage, turning to Lois. \u201cWhen this has simmered down, you should totally hire him. He has, like, all these ideas for strategy. And he\u2019s such a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Sage ...\u201d I don\u2019t quite know how to put it. \u201cInventing a feud with Lois can\u2019t be part of Luke\u2019s strategy, surely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I had to go a little off the path.\u201d She tosses her hair back. \u201cIt worked, didn\u2019t it? You mustn\u2019t tell him,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou know what he thinks I should be doing? Charity work. Like, some trip to Darfur.\u201d She makes a disparaging face. \u201cI told him I was researching land mines today. In fact, you can back me up!\u201d Her face brightens. \u201cTell him you called me and I was totally on the Internet looking at charity websites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lie to Luke!\u201d I say in horror.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t tell Luke,\u201d retorts Sage.</p><p>\u201cBecky, you\u2019re in this now,\u201d says Lois sternly. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re in it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a quote from one of her movies, too, but I can\u2019t remember which one. The Mafia one, maybe?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you your break as a stylist,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou can dress us both for events. You\u2019ll make contacts, it\u2019ll be the real deal. But you cannot tell anyone.\u201d Her eyes are flashing at me. She\u2019s got up from her chair and looks suddenly quite intimidating, like she did when she played that partner of a law firm who was also a serial killer. \u201cYou cannot tell anyone,\u201d she repeats.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I swallow.</p><p>\u201cIf you do, we\u2019ll trash you.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what she means by \u201ctrash,\u201d but it can\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say again, nervously.</p><p>Lois has already turned away and is tapping at a laptop. \u201cLois and Sage to appear on Camberly,\u201d she reads aloud. \u201cIt\u2019s up! You should go, Becky,\u201d she adds to me. \u201cCall your driver. The guard will let him in and he can back the SUV right up to the door. The press won\u2019t see you. That\u2019s what Sage did yesterday. And if your driver asks, tell him I wasn\u2019t available. I was too ill. That\u2019ll get around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrivers know everything,\u201d chimes in Sage. \u201cHey, look, we made Fox News!\u201d</p><p>The two of them are totally engrossed in the laptop. There\u2019s no point in me sticking around.</p><p>\u201cWell ... bye, then,\u201d I say, and reach for my phone. A few minutes later Mitchell and Jeff arrive at the front door in the blacked-out SUV and I slide in seamlessly, just as Lois described. It\u2019s like the house was designed for discreet exits. As we make our way out of the gates, journalists start banging on the sides of the SUV and flashing cameras, shouting, \u201cLois! Lois!\u201d until we manage to break free and drive off.</p> <p>They thought I was her. The world has gone nuts. My head is still spinning, and the blood is pulsing in my ears.

The thing is, this is what Hollywood is like and you just have to get used to it. Yes, it seems completely freaky and messed up at first, but gradually it starts to feel more normal. They\u2019re right. It is all a game. Everyone\u2019s playing it\u2014the stars, the journalists, the public, everyone. And if you don\u2019t want to play, maybe you shouldn\u2019t come to Hollywood.</p><p>On the plus side, Sage has been texting me all afternoon, and I\u2019ve been texting back, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re best friends. I\u2019m totally in the gang! Lois even texted me, too, a few times. The forthcoming Camberly interview is already huge news, exactly as they said it would be. It\u2019s been featured on every news website, and it\u2019s all over the TV, too, and the Sage-and-Lois soap opera is topic A again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019ve been really clever. (At least, Lois has been really clever.) And now I\u2019m part of it too! The best bit was this afternoon, when I was picking up the children from school. I\u2019d already made quite an impression, what with Jeff and Mitchell and the blacked-out SUV. But then, when I was waiting at the preschool door to get Minnie, Sage rang and I said, \u201cOh hi, Sage, how are you?\u201d just a bit more loudly than usual, and everyone turned to stare.</p><p>The only not-so-A-list thing is, all the photographers have disappeared from our gates, which is a bit disloyal of them. Well, not all. There\u2019s one geeky Asian guy who is still hanging around. He has bleached-blond hair, and today he was wearing a pink bomber jacket with tight black jeans and rubber ankle boots. I started to pose and he took a few snaps, then he beckoned me over and said excitedly, \u201cYou\u2019re a friend of Danny Kovitz, right? The designer? Could you get me his autograph?\u201d It turns out his name is Lon and he\u2019s a fashiondesign student and he worships Danny. And now he worships me, too, because I\u2019m a friend of Danny.</p><p>And, OK, maybe I did play up to it a bit. Maybe I did promise to come out tomorrow morning wearing a vintage Danny Kovitz outfit (i.e., two years old), which never even hit the catwalks, and let him take a picture of it. The thing is, I like having photographers outside the house. It\u2019s boring not to have any around.</p><p>I\u2019m in the kitchen preparing an A-lister-type supper when Luke comes in. Dad must have come back at some point and he and Tarquin have gone out sightseeing\u2014they left a note\u2014and Suze is nowhere to be seen, so I guess she\u2019s with them too. All the children are in bed and I\u2019ve sent Jeff and Mitchell out for supper, so it\u2019s just Luke and me, which is nice.</p> <p>Now that I\u2019m a rising Hollywood celebrity, I have to cook appropriately. We\u2019ll probably need to get a chef or private juice-maker or something, but for now I\u2019m making a very of-the-moment dish. Grain soup. It\u2019s the latest thing. All the A-listers have it, plus I need to look thin for all my forthcoming appearances, and apparently it\u2019s got some magic combination that boosts the metabolism.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I greet Luke with a kiss and a wheatgrass smoothie, which is also very healthy and A-list.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He sniffs it and recoils. \u201cI\u2019m having a glass of wine. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say self-righteously. \u201cI\u2019m trying to follow a clean diet.\u201d I ladle grain soup into two bowls and put them on the table. \u201cThis is totally organic and macrobiotic. It has chia,\u201d I add.</p><p>Luke looks dubiously at it and pokes it with his spoon. \u201cOK,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cWhat are we having with it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is it! It has protein and sprouty things and everything. It\u2019s a meal in a bowl.\u201d I\u2019m about to take a spoonful when I remember something. I push my chair back and start doing squats.</p><p>Luke stares at me in alarm. \u201cBecky, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cYou should do squats before you eat. It boosts the metabolism. All the stars do it. Nine ... ten.\u201d I take my seat again, panting slightly. Luke surveys me silently for a moment, then takes a spoonful. He munches it but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d I say cheerily, and take a massive spoonful myself.</p><p>Argh. Bleargh. Ack.</p><p>Seriously? This is what the film stars eat?</p> <p>It\u2019s really watery, and what little taste it has is like a mix of mushrooms and sawdust and earth. I force myself to swallow it down and take another spoonful. I don\u2019t dare look at Luke. A bowl of this won\u2019t fill him up. Nor me. It wouldn\u2019t even fill up Minnie.</p><p>How do the A-listers stay so cheery when they have to eat grain soup the whole time? It must be mind over matter. They must sit there grimly, telling themselves, I\u2019m ravenous\u2014but I\u2019m in a movie! My stomach is rumbling and I feel faint\u2014but I\u2019m friends with Leonardo DiCaprio!</p><p>I take another mouthful and try to chew it a hundred times, as recommended in the blog I read. But honestly. How can this be good for you? My jaw is aching, and all I can taste is sprouty things. I would kill for a KitKat\u2014</p><p>No, stop it. A-listers don\u2019t eat KitKats.

And then we could hang out with other people on yachts. Like Ben and Jennifer,\u201d I add casually. \u201cThose kinds of people.\u201d</p><p>Sage was talking about \u201cBen\u201d today as though they\u2019re best friends.

We live in L.A. now, we\u2019re in the movies ... you\u2019re bound to meet Ben Affleck at a party or something....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d says Luke drily.</p><p>\u201cWell, I will, then! Maybe Sage will introduce us. Or maybe I\u2019ll style him or one of his friends.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019ll become best friends with Jennifer Garner, I think secretly. I\u2019ve always thought I would hit it off with her.</p><p>\u201cBecky, this conversation makes no sense.\u201d Luke is shaking his head, and I look at him impatiently. He\u2019s so slow sometimes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize everything\u2019s changed? I\u2019m in the public eye now. I\u2019m in a whole new zone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly an A-lister,\u201d he snorts, and I feel a dart of indignation.</p><p>\u201cWell, I will be! I have paparazzi outside the house.... Sage Seymour calls me all the time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe paparazzi have gone,\u201d says Luke, unmoved. \u201cAnd Sage calls me all the time too. That doesn\u2019t make me an A-lister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAran believes in me,\u201d I say pointedly. \u201cHe says I\u2019m going to be huge. He says I could have my own network show by next year.\u201d</p><p>Luke sighs. \u201cDarling, I don\u2019t want to rain on your parade\u2014but don\u2019t believe every word Aran says. He\u2019s a great guy, but he just says whatever the conversation of the moment seems to require. Maybe he believes it, maybe he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s the Hollywood way.\u201d He sips his wine. \u201cAnd another thing: We need to get rid of those goons. We can\u2019t live with them lurking around the place all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitchell and Jeff?\u201d I put down my spoon in dismay. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live without Mitchell and Jeff.\u201d</p> <p>Luke peers at me incredulously for a moment, then throws back his head in laughter. \u201cDarling, you\u2019ve only had bodyguards for a day. You can\u2019t be dependent on them already. And if you are, I\u2019m afraid you need a reality check.\u201d He gets up from the table. \u201cI\u2019m making myself a sandwich. Sorry.\u201d He starts slathering mayonnaise onto bread, and I watch in secret envy. \u201cSince you\u2019re talking to your best friend Sage nonstop,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou can tell me something. I\u2019m convinced she\u2019s up to some lunatic plan or other. What has she said to you?\u201d</p><p>I feel a tweak of alarm. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to ask me straight out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say, playing for time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hiding something.\u201d He sits down with his monster sandwich and takes a bite. \u201cTruthfully, Becky, I\u2019m nearly at the end of the line with Sage. I thought we could work together, but ...\u201d He wipes a blob of mayonnaise off his chin and takes another huge bite.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she can\u2019t play straight with me, then it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean ...\u201d I feel a sudden foreboding. \u201cLuke, what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d He opens a bag of crisps, which he must have bought himself. I certainly didn\u2019t buy them. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Becky. A lot of issues are up in the air.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of issues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with the London office today, and there\u2019s some intriguing stuff going on back there. We\u2019ve just had a call from the Treasury. I\u2019m going to have to fly back to take a meeting. And if we progress with that association, then I\u2019ll need to be on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn London?\u201d I can\u2019t hide my dismay.</p><p>\u201cWell, it makes sense. This L.A. jaunt was always temporary. It\u2019s been fun and interesting, but, frankly, I\u2019d take ten bolshie Treasury officials over one obstreperous movie star any day.\u201d Luke laughs, but I don\u2019t join in. I\u2019m feeling a rising rage. He\u2019s talking about moving back to London? Without even consulting me?</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t move back to London!\u201d I blurt out. \u201cWhat about me? What about my new career?\u201d</p><p>Luke looks taken aback. \u201cWell, you can be a stylist in London, surely? It\u2019s the home of style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be a Hollywood stylist in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, there\u2019s a film industry in Britain. I\u2019m sure you can get some contacts together, talk to the right people ...\u201d</p><p>How can he be so dense?</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t Hollywood!\u201d I cry out. \u201cI want to live in Hollywood and be famous!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as the words are out, I feel a bit stupid. But, even so, I don\u2019t want to take them back. I mean them. I\u2019ve only had the teeniest taste of being famous. How can I give it up?</p><p>Luke is looking at me, an odd expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he says at last.</p><p>This is the final straw. How can he even ask that?</p> <p>\u201cI want it more than anything!\u201d I cry out. \u201cYou know what my dream is? To be standing on the red carpet in my own right! Not shuffled along like a second-class citizen, just filling up the space ... but there as me. Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was so important to you,\u201d says Luke in a toneless way, which infuriates me.</p><p>\u201cWell, it is. It\u2019s always been my dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t!\u201d Luke gives a short laugh. \u201cAre you trying to pretend this is the fulfillment of a childhood ambition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d I flounder briefly. \u201cOK ... maybe it\u2019s a new dream. Does it matter? The point is, if you respected me, Luke, you wouldn\u2019t drag us all out to L.A., then drag us back to London without any warning. I know you\u2019re the big-shot Luke Brandon, but I have a career too! I\u2019m my own person! I\u2019m not only \u2018Mrs. Brandon\u2019! Or would you like me to turn into some corporate wifey wifey? Maybe that\u2019s what you secretly wanted all along! I\u2019ll go and learn how to make profiteroles, shall I?\u201d</p> <p>I break off, slightly shocked at myself. I didn\u2019t mean to say all that; it just came out. I can tell I\u2019ve hurt Luke by the way his eyes are flickering. I want to say, Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it, and give him a hug\u2014but that wouldn\u2019t feel quite right either.</p><p>The truth is, I meant some of it. I\u2019m just not sure which bit.</p><p>For a while there\u2019s silence in the kitchen. Neither of us is looking at the other, and the only sound is coming from the sprinklers in the garden outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dragging anyone anywhere,\u201d Luke says at last, his voice tight. \u201cThis is a marriage, and we do things by agreement. And if after all these years together you think I don\u2019t respect you, then\u2014\u201d He breaks off and shakes his head. \u201cLook, Becky, if you really feel that your career path lies in L.A. and can\u2019t be anywhere else, then fine. We\u2019ll work it out. I want you to have what makes you happy. Whatever that might be.\u201d</p><p>Everything he\u2019s saying is positive and supportive. I should feel pleased. But his face is so distant, it unnerves me. Usually my intuition tells me exactly what Luke is thinking\u2014but right now I\u2019m not at all sure.</p><p>\u201cLuke ...\u201d To my horror, my voice is a bit wobbly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want us to be together. I just\u2014 I need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He cuts me off. \u201cI get it, Becky. I have to make some calls.\u201d</p><p>Without giving me another glance, he picks up his sandwich and strides out of the kitchen, his steps resounding down the corridor. Slowly, I stir my grain soup, feeling a slight shock. One minute we were talking normally, and the next we were ... what? I don\u2019t even know how things have been left.</p><p>I don\u2019t see Luke for the rest of the evening. He\u2019s talking on the phone in his office and I don\u2019t want to disturb him, so I sit in the kitchen flicking through TV channels, my head full of dark, circular thoughts. This is the biggest chance of my life. Luke should be excited. I mean, Aran is more excited than he is. How can that be right? And anyway, why did he give me that look? Just because he thinks fame is overrated.</p><p>And the Treasury. The Treasury. Who would choose the Treasury over Hollywood? Is he insane? I\u2019ve been to the Treasury, and, believe me, it has nothing to recommend it. I bet if you asked all the Treasury officials, Would you rather be in Hollywood? they\u2019d all march out in an instant.</p><p>And why did he have to make me feel guilty? I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty, but I do. I don\u2019t even know why I feel guilty. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong except become the celebrity of the moment, and I want to take advantage of that. If Luke can\u2019t see that, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t work in the media. He should be excited.</p><p>I\u2019m just summoning up my name on Google for the billionth time when the door opens and in walk Dad and Tarkie. No, in lurch Dad and Tarkie. They\u2019re arm in arm, and Dad bumps into the table and Tarkie bursts out laughing, and then he trips up on a chair.</p><p>I goggle at them in astonishment. They\u2019re drunk? My father and Tarquin have gone out and got drunk? Why didn\u2019t Suze stop them?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Suze?\u201d I demand. \u201cDad, what happened today? Did you meet Brent?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea where my wife is,\u201d says Tarkie, talking with elaborate carefulness. \u201cI have my friends and that is all I need.\u201d He claps Dad on the back. \u201cYour father is a very, very, very ...\u201d He seems to run out of steam for a moment. \u201cVery interesting man,\u201d he resumes. \u201cWise. He understands.

Dad gives a gurgle of laughter, and Tarkie joins in. They look like two small boys playing truant from school.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d I say briskly. \u201cSit down.\u201d I turn on the kettle, and reach for our strongest espresso blend. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m trying to sober up my dad. What is going on? Mum would be livid.</p><p>As I\u2019m pouring hot water into the French press, I can hear Dad and Tarkie murmuring to each other behind me. I turn sharply, but they don\u2019t even notice me. I hear Tarkie saying, \u201cBryce,\u201d and Dad saying, \u201cYes, yes. Yes. He\u2019s the man. Bryce\u2019s the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you are!\u201d I put the cups down sharply, trying to shock them into sense.</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky.\u201d As Dad looks up, his face is wreathed in fondness. \u201cMy little girl, a star in Hollywood. I\u2019m so proud of you, Becky, my love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re famous,\u201d chimes in Tarkie. \u201cFamous! We were in a bar and you came on the TV. We said, \u2018We know her!\u2019 Your father said, \u2018That\u2019s my daughter!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Dad nods drunkenly.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Tarkie regards me solemnly. \u201cWhat does it feel like, being famous, Becky? Fame!\u201d he suddenly sings loudly. For a dreadful moment I think he\u2019s going to start singing the Fame song and dancing on the table, but he clearly doesn\u2019t know the rest, so he just sings \u201cFame!\u201d again.</p><p>\u201cDrink your coffee,\u201d I say, but less sternly than before. I feel quite mollified by their interest. You see? They get it. They realize I\u2019m famous. \u201cIt feels ... well, I suppose I\u2019ve got used to it now.\u201d I shrug carelessly. \u201cI mean, obviously life will never be the same....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of them.\u201d Dad nods sagely. \u201cShe\u2019s one of them.\u201d He turns to Tarkie, who nods back. \u201cShe mingles with the famous people. Tell me who you\u2019ve met, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaps of people,\u201d I say, basking in their admiration. \u201cI hang out loads with Sage, and I met Lois, obviously, and ... er ...\u201d Who was that ancient guy at the benefit? \u201cI met Dix Donahue, and I\u2019ve got April Tremont\u2019s phone number, she\u2019s in that sitcom One of Them, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDix Donahue!\u201d Dad\u2019s face has crinkled up with delight. \u201cNow, he\u2019s a big name. One of the greats. Your mother and I used to watch him every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got on really well,\u201d I boast. \u201cWe chatted for ages. He was such a nice man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you get his autograph for me?\u201d Dad\u2019s face is all lit up with excitement. \u201cShow me the book, love. It must be full by now!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as if something cold trickles down my back. Dad\u2019s autograph book. Shit. Dad\u2019s autograph book. I\u2019d forgotten all about that. I don\u2019t even know where it is. Still in a suitcase somewhere? I haven\u2019t given it one single thought since I arrived in L.A.</p><p>\u201cI ... um ...\u201d I rub my nose. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t get his autograph, Dad.

I promise.\u201d</p><p>I get to my feet and start stacking plates from the dishwasher, trying to fill the silence in the kitchen. Dad doesn\u2019t speak.

Tarquin seems to have fallen asleep with his head on the table, so it\u2019s only Dad, not saying anything, and me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel all prickly with guilt and resentment and frustration as I crash the plates into their piles.

I don\u2019t want to see Luke either. Where\u2019s Suze? I try her number, but her phone\u2019s switched off.

Despite encouragement from the team leader and other team members, he finally stopped skiing, threw down his pack, and began sobbing. The client was airlifted at 15:00 hours and taken to base camp on Kulusuk.</p><p>A full medical examination was undertaken and the client was found to be in good health, with no signs of frostbite or respiratory disorder. However, the client was in significant mental distress. Nurse Gill Johnson observed him for three hours, during which time she noted down the following remarks: My toes are gone; My fingers will have to be amputated; My lungs have frozen; I have snowblindness; Why me?; I\u2019m ebbing away; Tell the world I was brave at the end. Despite her reassurances, he remained convinced for several hours that he was about to die.</p> <p>The client subsequently enjoyed a substantial meal, viewed several episodes of America\u2019s Next Top Model on the sanatorium TV, and slept a comfortable night before being transported the following day to Reykjavik and thence to New York.</p><p>Greg Stein</p><p>Team Leader</p><p>From: Kovitz, Danny</p><p>To: Kovitz, Danny</p><p>Subject: don\u2019t know how i survived</p><p>dearest friends,</p><p>despite my best endeavors, my trek across the ice sheet ended prematurely when, against my own wishes, i was airlifted to safety. i wanted to continue but was told by the team leader that to do so would endanger myself and the others. you will be shocked to hear I was near death.</p> <p>i feel heartache at leaving the expedition but i will always remember the soaring landscape and will re-create this in a series of winter white dresses for my next a/w collection it will be called ice and pain and will use textured quilted fabrics with raw bone nb Tristan, plse have list of raw bone sources ready for my return.</p><p>I am now, on medical advice, checking in to a place of rest and recuperation.

They didn\u2019t even have any clothes in the studio. We didn\u2019t talk about fashion at all. I\u2019m sitting in the limo, numb with shock, driving away from the studios with Aran. How did that happen?</p><p>At first it all seemed perfect. The limo arrived at 6:00 A.M., and Jeff \u201csecured\u201d it, while I posed for pictures taken by Lon and all his friends, who were yelling, \u201cBecky! Beckeeee!\u201d I was wearing my exclusive Danny Kovitz dress with a little shrug over it, and I felt just like a top-notch celebrity. Then we whizzed off to the studios, and I had my makeup done next to Ebony-Jane Graham, who is totally famous if you watch weight-loss programs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The host was called Marie and she was very smiley, with enormous pearls. (And also a fairly enormous bottom, only you don\u2019t see that, as she sits on the sofa the whole time.) I was all set to start filming at 7:20, and I was dying of excitement, except my one niggle was: Where were the clothes? When I asked the assistant producer, she just looked at me blankly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re on to talk about Lois, right?\u201d There wasn\u2019t time to protest, because she bustled me onto the set, where I found not just Marie but a kleptomania expert called Dr. Dee.</p><p>Even then I didn\u2019t realize. I kept thinking, They\u2019ll ask me about styling soon. Maybe the clothes are on-screen. Maybe some models will appear, wearing the latest outfits.</p><p>I was so stupid. The segment started, and Marie read out an introduction all about Lois and Sage, and then she turned to me and said, \u201cSo, Becky. Let\u2019s go back to basics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p> <p>I beamed at her and was about to explain that this season\u2019s trends are all about clean lines and playful accessories when she continued, \u201cYou were actually in the shop when Lois\u2014for whatever reason, and we\u2019ll go into that later with Dr. Dee\u2014shoplifted some items. Could you relive that moment for us?\u201d I stumbled through some awkward account of seeing Lois take the socks, and then she asked me about the awards, and then she turned to Dr. Dee and said, \u201cSo, Dr. Dee. Why does an A-list movie star like Lois Kellerton turn to crime?\u201d</p><p>And that was it. My part was over. Dr. Dee talked endlessly about self-esteem and childhood issues, blah blah (I tuned out), and then the segment was finished. Not one fashion reference. Not one mention of me being a stylist. They didn\u2019t even ask me who the diamant\u00e9 clutch bag was by.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Aran looks up from his phone and smiles his Hollywood smile. \u201cThat went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent well?\u201d I echo in disbelief. \u201cIt was awful! I thought I was going to be styling clothes! I made all these notes, and I was all prepared, and it was supposed to launch me as a stylist....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Aran looks at me blankly, then shrugs. \u201cBut it was great exposure. We\u2019ll build up to the styling thing.\u201d</p> <p>Build up to it?</p><p>\u201cYou said it would be a styling segment,\u201d I say as politely as I can. \u201cThat\u2019s what you told me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be a diva. I know Aran\u2019s really helping me and everything. But he did promise styling. He did promise clothes.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He\u2019s got that blank look again, as though he\u2019s already tuned out what I just said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll work on that. Now, I have a couple of new offers, one of which is huge. Huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I can\u2019t help feeling hopeful.</p><p>\u201cYou see? I told you you\u2019d be the queen of the moment. The first thing is a nice invitation to the Big Top premiere tomorrow. They want you to do the red carpet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo the red carpet?\u201d I feel a sudden glittery excitement. \u201cLike ... do interviews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I think you should do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll do it!\u201d I say in elation. \u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to do the red carpet at a premiere! Me! Becky! In my own right! \u201cWhat\u2019s the other thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is shit hot, totally confidential.\u201d He nods at his phone. \u201cI should not even be sharing this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I feel fresh sparks of excitement. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s reality. But it\u2019s a whole new breed of reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I feel a bit hesitant at the word \u201creality,\u201d but I\u2019m not going to give that away. \u201cCool!\u201d I say determinedly. \u201cThat sounds fab!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat it is\u2014\u201d He interrupts himself. \u201cOK, it\u2019s not for the squeamish. But you\u2019re not squeamish, are you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Definitely not!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Please don\u2019t say he wants me to go on a show where you have to eat bugs. I can\u2019t eat a worm. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were.\u201d He flashes that smile at me again. \u201cWhat this show is about is aesthetic improvement. The working title is Even More Beautiful. Each celebrity will have a mentor in the form of another celebrity, and that mentor will carefully guide a process of aesthetic alteration. The American public will follow each process and vote on the result. Obviously, medical professionals are on hand to consult at all times,\u201d he adds blithely.</p><p>I blink at him, not sure if I heard right.</p><p>\u201cAesthetic alteration?\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou mean, plastic surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pioneering show.\u201d Aran nods. \u201cSuper-exciting, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say automatically, although I can\u2019t quite get my head round this. \u201cSo ... I\u2019d decide what kind of plastic surgery some celebrity has and then it gets voted on? But what if I get it wrong?\u201d</p><p>Aran is shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWe see you as one of the celebrity participants who would undergo the journey. You would be assigned a celebrity mentor who would aim to make you the most beautiful swan. Not that you\u2019re not already a swan,\u201d he adds charmingly. \u201cBut everyone can do with a little improvement, right?\u201d He twinkles. \u201cThe surgery alone would be worth thousands, together with the fee and the primetime exposure.... Like I said, it\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d</p><p>My head is spinning. He can\u2019t be serious.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to have plastic surgery?\u201d I falter.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, this is going to be the biggest TV show ever to hit our planet,\u201d says Aran confidently. \u201cWhen I tell you who\u2019s already signed up ...\u201d He winks. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, you will be in stellar company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ... I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>I stare out of the window, feeling dazed. Plastic surgery? Luke would be absolutely\u2014 Oh God. I can\u2019t even tell Luke about this. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing it.</p><p>\u201cAran.\u201d I turn back. \u201cListen. I don\u2019t think ... I mean, I know it\u2019s a great opportunity and everything\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. You think it\u2019s grotesque. You\u2019re shocked I even asked.\u201d Aran twinkles again. He opens a box of gum and offers me some, and I shake my head. \u201cBecky, you want a shortcut to fame? This is your quickest route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you what to do, I\u2019m just giving you the information. Think of me as your GPS. There are slow routes and there are quick routes to fame. Appearing on this show would be a super-fast route.\u201d He tips three pellets of gum into his mouth. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t like the look of the super-fast route, that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so matter-of-fact. He\u2019s so detached. As I survey his smooth, immaculate face, I feel more confused than ever.</p><p>\u201cYou said I was hot already. You said my profile had gone through the roof. So why do I need to do a reality show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, you don\u2019t do anything,\u201d Aran says bluntly. \u201cYou\u2019re not on a TV show. You\u2019re not dating a celebrity. If Lois pleads guilty, there won\u2019t even be a court case. If you want to stay out there, you need to be out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to be out there styling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, style.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cBut that is not the super-fast route, I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>The car pulls up in my drive, and he leans over to kiss me lightly on each cheek. \u201cCiao, ciao.\u201d</p><p>I get out, followed by Jeff, and the car drives off, but I don\u2019t approach the house. I go and sit on a low wall, thinking hard and chewing my lip. I let my thoughts simmer down into a decision, then determinedly pull out my phone and jab in a number.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d comes Sage\u2019s sleepy voice down the phone. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Sage, are you going to the Big Top premiere tomorrow? Only, I\u2019d love to put an outfit together for you. Remember, you said you wanted me to style you? Remember we were talking about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sage yawns. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... are you going to the premiere? Can I dress you?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m crossing my fingers tightly. Please say yes, please say yes ...</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I exhale in relief. \u201cFantastic! Well, I\u2019ll put some looks together. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>As I head into the house, my spirits are higher. So what if the interview today wasn\u2019t brilliant? I\u2019ve taken charge. I\u2019m styling Sage Seymour. I\u2019m doing the red carpet. Everything\u2019s coming together!</p><p>I can hear Luke in the kitchen, and my stomach gives a twinge of apprehension. I haven\u2019t spoken properly to Luke since yesterday. He came to bed after I\u2019d fallen asleep, and I left him dozing when I got up for the TV show. So we haven\u2019t seen each other since our row.</p><p>No, not row. Discussion.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit there for now,\u201d I say to Jeff, and point to one of the big chairs in the hall. \u201cI guess Mitchell\u2019s patrolling the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d says Jeff, in that expressionless way he has, and settles his huge frame down on the chair. I take a deep breath, then saunter into the kitchen, humming, like someone who\u2019s totally OK with everything and didn\u2019t have a tense moment with her husband last night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d My voice is a little too high-pitched.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Luke looks up from some document in a plastic binder. \u201cHow was the interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was ... good. How\u2019s things with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s things?\u201d Luke gives a short, humorless laugh. \u201cTo be honest, things have been better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look at him in alarm. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that wretched Sage was up to something, and now, sure enough, I discover she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I say, my heart pumping a little faster. \u201cUm, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of them. Sage and Lois.\u201d He glances at the door. \u201cShut that, will you? I don\u2019t want your goons hearing.\u201d</p><p>I do as he says, my mind working quickly. What\u2019s he found out? How did he find out?</p> <p>\u201cThey staged the whole thing. The whole feud, the stealing, the row at the awards: fake. The whole lot of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim, trying my best to sound shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAran discovered it last night. We\u2019re meeting later on. Obviously this goes no further\u2014\u201d He breaks off and his dark eyes suddenly narrow. \u201cWait a minute. Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes?\u201d I falter. He comes right up near and eyes me closely. I can feel my cheekbones quivering under his scrutiny. And my lips. I think my hair is shaking too.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d he says again, and I feel a horrible sense of foreboding.</p><p>Oh God. The thing about Luke is, he knows me really, really well. How am I ever supposed to keep anything from him?</p> <p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d he says at last. \u201cYou knew about this?\u201d He seems so scandalized that I gulp inwardly.</p><p>\u201cKind of. I mean, I only found out yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me? Even when I asked you directly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t! I mean, Sage said ... I promised her ...\u201d</p><p>I trail off feebly. Luke doesn\u2019t only look angry, he looks hurt. And weary. He looks like he\u2019s had enough, I think with a lurch. But enough of what? Of Hollywood? Of me?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I get it,\u201d he says, sounding tired. \u201cYou rate your loyalty to Sage above your loyalty to me. That\u2019s fine. I know where I stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cThat\u2019s not ... I just ...\u201d Again I trail off, twisting my fingers miserably. I can\u2019t find the words. Maybe there aren\u2019t any words, except the ones I don\u2019t want to say because he\u2019ll think I\u2019m shallow, which I\u2019m not.</p><p>Well, OK, maybe I am. A little bit. But, then, everyone in Hollywood is shallow. I mean, compared to lots of people here, I\u2019m deep. I\u2019m profound! Doesn\u2019t he realize that?</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been really clever,\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou have to admit that. Lois thought up the whole thing. No one has any idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll find they\u2019ve been less clever than you think,\u201d says Luke drily. \u201cWhen this gets out, neither the press nor the public will be very impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p>Even as I\u2019m saying it, I know I\u2019m being na\u00efve. Everything gets out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get out. And then I think they\u2019ll both have even more trouble finding the kind of work they want.\u201d Luke shakes his head. \u201cBecky, I have to tell you, I won\u2019t be working with Sage any longer than I have to. I\u2019ll wrap up our work properly, stay professional\u2014but it\u2019s over. There\u2019s no point my advising someone who\u2019s going to ignore everything I say. I\u2019ve never met anyone so unprincipled, so capricious, so stupid.... And I\u2019d advise you not to get too mixed up with her either. She won\u2019t do you any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she will!\u201d I say hotly. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend! She\u2019s my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour passport to fame and fortune. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018fame and fortune,\u2019 \u201d I say, overly defensive. \u201cIt\u2019s my work. It\u2019s my career. I\u2019m styling her for a premiere. It\u2019s my big chance! Aran says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAran doesn\u2019t love you.\u201d He cuts me off again, this time so fiercely that I take a step back in shock. \u201cI do. I love you, Becky. I love you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are only inches away from mine. And as I gaze into their dark depths, it\u2019s as though I can see our whole life together. I can see Minnie being born. Our wedding at my parents\u2019 house. Luke whirling me on the dance floor in New York. My Denny and George scarf.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what he can see in my eyes, but he\u2019s gazing just like me, unblinking, as though he\u2019s trying to drink me in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says again, more quietly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gone wrong here, but ...\u201d</p><p>I feel suddenly close to tears, which is just stupid.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s gone wrong,\u201d I say, gulping. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Well.\u201d He shrugs and moves away. There\u2019s a flat silence, which seems to weigh on my shoulders. I can\u2019t bear it. Why doesn\u2019t he understand?</p> <p>Then Luke turns, and there\u2019s a new animation in his face.</p><p>\u201cBecky, listen. I have to go back to London for a few days. It\u2019s the Treasury stuff I told you about. I\u2019m flying tomorrow. Why don\u2019t you come? We could pull Minnie out of preschool, spend some time together, regroup, talk things over, have breakfast at the Wolseley ...\u201d</p><p>I feel a little pang. He knows breakfast at the Wolseley is one of my favorite things in the world. \u201cIf your mother would have Minnie for the night, we could even take a room at the Ritz,\u201d he adds, his eyes twinkling. \u201cHow about that?\u201d</p><p>The Ritz is where we spent our first ever night together. It\u2019s a fabulous idea. I have a sudden vision of us waking up in some beautiful, luxurious bed, all relaxed and content, as though none of these arguments had ever happened. Luke has put his hands on my shoulders. He gently pulls me toward him and his hands travel down my back.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could make that little sibling for Minnie,\u201d he says, in that soft growly voice that normally makes me go weak. \u201cSo, shall I book three tickets for tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke ...\u201d I gaze up at him, agonized. \u201cI can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s this premiere, and I\u2019ve said I\u2019ll dress Sage, and it\u2019s my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Luke exhales sharply. \u201cYour big chance.\u201d I can see him making a supreme effort to stay good-natured. \u201cOK, another time.\u201d He steps away, and my skin feels cold where he\u2019s let go of it. I wish he\u2019d hold me again. I wish the premiere weren\u2019t tomorrow. I wish ...</p><p>Oh God, I don\u2019t know what I wish.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s my father to think about,\u201d I point out, relieved to have another reason to grab on to. \u201cI can\u2019t leave him with no warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Luke has retreated into his detached, everyday mood. \u201cOh, I meant to tell you. Your mother called me. She asked what\u2019s going on. Apparently you didn\u2019t ring her back yesterday?\u201d</p><p>I feel another guilty twinge. My mum\u2019s left so many messages on my phone, I can\u2019t keep track of them anymore.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her. She\u2019s just stressing about my dad. She can\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s got a point,\u201d says Luke drily. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with your father? Why is he here anyway? Have you got to the bottom of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I admit. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had a chance?\u201d says Luke incredulously. \u201cHe\u2019s staying with us, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been really busy!\u201d I say, stung. \u201cI had my filming this morning, and I had to prepare for it, and I\u2019ve got to put together some looks for Sage ... I\u2019ve been frantic. And it doesn\u2019t help that he went out with Tarquin and got drunk! They made no sense at all when they got in last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d talk to him when you have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I\u2019m totally planning to. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>Luke shakes his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him. Or Tarkie. They must have gone out.\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cI must get some things ready. See you later.\u201d He kisses me briefly and heads out. I slump into a chair, feeling totally and utterly deflated.</p> <p>So far, today has been pretty much the opposite of what I hoped. I thought I\u2019d do an amazing TV interview. I thought I\u2019d arrive back from the studios in clouds of glory. I thought Luke would be waiting, proud and beaming, maybe toasting me with champagne. My phone bleeps with a text and I reach for it despondently. It\u2019s probably Luke saying, And by the way, your outfit looked crap too.</p><p>But it\u2019s not from Luke. It\u2019s from Elinor.</p><p>I sit bolt upright, my heart suddenly beating fast. Elinor. I open the text and read the message:</p><p>Dear Rebecca, I have arrived in Los Angeles.</p><p>Oh my God. She\u2019s here? Already?</p><p>A moment later, a whole load more text appears:</p><p>I look forward to my meeting with Luke and I trust you have prepared the ground with him. Perhaps you could contact me at your earliest convenience. I am staying at the Biltmore. Kind regards, Elinor Sherman</p><p>That\u2019s so Elinor. She writes texts as though she\u2019s using a quill pen on parchment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I read the message through a few more times, trying not to panic. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s all fine. I can handle this. In fact, this is good timing. This could be the answer to everything. Luke and I need to clear the air; Luke and Elinor need to clear the air; everyone needs to clear the air. We need one big honest, cathartic session, and then everyone will be a lot happier.</p><p>Maybe this will even bring Luke and me together. He\u2019ll realize that I do care about more than being on the red carpet. He\u2019ll realize that all this time I\u2019ve been thinking about his welfare and happiness. And then he\u2019ll be sorry for calling me shallow. (OK, maybe he didn\u2019t actually call me shallow. But he thought it; I know he did.)</p><p>I haven\u2019t prepared any ground with Luke, but how can I? If I mention Elinor\u2019s name, he shuts down. The best thing is just to get them in the same room and lock the door. That\u2019s what you do with interventions: You take people by surprise.</p><p>What I have done is write a letter. Because that\u2019s the other thing you do with interventions: You write down all the ways in which the individual is hurting you by their behavior, and you read it out and they say, My God, now I understand, and immediately give up alcohol/?drugs/?rifts with family members. (Well, that\u2019s the idea.)</p> <p>I\u2019ll buy some candles and some calming room spray, and ... what else? Maybe we should all chant first. I did a brilliant chanting class at Golden Peace, except I never quite learned what words we were supposed to be saying. So I usually just chanted, \u201cPra-daaaaa,\u201d over and over. No one seemed to notice.</p><p>And maybe I should coach Elinor. Because if she arrives and gives Luke that icy look and says, You need a haircut, then we might as well not bother.</p><p>I consider for a moment, then type a reply:</p><p>Dear Elinor, I will be glad to meet you later today. Perhaps we could have tea together before seeing Luke in the evening. Shall we say 3:00 p.m.?</p><p>I\u2019ve sent it before I realize that I have no idea where to have tea in L.A. In London it\u2019s easy. You can\u2019t move for teapots and silver tiered plate stands and scones with cream slathered on them. But in L.A.?</p> <p>I think for a second, then text Aran: Do you know the best place to have afternoon tea in L.A.?</p><p>Immediately his reply pings back: Sure. The Purple Tea Room. Latest place. Always booked up. Shall I get you a reservation?</p><p>After a few more texts, it\u2019s all set up. I\u2019m meeting Elinor at 3:00 P.M. and we\u2019ll talk everything through. And then she\u2019ll come here to see Luke at 7:00 P.M., and I guess we\u2019ll take it from there.</p><p>The trouble with Luke is, he\u2019s so stubborn. He\u2019s decided he hates his mother and that\u2019s it. But if he only knew. If he\u2019d only give her a chance. Elinor may have done all kinds of terrible things when he was growing up, but while we were planning his birthday party I saw how much she regrets it. I saw how much she wants to make amends. I even saw how much she loves him, in her own chilly, Vulcan weirdo way. And the thing is, she won\u2019t live forever, will she? Does Luke really want to be estranged from his own flesh and blood?</p><p>As I\u2019m gazing through the kitchen window, Suze\u2019s car turns in to the drive, and I watch her park carefully under a tree. Thank God. Suze will help me. I haven\u2019t seen Suze properly for ages, I realize. I\u2019ve missed her. What\u2019s she been up to? Where was she last night?</p><p>I\u2019m about to yell \u201cSuze!\u201d out of the kitchen window when, to my surprise, the front passenger door opens and two long legs in capri leggings emerge, followed by a sinewy body and unmistakable blond hair.</p> <p>I stare, discomfited. It\u2019s Alicia. What\u2019s Suze doing with Alicia?</p><p>Suze is just in jeans and a black top, but, as usual, Alicia is wearing an amazing yoga outfit. There are slits in the side of her orange top, and I can see her tanned, lean torso. Urgh. She\u2019s such a show-off. The two are talking earnestly. Then, to my horror, Suze leans forward and gives Alicia a big hug. Alicia is patting her back and seems to be talking soothingly. I feel outraged at the sight. In fact, I almost feel sick. Suze and Alicia Bitch Long-legs? Hugging each other? How can she?</p><p>Suze turns and heads toward the house, and a moment later I hear her key in the lock.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I call, and I hear her turn her footsteps toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi.\u201d She stands at the doorway but doesn\u2019t rush up or smile or anything normal. She looks strained. She\u2019s clutching on to the doorframe, and I can see the tendons in her hand standing out.</p><p>\u201cHow was the TV?\u201d she says, as though she couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cAre you even more famous now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fine. Suze, where on earth have you been? Were you out last night with Alicia?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I was\u2014but why do you care?\u201d she says, with a taut little smile. \u201cIf you\u2019re lonely, why not hang out with Sage? Or you must have some celebrity event you should be at, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that!\u201d I say, feeling hurt. \u201cI need you. Guess what\u2019s happened? Elinor\u2019s arrived, and I\u2019ve got to stage my intervention, and I\u2019m not nearly ready, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, I really don\u2019t care.\u201d Suze cuts me off roughly. \u201cI have other things to worry about. In fact, I\u2019m just here to pick up a couple of things and then I have to go.\u201d She turns on her heel and I hurry after her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I demand, following her up the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cTo Golden Peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re with Alicia?\u201d I try not to let myself sound resentful, but I can\u2019t help it. \u201cI saw you with her. I saw her hugging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were hugging Alicia Bitch Long-legs? On purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Again, Suze couldn\u2019t sound less interested. She grabs a jacket and puts it in her tote bag, followed by a set of notes that look like they\u2019re in Tarquin\u2019s handwriting. \u201cOK, I\u2019m off.\u201d She pushes past me and strides out of the room.</p> <p>I stare after her, mortified. She\u2019s behaving as though I don\u2019t exist. What\u2019s wrong?</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I run down the stairs behind her. \u201cListen. What time will you be back? Because I\u2019d like to talk. Things haven\u2019t been great with Luke, and now Elinor\u2019s here, and it\u2019s going to be really tricky, and I\u2019m just feeling a bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings haven\u2019t been great with Luke?\u201d She wheels round, her blue eyes suddenly blazing with anger, and I take a step back in alarm. \u201cYou know what, Bex? Things haven\u2019t been great with Tarquin either! But you weren\u2019t interested in that, were you? So why should I be interested in your stupid problems?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too shocked to reply. She looks livid. In fact, she looks in a terrible state. Her eyes are bloodshot, I now notice. Has something happened that I don\u2019t know about?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I say anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the fact that he\u2019s been taken away from me by that evil man,\u201d she says, trembling. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the fact that he\u2019s been brainwashed.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s not still on about that, is she?</p><p>\u201cSuze,\u201d I say as patiently as I can. \u201cBryce is not evil\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, Bex!\u201d Suze explodes. \u201cThey\u2019ve fired him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gape at her.</p><p>\u201cThe well-being committee think he\u2019s introduced unhealthy practices into Golden Peace. They\u2019re really worried. They want Tarkie to come in to Golden Peace and tell them what\u2019s been going on in all those one-to-one sessions. I\u2019m going to see an expert today on cults. He\u2019s going to advise me. I\u2019m on my way there right now with Alicia. She\u2019s been totally supportive and brilliant,\u201d she adds tremulously. \u201cIn fact, it was Alicia who alerted her husband and pushed for Bryce to get fired.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m speechless with shock. My head\u2019s spinning with all this new information. Bryce fired? Alicia brilliant? Tarquin brainwashed?</p><p>\u201cSuze,\u201d I falter at last. \u201cSuze, I had no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t,\u201d she says with an edge, which makes me flinch. \u201cYou were too busy choosing clutch bags.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was for work,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, work. I forgot.\u201d She sounds even more scathing. \u201cYour super new career, which we all have to tiptoe around because you\u2019re famous. Well, I hope you\u2019re enjoying your dream, Becky. I\u2019ll just get on with sorting out my nightmare.\u201d She reaches for her car keys, her hands shaking.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cWait! Look, let\u2019s have a cup of tea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beyond a cup of tea!\u201d she almost shrieks. \u201cDon\u2019t you get that? No, of course you don\u2019t. Luckily, I had Alicia. She\u2019s been amazing. So helpful and so kind ...\u201d Suze\u2019s voice gives a sudden wobble. \u201cI knew something was wrong, I knew it....\u201d</p><p>I gaze at Suze, stricken. I\u2019ve never felt so bad in my life. This is all my fault. I introduced Tarquin to Golden Peace; I didn\u2019t listen when Suze was worried....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I swallow. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize\u2014Suze, whatever I can do to help, I\u2019ll do....\u201d I move forward to give her a hug, but she bats me off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to go.

Being told a load of vile rubbish.\u201d She opens the front door, but I jam a foot across it.</p><p>\u201cSuze, please,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cTell me. What can I do?\u201d</p> <p>Suze surveys me silently, and for one hopeful moment I think she\u2019s going to relent and treat me like her oldest, best friend again. But then, with a weary sigh, she shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, Bex. You deal with your problems. I\u2019ll deal with mine.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s gone. I peep through the little side window, staying out of sight. I can see her hurrying to the car. I can see her face relaxing as she calls something to Alicia. My throat is tight, and there\u2019s a hotness in my chest.</p><p>The car moves off down the drive and I press my head against the window, breathing a cloud onto the glass. What\u2019s happening to my life? Ever since that awards evening when everything kicked off, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m living in a kaleidoscope. It\u2019s whizzing around, making different patterns every moment, and as soon as I get used to one, it shifts again. Why can\u2019t things stay the same for just one second?</p><p>The electric gates are slowly shutting. The car\u2019s gone. My heart feels full to bursting, except I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s most full of: stress about Luke, worry for Tarkie, longing for Suze to come back, or hatred for Alicia. Because I don\u2019t care what Suze says\u2014I don\u2019t believe Alicia\u2019s changed. She plays games. If she\u2019s being nice and supportive to Suze now, it\u2019s only because she wants to damage her in some way later. She\u2019s got some poisonous plan up her sleeve, I know it. And Suze trusts her more than me.... Suze likes her more than me....</p> <p>Tears are welling up in my eyes, and one suddenly trickles down my nose. Another is following it as my phone rings, and I hastily wipe them both away as I answer.</p><p>\u201cAran! Hi! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d comes his easy voice. \u201cI hear you\u2019re styling Sage for the Big Top premiere. Congratulations; that\u2019s pretty big!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I try to sound as bright as I can. \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Luke? Is he psyched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I say after a pause.</p> <p>Not only is he not psyched, I want to say miserably, he isn\u2019t even a tiny bit proud. He thinks I should fire the bodyguards. He won\u2019t eat grain soup. He doesn\u2019t want to be an A-lister. I mean, if you don\u2019t want to be an A-lister, why come to Hollywood in the first place?</p><p>\u201cWell, guess who wants to meet you at the premiere? Nenita Dietz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I gasp. \u201cNenita Dietz has heard of me?\u201d</p><p>In spite of everything, my spirits rocket up. I spent that whole stupid studio tour trying to find Nenita Dietz. And now she\u2019s trying to find me!</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s heard of you.\u201d Aran laughs. \u201cWe\u2019ll set up a meeting, a photo opportunity on the red carpet; maybe you guys can chat at the party. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d I breathe.</p><p>As I ring off, I feel heady. Nenita Dietz and me on the red carpet. Making friends and talking fashion. I couldn\u2019t even have dreamed that.</p><p>\u201cHey, guess what?\u201d I call out, before I realize that there\u2019s no one to hear me. A moment later, Jeff appears around the door.</p> <p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to meet Nenita Dietz!\u201d I say. \u201cOn the red carpet! She\u2019s asked to meet me. Do you know how important she is?\u201d Jeff\u2019s face is blank, but I can see his eyes reading my expression for clues.</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d he says at last, and nods. He disappears again, and I quell a feeling of disappointment that he wasn\u2019t more excited. No one\u2019s proud of me, not even my bodyguard. Another tear suddenly rolls down my cheek, and I brush it away impatiently. This is stupid. Stupid. Life is great. Why am I feeling like this?</p><p>I\u2019ll call Mum. The solution hits me out of the blue. Of course. Mum will make me feel better. I should have thought of this ages ago. And I can reassure her about Dad too. It\u2019s evening in the UK. Perfect. I lean back in my chair, dialing the number, and as I hear her familiar voice answering, I feel a relief all over my body.</p><p>\u201cMum! How are you? Listen, I\u2019m styling Sage for a premiere tomorrow! And I\u2019m meeting Nenita Dietz! She especially called Aran to say she wanted to meet me! Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely, Becky.\u201d Mum sounds tense and distracted. \u201cListen, darling, where\u2019s Dad? Can I speak to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out at the moment. I\u2019ll get him to call you back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, where is he?\u201d I hear a shrill of alarm in her voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s he gone? Becky, you said you\u2019d keep an eye on him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am keeping an eye on him!\u201d I retort, a bit impatiently. Honestly, what does she expect, that I stalk my own father? \u201cHe\u2019s been out with Tarquin, Mum. They\u2019ve really bonded. It\u2019s so sweet. Yesterday they went sightseeing and had supper together and\u2014\u201d I break off just before I say \u201cgot drunk.\u201d \u201cThey had a good time,\u201d I amend. \u201cMum, you mustn\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s this all about? Why did he suddenly fly to L.A.?\u201d She still sounds distressed. \u201cHave you found out? What\u2019s he said to you, love?\u201d</p><p>I feel a huge twinge of guilt. I should have made more time to talk to Dad yesterday. I really should. And I should have got those autographs for him. I feel terrible about that.</p> <p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said that much,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have a big old talk tonight. I promise. I\u2019ll wheedle it out of him.\u201d</p><p>As I put the phone down ten minutes later, I feel both better and worse. Better because it\u2019s always good to talk to Mum. But worse because I can see how I\u2019ve let things unravel. I\u2019ve been too distracted. I should be more on the case with Dad.... I should have been there for Suze.... I close my eyes, burying my face in my palms. Everything feels painful and wrong. I\u2019ve messed up in all directions, all at once, and I didn\u2019t even realize I was doing it, and now I don\u2019t know where to start to put things right.... What am I going to do?</p><p>For what seems like ages, I simply sit there, letting my thoughts whirl round and gradually settle. Then, full of determination, I grab a piece of paper from the kitchen notepad and write a heading: Resolutions. I\u2019m going to make my life work for me. I\u2019m not going to let it whirl round like a kaleidoscope anymore. It\u2019s my life, which means I get to choose how it goes. Even if that means wrestling it to the floor and bashing it on the head and saying, Take that, life!</p><p>I scribble hard for a while, then sit back and look at my list with resolve. It\u2019s quite a lot\u2014it\u2019ll be a challenge\u2014but I can do it all. I have to do it all.</p><p>Resolutions:</p> <p>1. Bring peace to Luke and Elinor. (Like St. Francis.)</p><p>2. Go on the red carpet and get a million autographs for Dad.</p><p>3. Come up with perfect outfit for Sage and get hired by Nenita Dietz.</p><p>4. Make friends with Suze again.</p><p>5. Save Tarkie from cult.</p><p>6. Find out reason for Dad\u2019s trip and reassure Mum.</p> <p>7. Buy strapless bra.</p><p>OK, so the last one isn\u2019t quite as life-changing as the others, but I really do need a new strapless bra.</p><p>By 3:00 P.M. I\u2019m feeling a lot calmer. I\u2019ve bought my new bra and I\u2019ve sent over three dresses, six pairs of shoes, and a tuxedo suit for Sage to try on. (I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go for the tuxedo suit, but she should. She\u2019d look amazing.) I\u2019ve also taken Minnie out of preschool early and dressed her up in her sweetest smocked pink lawn frock, with a big sash and puffed sleeves. It has matching pink lawn knickers, too, and I\u2019m actually quite envious. Why don\u2019t grown-up dresses have matching knickers? Everyone would buy them. I might write to a few designers and suggest it.</p><p>Jeff has driven us to the Purple Tea Room, which is halfway along Melrose Avenue and has a big hand-painted sign with swirly letters. I help Minnie down from the SUV, shake out her skirts, and say, \u201cSee you later, Jeff. I\u2019ll call.\u201d Then we head toward the sign and push open the glass-paned door.</p><p>Crikey.</p><p>OK, so I don\u2019t think Aran and I mean quite the same thing by \u201cafternoon tea.\u201d When I say \u201cafternoon tea\u201d I mean silver teapots and waitresses in frilly white aprons and tiny cucumber sandwiches. I mean starched tablecloths and maybe a harp playing and Miss-Marple-type ladies sitting at the next table.</p><p>The Purple Tea Room is nothing like that. For a start, there aren\u2019t any chairs or tables, only cushions and beanbags and odd-shaped stools made out of wood. The room is big, but it\u2019s dimly lit, with candles casting a wavery glow over the walls. There\u2019s music playing, but it\u2019s Eastern sitar music, and the air smells scented, but not of scones or cinnamon. More of ...</p><p>Well. Hmm. You\u2019d think they\u2019d be more subtle; I mean, this isn\u2019t Amsterdam, is it?</p> <p>Everywhere I look, I can see hip young people lying around, sipping at teacups, typing on Apple Macs, and having their feet or shoulders rubbed by what seem to be therapists in baggy Indian trousers. And in the middle of it all is sitting Elinor, bolt upright, wearing her usual stiff boucl\u00e9 suit and chilly expression. She\u2019s perched on a stool in the shape of a mushroom, holding a glass of water and looking around as though she\u2019s Queen Victoria and these are the savages. I bite my lip, trying not to giggle. Poor Elinor. She was probably expecting starched tablecloths too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s looking rather pale and wan, but her dark helmet of hair is as immaculate as ever, and her back is ramrod straight.</p><p>\u201cLadeee!\u201d shrieks Minnie as she spots Elinor. \u201cMummy!\u201d She turns to me in joy. \u201cIs Ladeeee!\u201d Then she wrenches herself out of my grasp, runs to Elinor, and hurls herself affectionately against Elinor\u2019s legs. Everyone in the place turns to watch, and I can hear a few \u201cawwws.\u201d I mean, whatever you think of Elinor, it\u2019s a very sweet sight.</p><p>In fact, I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw Minnie quite so thrilled. Her whole body is shaking with excitement, and her eyes are bright, and she keeps glancing up at me as though to share the wondrous moment. Elinor looks pretty delighted to see Minnie too. Her cheeks have turned a kind of almostpink, and her frozen face has come alive.</p><p>\u201cWell, Minnie,\u201d I can hear her saying. \u201cWell, now, Minnie. You\u2019ve grown.\u201d</p> <p>Minnie is delving into Elinor\u2019s crocodile-skin bag and triumphantly produces a jigsaw puzzle. Every time she sees Minnie, Elinor brings a different jigsaw puzzle and puts it together while Minnie watches in awe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it together,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cIt\u2019s a view of the Wellesley-Baker Building in Boston. My great-grandfather used to own it. Your ancestor, Minnie.\u201d</p><p>Minnie nods blankly, then turns to me.</p><p>\u201cMummy, Ladeeeee!\u201d Her joy is so infectious that I find myself beaming and saying, \u201cYes, darling! Lady! Isn\u2019t that lovely?\u201d</p><p>The whole \u201cLady\u201d thing began because we had to keep Minnie\u2019s meetings with Elinor a secret from Luke, and we couldn\u2019t risk her saying, I saw Granny Elinor today.</p> <p>I mean, they still are secret. This meeting today is secret. And as I watch Minnie and Elinor gazing at each other in delight, I feel a sudden fresh resolve. This rift is stupid and sad and it has to end now. Luke and Elinor have to make up. They have family together.</p><p>I know Elinor said something tactless, or worse, about Luke\u2019s beloved stepmother, which he was upset by. (I never got the exact details.) That\u2019s how this whole argument began. But life can\u2019t be about holding on to the bad things. It has to be about grabbing on to good things and letting the bad things go. Looking at Elinor as she opens the jigsaw with an ecstatic Minnie, I know she\u2019s a good thing. For Minnie, and for me, and for Luke. I mean, she\u2019s not perfect, but, then, who is?</p><p>\u201cCan I offer you some tea?\u201d A drifty girl in a linen apron and baggy white trousers has come up so silently, she makes me jump.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, please,\u201d I say. \u201cLovely. Just normal tea for me, thanks. And milk for my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Normal\u2019 tea?\u201d the girl echoes, as though I\u2019m speaking Swahili. \u201cDid you look at the tea menu?\u201d She nods at a booklet on Elinor\u2019s lap, which seems to be about forty pages long.</p><p>\u201cI gave up,\u201d says Elinor crisply. \u201cI would like hot water and lemon, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just have a look....\u201d I start to skim through the booklet, but before long my eyes are blurring with type. How can there be so many teas? It\u2019s stupid. In England you just have tea.</p><p>\u201cWe have teas for different needs,\u201d says the girl helpfully. \u201cWe have fennel and peppermint for digestion, or red clover and nettle for skin complaints....\u201d</p><p>Skin complaints? I eye her suspiciously. Is she trying to say something?</p><p>\u201cThe white teas are very popular....\u201d</p><p>Honestly, tea isn\u2019t supposed to be white. I don\u2019t know what Mum would have to say to this girl. She\u2019d probably produce a Typhoo tea bag and say, This is tea, love.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a tea for making life totally brilliant in every way?\u201d I say, just to wind the girl up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, without missing a beat. \u201cOur hibiscus, orange, and St. John\u2019s wort tea promotes an improved sense of well-being through mood enhancement. We call it our happy tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better have that one, then. Would you like that, Elinor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not wish to have my mood enhanced, thank you.\u201d She gives the girl a stern look.</p><p>That\u2019s a shame. I\u2019d love to see Elinor on happy pills. She might smile properly for once. Except then she\u2019d probably crack, it occurs to me. White powder would fall from the corners of her lips, and suddenly her whole face would disintegrate into plaster dust and whatever else they\u2019ve patched her up with.</p><p>The girl has given our order to a passing guy in what looks like a Tibetan monk\u2019s outfit and now turns back.</p><p>\u201cMay I offer you a complementary reflexology session or other holistic therapy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say politely. \u201cWe just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very discreet,\u201d says the girl. \u201cWe can work with your feet, or your head, or the pressure points in your face....\u201d</p><p>I can see Elinor recoiling at the very idea. \u201cI do not wish to be touched,\u201d she says stiffly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can work without touching you,\u201d persists the girl. \u201cWe can do a tarot reading, or we have a humming meditation, or we can work with your aura.\u201d</p> <p>I want to burst into giggles at Elinor\u2019s expression. Her aura? Do they mean that chilly cloud of disapproval that follows her round like her own atmosphere?</p><p>\u201cI do not possess an aura,\u201d she says, her tones like icicles. \u201cI had it surgically removed.\u201d She glances sidelong at me, and then, to my utter astonishment, she gives the faintest of winks.</p><p>Oh my God. Did Elinor just make a joke?</p><p>At her own expense?</p><p>I\u2019m so gobsmacked I can\u2019t speak, and the girl seems a bit nonplussed as well, because she backs away without trying to press any more therapies on us.</p> <p>Minnie has been surveying Elinor intently throughout all of this, and now Elinor turns to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Minnie?\u201d she says uncompromisingly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t stare at people. Aren\u2019t you going to sit down?\u201d</p><p>Elinor always talks to Minnie as though she\u2019s another adult, and Minnie loves it. Minnie doesn\u2019t answer but leans forward and picks a tiny thread off Elinor\u2019s skirt.</p><p>\u201cAll gone,\u201d she says dismissively, and drops the thread on the floor.</p><p>Ha! Ha-di-ha!</p><p>How many times has Elinor made a point of picking some tiny bit of fluff or speck off my clothes? And now Minnie\u2019s got her revenge. Only Elinor doesn\u2019t look remotely put out.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says to Minnie gravely. \u201cThe housekeeper at my hotel is somewhat lax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLax,\u201d agrees Minnie, equally gravely. \u201cLax bax ... Guess how much I love you,\u201d she adds inconsequentially.</p><p>I know that Minnie\u2019s quoting from her bedtime book, but Elinor doesn\u2019t\u2014and I\u2019m stunned by her instant reaction. Her cheekbones start to tremble and there\u2019s a sheen to her eye.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says in a low voice. \u201cWell, Minnie.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s almost unbearable, watching her tight chalky-white face struggle with emotion. She puts her lined, beringed hand on Minnie\u2019s head and strokes it a few times, as though that\u2019s the most she can bring herself to do.</p><p>God, I\u2019d love to loosen her up. I should have ordered the mind-altering tea for repressed older women in Chanel suits.</p><p>\u201cElinor, we have to reconcile you with Luke,\u201d I say impulsively. \u201cI want you to be part of the family. Properly. I\u2019m going to stage an intervention at our house, and I\u2019m not letting either of you go till you\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe \u2018friends\u2019 is the appropriate term,\u201d she says, looking puzzled. \u201cWe are mother and son, not contemporaries.\u201d</p> <p>OK, this is why she doesn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s totally appropriate. I\u2019m friends with my mum, and you can jolly well be friends with Luke. When I tell him everything you did for the party\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elinor cuts me off, a sudden steel to her voice. \u201cI have told you, Rebecca. Luke must never know of my involvement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did such an amazing thing!\u201d I say in frustration. \u201cAnd he thinks it was Suze and Tarkie! It\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must never know. I am not buying his love,\u201d she adds, so quietly I can barely hear her.</p><p>\u201cElinor, it\u2019s not \u2018buying his love,\u2019 \u201d I say gently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about the money. It was about all the thought and effort you put into it.\u201d</p><p>The girl arrives with our drinks, and we\u2019re both silent as she arranges teapots, cups, strainers, and little sugar crystals on a trolley made out of bamboo. I pour Elinor her hot water, and she picks it up without drinking it.</p><p>\u201cSo, Elinor,\u201d I say, in soft, coaxing tones. \u201cWill you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says in final tones. \u201cAnd you will not tell him either. You made me a promise.\u201d</p><p>Argh. It\u2019s like she\u2019s made of granite. This intervention is not going to be an easy matter.</p><p>\u201cOK, then. Well, we\u2019ll find another way.\u201d I reach in my bag for my \u201cconflict resolution\u201d notes. I printed them off from Google and they\u2019ve been quite helpful, except I realized a bit too late they were about conflict resolution in an industrialaction situation. I skim through the pages, trying to find something useful. Picketing, no ... union representation, no ... health and safety executive, no ... cooperation techniques ... Ooh, that\u2019s more like it.

It\u2019s as though she hasn\u2019t understood the question.</p><p>\u201cCharity work,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cOK ...\u201d I wrinkle my nose dubiously. \u201cAnything else? Have you ever done anything fun together? You must have done! When he was in New York.\u201d</p><p>When I first met Luke, he was really close to Elinor. Unhealthily close, actually, although I\u2019d never say that. I mean, I don\u2019t want him to go back to worshipping her, but can\u2019t they recapture any of that relationship?</p><p>\u201cDid you ever go on holiday together?\u201d I ask with sudden inspiration. \u201cDid you have any fun times then?\u201d</p> <p>I have an image of Elinor limbo-dancing at some Caribbean resort while Luke cheers her on, cocktail in hand, and force myself not to giggle.</p><p>\u201cWe stayed in the Hamptons,\u201d she says after some thought. \u201cMy old friend Dirk Greggory had a beach cottage there. I took Luke on a number of occasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So, you could reminisce about that ... maybe plan another trip....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we did, it would have to be soon,\u201d says Elinor with asperity. \u201cDirk passed away two years ago, and his daughter is selling the beach cottage. A mistake, in my opinion, as was the ghastly work she did to the porch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I cut her off, my head spinning. \u201cWait. So there\u2019s a cottage in the Hamptons that you and Luke have happy memories of ... and it\u2019s about to be sold ... and this is your last chance to go back there?

You can say that\u2019s why you\u2019ve come to see Luke.

I never knew being a peacemaker would be so nerve-racking. Does the Dalai Lama get this stressed out before he spreads peace throughout the world? Does he apply his lip gloss three times because he gets so flustered? (Not very likely, actually.)</p><p>At least Minnie went to bed without a fuss, and the older children are happily watching Wall-E. The intervention should be over by the time they have to go to bed. Or I suppose it should. How long does an intervention take?</p><p>Oh God, why did I ever decide to do this?</p> <p>On the plus side, the intervention room (i.e., kitchen) looks brilliant. I\u2019ve lit about twenty candles for a mellow, calming atmosphere, and I\u2019ve got soft music playing, and I\u2019m wearing a green dress, which is very soothing. At least, it would be soothing if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it cost me $280 last week in Intermix and today I saw it marked down to $79.99! They could have warned me. They could have given me some secret sign. That assistant must have been laughing her head off as she wrapped it up.</p><p>Anyway. Never mind. Luke doesn\u2019t need to know all of that. The point is, the room is ready and I\u2019m ready and now all we need is for Elinor to arrive. I can\u2019t pretend I\u2019m not tense. And I can\u2019t pretend the atmosphere isn\u2019t tense. I keep glancing at Luke, wondering how he\u2019ll react.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting at the kitchen table, sipping a beer, and his face is resolutely turned away from me. As I look at him, I feel a kind of plunging inside. We aren\u2019t right. We aren\u2019t us. It\u2019s not that we\u2019ve rowed again\u2014it\u2019s almost worse. We\u2019re not making proper eye contact, and neither of us has mentioned our talk this morning. The only time I\u2019ve seen Luke smile today was earlier on, when he was on the phone with Gary, his colleague.</p><p>Gary is in New York right now but flying back to London tomorrow. They were talking about the Treasury meeting, and Luke seemed all fired up. He kept dropping in \u201cNumber 10\u201d and \u201cpolicy,\u201d and I could tell his brain was whizzing with ideas. He kept laughing at things that Gary said, and he seemed in a better mood than he\u2019s been in for days.</p><p>I really, really hate to say it ... but I think the truth is that high finance suits him better than movie stars.</p><p>Dad is still out, which I\u2019m a bit relieved about, because he\u2019d only want to join in the intervention and start telling Elinor she\u2019d be a nice-looking girl if she\u2019d get a bit of meat on her bones. And I haven\u2019t heard from Suze since I saw her this morning, except for one text asking me to pick up the children from their activity clubs. I know she came back to the house earlier, because Mitchell told me. Apparently she was still with Alicia and still looking for Tarquin. She went round the house, yelling, \u201cTarkie! Tarquin, where are you?\u201d and then she drove off again. That\u2019s all he had to say about Suze. He then proceeded to give me a full report on all the security breaches he had identified that day (two, both consisting of the little boy next door throwing his Frisbee into our garden).</p> <p>I think Mitchell will be glad to leave. He was so bored today, he mended our barbecue, which he showed me proudly. I didn\u2019t even know it was broken, to be honest. In fact, I must tell Luke.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, Mitchell mended the barbecue,\u201d I say, awkwardly breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cI was going to do that,\u201d says Luke at once, his jaw tight. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to ask Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask Mitchell! I didn\u2019t even know it was broken....\u201d I trail off, in slight despair. I\u2019ve got to get him in a better mood before Elinor arrives.</p><p>\u201cLook, Luke ...\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cAre we OK?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, then Luke raises his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean this!\u201d I say in frustration. \u201cNot looking at each other!

I\u2019ve been trying to be independent ... trying to get my career going....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d He sighs. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be our own people. If you have to spend time out here for your career, then that\u2019s what you have to do, and we\u2019ll make it work.\u201d He gives me a strained smile. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend I look forward to life without you\u2014but if it\u2019s really your dream, I\u2019m not going to stand in your way.\u201d He hesitates, spinning the beer bottle round in his fingers, then plants it firmly on the table. \u201cBut we have to be honest with each other. We have to, Becky. Honesty is the foundation of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I gulp. \u201cI know it is.\u201d</p> <p>Oh God, should I quickly tell him about Elinor coming here tonight? Explain everything? Give him my reasons, tell the whole story, try to make him understand ...</p><p>But it\u2019s too late. As I\u2019m drawing breath, the doorbell rings shrilly, and I feel a clutch of nerves at my stomach. She\u2019s here. Help. She\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d I say breathlessly, and make for the door before Luke can move. \u201cJeff, I\u2019ll go!\u201d I call as I hear his heavy tread coming from the TV room. \u201cI know who it is!\u201d</p><p>I gave Elinor the code for the gate earlier and told Mitchell to put Echo away for the night.</p><p>My heart is hammering as I swing open the front door. And there she is. My mother-in-law. The first thing I see is the nervous look in her eye. The second thing I see is the dress. She\u2019s in a dress. A wrap dress. Elinor Sherman is wearing a wrap dress?</p> <p>I blink in astonishment. I\u2019ve never seen Elinor in anything other than a suit, or perhaps a very structured evening gown. Where did she even get this? She must have gone out to buy it specially.</p><p>It\u2019s not the greatest fit. She\u2019s so skinny, it swathes her body a little too loosely. And I wouldn\u2019t have chosen that brown and cream print for her. But the point is, she\u2019s in it. She made the effort. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s taken off her armor.</p><p>Her hair is different too. I can\u2019t quite work out how, because Elinor\u2019s hair has always been a mystery to me. It\u2019s not so much hair as a helmet. (Sometimes I even wonder if it\u2019s a wig.) But tonight it\u2019s looser in some way. Softer.</p><p>\u201cYou look great!\u201d I whisper, and squeeze her bony hand. \u201cWell done! OK. Ready?\u201d</p><p>As we walk toward the kitchen, I feel sick with apprehension, but I force myself to keep going. I can do this. I need to do this. We can\u2019t go the rest of our lives with Elinor an outcast.</p><p>And we\u2019re in. I retrieve the heavy key from the drawer where I\u2019ve been keeping them all safe from Minnie, and hastily lock the door. Then I turn to face Luke, breathing hard.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what I was expecting.... I don\u2019t know what I was hoping....</p><p>OK, I do know what I was hoping. I was secretly hoping that Luke would look up, and his face would turn from shock to rueful understanding to wise acceptance, and he\u2019d say something simple like, Mother. It\u2019s time for peace. I see that now. And we wouldn\u2019t need the intervention at all.</p><p>But that\u2019s not what happens. He stares at Elinor in shock, but his expression doesn\u2019t change. Or if it does, it gets worse. As he turns to me, shock veers to icy fury. For the first time ever, his expression actually scares me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d he says, his voice colder than I\u2019ve ever heard it. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d I say, my voice trembling.</p><p>Luke gazes at me a moment more, then strides to the kitchen door, without even glancing at Elinor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve locked it,\u201d I call after him. \u201cThis is an intervention!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d He wheels round, his hand on the door handle.</p> <p>\u201cAn intervention. We have a problem and we need to fix it and we\u2019re not leaving this room till we do,\u201d I say more bravely than I feel.</p><p>For a while no one moves. Luke has fixed his eyes on mine, and it\u2019s as though we\u2019re having a private, silent conversation. It\u2019s as though I can hear his words: You didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t.</p><p>And I\u2019m replying: I did. I so did.</p><p>At last, Luke swings round to the fridge and pulls out a bottle of wine. He pours a glass and hands it to Elinor, saying abruptly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks. He sounds like a sulky toddler. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s your mother,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my mother,\u201d says Luke harshly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his mother,\u201d echoes Elinor, even more harshly, and I see the surprise flash through Luke\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They\u2019re so similar. I mean, that\u2019s the irony. They look like they\u2019ve come out of the same Russian-doll set, standing rigid, their chins tight, and their eyes steely with determination.</p> <p>\u201cI forfeited the right to be your mother many years ago,\u201d Elinor says, more quietly. \u201cI know that, Luke. But I would like to be Minnie\u2019s grandmother. And your ... friend.\u201d She glances at me, and I give her an encouraging nod.</p><p>I know how hard this must be for Elinor. It so doesn\u2019t come naturally. But, honestly, with her hair loosened, holding a glass of wine, using the word \u201cfriend,\u201d she almost sounds normal. She takes a tentative step toward Luke, and I long for him to see her the way I do. But he\u2019s prickling all over with suspicion. He doesn\u2019t want to see.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here because this is nuts!\u201d I say, unable to stay quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re flesh and blood. You\u2019re connected, OK, whether you like it or not. And one day you\u2019ll both be dead!\u201d</p><p>OK, that just popped out. Not sure where I was going with that.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both be dead?\u201d says Luke disbelievingly. \u201cWhy the hell is that relevant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ...\u201d I flounder for a moment. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll be in heaven or floating around in the sky, or wherever, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFloating in the sky.\u201d Luke raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes. And you\u2019ll look back at your life, and you won\u2019t remember any one argument or one hurtful comment, you\u2019ll remember the relationships you had. You\u2019ll see a great big pattern to your life. And your pattern is all wrong, Luke. Don\u2019t let one false stitch spoil your pattern.\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t react. Is he even listening?</p><p>\u201cDo you realize that by cutting off contact with your mother, you\u2019re spoiling Minnie\u2019s pattern too?\u201d I warm to my theme. \u201cAnd what about my pattern? You know, life isn\u2019t just about your own pattern, Luke. All the patterns weave together, and they make, like, a worldwide web of patterns, like an \u00fcber-pattern, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Luke expostulates. \u201cEnough with the bloody patterns!\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, feeling hurt. I was rather proud of my pattern theory. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I see Elinor retreating toward the door. She\u2019s not trying to escape, is she?</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I grab her. \u201cTell him about the cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCottage?\u201d Luke manages to make the word \u201ccottage\u201d sound highly suspicious and sinister. I nudge Elinor to speak. Honestly, these two really don\u2019t help themselves.</p><p>\u201cDirk Greggory has died,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cYou were fond of his cottage, I think. It will be possible for us to visit one last time before his daughter sells it. But I will have to let the family know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Luke sounds taken aback. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a photograph of you there,\u201d says Elinor to my surprise, and opens her bag.</p><p>She produces an ancient-looking crocodile case, and snaps open the stiff clasps. I immediately see an old black-and-white print of some gorgeous-looking man, which Elinor bundles out of view. She leafs past about five more pictures, then removes a photo and hands it to Luke.</p> <p>\u201cYou remember this?\u201d</p><p>I peer at the photograph with curiosity and see a younger-looking Luke standing on a wide, sandy beach, dressed in a polo shirt and rolled-up cotton trousers, with bare feet. He\u2019s holding a wooden spade and laughing. His hair is longer than it is today, and it\u2019s rumpled in the wind. I feel a tiny stab of jealousy. I wish I\u2019d known him then.</p><p>Luke gives the photo the barest glance. \u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were twenty-three. It feels like only a year or two ago.\u201d Elinor places a different photo on top, without saying anything. This time, Elinor is in the shot too. She\u2019s wearing such a hideous-looking mustard-colored halter-neck and slacks combo, I nearly gasp. But her sunglasses are quite cool, and the setting is amazing. The pair of them are standing on a boat, with nothing but ocean in the background.</p><p>\u201cYou carry photographs around with you?\u201d I can\u2019t help saying incredulously. Elinor immediately looks as though I\u2019ve tapped into her secret source of weakness.</p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d she says, her face closing up. \u201cOn occasion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s like a snail, I think, in fascination. Every time you touch her, she retreats. But the point is, snails can be tamed.</p><p>Actually, can snails be tamed? OK, she\u2019s not a snail, she\u2019s a ... tortoise. No. A meerkat? No. Oh, fuck knows what she is. The point is, this picture seems to have gripped Luke. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s gazing at the sea or the boat or Elinor\u2019s revolting outfit, but something has got to him.</p><p>\u201cMinnie would love it there.\u201d He glances up at me. \u201cSo would you. It\u2019s a magical place. The sand, the sea ... You wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could easily charter a boat,\u201d puts in Elinor.</p> <p>\u201cMinnie should learn to sail.\u201d Luke has that gleamy, distant look he gets when he\u2019s making plans. \u201cBecky, you need to learn to sail too.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s mentioned the whole sailing thing quite a few times in our marriage, and so far I\u2019ve managed to avoid it.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait!\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>The oven pings and we all jump. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve come back to life. For an awful moment I think Luke\u2019s going to snap back to his cold, angry self and tell Elinor to leave. But instead he looks up from the photo and surveys each of us in turn. He walks over to the window, heaves a deep sigh, and rubs his face with the flat of his hands.</p><p>I know it\u2019s all going on inside his head. He hates to be rushed; we just have to let him get there. Elinor is following my lead. She\u2019s standing absolutely still, barely even breathing.</p> <p>\u201cLook ... maybe this has gone on long enough,\u201d Luke says at last. \u201cI\u2019d like to ... start again.\u201d</p><p>As the words leave his mouth, I practically collapse in relief. Elinor doesn\u2019t move very much at all, but I\u2019ve learned to read her too. The two lines at her jaw have relaxed, which is the equivalent of her going Phew!</p><p>\u201cI would like that,\u201d she says in a low voice. \u201cI meant what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I didn\u2019t mean what I said.\u201d Luke smiles, a rueful boyish smile that makes my heart constrict. It hasn\u2019t been easy for him, losing one mother and loathing the other. \u201cCome here.\u201d He pecks Elinor on the cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay for supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d Elinor shoots a questioning look at me, and I nod.</p><p>\u201cMay I have the key back now?\u201d Luke says to me.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I say teasingly, and hand it to him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must meet Minnie,\u201d he adds to Elinor. \u201cShe won\u2019t be asleep yet; I\u2019ll get her up. Minnie!\u201d he calls, unlocking the kitchen door. \u201cThere\u2019s someone for you to meet! You haven\u2019t seen her since she was a baby,\u201d he adds to Elinor as he strides out. \u201cYou\u2019ll get such a shock.\u201d</p><p>Minnie.</p><p>Shit. Minnie. As far as Luke is concerned, Minnie and Elinor are strangers. Elinor and I meet eyes, and I can tell we\u2019ve had exactly the same thought.</p><p>OK. Don\u2019t panic. It\u2019ll be fine. I just need to think quickly. I need to head this off. Think ... think ...</p><p>I can hear Minnie pattering down the stairs, and Luke following her and saying, \u201cNow, Minnie, I\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d replies Minnie. \u201cPresent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not a present, a person, and here she is....\u201d</p> <p>The kitchen door opens and Minnie stands in the doorway, a tiny figure in her frilled white nightdress and rabbit slippers. \u201cLadeeeeee!\u201d she cries joyously.</p><p>\u201cThis is your grandmother!\u201d says Luke with a flourish. \u201cMinnie, this lady is my mother. Would you like to say hello?\u201d Minnie isn\u2019t listening. She rushes over, flings herself at Elinor\u2019s legs, and then starts trying to open her bag.</p><p>\u201cLadeeeeee!\u201d she says. \u201cDaddy, is Ladeeeee!\u201d She finds a puzzle in Elinor\u2019s bag and pulls it out in triumph. \u201cPuzzle, Ladeee! Do it at the table,\u201d she enunciates carefully as she climbs onto a chair. \u201cAt the table.\u201d</p><p>Luke is staring at them both in utter bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cShe ... knows her,\u201d he says. \u201cMinnie, darling, do you know your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gran-mudder,\u201d says Minnie scornfully. \u201cIs Ladeeee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows you.\u201d He addresses Elinor directly. \u201cHow could she know you? She hasn\u2019t seen you since she was a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know Elinor!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! She\u2019s just being friendly.\u201d But my voice sounds false to my own ears.</p><p>I can see the truth dawning on Luke\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe used to talk about seeing a lady,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what she was talking about.\u201d He whips round to me, suddenly pale with fury. \u201cThat was my mother, wasn\u2019t it? Becky, what have you been doing behind my back? And no more lying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sounds so self-righteous, I feel a surge of outrage. He has no idea. No bloody idea.</p><p>\u201cOK, I did take Minnie to see Elinor!\u201d I cry. \u201cBecause she\u2019s her grandmother and they should get to know each other! But before you get so high and mighty, do you want to know what else we were doing, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Elinor in a tone of dreadful warning, but I ignore her.</p><p>\u201cWe were planning your surprise party! You thought that was Suze and Tarquin? Well, it wasn\u2019t! It was your mother. She organized the whole thing and paid for it, and she wouldn\u2019t take any credit, but she should! Because it was her. It was Elinor.\u201d</p> <p>I break off, breathing hard. At last. At last. I\u2019ve been carrying that secret around like a heavy weight ever since the night of the party.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d Luke sounds shaken.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s asking Elinor or me, but in any case, Elinor doesn\u2019t answer. She looks dry-frozen. All the warmth has vanished, and her eyes have dwindled to dark, burning points.</p><p>\u201cThat is not why I came here, for you to discover that fact, Luke,\u201d she says, her voice an angry rasp. \u201cIt is not why I came here. You were not supposed to discover ... you were never supposed to know....\u201d Her face is trembling, and as I watch I\u2019m suddenly appalled. Is she\u2014</p><p>No.</p> <p>Is she about to cry?</p><p>\u201cElinor,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cElinor, I\u2019m sorry, but he had to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She won\u2019t meet my eye. \u201cNo, Rebecca. You have undermined everything. Goodbye, Minnie.\u201d</p><p>To my utter horror, she grabs hold of her bag with shaking hands and walks out.</p><p>\u201cLadeeee!\u201d cries Minnie. \u201cNo go!\u201d</p><p>I watch, paralyzed, unable to bring myself to go after her. Only when I hear the heavy front door slam do I move. A horrible guilt is growing inside me, and I can\u2019t stop myself lashing out at Luke.</p> <p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d I round on him. \u201cSo you\u2019ve destroyed your mother\u2019s life. I hope you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestroyed her life? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have! All she wants is to make amends and be part of the family and see Minnie. Don\u2019t you get that, Luke? She doesn\u2019t want to buy your love. She wouldn\u2019t let me tell you about the party. She was watching the whole thing from a hiding place, but she wouldn\u2019t come out. And then you went overboard, thanking Suze and Tarkie. They knew it was Elinor. They felt terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everyone knew except me,\u201d says Luke tightly. \u201cOf course they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadeeee!\u201d wails Minnie, as Luke\u2019s BlackBerry bleeps with a text. \u201cWhere Ladeee?\u201d She gets down from the table, looking determined. \u201cFind Ladeeee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinnie, Lady had to go to her own home,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you a bedtime story about Lady, how about that? And then you can go to sleep and tomorrow we\u2019ll do something nice\u2014\u201d I break off, noticing a weird flicker pass over Luke\u2019s face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Luke says nothing. He\u2019s just gazing at his phone. He glances at me, then focuses on his screen again. OK, I don\u2019t like this.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cTell me!\u201d</p> <p>Silently, Luke turns his phone round. I squint at the screen and see a picture of Minnie, standing in our drive, in a sexy, grown-up pose.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the USA Today website,\u201d he says, and my heart plummets.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d I grab the phone and wince at the image. They\u2019ve managed to make Minnie look all grown-up and knowing and ... awful. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve touched up her mouth so she looks like she\u2019s wearing makeup.</p><p>\u201cThat was Sage\u2019s fault,\u201d I say, handing the phone back. \u201cShe encouraged Minnie. I stopped her as soon as I saw what they were doing. Who sent it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAran. But I think he got our numbers mixed up, because the message is to you. He seems to think you\u2019ll be pleased. It\u2019s all raising the family profile, as he puts it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an accusing note to Luke\u2019s voice, I suddenly realize.</p><p>\u201cPleased?\u201d I echo in horror. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not pleased. I was livid! I told them to stop! Luke, you can\u2019t think\u2014\u201d I stop at his expression. He\u2019s staring at his phone again, with a look of revulsion.</p><p>\u201cAran\u2019s just sent me another text for you by mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cYou really must tell him your correct number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cWhat does he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s set up the meeting you discussed with the producers of Even More Beautiful,\u201d says Luke in an odd, toneless voice. \u201cHe\u2019s told them you\u2019re super-excited, and they can\u2019t wait to meet you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t believe it.

It\u2019s just a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what it is,\u201d says Luke, still in the same odd voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality show involving plastic surgery. Are you so desperate for fame, Becky? Are you willing to butcher your body to become a celebrity? Are you willing to leave Minnie and put yourself at risk of injury, or death, just so you can stand on the red carpet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, appalled. \u201cLuke, I wouldn\u2019t actually do it\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why are you having the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not! I told Aran I didn\u2019t want to do it! This is all a mix-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Aran set up a meeting unless you\u2019d expressed interest?\u201d His voice is inexorable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I say desperately. \u201cLuke, please believe me! I told Aran I wasn\u2019t interested. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? That\u2019s a good one, Becky.\u201d He gives a short, ill-humored laugh. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t lie to me. That\u2019s a brilliant one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d I clutch my hair. \u201cI know I fibbed about Minnie seeing Elinor. And Sage and Lois. But that was different. Luke, you can\u2019t think I\u2019d be willing to have plastic surgery on TV!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, to be absolutely honest,\u201d he says, his face hard, \u201cI have no idea how your mind works anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere Ladeee?\u201d Minnie interrupts. \u201cWhere Ladeee gone?\u201d</p><p>Her little face is so innocent and trusting that, with no warning, I burst into tears. I would never, ever use her for publicity. I would never, ever put myself at risk for some stupid reality show. How could Luke think that?</p><p>He\u2019s shrugging on his jacket and now he heads to the kitchen door, still with that distant expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about supper for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMy assistant had a place held for me on the midnight flight to New York. I decided I didn\u2019t want to go till the morning, but I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m waiting around. I\u2019ll see if she can still get me out tonight, then I can hook up with Gary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I say, stricken.</p><p>\u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care!\u201d My voice wobbles perilously. \u201cLuke, you\u2019re not listening! You don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he lashes back. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what you want or why you want it or what your values are anymore. You\u2019re lost, Becky. Completely lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d I give a sudden sob. \u201cI\u2019m not lost!\u201d</p><p>But Luke has gone. I sink back into my chair, feeling shaky with disbelief. So much for my intervention. Elinor stalked out. Luke stalked out. I\u2019ve made everything a zillion times worse.</p> <p>How could he think I\u2019d have plastic surgery? How could he think I\u2019d use Minnie?</p><p>\u201cWhere Ladeeeee?\u201d says Minnie again. She looks curiously at my face. \u201cMummy crying,\u201d she adds dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cCome on, darling.\u201d With a huge effort, I force myself out of my chair. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>Minnie isn\u2019t too keen on the idea of bed, and I don\u2019t really blame her, to be honest. It takes ages to cajole her back under the blankets, and I end up reading Guess How Much I Love You about ten times because, each time we finish, she says, \u201cAgain! More! Moooooore!\u201d and I can\u2019t resist her pleas. Reading the familiar words is soothing me as much as her, I think.</p><p>And then, just as I\u2019m creeping out of her darkened room, I hear the front door slam down below. It\u2019s like a stab in the heart. He\u2019s gone and he didn\u2019t say goodbye. He always says goodbye.</p><p>I feel dazed. I don\u2019t know what to do with myself. At last, I head back into the kitchen, but I can\u2019t bring myself to eat, and that\u2019s not only because it\u2019s revolting quinoa bake from that stupid Eat Good &amp; Clean website, which I am never, ever visiting again. So I just sit at the table, my mind circling round and round, trying to work out where exactly I went so disastrously wrong.</p><p>And then there\u2019s the sound of a key in the front door, and my heart lifts. He\u2019s back. He came back! I knew he would.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I go running into the hall. \u201cLuke\u2014 Oh.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not Luke; it\u2019s Suze. She\u2019s looking tired, and as she takes off her jacket I can see she\u2019s been nibbling the skin on her fingers, which she does whenever she\u2019s stressed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says shortly. \u201cAre the children OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching Wall-E.\u201d I nod.

And now he won\u2019t answer the phone at all. I have no idea where he is, I have no idea what he\u2019s doing; he could be anywhere....\u201d Her voice rises to an accusing roar. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all your dad\u2019s fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s fault?\u201d I say, staggered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dragged him off on some wild goose chase.\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes blaze at me accusingly. \u201cApparently he\u2019s got to \u2018put something right.\u2019 What is it?

First, Mum, then Luke, now Suze.</p><p>\u201cI was going to talk to him.\u201d I know how feeble this sounds, and a warm shame creeps over me. Why didn\u2019t I sit down properly with Dad? \u201cAll I know is it was something to do with some old friend from a trip years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome old friend,\u201d repeats Suze sarcastically. \u201cCould you be any more vague?\u201d</p><p>Her tone is so lacerating, I suddenly find myself lashing back. \u201cWhy are you blaming me? It\u2019s not my fault!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is your fault! You\u2019ve totally ignored your dad, so he\u2019s latched on to Tarkie! They were drunk last night, you know that? Tarkie\u2019s in a vulnerable place at the moment. He shouldn\u2019t be getting drunk. Your dad\u2019s a total alkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t!

Might be true.</p><p>I\u2019ve searched Dad\u2019s room for clues, of course. The first thing I found was a jolly note on his pillow, telling me that he was off on a little trip and he had something to put right but that I wasn\u2019t to worry and he would be back with Tarquin in two shakes of a duck\u2019s tail. Apart from that, my findings consist of:</p><p>1. The map from his trip all those years ago.</p><p>2. A copy of Vanity Fair from 1972.</p> <p>3. A napkin from Dillon\u2019s Irish Bar. (Relevant?)</p><p>I look yet again at the map. I\u2019m holding it really carefully, because it\u2019s pretty fragile, and I\u2019m tracing my finger over the ancient red Biro marking their route. Los Angeles ... Las Vegas ... Salt Lake City ...</p><p>What is he \u201cputting right\u201d? What\u2019s been going on?</p><p>I wish for the millionth time that I\u2019d listened more carefully when Dad was telling me about his trip. I can remember vague details and stories\u2014like the time they staked their rental car in a poker game and the time they got lost in Death Valley and thought they were going to die\u2014but nothing solid. Nothing that actually helps us.</p><p>Mum had no idea about it when I spoke to her on the phone either. In fact, she was in such a state that I couldn\u2019t get much sense out of her at all. She was packing, and Janice was helping, and the two of them were getting in a total tizzy about how to carry their money without being mugged. She and Janice are both coming out on the next possible flight to L.A., leaving Martin to \u201cman the phones at home,\u201d as Mum put it. She\u2019s convinced that Dad is dead in a ditch somewhere and kept talking about \u201cIf the worst should happen\u201d and \u201cIf he\u2019s alive, God willing,\u201d until I finally snapped and yelled, \u201cMum, he\u2019s not dead!\u201d Then she accused me of being insensitive.</p> <p>I\u2019ve left about five messages for Brent Lewis\u2019s sister, Leah, but she hasn\u2019t replied. The only thing I can think of doing now is going back to that trailer park where Brent Lewis lived. I know he\u2019s been evicted, but maybe some neighbor will have a number for him, or something? He\u2019s my only connection with Dad\u2019s trip, or any of it.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll take the children to school, I\u2019ll head over to the trailer park straightaway,\u201d I say to Suze. \u201cJeff will drive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Suze doesn\u2019t look at me properly. She hasn\u2019t looked at me properly since last night. Her phone is clamped to her ear, and she\u2019s stirring her tea obsessively with her other hand, round and round and round.</p><p>\u201cWho are you phoning?\u201d I venture.</p><p>\u201cAlicia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I turn away.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d says Suze into the phone. \u201cNo. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>I feel a tweak of hurt. She\u2019s talking in the kind of intimate shorthand you use when you\u2019re really close to someone. Like the way we talk. Used to talk.</p><p>I can almost feel tears rising at the thought of Suze and Alicia being that close, but, then, I\u2019ve had only about two hours\u2019 sleep. I kept checking my phone for messages from Luke, but there weren\u2019t any. I\u2019ve composed a million texts to him, but I haven\u2019t sent any of them. Every time I even picture him, I feel such a tidal wave of hurt that I don\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>I rub my eyes and drain my coffee. \u201cOK, Jeff,\u201d I call. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>As Jeff comes into the kitchen, his demeanor is gloomier than ever. He hasn\u2019t reacted well to the news of Dad and Tarkie disappearing. He seems to feel it\u2019s all his fault, even though I keep reassuring him that it isn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe site\u2019s secure,\u201d he says. \u201cMitchell\u2019s on patrol in the yard with Echo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Jeff heads to the kitchen door and checks it, then goes to the window and runs a finger along the glass. He murmurs into his headpiece, then goes back to check the door again. God, he\u2019s making me edgy.</p> <p>\u201cThe kitchen\u2019s fine!\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re safe! Look, Jeff, my dad just took off. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019ta happened,\u201d he says heavily. \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go, and maybe we\u2019ll find something out.\u201d I push my chair back with a scrape. \u201cSuze, I\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes are fixed resolutely beyond me. Her jaw is tight and her hair is lank. I know she didn\u2019t get any sleep at all.</p><p>\u201cLook, Suze,\u201d I say tentatively. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t even answer. I can see her mind grimly whirring round all the worst possibilities. There\u2019s nothing more I can say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cWell ...

It airs in, like, ten minutes! I\u2019m totally psyched. Aran was just on the phone. He was, like, \u2018This is huge already, babe.\u2019 I mean, have you seen the hits on YouTube? And that\u2019s just the trailer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Right.\u201d I try to wrench my head away from Dad and into the world of Sage. \u201cYes, I saw that. It\u2019s phenomenal!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true; it is pretty phenomenal. There have been wall-to-wall trailers for the last two days for what they\u2019re calling The Big Showdown: Lois Meets Sage. They were on this morning while I was making coffee, but we turned the telly off because it was all getting a bit too much.</p><p>(Well, in fact, Suze threw her phone at the telly and yelled, \u201cShut up! Shut up!\u201d So I zapped it off.)</p> <p>\u201cAre you watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be!\u201d I say, hastily turning on the in-car TV. \u201cI\u2019m in the car, but I\u2019ll be watching it in here. I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re amazing in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awesome,\u201d says Sage in satisfaction. \u201cSo the other thing is, I had this great idea for my premiere outfit tonight. You have to come over and help me with it. Where are you now? Could you be here in, like, fifteen minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes?\u201d I stare at the phone. \u201cWell ... no. Sorry. I have some stuff I have to do this morning. It\u2019s kind of a family emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re styling me!\u201d says Sage, sounding affronted.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m coming round later, remember? Can we discuss it then?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence down the phone. Oh God. Is Sage pissed off?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the idea?\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI bet it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. I have to show you.\u201d She gives a huffy little sigh. \u201cOK, if you really can\u2019t come now, I guess we\u2019ll meet later. You\u2019ll be, like, totally oh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Sounds amazing. I\u2019ll see you later. OK?\u201d</p><p>I ring off and turn up the volume on the TV. It\u2019s showing a weather report for the East Coast, and I find myself wondering if Dad and Tarkie could have got on a plane.</p><p>No. They wouldn\u2019t do that. Would they?</p><p>Even though I\u2019m sure both Mum and Suze are overreacting to the situation, I feel a little chill. People you love shouldn\u2019t disappear, simply telling you vaguely they have \u201csomething to put right.\u201d They shouldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>Suddenly I realize the Camberly show is starting. The familiar titles are zooming over the screen, and shots of Camberly in evening dress and running along the beach with her dog are flash-cutting with shots of her famous white house, where it\u2019s \u201cfilmed.\u201d (It\u2019s really filmed in L.A., on a studio set. Everyone knows that.) Normally there are several sections in the show. There\u2019s an interview and a song and a cooking slot, and often a competition. But today is a \u201cspecial.\u201d It\u2019s all about Lois and Sage. As soon as the music dies away, the camera focuses on Camberly, looking somber, and a backdrop of Sage\u2019s and Lois\u2019s faces blown up, glaring at each other. It all looks very dramatic.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to my home,\u201d Camberly says in serious tones. \u201cAnd to a unique and momentous hour-long special. Sage Seymour. Lois Kellerton. Meeting for the first time since their infamous encounter at the ASAs. We\u2019ll be back after this.\u201d Music plays again, and the titles swoosh around the screen. I stare at it in slight outrage. An ad break already? I will never get used to American telly. Yesterday I started watching an advert and it went on for twenty minutes. Twenty whole minutes!</p><p>(It was quite good, though. It was all about this brilliant barbecue grill thing, which gives you a \u201crestaurant quality finish\u201d with none of the calories. I wrote the number down, actually.)</p><p>I sit impatiently through a zillion ads for pain relievers and then watch as Sage appears on the screen, sitting on the sofa with a rapt Camberly. At first it\u2019s very boring, because she gets Sage to tell her exactly what happened at the awards ceremony, in every detail, and shows the video clip about ten times, and asks Sage over and over, \u201cAnd how did that make you feel?\u201d</p><p>Sage is acting devastated. She keeps using phrases like \u201cI felt so betrayed\u201d and \u201cI just don\u2019t understand Lois\u201d and \u201cWhy me?\u201d in a broken voice. I think she\u2019s overdoing it myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then it\u2019s another ad break\u2014and then it\u2019s time for Lois\u2019s appearance. And even though I know they\u2019ve cooked all this up, my heart is beating faster at the thought of them together on the sofa. God knows what the American public is feeling. This really is a TV event.</p><p>Suddenly we\u2019re back in the studio, and Lois walks onto the set, wearing skinny cigarette pants and a billowy white silk shirt and ... holding the clutch bag! I can\u2019t help gasping, and Jeff looks in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cJust watching the telly.\u201d</p><p>Sage and Lois are staring at each other like two hostile cats, with a kind of crackling, unsmiling tension. The cameras keep switching from close-up to close-up. Camberly is watching silently, her hands to her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHave your clutch bag.\u201d Lois throws the bag down on the floor. Camberly jumps in shock and I make a squeak of protest. She\u2019ll damage the diamant\u00e9!</p><p>\u201cYou think I want it?\u201d says Sage. \u201cYou can keep it.\u201d</p><p>Hang on. I\u2019m a bit offended here. That\u2019s a really nice clutch bag. Which, by the way, no one has ever paid me for.</p><p>\u201cYou two girls haven\u2019t seen each other since the awards ceremony,\u201d says Camberly, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Sage, not taking her eyes off Lois.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I want to see her?\u201d chimes in Lois.</p><p>And suddenly I lose patience with the whole thing. It\u2019s so unreal. They\u2019re going to fight and be mean and then they\u2019ll probably hug each other and cry at the end.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d says Jeff, pulling the car over. \u201cYou wanna keep watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say, and switch off the TV. I look out of the window, trying to get my bearings. There are the galvanized gates. There are the rows of mobile homes. OK. Let\u2019s hope I find some answers here.</p><p>\u201cThis is really the address?\u201d says Jeff, who is peering out of the window dubiously. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, this is it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s advisable I come along with you,\u201d he says firmly, and gets out of the car.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jeff,\u201d I say, as he opens my car door.</p><p>I\u2019m going to miss Jeff.</p><p>This time I walk straight to trailer 431, without looking right or left. The eviction notice is still on the door, and the trailer opposite is shut up. I can see my card still stuck in the window frame. Great. Clearly that woman didn\u2019t pass it on.</p><p>I walk past an old man sitting outside a trailer about three along, but I don\u2019t feel like approaching him. Partly because he keeps giving me funny looks, and partly because he has a massive dog on a chain. I can\u2019t see any neighbors other than him. So what do I do now? I sit down on a plastic chair, which seems to be randomly in the middle of the path, and heave a big sigh.</p><p>\u201cAre you visiting with someone?\u201d says Jeff, who has followed me without comment.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, yes, but he\u2019s been evicted.\u201d I gesture at the notice on the door. \u201cI want to find out where he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Jeff digests this for a few moments.</p> <p>\u201cI was hoping to speak to a neighbor,\u201d I explain. \u201cI thought I could get a forwarding address or something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says Jeff again, then nods at the trailer. \u201cHe might be in there. Back door\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>What? That hadn\u2019t even occurred to me. Maybe he\u2019s come back. Maybe Dad\u2019s in there with him! In excitement, I hurry to the trailer door and bang on it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I call. \u201cBrent? Are you there?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, then the door swings open. But it\u2019s not Brent. It\u2019s a girl. She\u2019s a little older than me, I\u2019d say, with wavy sandy hair and a freckled, weather-beaten face. She has pale-blue eyes and a nose ring and an unfriendly expression. I can smell toast and hear Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBeat It\u201d playing faintly in the background.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cSorry to disturb you.\u201d</p><p>A little dog comes running out of the door and licks my toes. He\u2019s a Jack Russell, and he\u2019s wearing the cutest lime-green harness.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous!\u201d I say, and squat to pat him. \u201cWhat\u2019s he called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScooter.\u201d The girl doesn\u2019t unbend a millimeter. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d I rise up and give her a polite smile. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d I extend a hand and she cautiously takes mine. \u201cI\u2019m looking for someone called Brent Lewis. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I exhale in relief. \u201cGreat! Well, he was a friend of my father, and I think my dad\u2019s gone off looking for him, but I don\u2019t know where\u2019s he\u2019s headed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as though I\u2019ve said the Antichrist.

What have I said?</p><p>\u201cYour dad is Graham Bloomwood?\u201d she says at last.</p> <p>\u201cYes! Do you know him?\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you\u2019ve come here to gloat? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>My jaw falls open a little.

Him.\u201d I cough, feeling a bit embarrassed. \u201cHe\u2019s my bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bodyguard.\u201d She gives a bitter, incredulous laugh and shakes her head. \u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>It figures? Why does it figure? She doesn\u2019t know anything about me\u2014</p><p>Oh, she\u2019s recognized me! I knew I was famous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just been since the whole ridiculous business on TV,\u201d I say, with a modest sigh. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in my position, you have to hire security. I mean, I\u2019m sure you can imagine what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>She might want an autograph, it occurs to me. I really should get some of those big shiny pictures to carry about with me.</p> <p>\u201cI could sign a napkin,\u201d I suggest. \u201cOr a piece of paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d says the girl, her tone unchanged. \u201cI don\u2019t watch TV. Are you a big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, feeling suddenly stupid. \u201cRight. I thought ... well ... no. I mean, kind of ...\u201d This conversation is excruciating. \u201cLook, can we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk?\u201d she echoes, so sarcastically that I wince. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit late to talk, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in bewilderment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry ... I don\u2019t follow. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ.\u201d She closes her eyes briefly and takes a deep breath. \u201cLook, just take your little bodyguard and your little designer shoes and your little prinky prinky voice and go. OK?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m feeling more and more upset by this conversation. Why is she so angry? I don\u2019t even know her. Why did she say I\u2019d come here to gloat?</p><p>And what prinky prinky voice? I don\u2019t have a prinky prinky voice.</p> <p>\u201cLook.\u201d I try to stay calm. \u201cPlease, can we start again? All I want is to track down my father. I\u2019m quite worried about him, and this is the only place I can think of, and\u2014\u201d I break off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I haven\u2019t even introduced myself properly. My name\u2019s Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She looks at me strangely. \u201cOf course it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca too. We\u2019re all called Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as though time stands still. I gape at her blankly for a few seconds, trying to process her words. But they make no sense. We\u2019re all called Rebecca.</p><p>We\u2019re all ... what?</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cYou knew that.\u201d She seems puzzled by my reaction. \u201cYou had to know that.\u201d</p><p>Am I missing something? Have I moved into some weird, parallel universe? Who\u2019s we?</p><p>What the bloody hell is going ON?</p><p>\u201cYour dad did see my dad. Couple days ago.\u201d She gives me a challenging stare. \u201cI guess they had it out at long last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad it out about what?\u201d I say in despair. \u201cWhat? Please tell me!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence. The other Rebecca is just staring at me with narrowed blue eyes, as though she can\u2019t work me out.</p><p>\u201cWhat did your dad tell you about that trip?\u201d she says at last. \u201cThe trip in \u201972.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. I mean, just little stuff. They went to the rodeo, they ate ice cream, my dad got really sunburned....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d She seems incredulous. \u201cSunburn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cWhat else was there to tell? What do you mean, we\u2019re all called Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t know I\u2019m not telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you nothing.\u201d She looks me up and down, and I can feel the contempt in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know where your dad is. Now, fuck off, princess girl.\u201d She picks up the little dog and, to my horror, bangs the trailer door shut. A moment later I can hear the back door being locked too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome back!\u201d I beat furiously on the door. \u201cPlease!

I don\u2019t know what happened!\u201d</p><p>I bang on the door for what seems like forever, but there\u2019s no answer. Suddenly I feel a huge, gentle hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t opening that,\u201d says Jeff kindly. \u201cI say you leave it. I say we go home.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t reply. I stare at the trailer, a painful fullness in my chest. Something happened. And I don\u2019t know what, and the answer\u2019s in there, but I can\u2019t get at it.</p><p>\u201cI say we go home,\u201d repeats Jeff. \u201cNothing you can do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We should go.\u201d</p><p>I follow him past the mobile homes, past the man with the scary dog, out of the gates. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say to Suze. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, full stop.</p> <p>As Jeff starts up the car, the TV comes on, and I\u2019m assailed by the sound of sobbing. Lois and Sage are in each other\u2019s arms on-screen, mascara dripping down both their faces, while Camberly watches, her hands clasped to her mouth in delight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve alwaaaays respected you....\u201d Sage is hiccuping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had such a damaaaaged life,\u201d Lois sobs back.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know that, Lois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will always love yoooooou....\u201d</p><p>They both look absolute wrecks. They must have worn non-waterproof mascara on purpose.</p> <p>Lois cradles Sage\u2019s face between her hands and says tenderly, \u201cYou have a beautiful spirit,\u201d and I can\u2019t help snorting with laughter. Is anyone going to believe in this \u201creconciliation\u201d? I have no idea. And right now I don\u2019t care. All I can think is: Where\u2019s Dad? What\u2019s going on? What on earth is going on?</p><p>When I get back, Suze is out. Presumably she\u2019s with Alicia. Presumably they\u2019re having really long, heartfelt conversations, because Suze can\u2019t talk to me, her oldest friend, who helped her have her first baby; does she remember that? And spent a whole week jiggling him in my arms while Suze slept; does she remember that? Where was Alicia then? She was swigging cocktails and planning how to ruin my life, that\u2019s where she was.</p><p>Anyway. If Suze wants to be best friends with Alicia, then fine. Whatever. Maybe I\u2019ll make friends with Robert Mugabe, to match.</p><p>I leave her a voice mail, giving her the bare bones of what happened, and do the same for Mum. But then I feel at a loss. I can\u2019t just head off randomly in search of Dad. I don\u2019t have a single other clue.</p><p>So at last I pack up my bag and get Jeff to take me to Sage\u2019s house, which is surrounded by paparazzi. (Proper paparazzi, not just Lon and his mates.) As we approach, I realize they won\u2019t be able to see into the blacked-out SUV. I wind down the window and they start snapping away at me inside the car, while I ignore them elegantly and Jeff shouts, \u201cRoll that window up!\u201d (He doesn\u2019t have to be so cross. I only wanted some air.)</p><p>When I finally get inside, the whole place is pumping with music, and there are about ten assistants milling around, making smoothies and telling people on the phone that Sage is not available. Sage herself is dressed in gray leggings and a T-shirt reading SUCK ON THAT and seems totally hyper.</p><p>\u201cSo, wasn\u2019t Camberly awesome?\u201d she says about five times before I can even say hello. \u201cWasn\u2019t it incredible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing! Did you wear non-waterproof mascara on purpose?\u201d I can\u2019t help asking.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d She points her finger at me as though I\u2019ve got an answer correct on a quiz show. \u201cThat was Lois\u2019s idea. The makeup people were all, like, \u2018You might cry, people often do on this show,\u2019 and we were, like, well, so what? We want to be honest, you know.\u201d She blinks at me. \u201cWe want to be truthful. Mascara runs and that\u2019s the truth, and if it\u2019s not your perfect put-together look, then too bad.\u201d</p><p>I clamp my lips together so I won\u2019t laugh. Truthful? Only I can\u2019t say anything because she\u2019s my client, so I just nod earnestly.</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re so right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says in satisfaction. \u201cSo, some dresses arrived. Where did I put them?\u201d</p><p>After some searching, I find a Danny Kovitz box in the corner of the room. It was sent over this morning from Danny\u2019s L.A. showroom and contains three dresses. He\u2019s such a star. (I talked to Adrian at the Danny Kovitz headquarters today. Apparently Danny has checked into The Setai in Miami and says he\u2019s never going anywhere colder than seventy-five degrees again. I never thought Greenland would suit him.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake out the white beaded dress, which is absolutely gorgeous, and head over toward Sage.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing.\u201d I drape the dress over my arm so she can see. \u201cIt\u2019s very fitted, though, so you\u2019ll need to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Sage strokes it. \u201cI\u2019ll try it on in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what was your brilliant idea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d She gives me a secretive smile. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stare at her, disconcerted. \u201cNot at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see it tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tonight?

So, I have some other options as well as the white\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d Sage is distracted by a TV on the wall. \u201cLook! The interview\u2019s on again. Let\u2019s watch it. Hey, guys!\u201d she calls to her assistants. \u201cThe show\u2019s on again! Get popcorn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoo!\u201d shout a couple of assistants. \u201cGo, Sage! Awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me call Lois. Hey, babe,\u201d she says as soon as she\u2019s put through. \u201cWe\u2019re on again. Becky\u2019s here. We\u2019re going to watch it.\u201d She high-fives me as she speaks, and I notice a tongue stud, which wasn\u2019t there before. Is that her new thing?</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d Sage beckons me to her enormous white squashy sofa. \u201cRelax!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I surreptitiously glance at my watch. It\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll watch the show and then we\u2019ll get to work.</p><p>Except we don\u2019t just watch it once, we watch it four times.</p> <p>Each time, Sage keeps up a running commentary, saying things like, \u201cSee how I really nail the emotion here?\u201d and \u201cLois looks so good from that angle,\u201d and once, \u201cWhere did Camberly have her boobs done? They\u2019re pretty great.\u201d Whereupon a young assistant leaps up and says, \u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d and immediately starts tapping at his BlackBerry.</p><p>By the fourth go-round I\u2019m numb with boredom. The weird thing is that if I could see myself, I\u2019d be mad with jealousy. I mean, look at me! Lounging on a squashy white sofa with a movie star ... sipping smoothies ... listening to her little in-jokes ... You\u2019d think it would be paradise. But all I really want to do is go home and see Suze.</p><p>I can\u2019t, though, because we still haven\u2019t got to the clothes. Every time I mention them, Sage says, \u201cSure,\u201d and absently waves a hand at me. I\u2019ve told her about fifty times that I\u2019ll need to go and pick up Minnie from preschool soon and I don\u2019t have all day, but she doesn\u2019t seem to have registered that.</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s go have our nails done!\u201d Sage suddenly gets up from the sofa. \u201cWe have to get to the spa. We all have reservations, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d says an assistant. \u201cWe have the cars waiting outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Sage starts searching around the coffee table. \u201cWhere are my shoes? Did they slide under the sofa? Christopher, find my shoes,\u201d she says prettily to the most handsome of her assistants, and he instantly starts groveling on the floor.</p><p>I\u2019m not following any of this. How can she be going off to a spa?</p><p>\u201cSage?\u201d I try to get her attention. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to decide on your look for tonight? You were going to try on the dresses?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d says Sage vaguely. \u201cWe\u2019ll do that too. We\u2019ll talk about it at the spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t come to the spa,\u201d I say as patiently as I can. \u201cI have to pick up my daughter from her class trip to the Museum of Contemporary Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer kid is so sweet,\u201d Sage announces to her assistants, and they all croon back, \u201cOh, cuuuute!\u201d \u201cAdorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what about the dresses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll try them on myself.\u201d She suddenly seems to focus. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to be there. You did a great job, Becky, thanks! And thank you, Christopher angel!\u201d She slides her pumps on.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t need me? I feel like she\u2019s slapped me in the face.</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t explained each look yet,\u201d I say, bewildered. \u201cI was going to try them on with you, talk you through the accessories, see if we need to alter anything....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d She spritzes herself with scent, then catches my eye. \u201cGo! Have fun with your daughter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d</p><p>If I don\u2019t help her create her look, then I\u2019m not a stylist at all. I\u2019m a delivery girl.</p><p>\u201cYour car will take you, right? See you tonight!\u201d Before I can say anything else, she\u2019s skipped out of the door. I can hear a roar from the paparazzi outside, and the sound of engines, and the general mayhem that surrounds Sage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m alone, apart from a housekeeper, who walks silently around, picking up bowls and brushing popcorn off the sofa. And just for an instant I feel totally deflated. This isn\u2019t how I pictured it at all. I had so many ideas I wanted to share with Sage, yet she doesn\u2019t even seem interested in the clothes.</p><p>But as I pull out my phone and dial Jeff\u2019s number, I force myself to look on the positive side. Come on. It\u2019s all still good. I\u2019ve still been to her house; I\u2019ve still given her the bones of her outfit. When people ask who styled her, she\u2019ll say, \u201cBecky Brandon.\u201d It\u2019s still my big chance. I have to hold on to this. Whatever else is going on, this is still my big Hollywood chance.</p><p>As we approach the house, Lon is still hanging around outside the gates, and he gesticulates wildly at the car. He\u2019s wearing a lime bandanna today and thigh boots.</p><p>\u201cPirate!\u201d cries Minnie, who is clutching the \u201cRothko-inspired\u201d painting she did at the museum. (It\u2019s really good. I\u2019m going to put it in a frame.) \u201cSee pirate!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky!\u201d I can hear him shouting as we drive past. \u201cBecky, wait! Listen! Guess what?\u201d</p><p>The thing about me is I\u2019m a total sucker for anyone who says, \u201cGuess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jeff,\u201d I say, as the gates start opening for us. \u201cStop a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to Lon. That guy.\u201d I point.</p> <p>Jeff halts the car and turns round in his seat. He\u2019s got his \u201cdisappointed\u201d face on.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, we\u2019ve talked about street interactions,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not recommend that you get out of the vehicle at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff, honestly.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s Lon. He\u2019s a fashion student! I mean, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s hiding a gun.\u201d</p><p>OK, saying \u201cgun\u201d was a mistake. At once Jeff stiffens. He\u2019s been on hyper-alert ever since Dad and Tarkie disappeared.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to approach this person,\u201d he says heavily, \u201cI will secure the area first.\u201d</p><p>I want to giggle at his disapproving expression. He\u2019s behaving like he\u2019s some stiff and starchy 1930s butler and I\u2019ve said I want to talk to a tramp.</p> <p>\u201cFine. Secure the area.\u201d</p><p>Jeff gives me another reproachful look, then gets out of the car. The next minute I can see him frisking Lon. Frisking him!</p><p>But Lon doesn\u2019t seem to mind. In fact, his face is all shiny and excited, and I can see him taking pictures of Jeff with his phone. At last Jeff returns to the car and says, \u201cThe area is secure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jeff!\u201d I beam and bound out of the car. \u201cHi, Lon!\u201d I salute him. \u201cHow are you? Nice boots! Sorry about all the security and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine!\u201d says Lon breathlessly. \u201cYour bodyguard is so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really sweet.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cI guess you have to be super-careful of nut jobs,\u201d says Lon reverently. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your guard dog, too, patrolling the grounds and everything?\u201d</p><p>Lon is so starry-eyed, I can\u2019t help blossoming under his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know.\u201d I toss my hair back. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in my position, you have to be careful. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had many attempts on your life?\u201d Lon is agog.</p><p>\u201cEr, not that many. You know. Just the normal amount.\u201d I quickly change the subject. \u201cAnyway, so what did you want to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d Lon nods animatedly. \u201cWe saw your special delivery from Danny Kovitz. The van came earlier, and I got talking to the guy. He works at the showroom. He knew all about it. It\u2019s a dress for you to wear tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny sent over a dress for me?\u201d I\u2019m so touched, I can\u2019t help grinning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the new collection, Trees and Wires? Like, the one that hasn\u2019t even been shown yet?\u201d Lon seems beyond ecstatic. \u201cThe one that Danny said came straight from his soul?\u201d</p><p>All Danny\u2019s recent collections have been called \u201cSomething and Something.\u201d One was Metal and Philosophy. Another was Envy and Scarlet. The fashion journalists and bloggers write screeds on what the titles mean, but if you ask me, he just picks two random words out of the dictionary and chooses two different fonts and calls it meaningful. Not that I\u2019ll say this to Lon, who looks like he\u2019s going to expire with excitement.</p><p>\u201cNo one has seen anything of this collection,\u201d Lon is babbling. \u201cThere are rumors online, but nobody knows anything. So, like, I was wondering, will you wear it tonight? And can we take some pictures? My friends and me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His face is scrunched up in hope and he\u2019s folding his bandanna into ever-decreasing squares.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m leaving at six, but I\u2019ll come out five minutes early and you can all see the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Lon\u2019s face relaxes into a beam. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there!\u201d Already he\u2019s tapping at his phone. \u201cThanks, Becky! You\u2019re the greatest!\u201d</p><p>As we head inside, my spirits are higher than they have been for ages. Danny sent me a dress! I\u2019m going to be a fashion story! Nenita Dietz is bound to be impressed when she sees me. But my momentary euphoria freezes into icy fog as soon as I see Suze. She\u2019s sitting in the kitchen, surrounded by papers on which I can see her scribbled writing. Her hair is shoved into a disheveled knot. I can hear The Little Mermaid playing in the next room and smell toast, which is clearly what she\u2019s given her children for their tea.</p> <p>On the table is a fancy-looking Golden Peace tote bag, which is new. Alicia must have given it to her, as well as that sweatshirt sticking out of it. I know what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s trying to buy Suze\u2019s love.</p><p>\u201cNice bag,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Suze, barely looking up. \u201cSo you\u2019re back.\u201d She sounds accusing, which is hardly fair.</p><p>\u201cI was back earlier,\u201d I reply pointedly. \u201cBut you were out.\u201d With Alicia, I refrain from adding. \u201cAny news?\u201d</p><p>I know there isn\u2019t any news, because I\u2019ve been checking my phone every five minutes, but it\u2019s worth asking anyway.</p> <p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019ve been on the phone to all of Tarkie\u2019s friends, but none of them has any leads. What have you done? Have you spoken to your dad\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the trailer park. I did some investigating there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I got your voice mail.\u201d She stops scribbling and draws her feet up to her chair, hugging her knees. Her face is drawn with worry, and I feel a sudden urge to hug her tight and pat her back, like I would have done any other time. But somehow ... I can\u2019t. Everything feels too stilted between us. \u201cYou met another Rebecca? That\u2019s so strange.\u201d</p><p>I tell her all about the trailer park, and she listens in silence.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s going on with my dad,\u201d I finish. \u201cBut I have no idea what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what does it mean?\u201d Suze rubs her brow. \u201cAnd why has he got Tarquin involved?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cMum will be in the air by now, so I can\u2019t ask her, and anyway, she doesn\u2019t know anything....\u201d I grind to a halt. My attention has been grabbed by something on the kitchen counter. It\u2019s a big box with DANNY KOVITZ printed on the side.</p><p>Obviously my dress isn\u2019t the priority right this second. On the other hand, I can\u2019t wait to see it. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s full-length, or mid-length, or a minidress....</p><p>\u201cI tried the police again,\u201d Suze is saying. \u201cAbsolutely useless! They said I could file a report. What good is a report? I need them out there, searching! They kept saying, \u2018But where would we search, ma\u2019am?\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s for you to find out! Put some detectives on it!\u2019 Then they said, \u2018Could these two gentlemen have just gone on a little trip?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes! They have gone on a trip. That\u2019s the whole point. But we don\u2019t know where!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>As Suze is talking, I edge over to the counter. I lift the lid a little way and hear a rustle of tissue paper. There\u2019s a lovely waft of scent too. Danny always has his clothes sprayed with his signature fragrance before they\u2019re sent out. I push aside the silvery-gray tissue paper and glimpse a shoulder strap made out of linked copper hoops. Wow.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d says Suze tonelessly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I jump and drop the lid. \u201cJust having a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore \u2018essential shopping\u2019 for Sage, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for Sage, it\u2019s for me. I\u2019m wearing it tonight. Danny sent it over specially. It\u2019s from his Trees and Wires collection....\u201d I trail off, registering the sharp silence in the kitchen. Suze is staring at me with a look I can\u2019t quite work out.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to the premiere,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another long silence. The atmosphere is getting edgier and edgier, until I want to scream.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say at last. \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you think I should go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Bex! Do you really have to ask?\u201d Suze\u2019s sudden vehemence takes me by surprise. \u201cYour dad is missing, and Tarkie, too, and you\u2019re going to a bloody premiere? How can you be so selfish? I mean, what kind of priorities do you have?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Resentment is rising inside me. I\u2019m tired of Suze making me feel bad. I\u2019m tired of everyone making me feel bad.</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s disappeared without a trace and taken Tarkie with him!\u201d Suze repeats, still on her tirade. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously some mystery; they could be in big trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what am I supposed to do about it?\u201d I explode. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault if they just took off! I\u2019ve got one chance in Hollywood, Suze, one chance, and this is it! If I don\u2019t grab it, I\u2019ll always regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe red carpets will always be there,\u201d says Suze scathingly.</p> <p>\u201cThe TV interviews won\u2019t always be there! Nenita Dietz won\u2019t always be there! I don\u2019t see why I should just sit around, doing nothing, waiting for news. You can do that if you like. Maybe Alicia could keep you company,\u201d I can\u2019t help adding bitterly. And I grab the Danny Kovitz box and march out of the kitchen before Suze can say anything more.</p><p>As I get ready, there are two voices arguing in my head. One is mine and one is Suze\u2019s. Or maybe one is Luke\u2019s. Or maybe they\u2019re both mine. Oh God, I don\u2019t know whose they are, but by quarter to six I\u2019m sick of both of them. I don\u2019t want to have to think about whether I\u2019m doing the right thing. I just want to do it.</p><p>I stare at myself boldly in the mirror and adopt a red-carpet pose. I look good. I think. I\u2019ve put on a bit too much makeup, but I don\u2019t want to look washed out next to all the celebrities, do I? And Danny\u2019s dress is genius. It\u2019s short and slinky, in a flattering black fabric, and the single shoulder strap is made of a mass of unpolished copper hoops. (They\u2019re digging into my skin a bit, and they\u2019ll probably leave marks, but I don\u2019t care.) I\u2019m wearing the spikiest-ever black stilettos, and my bag is a little copper-framed clutch (it was in the box with the dress). I definitely look like a top celebrity stylist.</p><p>Adrenaline is pumping through my body. I feel like I\u2019m about to go into a boxing ring. This is it. This is it. As I\u2019m carefully painting my lips, my phone rings, and I put it on speaker.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Aran\u2019s voice fills the room. \u201cPsyched for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely!\u201d I say. \u201cCan\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I just wanted to let you know the rundown. You are in demand tonight, girl.\u201d He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll be talking to NBC, CNN, Mixmatch\u2014that\u2019s a fashion channel ...\u201d</p><p>As he continues, I can barely concentrate. It all seems so surreal. I\u2019m going to be on NBC!</p><p>\u201cSo just stay bright and positive,\u201d Aran is saying. \u201cOoze your British charm and you\u2019ll do great. See you later!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you there!\u201d I give myself a final spray of perfume and look at my reflection. British charm. How do I ooze British charm?</p> <p>\u201cCor, strike a light, guv\u2019nor!\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>Hmm. Maybe not.</p><p>As I walk downstairs, I can hear Suze approaching. I start prickling with defiance and clench my bag tight. She appears in the hall, holding Minnie on her hip, and looks me up and down dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d she says flatly.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I match her tone.</p><p>\u201cThin.\u201d She manages to make this sound like an accusation.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I take out my phone and check for texts. There\u2019s one from Jeff, telling me he\u2019s waiting outside, but nothing from Luke. Not that I was really expecting it, but still my heart drops in disappointment. \u201cI\u2019ll have my phone on the whole time,\u201d I add. \u201cIn case you ... you know. Hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, enjoy yourself.\u201d She hoists Minnie to the other hip and I glare at her resentfully. She\u2019s only carrying Minnie to make me feel bad. She could easily put her down on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cHere are the details of where I am.\u201d I hand her a printed sheet. \u201cThanks for looking after Minnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, any time.\u201d Her voice is so sarcastic I wince. She doesn\u2019t mean it, I tell myself. She\u2019s just stressed out about Dad and Tarkie.</p><p>I mean, I\u2019m stressed out too. But there\u2019s a bigger emotion overriding the stress. It\u2019s excitement. NBC ... red carpet ... exclusive designer outfit ... How could I not be excited? How can Suze not understand?</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you have the time of your life,\u201d she says as I open the door.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I say mutinously. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>I step outside and hear a roar from outside the gates. I stop dead and blink in astonishment. Oh my God. Lon must have brought his entire class to see the dress. There\u2019s a whole crowd of them clustered together, pointing cameras and phones at me through the iron bars of the gates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOpen the gates,\u201d I instruct Jeff, and I approach the throng, waving graciously, feeling like a princess.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Lon is calling.</p><p>\u201cBeckeeeee!\u201d shouts a girl in a black shift dress. \u201cOver here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow does the dress feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get a back view?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Danny tell you anything special about the dress? What was his inspiration?\u201d</p><p>As I pose, looking this way and that, I keep darting glances back at the house. I hope Suze is watching out of the window and can hear all the yelling. Then maybe she\u2019ll understand.</p><p>At last everyone has taken their photos and I\u2019ve done two little interviews about Danny for fashion blogs, and I\u2019m in the car, on the way to the premiere. I feel a bit giddy. It\u2019s going to be brilliant. It already is brilliant.</p> <p>The premiere is being held at El Capitan, and I know we\u2019re getting near from the noise. The thumping music is practically rocking the SUV, and there are shouts from the crowd, and as we slow down, someone bangs on the car, which makes me jump, startled.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d says Jeff at once.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say, exhilarated. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty big, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The film is an action movie about two circus performers who foil a terrorist attack. Apparently they use all the animals and their circus skills to help them, and it was nearly derailed when an elephant went a bit crazy during the filming.</p><p>Jeff has to show all kinds of passes to officials, and as he does so, I peer out of the window. I can see faces pressing up against the glass, trying to see through the tinted windows. They probably think I\u2019m Tom Cruise or something.</p><p>\u201cJeez!\u201d Jeff says, trying to negotiate a path through the hubbub. \u201cPlace is chaos. You wanna go through with this?\u201d</p> <p>Honestly. Not him too.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say firmly. I reach in my bag for my dad\u2019s autograph book. I\u2019ve brought it with me and I\u2019m determined to get him as many autographs as I can. Then Suze won\u2019t be able to call me selfish.</p><p>We\u2019re in a queue of cars, and I can see how the process works. The car pulls up to the dropping-off point, and the door opens and the celebrity gets out and the crowd goes wild. There are two limos ahead of us. Soon it\u2019ll be me!</p><p>\u201cSo, you text as soon as you need to get out of here,\u201d says Jeff. \u201cOr call. Any kind of trouble, you just call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise, and check my reflection one last time. My heart is starting to beat fast. This is really it. I need to get out of the car elegantly, I need to stay calm, I need to remember who made my dress....</p><p>\u201cOK, you\u2019re on.\u201d Jeff pulls up and a guy in a headset yanks open the door and I\u2019m out. I\u2019m standing on the red carpet. On the proper red carpet. I\u2019m one of them!</p><p>I\u2019m so transfixed by the atmosphere, I don\u2019t move for a moment. The music is even louder now that I\u2019m outside. It\u2019s all so big and bright and spectacular. The entrance to El Capitan is done up like a circus big top, and there are circus performers wandering about everywhere. There are fire-eaters and jugglers, and a contortionist girl in a jeweled bikini, and a ringmaster cracking his whip. And there\u2019s an elephant! An actual elephant, walking back and forth with its trainer. The crowd is going wild over some young guy in jeans, who I think is in a band, and I can see Hilary Duff about ten yards away ... and is that Orlando Bloom signing autographs?</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d A girl in a black trouser suit approaches me with a businesslike smile. \u201cI\u2019m Charlotte. I\u2019ll be escorting you on the red carpet. Let\u2019s keep moving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Charlotte!\u201d I beam at her as we shake hands. \u201cIsn\u2019t this amazing? Look at the jugglers! Look at the elephant!\u201d</p><p>Charlotte seems puzzled.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Cameras are flashing everywhere as we proceed along. I\u2019ve been practicing the proper film-star pose for days, only now I have to walk too. I never practiced film-star walking. Damn. How do they do it?</p><p>I think they kind of glide seamlessly along. I\u2019ll glide too. Perhaps with my legs slightly bent?</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Charlotte gives me a strange look, and I hastily straighten my legs. Maybe that\u2019s not such a good look. \u201cSo, we have your photo-call and then your interviews....\u201d She glances at her watch and consults her clipboard. She seems totally unimpressed by the elephant, or the fire-eaters, or the celebrities. In fact, she seems unimpressed by the whole event. \u201cSo, you\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>With no warning, she pushes me into an empty patch of red carpet, in front of a bank of photographers, who all start shouting, \u201cBecky! Becky, over here!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hastily, I get into position. Legs crossed, chin tucked, radiant celebrity-type smile ...</p><p>I\u2019m waiting to feel the glee I did before\u2014but it\u2019s weird. I feel a bit nothingy. And then, almost before they\u2019ve started, it\u2019s over, and Charlotte is tugging me along again, toward the rows of TV cameras.</p><p>It was more fun when it was Suze and me, giggling at the whole thing, flashes through my mind.</p><p>No. Don\u2019t be stupid. This is fantastic. I\u2019m a proper celeb! I\u2019m part of it! I\u2019ve loads to say about Sage\u2019s outfits, and my own dress, and fashion.... I can\u2019t wait.</p> <p>\u201cSo, the first interview is with Fox News,\u201d says Charlotte in my ear, and pushes me toward a TV camera. I quickly straighten my hair, and hope my lipstick hasn\u2019t come off on my teeth, and put on my brightest, most intelligent expression.</p><p>\u201cHello, Betty!\u201d says a very coiffed woman in a trouser suit. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted you could join us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I smile. \u201cAlthough actually it\u2019s Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty,\u201d she continues as though she didn\u2019t hear, \u201cyou are, of course, the witness to Lois Kellerton\u2019s shoplifting incident. Have you seen Lois since then?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m flummoxed for a moment. What do I say? I can\u2019t reply, Yes, I broke into her house and found her plotting how to fool the American public.</p> <p>\u201cUm ... no,\u201d I say feebly.</p><p>\u201cIf you see her tonight, what will you be saying to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be wishing her well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely! Well, thank you, Betty! Enjoy the movie!\u201d</p><p>To my astonishment, Charlotte grabs my arm and shunts me onward. That was it? That was the interview? Don\u2019t they want to know what I do for a living? Don\u2019t they want to know who my dress is by?</p><p>\u201cAnd the next one is TXCN,\u201d says Charlotte in my ear.</p> <p>Another TV camera is pointing at my face, and a guy with red hair grins at me.</p><p>\u201cHi there, Betty!\u201d he says in a Southern accent. \u201cHow\u2019re you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Becky,\u201d I say politely.</p><p>\u201cSo, shoplifting. Is it a crime or is it a disease?\u201d</p><p>What? How on earth would I know? I stammer some answer, feeling like a total moron, and before I know it, I\u2019m moving on to the next interview. That guy wants to know if Lois put up a fight when I confronted her, and the next woman asks me if I think Lois might have shoplifted because she was pregnant. I haven\u2019t had a chance to mention my dress or the fact I\u2019ve styled Sage. And they all call me Betty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Becky!\u201d I exclaim to Charlotte as we\u2019re moving on. \u201cNot Betty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, unmoved. \u201cI guess it might have been written wrong in the press pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I stop, mid-sentence.</p> <p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>I was going to say, But don\u2019t they all know my name? Looking at Charlotte\u2019s expression, though, I change my mind.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m not quite as famous as I thought I was. I feel a bit crushed, even though I think I manage to hide it quite well. Charlotte leads me on to another reporter, who shoves a radio mic in my face, and I\u2019ve just babbled a few lines about how I\u2019m really glad that Lois and Sage have reconciled and, yes, I did see the interview\u2014when there\u2019s the most almighty roar and I can\u2019t help looking round.</p><p>It\u2019s Sage.</p><p>She\u2019s standing in front of the photographers and they are going wild. I mean, nuts. The level of shouting is going up and up and up, and the flashes are like some kind of lightning storm, and the crowd is surging in her direction, pressing against the metal barriers and holding out phones and autograph books.</p><p>Sage looks absolutely delighted. She\u2019s posing in Danny\u2019s white dress, which looks sensational, and she\u2019s flicking her hair around and blowing kisses to the crowd. And then it happens. She blows a particularly energetic kiss\u2014and somehow the side seam of her dress comes apart. I watch in shock as the whole thing unravels, exposing the entire side of her body.</p><p>Sage gives a huge gasp and clutches at the dress, and the photographers nearly have fits trying to get a shot of her.</p><p>I\u2019m slack-jawed in horror as white beads start rolling all over the red carpet. That dress was fine this afternoon. It was fine. She must have doctored it. That was her secret plan which she didn\u2019t want to tell me. A deliberate wardrobe malfunction. A girl in a black trouser suit is trying to offer Sage a coat, but she\u2019s ignoring the offer and beaming at the cameras.</p><p>Danny\u2019s going to kill me. He\u2019s got a particular sore spot about his clothes falling apart, ever since an unfortunate incident in Barneys when he hadn\u2019t sewn up his seams properly. He\u2019ll ask me why I didn\u2019t make sure she was dressed properly, and I\u2019ll have to say she wouldn\u2019t let me near her, and he\u2019ll say I should have insisted.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t tell anyone I\u2019m Sage\u2019s stylist now. It hits me with a fresh blow. They\u2019ll laugh at me. My whole plan is ruined.</p><p>Charlotte has been listening to her earpiece and now looks up.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, you\u2019re done,\u201d she says with a professional smile. \u201cYou can go in now. Enjoy the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d she says politely.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought I was doing loads of interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plan changed. If you make your way into the movie theater, someone will show you to your seat. Have a good evening!\u201d</p><p>I feel a pang of dismay. I don\u2019t want to go into the movie theater. Once I go in, it\u2019s over.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay out here a bit longer?\u201d I say. \u201cI want to ... you know. Soak it all up.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte looks at me as though I\u2019m crazy. \u201cSure.\u201d She shrugs and turns away, leaving me alone. I feel a tiny bit awkward, with nothing to do, but I determinedly swivel round and survey the rows of surging people and TV cameras and celebrities talking to interviewers. Come on, Becky. Here I am on the red carpet. Maybe Sage has derailed my plan a little, but I can still enjoy myself. I can still be positive.</p><p>The entire lineup of Heaven Sent 7 has just appeared on the red carpet, and a bunch of teenage girls is screaming hysterically. I can\u2019t help feeling a thrill. They\u2019re huge! I so want to share this with someone. I automatically pull out my phone and start to text\u2014and then stop, mid-word. I can\u2019t share it with Luke. Or Suze. Or Mum.</p><p>Or Dad, obviously.</p><p>Or ... anyone.</p><p>Without meaning to, I heave a miserable sigh, then immediately plaster a wide smile on to compensate. I can\u2019t be sighing on the red carpet. That\u2019s a ridiculous idea! It\u2019s all good. It\u2019s all fab. It\u2019s\u2014</p><p>Oh, there\u2019s Aran, looking immaculate in a black tuxedo and open-collared blue shirt. Feeling a surge of relief, I hurry over to him. His hands are in his pockets and he\u2019s watching Sage, with that wry, detached expression he has. Sage has found a little mini trench coat from somewhere and has put it on over her dress and is talking eagerly to a queue of interviewers.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Becky.\u201d Aran kisses me lightly on each cheek. \u201cHaving a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say automatically. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough did you see Sage\u2019s dress? It totally collapsed.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cBelieve me, I saw that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was lent that dress by a friend of mine. He\u2019s a really famous designer. And she ruined it on purpose.\u201d I\u2019m trying not to sound accusing, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Aran winces. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure we can figure out some sort of compensation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the money! It\u2019s just so inconsiderate. And now I can\u2019t let anyone know I\u2019m her stylist. I mean, that was the point of tonight\u2014to launch myself as a stylist! I sourced her that dress and she would have looked amazing, but then she goes and deliberately sabotages it....\u201d My voice is trembling. I think I\u2019m more upset than I quite realized.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Aran surveys me as though he\u2019s working something out. \u201cDid you meet Nenita yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll fix that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Thanks.\u201d To my dismay, a tear has come to one of my eyes. I wipe it hastily away and smile, but Aran has noticed.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d I gulp. \u201cNot really. My dad\u2019s gone missing and I had a row with Luke, and then I had one with my best friend too.... No one gets it. This.\u201d I spread my arms around.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t surprise me,\u201d says Aran.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens. You\u2019re not a civilian anymore, remember?\u201d</p><p>He sounds totally unmoved, and I suddenly feel a pang of frustration at his easygoing, Teflon manner. If the world ended, he\u2019d probably just shrug and say, That\u2019s the way it rolls.</p><p>And what did he mean, You don\u2019t surprise me?</p><p>\u201cLet me find Nenita.\u201d He pats me on the shoulder.</p><p>As Aran heads off, I look around again, trying to savor the experience, but suddenly I\u2019m finding it a bit jarring. Everything\u2019s so bright. The white smiles, the cameras flashing, the sequins and jewels and shrieking. It\u2019s like even the air is alive with electricity. My hair is prickling with it, and my leg is tingling....</p><p>Oh. Actually, that\u2019s my phone buzzing. I grab it out of my clutch, and it\u2019s Suze. I feel a dart of terror and jab the ANSWER button. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs everything OK?\u201d I demand. \u201cHas anything happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Bex.\u201d Suze sounds despairing, and I feel a lurch of fright. \u201cAlicia\u2019s found out some information. They\u2019ve gone off with Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce?\u201d I stare at the phone, not quite understanding. \u201cBryce from Golden Peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad had some mission and he asked Tarkie to help him carry it out. And Tarkie asked Bryce to come with them. Bryce! Alicia reckons he\u2019s just after our money.

We will. Suze, just try to get as much information as you can....\u201d She\u2019s trying to say something else, but I can\u2019t make it out. Her voice is crackling and breaking up. \u201cSuze?\u201d</p><p>My phone goes silent and I stare at it in dismay. Bryce. Tarquin. My dad. In the middle of nowhere. What\u2019s Mum going to say? What are we going to do?</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Aran is at my side again. \u201cLet me take you to meet Nenita.\u201d His eyes twinkle. \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty big deal in your world, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm ... yes. Massive.\u201d In a daze, I follow him across the red carpet, stumbling slightly in my heels. This is the biggest moment of my career. Meeting Nenita Dietz. I have to put my personal life aside. I have to focus.</p><p>Nenita Dietz is holding forth to a group of people, and we wait patiently at the side until she pauses. She looks amazing. She\u2019s in a massive blue fur coat and spiky metallic boots. Her long, dark wavy hair is shining with red and gold highlights under the spotlights, and she must be wearing at least three pairs of false eyelashes. From here she looks like a fairy princess.</p><p>\u201cNenita Dietz.\u201d Aran says pleasantly. \u201cLet me present Becky Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d</p><p>As I take her hand, I feel like I\u2019m meeting the queen. I mean, she is the queen of Hollywood stylists.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I gabble nervously. \u201cI love your work. Actually, my background\u2019s fashion too. I was a personal shopper at Barneys and I\u2019d love to get into styling and I\u2019m such an admirer of yours. Especially of Clover. The clothes were exquisite.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve mentioned Clover because it\u2019s a very low-budget film that she did a few years ago, which most people haven\u2019t even heard of, and I\u2019m hoping to get some brownie points. But Nenita doesn\u2019t seem interested in my opinion of Clover.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She points at me with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the young woman who saw Lois stealing and told the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. I mean, no. I only told one person ... or maybe two....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois is a wonderful girl,\u201d she says with emphasis. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d Her words feel like a slap, and I start backward.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cAnd I honestly didn\u2019t tell the world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bring bad karma into your life, you realize that?\u201d As she leans forward, I can see that her eyes are all yellowed, and her hands are a lot older than her face. She actually looks quite intimidating.</p><p>\u201cLois\u2019s doing fine, Nenita,\u201d says Aran. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad karma.\u201d She fixes me with her yellow gaze and jabs a finger at me again. \u201cBad karma into your life.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m trying not to recoil in horror. I feel like she\u2019s putting a curse on me.</p><p>\u201cAlso, your dress is dated,\u201d she adds disdainfully, and I feel a prickle of outrage on Danny\u2019s behalf. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d she says, as though bestowing upon me a massive honor, \u201cI can see that you, young woman, are like me. When you really want something, you have to have it.\u201d Her eyes run appraisingly over me again. \u201cYou may call me.\u201d</p><p>She hands me a silver-edged card with a telephone number on it, and Aran raises his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Becky!\u201d he murmurs. \u201cNice job!\u201d</p><p>I stare down at the card, feeling a bit dizzy. I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve actually made contact with Nenita Dietz.</p><p>The crowd is moving toward the movie theater entrance, surging around us, and a bulky man bumps into me, causing me to drop my bag. As I stand, I see I\u2019ve been split up from Nenita and Aran, and the crush is increasing. Girls in black suits are circulating, telling everyone that the movie will start soon; could they please take their seats. Feeling a bit like a zombie, I follow them in. The foyer is crowded with people and cameras and journalists, and I just let the throng propel me forward. A pleasant young man shows me to a seat in the auditorium, where I find a complimentary bottle of water and some popcorn and a circus-themed goody bag. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m here! I\u2019m one of the in crowd! I\u2019m in a top seat at a premiere! I have Nenita Dietz\u2019s card and an invitation to call her!</p><p>So ... why do I feel so hollow? What\u2019s wrong?</p><p>My leather seat seems chilly, and the air-conditioning is making me shiver. As music starts blasting through the speakers, I jump. This should be the biggest treat ever, I keep telling myself. Suze\u2019s voice is ringing in my ears, I hope you have the time of your life, and my own defiant reply, I will.</p><p>But the truth is: I\u2019m not. I\u2019m sitting in a cold, dark room full of strangers, about to watch a movie I don\u2019t want to see, without any friends or family to share it with. I\u2019m not famous. Everyone was calling me Betty. I\u2019m not Betty; I\u2019m Becky.</p> <p>I finger Nenita\u2019s card to reassure myself. But even that feels toxic in my fingers. Do I want to work with that scary witch? Do I want to be her? I feel as though I\u2019ve reached the oasis mirage in the desert. I\u2019m scooping up sand and I\u2019m telling myself it\u2019s fresh and pure water ... but it\u2019s not.</p><p>I\u2019m breathing harder and harder; my thoughts are whirling round my head; I\u2019m gripping the armrests of my seat until my fingers hurt. And suddenly I\u2019ve had enough. I can\u2019t stay here. I don\u2019t want to be here. I have other, far more important things in my life than a red carpet and celebrities. I have my family and my friends and a problem to sort out and a husband to win back and a best friend to help. That\u2019s what I have. And I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken me so long to see that.</p><p>I have to leave. Right now.</p><p>Muttering apologies to the people around me, I get up and make my way to the side of the auditorium. The seats are full by now and a man in a dinner jacket has just started making a speech at the front, and all the attendants are giving me odd looks ... but I don\u2019t care. I need to get out. I need to talk to Suze as soon as I can. She probably hates me. I don\u2019t blame her. I hate me too.</p><p>Nenita is still standing in the lobby with Aran and a few others, and as I look at her anew, I feel a sudden revulsion. No, worse: outrage. How dare she try to curse me? How dare she dis Danny? As she\u2019s turning away to enter the auditorium, I tap her on the shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me, Nenita,\u201d I say, my voice shaking slightly, \u201cI\u2019d just like to rebut a couple of things you said. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have betrayed Lois\u2014but you should know, she isn\u2019t exactly the girl you think she is. Second, I reckon people who try to give other people bad karma get bad karma themselves. Third, my dress is not dated. Danny Kovitz is a very talented designer and all the young fashion bloggers are going wild over it, so maybe if you don\u2019t like it, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s dated.\u201d</p><p>I hear a couple of gasps from Nenita\u2019s acolytes. But I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m on a roll.</p><p>\u201cAs for us being similar ...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cYou\u2019re right. When I know what I want in life, I go after it.\u201d I look around at the PR girls; the cameras; the rows of glossy Big Top goody bags with striped handles, waiting to be collected. I would have gone wild about those goody bags, once upon a time. But now it feels as though they\u2019re somehow contaminated. \u201cAnd the truth is\u2014I don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d says Aran, with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it, Aran.\u201d I look him square in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t want the fame and I don\u2019t want the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t overreact!\u201d He puts a hand on my arm. \u201cNenita was joking about your dress.\u201d</p> <p>Is that all he thinks I care about? My dress?</p><p>But then ... why wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Suddenly I can see myself as everyone else has seen me over the last few weeks. And it\u2019s not a great sight. I have a horrible thickness in my throat, and I can feel tears rising. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m losing it in front of Nenita Dietz.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about my dress,\u201d I say, as calmly as I can, and shake off his arm. \u201cBye, Aran.\u201d</p><p>A bunch of black-suited girls are gossiping in a clutch by the doors, and as I approach, one springs to life.</p><p>\u201cDid you leave the movie already? Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I attempt a smile. \u201cBut I need to go. It\u2019s an emergency. I\u2019m going to call my driver.\u201d</p><p>I fumble for my phone and text a message to Jeff:</p> <p>Can we go now? Thx love Becky x</p><p>I stand awkwardly by the doors for a while, wondering where Jeff will pull up\u2014and then I can\u2019t stand waiting any longer. I\u2019ll go out and see if I can spot the car.</p><p>I push the doors open and head back out onto the red carpet. It\u2019s empty now, littered with a couple of discarded programs and a Coke can and a cardigan that someone must have put down. I can see some white beads from Sage\u2019s dress still glimmering on the red pile. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to explain that to Danny. It was hand-sewn. It must have taken ages to make. All ruined in an instant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And as I look at the beads, my spirits plunge further. I feel like everything has been ruined tonight. My stupid Hollywood dreams, my plan to be a celebrity, my friendship with Suze\u2014I feel a fresh crush of pain and take a deep, shaky breath. I need to hold it together. I need to find Jeff. I need to ...</p><p>Wait.</p><p>I gulp and stare, unable to move. I can\u2019t believe it.</p><p>Coming up the red carpet\u2014the empty red carpet\u2014is Luke. He\u2019s walking steadily but purposefully, and his eyes are fixed on mine. He\u2019s wearing his dark Armani overcoat, and I can see that underneath he\u2019s in black tie.</p> <p>As he gets near, I start to tremble. His face is taut and stern, giving nothing away. There are tiny shadows under his eyes, and as he reaches me, he doesn\u2019t smile. For one awful moment I think he\u2019s come here to divorce me.</p><p>\u201cI thought you went to New York,\u201d I falter, my voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He nods gravely. \u201cI did. And then I turned straight round and came back again. Becky, I behaved atrociously. I\u2019m sorry. To you and to my mother. It was unforgivable behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t!\u201d I say at once, flooded with relief.</p><p>\u201cYou have every right to be angry with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Honestly, I\u2019m not.\u201d I gulp. \u201cI\u2019m just ... I\u2019m so pleased to see you.\u201d</p><p>I reach for his hand and clasp it tight. I never expected to see Luke here. Not in a million years. His hand is warm and firm and feels like it\u2019s anchoring me. I never want to let it go.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you inside?\u201d He jerks his head toward the auditorium. \u201cHas the evening been a success?\u201d</p><p>Part of me longs to say, Yes! It\u2019s been brilliant! and regale him with my triumph. But there\u2019s a bigger part of me that can\u2019t lie. Not to Luke. Not when he\u2019s standing here. Not when he flew back from New York. Not when he\u2019s the only person at this premiere who actually cares about me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I thought,\u201d I say at last. \u201cNothing\u2019s what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He nods, as though he can read my mind.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe ...\u201d I swallow. \u201cMaybe you were right. Maybe I am a bit lost.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Luke doesn\u2019t say anything. Those intense dark eyes of his meet mine, and it\u2019s as though we don\u2019t have to talk. He can sense it all.</p><p>\u201cI was brooding about that all the way to New York,\u201d he says finally, his voice deep and gravelly. \u201cAnd then it hit me. I\u2019m your husband. If you\u2019re lost, it\u2019s up to me to come and find you.\u201d</p><p>With no warning, tears start to my eyes. After everything I did to annoy and upset him. He came to find me.</p><p>\u201cWell ... here I am,\u201d I manage, a lump suddenly in my throat, and Luke sweeps me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he says against my wet cheek. \u201cNo one should have to go to a premiere on their own. I\u2019m sorry, my darling girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumble back, sniffling against his white collar. \u201cI think I lost the plot a bit.\u201d</p><p>Luke offers me his handkerchief, and I blow my nose and try to repair my eye makeup a little while he waits patiently.</p> <p>\u201cAll the interviewers called me Betty,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBetty.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. \u201cBetty? No, I can\u2019t see it.\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cNow, what shall we do? You want to go back inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say with resolve. \u201cI want to find my dad. I want to make up with Suze. I want to hug Minnie. I want to do anything but go inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He meets my eyes\u2014and I can see he\u2019s asking me a bigger question. The same question he was asking me before. It seems so long ago now.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then.\u201d His eyes soften. \u201cOK.\u201d He takes my hand, and slowly we start to walk back down the empty red carpet.</p><p>They talk about rose-tinted spectacles. Well, I think I\u2019ve had red-carpet-tinted spectacles. I mean, this red carpet is actually quite tatty, now it\u2019s empty of celebrities. As Luke and I walk along, hand in hand, there are cameras still banked along the barriers, but we have the carpet to ourselves. It reminds me of strolling along the Walk of Fame, weeks ago, when we were new to L.A. and it was a big adventure ahead of us. I can\u2019t believe how much has happened since then.</p><p>\u201cI need to build bridges with my mother,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d I nod. \u201cAnd you will. It\u2019ll be wonderful. Luke, you should see your mum with Minnie. They\u2019re amazing! They\u2019re actually very similar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d He shoots me a wry smile, and I have a sudden vision of sitting with Luke and Elinor and Minnie: a happy family round the tea table.

Everything will change.</p><p>\u201cBuy her a jigsaw,\u201d I suggest. \u201cShe loves jigsaws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Luke smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. Or maybe I should buy her a hundred. I have a lot to put right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, so do I.\u201d I wince as all my troubles flood back into my brain. Suze ... Tarquin ... my dad ... \u201cI had this big row with Suze.\u201d I wring his hand. \u201cIt was awful. She\u2019s really angry with me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky.\u201d He cuts me off gently. \u201cListen. I have to tell you something. Suze is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turn my head, puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left the car a few streets away. She\u2019s parked there right now. She wants to drive into the desert after your father, and she wants you to come too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. When I told her where I was going, she begged to come along with me. If I didn\u2019t succeed, she was going to come and drag you out of the premiere herself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut ...\u201d I can\u2019t process this. \u201cInto the desert?\u201d</p><p>Luke sighs. \u201cSuze is in a real state. We think your father and Tarquin are heading to Las Vegas. Suze is worried about Tarquin, and, to be fair, I think she has good reason to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d My head is spinning. \u201cSo ... where are the children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitchell is babysitting right now. Obviously we\u2019ll have to decide what the best plan is. We need to get home, work out what we know, put together a route.... And you need to think hard, Becky. I mean, he\u2019s your father. If anyone can figure out where he\u2019s gone ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got that old map of my dad\u2019s.\u201d My mind starts to whir. \u201cWe might be able to work out something from that, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d A voice hails us, and I whip round to see Jeff a few yards away, leaning out of the driver\u2019s window and waving. \u201cI can\u2019t get any closer!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeff!\u201d I hurry toward his friendly face. Within a minute, both Luke and I are in the backseat of the SUV, and Luke is instructing him on where to go.</p><p>\u201cMovie finished early?\u201d says Jeff, as he maneuvers the car out.</p><p>\u201cI just decided I\u2019d had enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d Jeff nods.</p><p>\u201cI did everything I needed to. Except\u2014wait.\u201d I turn to Luke, stricken. \u201cThe autographs! I never got any!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does! I promised Dad I\u2019d get him some autographs, and I haven\u2019t got a single one.\u201d I stare at Luke miserably. \u201cI\u2019m so crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s not the priority right now\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I promised. And I let him down again.\u201d Remorse is pouring over me. \u201cHe wanted Dix Donahue\u2019s autograph, and I never got it, and now I\u2019ve forgotten again, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some signatures? I\u2019ll fill your dad\u2019s book.\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice comes from the front of the car, and I blink in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d I say stupidly.</p><p>\u201cYou name a celebrity, I\u2019ve worked for them. They all owe me one. I\u2019ll get your autographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, agog. \u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cName a celebrity,\u201d repeats Jeff.</p><p>\u201cJohn Travolta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad Pitt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>His face is blank, but his eyes are twinkling in the rearview mirror. I think I love Jeff.</p><p>\u201cThat would be amazing. Thank you so much.\u201d I carefully take out Dad\u2019s precious autograph book and put it on the front passenger seat.</p><p>What seems like thirty seconds later, Jeff is pulling up in a side street and Luke is saying, \u201cWe\u2019re parked just here. Thank you, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Jeff.\u201d I lean over and give him a hug. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a nice family,\u201d says Jeff gruffly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again with those autographs.\u201d</p><p>We get out of the SUV and a breeze ruffles my dress. I glance at my reflection in the car window, and my own eyes stare back at me, huge and over-made-up and a bit wired. I suddenly feel really nervous at the idea of seeing Suze. I feel as if I\u2019ve been in some alternate universe. But I can\u2019t run. I can\u2019t dodge this. The car door is opening and she\u2019s getting out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment we just stand there, staring at each other through the evening air. I\u2019ve known Suze for many years, and she hasn\u2019t changed a bit. Same blond hair; same endlessly long legs; same huge, irreverent laugh; same way of nibbling her thumb when she\u2019s stressed. I can only imagine the state of her skin right now.</p><p>\u201cBex, I know you\u2019re really busy.\u201d Her voice is husky. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got all these big chances and everything. But I need you. Please. I need you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so taken aback that she isn\u2019t shouting at me, tears spring to my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cI need you too.\u201d I skitter to her on my heels and envelop her in a huge hug. When\u2019s the last time I hugged Suze? Ages ago.</p> <p>She\u2019s crying, too, I realize. She\u2019s really sobbing on my shoulder. She\u2019s been totally wiped out by all the worry, and I wasn\u2019t there for her. I feel a horrible gnawing in the pit of my stomach. I was a bad friend. A bad, bad friend.</p><p>Well, I\u2019m going to make up for it now.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she mumbles into my hair.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d I squeeze her tight. \u201cThe red carpet wasn\u2019t the same without you. I didn\u2019t have the time of my life at all\u2014in fact, it was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>And I can tell she truly is. Even though I\u2019ve been so crap to her, she still wishes I\u2019d had a nice time. That\u2019s how lovely Suze is.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone to Las Vegas,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her face and wipes her nose with her sleeve. \u201cI thought we could follow them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I squeeze her hands tight. \u201cLet\u2019s do it. Whatever you want to do, Suze, I\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019ve just signed myself up for, but I don\u2019t care. This is Suze and she needs me, so I\u2019m in.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been texting Danny,\u201d she adds, her voice a bit snuffly. \u201cHe\u2019s coming too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny is?\u201d I say in astonishment.</p><p>She turns her phone to show me the screen.</p><p>Suze, my darling, do you even need to ASK??? I will be there in a nanosecond, and we will find that husband of yours.</p><p>Danny xxxxx</p><p>Danny is such a star. Although how we\u2019re going to keep tabs on him in Las Vegas, I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cWell, there we are, then.\u201d I give her another hug. \u201cWe\u2019re sorted. We have a team. We\u2019ll do it, Suze. We\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>How? I can\u2019t help thinking. How are we going to find them? This whole idea feels a bit nutty to me. But Suze wants me to do it, so that\u2019s all that matters.</p> <p>I\u2019m about to suggest that we all go home, order takeout, and pool our ideas, when the other passenger door opens. I feel a massive shock as another blond head appears. Alicia? Seriously? Alicia?</p><p>\u201cAlicia\u2019s going to come too.\u201d Suze wipes her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s been so lovely. She was the one who found out about Las Vegas. Bryce told one of his friends at Golden Peace that\u2019s where he was going. Alicia had every single member of staff interviewed until she got some information.... Honestly, Bex, she\u2019s been amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cHow ... fabulous of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two will be friends, won\u2019t you?\u201d Suze looks anxious. \u201cYou have put all that stuff in the past behind you?\u201d</p><p>What can I say? I can\u2019t add to Suze\u2019s stress.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say at last. \u201cOf course we have. We\u2019ll be great friends, won\u2019t we, Alicia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Alicia comes forward, her footsteps silent in her trendy soft-leather yoga flip-flop things, her face in that composed, serene expression she puts on. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, my hackles rise. She doesn\u2019t get to say welcome. I say welcome.</p><p>\u201cAnd welcome back.\u201d I smile sweetly at her. \u201cWelcome to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a challenge we have.\u201d She looks at me seriously. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure if we all work together, we can find Tarquin, your father, and Bryce before\u2014\u201d She breaks off. \u201cWell. We\u2019re worried that Bryce is ... predatory. That\u2019s our concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get back to the Batcave and make a plan.

Then, just as Alicia is drawing breath to speak, I turn to her.</p><p>\u201cI know you haven\u2019t changed,\u201d I say in swift, low, furious tones. \u201cI know underneath all that sweetness and honey you have some agenda of your own. But just know, if you hurt Suze one tiny bit, I will burn you.\u201d I\u2019m glaring at her so hard, I think my eyes might pop out. \u201cI will burn. You.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>The car door opens and Suze climbs into the front passenger seat. \u201cEverything OK?\u201d she asks breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say brightly, and after a moment Alicia echoes, \u201cFine.\u201d She looks a bit shell-shocked.
