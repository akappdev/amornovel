How could she not? Individually, the three of them had voices that were usually described as booming; together they sounded like an entire football stadium full of fans. All three worked as mechanics in the family-owned car repair business and stood well over six feet. Their size alone was intimidating. Add to that their voices, and they\u2019d put the fear of God into the most hardened criminal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u201d Linc was saying. He was the oldest and, if possible, loudest of the bunch.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo said he\u2019d call her before now,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>Ned, her youngest brother, remained suspiciously quiet. He was the sensitive one. Translated, that meant he\u2019d apologize after he broke David Rhodes\u2019s fingers for getting his little sister pregnant and then abandoning her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d Linc insisted.</p><p>The determination in his voice gave her pause. Mary Jo\u2019s situation was complicated enough without the involvement of her loving but meddlesome older brothers. However, it wasn\u2019t their fault that she was about to have a baby and the father was nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cI say we find David Rhodes and string him up until he agrees to marry our sister.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo gasped. She couldn\u2019t help it. Knowing Linc, he\u2019d have no qualms about doing exactly that.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should, too\u2014if only we knew where he was,\u201d she heard Mel say.</p><p>Unable to sit still any longer, Mary Jo tore off her earphones and burst out of her bedroom. She marched into the living room, where her brothers stood around the Christmas tree, beers in hand, as its lights blinked cheerfully. Ever since their parents had been killed in a car accident five years earlier, her older brothers had considered themselves her guardians. Which was ridiculous, since she was over twenty-one. Twenty-three, to be precise. She hadn\u2019t been legally of age at the time of their deaths, but her brothers seemed to forget she was now an adult.</p><p>All four of them still lived in the family home. Linc and Ned were currently seeing women, but neither relationship seemed very serious. Mel had recently broken up with someone. Mary Jo was the only one eager to leave, chafing as she did at her brothers\u2019 attempts to decree how she should live her life.</p><p>Admittedly she\u2019d made a mess of things; she couldn\u2019t deny it. But she was trying to deal with the consequences, to act like the adult she was. Yes, she\u2019d made a massive error in judgment, falling for an attractive older man and doing what came all too naturally. And no, she didn\u2019t need her brothers\u2019 assistance.</p><p>\u201cWould you guys mind your own business,\u201d she demanded, hands on her hips. At five-three she stared up at her brothers, who towered above her.</p><p>She probably looked a sight, although at the moment her appearance was the least of her problems. She was dressed in her old flannel nightgown, the one with the Christmas angels on it, her belly stretched out so far it looked like she\u2019d swallowed a giant snow globe. Her long dark hair fell in tangles, and her feet were bare.</p> <p>Linc frowned back at her. \u201cYou\u2019re our sister and that makes you our business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re worried about you,\u201d Ned said, speaking for the first time. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have that baby any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about birthing no babies,\u201d Mel added in a falsetto voice.</p><p>If he was trying to add humor to the situation, Mary Jo wasn\u2019t amused. She glared at him angrily. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about delivering my baby. This child is my concern and mine alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>From the very minute she\u2019d tearfully announced her pregnancy four months ago, her brothers had decided the baby was a boy. For some reason, the alternative never seemed to occur to them, no matter how often she suggested it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re depriving this baby of his father,\u201d Linc said stubbornly. It was a lament he\u2019d voiced a hundred times over the past months. \u201cA baby needs a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Mary Jo told him. \u201cHowever, I haven\u2019t seen David in weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Mel stepped forward, his disapproval obvious. \u201cWhat about Christmas? Didn\u2019t he tell you he\u2019d be in touch before Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d But then David Rhodes had made a lot of promises, none of which he\u2019d kept. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be visiting his family in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cCedar Cove,\u201d she supplied and wondered if she should\u2019ve told her three hotheaded brothers that much.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go there and find him,\u201d Linc said.</p><p>Mary Jo held up both hands. \u201cDon\u2019t be crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy,\u201d Linc echoed with a snort of indignation. \u201cI refuse to let you have this baby alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone,\u201d Mary Jo said. She gestured toward them. \u201cI have the three of you, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Her brothers went pale before her eyes. \u201cYou...you want us in the delivery room?\u201d Mel asked in weak tones. He swallowed visibly. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo had delayed registering for the birthing classes because David had promised to attend them with her. Only he hadn\u2019t managed to show up for the first session or the one after that or the following one, either. Giving up on him, Mary Jo had begun a session that week\u2014a lot later in the pregnancy than she should have. She\u2019d gone by herself and left the class in tears. Although she\u2019d considered asking Ned if he\u2019d be her birthing partner, she hadn\u2019t found the courage to do it yet. And she wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be the best choice, anyway. Her other options were her girlfriends Casey and Chloe; however, Casey was terrified by the idea and Chloe, married last year, was expecting her own baby.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She struggled to maintain her composure.</p><p>\u201cThat was a joke.\u201d</p><p>They released a collective sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracting us from what\u2019s important here.\u201d Obviously, Linc wasn\u2019t going to be put off. \u201cI want to talk to David Rhodes, just him and me, man to man.\u201d He clenched his hands at his sides.</p><p>\u201cAnd when Linc\u2019s finished, I want a turn,\u201d Mel said, plowing his fist into his open palm.</p><p>Mary Jo rolled her eyes. She\u2019d defended David to her brothers countless times. She\u2019d defended him to Casey and Chloe\u2014the only other people who knew David was her baby\u2019s father. Casey worked with her at the insurance company in Seattle, so she\u2019d met David, since he\u2019d come to their office for meetings every few weeks, representing corporate headquarters in California. David had charmed just about everybody\u2014with the possible exception of Casey.</p><p>He\u2019d always had such good excuses for missing the birthing classes, and she\u2019d believed him. It was easy to do because she so badly wanted to trust him. He claimed to love her and while the pregnancy certainly hadn\u2019t been planned, he\u2019d seemed genuinely pleased when she\u2019d told him. There were a few legal and financial matters that needed to be cleared up, he\u2019d explained, but as soon as they were dealt with, he\u2019d marry her.</p><p>For a number of months Mary Jo had convinced her brothers that David\u2019s intentions were honorable. Now, though, she had to resign herself to the fact that David wasn\u2019t willing or able to marry her. She realized she didn\u2019t know as much about him as she should. Granted, he was older by at least twenty years, but her infatuation had led her to dismiss the significance of that. Now Mary Jo had to doubt his sincerity. She hadn\u2019t heard from him in more than two weeks and he wasn\u2019t answering his cell phone, and even during their last conversation, he\u2019d been preoccupied and abrupt. He\u2019d mentioned that he\u2019d be in Cedar Cove for Christmas with his father and stepmother and would call her then.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to marry David?\u201d Ned asked. He was the only brother to take her feelings into consideration.</p><p>\u201cOf course she wants to marry him,\u201d Linc answered, scowling at him. \u201cShe\u2019s about to have his baby, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I can answer for myself.\u201d Mary Jo calmly turned toward her oldest brother. \u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married,\u201d Linc broke in.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you holding a gun on David!\u201d</p><p>Linc shook his head, expression puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t own a gun.\u201d</p><p>She sighed; her brothers could be so literal sometimes. \u201cI was speaking figuratively,\u201d she said loftily.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Linc frowned. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not talking figures, I\u2019m talking facts.\u201d He raised one finger. \u201cYou\u2019re having a baby.\u201d He raised a second. \u201cThe father of that baby needs to accept his responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Mary Jo murmured, although any hope that David would take care of her and the baby had long since been dashed.</p><p>\u201cYes, he will,\u201d Mel said firmly, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to make sure he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that includes putting a wedding band on your finger,\u201d Linc informed her, giving her a look that said he wouldn\u2019t tolerate any argument.</p><p>The baby kicked as if in protest and Mary Jo echoed the child\u2019s feelings. She no longer knew what she wanted. In the beginning she\u2019d been head-over-heels in love with David. He was the most exciting man she\u2019d ever met, and without even trying, he\u2019d swept her off her feet. Mary Jo had been thrilled when he paid attention to her, a lowly accounting clerk. Compared to the boyfriends she\u2019d had\u2014as naive and inexperienced as she\u2019d been herself\u2014David was a romantic hero. An older man, confident, witty, indulgent.</p><p>\u201cMary Josephine,\u201d Mel said loudly. \u201cAre you listening?\u201d</p><p>Blinking to clear her thoughts, Mary Jo focused on her middle brother. \u201cI guess not, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d Mel stormed. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your future here and the future of your son.\u201d</p><p>Despite the seriousness of the situation, Mary Jo yawned. She couldn\u2019t help it. She covered her mouth with one hand and placed the other on her protruding belly. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d she declared.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo!\u201d Linc shouted after her as if she were a marine recruit and he was her drill instructor. \u201cWe need to decide what to do here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we talk about it in the morning?\u201d She was too exhausted to continue this argument with her brothers at\u2014she glanced toward the antique clock\u2014almost midnight.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc, be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get this settled.\u201d Mel joined forces with his older brother.</p><p>Again Ned didn\u2019t speak. He cast her a look of quiet sympathy but he wasn\u2019t taking sides. Mary Jo could see that he felt Linc and Mel were right\u2014not about becoming Mrs. Rhodes but about the need for her to make some kind of decision.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, but we\u2019ve already said everything there is to say.\u201d She sagged onto the sofa and tried to keep her eyes open.</p><p>Linc glanced at the clock, too. \u201cAs of about one minute ago, it\u2019s officially Christmas Eve. Rhodes promised to be in touch before Christmas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Exhaling a deep sigh, Mary Jo shrugged. \u201cHe might\u2019ve said on Christmas. I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Mel\u2019s feet were braced wide apart, his arms folded across his massive chest.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten, either.\u201d Linc, too, crossed his arms. They looked like bouncers at a tough bar, but Mary Jo feared the person they\u2019d toss out on his ear would be David Rhodes.</p><p>And he\u2019d deserve it; she knew that. He\u2019d deceived her not once, not twice, but a dozen times or more. Some of the responsibility was hers, though. Even though she was aware that he\u2019d abused her trust, she\u2019d continued to believe him, giving him chance after chance. Now her brothers were trying to save her from him\u2014and from herself.</p> <p>\u201cDavid said he\u2019d contact you before Christmas,\u201d Linc reminded her. \u201cThat\u2019s less than twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Her agreeing with him was sure to confuse her well-meaning brothers.</p><p>Apparently shocked by her unaccustomed meekness, Linc frowned, then checked the clock again. \u201cYup, less than twenty-four hours. It\u2019s time you realized he has no intention of doing the proper thing.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo couldn\u2019t argue with that. She was just tired of discussing it. \u201cYou never know,\u201d she said, forcing a note of optimism into her voice.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re living in a dream world, little sister,\u201d Mel said through gritted teeth.</p> <p>Ned sat down next to Mary Jo and reached for her hand. \u201cLinc and Mel are right,\u201d he told her gently.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d She was so exhausted, her vision had started to blur.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to get in touch with David. If we can\u2019t find him, then one of his family members. He has to be held accountable.\u201d</p><p>Linc snorted again. \u201cDavid Rhodes needs to make an honest woman of you.\u201d</p><p>If Mary Jo heard that one more time she was going to scream. \u201cI am an honest woman! I don\u2019t need David or any man to validate what each of you should already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Linc muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t get your knickers in a knot. It\u2019s only an expression.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat we all want,\u201d Mel began, as if to clarify their thoughts, \u201cis for you to be happy\u2014with the father of your baby.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo doubted that was even possible. She\u2019d lost faith in David and as much as she wanted to believe he loved her and cared about their child, the evidence stated otherwise.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not giving us any choice,\u201d Linc said, his dark eyes menacing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find him and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc, please. Hold off for a few days. Please.\u201d She hated to plead but it was Christmas and she didn\u2019t want to see the holiday ruined for any of them. She was protecting David\u2014again\u2014and the irony didn\u2019t escape her. Despite all these months of intermittent contact and broken promises, Mary Jo still felt the urge to shield him from her brothers.</p><p>But her real concern was for Linc, Mel and Ned. She didn\u2019t want them ending up in jail because of David.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting a minute longer!\u201d Mel boomed. \u201cIf David\u2019s in Cedar Cove, we\u2019re going to track him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please,\u201d she said shakily.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a say in this anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLinc, it\u2019s my life! Listen to me. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to you enough,\u201d her brother said matter-of-factly. \u201cNow the three of us have decided to take matters into our own hands.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo couldn\u2019t let her brothers get involved. She shuddered as she imagined them storming into Cedar Cove on Christmas Eve, bent on forcing David to marry her.</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t allow that to happen. Resolute, she stood up and started for her bedroom. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish discussing this in the morning,\u201d she said in as dignified a voice as she could manage.</p><p>Linc seemed about to argue, but her fatigue must have shown because he hesitated, then nodded reluctantly. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no avoiding it, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, sweetie.\u201d He threw his arms around her in a quick hug, as did Mel and then Ned.</p><p>Mary Jo slept soundly for six hours and woke in a cold sweat. She knew she\u2019d never be able to stop her interfering brothers from invading Cedar Cove, embarrassing her and possibly doing bodily harm to David. The only solution she could think of was to get there first and warn David and/or his family.</p><p>With that in mind, Mary Jo left her brothers a note and slipped quietly out of the house.</p><p>2</p><p>Cedar Cove was a festive little town, Mary Jo thought when she stepped off the ferry. It was a place that took Christmas seriously. Even the small terminal was decorated, with bells hanging from the ceiling and large snowflakes in the windows. She\u2019d never been here before and was pleasantly surprised by its charm. After taking the Washington State ferry from downtown Seattle to Bremerton, she\u2019d caught the foot ferry across Sinclair Inlet to the small town David had mentioned.</p><p>He\u2019d only talked about it that one time. She\u2019d had the impression he didn\u2019t like it much, but she hadn\u2019t understood why.</p><p>She looked around.</p><p>A lighthouse stood off in the distance, picturesque against the backdrop of fir trees and the green waters of the cove. Waves rhythmically splashed the large rocks that marked the beach. Adjusting her purse strap on her shoulder and getting a tighter grip on her bag, Mary Jo walked down the pier into town.</p><p>Large evergreen boughs stretched across the main street of Cedar Cove\u2014Harbor Street, according to the sign\u2014and from the center of each hung a huge ornament. There were alternating wreaths, angels and candles. The lightposts were festooned with holly. The effect of all these decorations was delightful and it raised her spirits\u2014until she remembered why she was in Cedar Cove.</p><p>It was ten in the morning on Christmas Eve, and everyone seemed to have places to go and people to see. So did Mary Jo, except that she was in no hurry to get there, and who could blame her? This was likely to be a painful confrontation.</p><p>Not sure where to start searching for David\u2019s family, desperate to collect her thoughts, Mary Jo stopped at a coffee house called Mocha Mama\u2019s about a block from the waterfront. This, too, was decorated and redolent of Christmas scents\u2014fir, cinnamon, peppermint. And the rich, strong aroma of fresh coffee. The place was nearly empty. The only other person there was a young man who stood behind the counter; he was writing or drawing something in a sketchbook and appeared to be immersed in his task, whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Mary Jo said cheerfully, wondering if her words sounded as forced as they felt. She pulled off her wool hat and gloves, cramming them in her pockets.</p><p>Her presence startled the young man, who wore a name tag that identified him as Shaw. He glanced up, blinked in apparent confusion, then suddenly smiled. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t see you come in. What can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like one of your decaf candy cane mochas, Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, grande\u2014is that what you call it here? Medium. One of those.\u201d She pointed at a stack of cups.</p><p>His eyes went to her stomach, which protruded from the opening of her long wool coat. She could no longer fasten more than the top three buttons.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have a baby.\u201d Shaw said, as if this information should be a surprise to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d She rested a protective hand on her belly.</p><p>Shaw began to prepare her mocha, chatting as he did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty quiet this morning. Maybe \u2019cause it\u2019s Christmas Eve,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Mary Jo nodded, then took a chair by the window and watched people walk briskly past. The town seemed to be busy and prosperous, with people popping in and out of stores along the street. The bakery had quite a few customers and so did a nearby framing shop.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around here before,\u201d Shaw said. He added whipped topping and a candy cane to her cup and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting,\u201d Mary Jo explained as she got up to pay for her drink. Shaw seemed to be full of information; he might be just the person to ask about David. She poked a folded dollar bill into the tip jar. \u201cWould you know any people named Rhodes in this area?\u201d she asked speculatively, holding her drink with both hands.</p><p>\u201cRhodes, Rhodes,\u201d Shaw repeated carefully. He mulled it over for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cThe name sounds familiar but I can\u2019t put a face to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She couldn\u2019t quite hide her disappointment. Carrying her mocha, she returned to the table by the window and gazed out at the street again. Her biggest fear was that her three brothers would come rolling into town in their huge pickup, looking like vigilantes out of some old western. Or worse, a bunch of hillbillies. Mary Jo decided she had to get to David and his family first.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Shaw said, suddenly excited. \u201cThere is a Rhodes family in Cedar Cove.\u201d He reached behind the counter and pulled out a telephone directory.</p><p>Mary Jo wanted to slap her forehead. Of course! How stupid. She should\u2019ve checked the phone book immediately. That was certainly what her brothers would do.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Shaw said, flipping the directory around so she could read the listings. As it happened, there was a B. Rhodes, a Kevin Rhodes and three others\u2014and Mary Jo had no way of knowing which of these people were related to David. The only thing to do was to call every one of them and find out.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I borrowed this for a few minutes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead. Tell me if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it a random act of kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so random.\u201d Mary Jo smiled as she brought the phone book back to her table. She rummaged for her cell phone; she hadn\u2019t remembered to charge it before she left and was relieved to see that she had nearly a full battery. She dialed the number for B. Rhodes and waited through several rings before a greeting came on, telling her that Ben and Charlotte weren\u2019t available and inviting her to leave a message. She didn\u2019t. She actually spoke to the next Rhodes, who sounded young and didn\u2019t know anyone named David. Of the last three, the first had a disconnected phone line and the other two didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Mary Jo had assumed it would be easy to find David in a town as small as Cedar Cove. Walking down Harbor Street, she\u2019d seen a sign for Roy McAfee, a private investigator. She hadn\u2019t expected to need one, and even if she could afford to pay someone else to track down David Rhodes, it wasn\u2019t likely that Mr. McAfee would accept a case this close to Christmas.</p><p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d Shaw asked.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Without knowing the name of David\u2019s father, she couldn\u2019t figure out what her next step should be. There were three, possibly four, potential candidates, since she\u2019d managed to rule out just one. Her only consolation was the fact that if she was having trouble, so would her brothers.</p><p>\u201cI can think of one person who might be able to help you,\u201d Shaw said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrace Harding. She\u2019s the head librarian and she knows practically everyone in town. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s working this morning but it wouldn\u2019t do any harm to go there and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe library is where?\u201d Being on foot and pregnant definitely imposed some limitations, especially now that it had started to snow.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d Shaw asked.</p><p>\u201cFoot ferry.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cThen you walked right past it when you got off. It\u2019s the concrete building with the large mural on the front. You won\u2019t have any trouble finding it.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo had noticed two such murals. She supposed it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to distinguish which one was the library. Eager to talk to Grace Harding, she left the remainder of her drink behind. She put the wool hat back on her head and pulled on her gloves. It was cold and the few snowflakes that had begun to drift down seemed persistent, like a harbinger of more to come. The Seattle area rarely experienced a white Christmas, and under other circumstances Mary Jo would\u2019ve been thrilled at the prospect of snow.</p><p>As Shaw had predicted, she didn\u2019t have a problem locating the library. The mural of a frontier family was striking, and the library doors were decorated with Christmas wreaths. When she stepped inside, she saw dozens of cut-out snowflakes suspended from the ceiling in the children\u2019s area, as well as a display of seasonal picture books, some of which\u2014like A Snowy Day\u2014 she remembered from her own childhood. A large Christmas tree with book-size wrapped gifts underneath stood just inside the small lobby. One look told Mary Jo this was a much-used and much-loved place.</p><p>She welcomed the warmth, both emotional and physical. There was a woman at the counter, which held a sign stating that the library would close at noon. Glancing at the clock on the wall, Mary Jo was surprised to see that it was already ten-forty-five.</p><p>She approached the front counter. \u201cExcuse me. Are you Grace Harding?\u201d she asked in a pleasant voice.</p> <p>\u201cAfraid not. Should I get her for you?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo agreed eagerly. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>The woman disappeared into a nearby office. A few minutes later, she reappeared with another middle-aged woman, who greeted Mary Jo with a friendly smile. She wore a bright red turtleneck sweater under a festive holly-green jumper. Her right arm seemed to be thickly bandaged beneath her long sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Grace Harding,\u201d she announced. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo offered the woman a strained smile. \u201cHello, my name is Mary Jo Wyse and\u2014\u201d The baby kicked\u2014hard\u2014and Mary Jo\u2019s eyes widened with shock. She placed her hands against her stomach and slowly exhaled.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Grace asked, looking concerned.</p> <p>\u201cI...think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should sit down.\u201d</p><p>Numbly Mary Jo nodded. This was all so...unseemly. She hated making a fuss, but she suspected the librarian was right and she did need to sit. Thankfully, Ms. Harding came around the counter and led her to a chair. She left for a moment and returned with a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cHere, drink this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Mary Jo felt embarrassed, since almost everyone in the whole library was staring at her. No doubt she made quite a spectacle and people probably thought she\u2019d give birth any second. Actually, her due date wasn\u2019t for another two weeks; she didn\u2019t think there was any danger the baby would arrive early, but this was her first pregnancy and she couldn\u2019t really tell. She could only hope....</p><p>Grace took the chair beside hers. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>Mary Jo gulped down all the water, then put the glass down beside her.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she clasped her hands together. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a man by the name of David Rhodes.\u201d</p> <p>Right away Mary Jo saw that the other woman stiffened.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d she asked excitedly, ignoring any misgivings over Grace\u2019s reaction. \u201cIs he here? He said he\u2019d be visiting his father and stepmother in Cedar Cove. It\u2019s important that I talk to him as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Grace sagged in her chair. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Mary Jo repeated. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs David in town?\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head, but her expression was sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s heart sank. She should\u2019ve known not to trust David. This was obviously another lie.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his father and stepmother? Are they available?\u201d If she didn\u2019t tell David\u2019s family about the baby, then her brothers surely would. The information would be better coming from her. The image of her brothers barging into these people\u2019s home lent a sense of urgency to her question.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Grace went on, \u201cBen and Charlotte have taken a Christmas cruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone, then,\u201d Mary Jo said in a flat voice. She recalled the message on their phone; ironically, Ben had been the first Rhodes she\u2019d called. Maybe she should be relieved they were out of town, but she wasn\u2019t. Instead, a deep sadness settled over her. The uncertainty would continue. Whatever happened, she accepted the likelihood of being a single mother, but her brothers would never stand for it.</p><p>\u201cAccording to a friend of mine, they\u2019re coming back sometime tomorrow,\u201d Grace told her.</p><p>\u201cOn Christmas Day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I understand, at any rate. I can find out for sure if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked tentative. \u201cBefore I phone Olivia\u2014she\u2019s the friend I mentioned\u2014I should tell you that her mother is married to Ben Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I asked you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Although she already knew what that question would be...</p><p>\u201cIs your baby...is David Rhodes\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rather than respond, Mary Jo closed her eyes and hung her head.</p><p>Grace touched her arm gently. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, dear,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNone of that matters now.\u201d</p><p>The answer to Grace\u2019s question was obvious. Why else would someone in an advanced state of pregnancy come looking for David and his family\u2014especially on Christmas Eve?</p><p>As she opened her eyes, Grace squeezed her hand reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen or heard from David in weeks,\u201d Mary Jo admitted. \u201cHe occasionally calls and the last time he did, he said he was coming here to spend Christmas with his family. My brothers want to make him marry me, but...but that isn\u2019t what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>At least Grace shared her point of view. \u201cI\u2019ve got to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes as soon as I can and explain that even if David offered to marry me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing for me or my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d Grace said. \u201cDavid isn\u2019t to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo grinned weakly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to agree with you. But this is their grandchild. Or...or Ben\u2019s, anyway. Maybe they\u2019ll be interested in knowing the baby. Maybe David\u2019ll want some kind of relationship.\u201d She turned to Grace and said earnestly, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I give them that choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what you should do.\u201d Grace squeezed her hand again. \u201cI\u2019ll go make that call and get right back to you. Olivia will know Charlotte and Ben\u2019s travel schedule. However, it does seem to me that they\u2019re due home on the twenty-fifth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mary Jo murmured. She was feeling light-headed and a bit queasy, so she intended to stay where she was until Grace returned. It didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>Grace sat down next to her again. \u201cI spoke with Olivia and she confirmed that Charlotte and Ben will indeed be home tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...good.\u201d Still, Mary Jo wasn\u2019t sure what she should do next. If she went home, her brothers would be impossible. They\u2019d be angry that she\u2019d left with no warning other than a brief note. In any case, they were probably on their way to Cedar Cove now. And with some effort, they\u2019d uncover the same information Mary Jo had.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d better spend the night here,\u201d Mary Jo said. She hadn\u2019t packed a bag, but her requirements were simple. All she needed was a decent hotel. \u201cCan you recommend a place to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, there are several, including a lovely B-and-B. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019ll be a problem getting a room for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA problem?\u201d This wasn\u2019t something Mary Jo had considered.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if there\u2019s anything at the Comfort Inn. It\u2019s close by and clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. Thank you so much,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>Here it was, Christmas Eve, and she felt as if she\u2019d found an angel to help her. An angel fittingly named Grace...</p><p>3</p><p>Grace Harding studied the young pregnant woman beside her. So David Rhodes was the father of her baby. Not a surprise, she supposed, but it made her think even less of him. Certainly Olivia had told her plenty\u2014about his deceit, his loans that were more like theft, since he never seemed to have any intention of repaying his father, the rumors of women he\u2019d cheated on...and probably just plain cheated. That Ben Rhodes, who was one of the most decent and honorable men she\u2019d ever met, could have a son like David defied explanation. Not only had David fathered this child, which she didn\u2019t doubt for a minute, he\u2019d also lied to Mary Jo.</p><p>Well, Grace decided, she\u2019d do what she could to give this poor girl a hand. And she knew Charlotte and Ben would, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get that list of places for you,\u201d Grace told Mary Jo, getting to her feet. The library had a sheet with phone numbers of the local bed-and-breakfasts, plus all the motels in the area. The best place in town was Thyme and Tide Bed &amp; Breakfast, run by Bob and Peggy Beldon. However, she recalled, the couple was away for the holidays. So staying there wasn\u2019t an option. But there were several chain hotels out by the freeway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to be within walking distance of the Rhodes home,\u201d Mary Jo explained as Grace handed her the list.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drive over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If there\u2019s a vacancy a few miles out of town I\u2019ll take you there myself and I can drop you off at Charlotte\u2019s tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo glanced up at her, brown eyes wide with astonishment. \u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It wouldn\u2019t be any problem. I\u2019m going that way myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged lightly. \u201cI\u2019m happy to do it,\u201d she said. The offer was a small thing and yet Mary Jo seemed so grateful. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to make another phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Mary Jo had taken out her cell phone, clearly ready to start her search for a room. Normally, cell phone use in the library was discouraged but in this case Grace couldn\u2019t object. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace returned to her office. She\u2019d promised to call Olivia back as soon as she could. Although they spoke almost every day, their conversations over the past week had been brief. With so much to do before Christmas, there hadn\u2019t been time to chat.</p><p>Sitting at her desk, Grace picked up the receiver and punched in Olivia\u2019s number. Her dearest friend was at home today, but unfortunately not because it was Christmas Eve. Judge Olivia Griffin had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone surgery; she\u2019d begin chemotherapy and radiation treatments early in the new year. She\u2019d taken a leave of absence from the bench. The last month had been frightening, especially when Olivia developed an infection that had become life-threatening. Grace got chills just thinking about how close they\u2019d all come to losing her.</p><p>Olivia answered on the first ring. \u201cIt took you forever to call back,\u201d she said. \u201cIs the girl still at the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s decided to stay the night and then meet with Ben and Charlotte tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tell her it might be better to wait?\u201d Grace asked. Like Olivia, she hated the thought of hitting Ben with this news the minute he and Charlotte arrived home.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re going to be tired...\u201d Her voice faded away.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Grace went on to explain, \u201cI really don\u2019t think it should wait. Mary Jo\u2019s obviously due very soon.\u201d She hesitated, unsure how much to tell Olivia. She didn\u2019t want to burden her friend. Because of her illness, Olivia was uncharacteristically fragile these days.</p><p>\u201cI heard that hesitation in your voice, Grace Harding,\u201d Olivia scolded. \u201cThere\u2019s more to this and you\u2019re wondering if you should tell me.\u201d</p> <p>There were times Grace swore Olivia could read her mind. She took a breath. \u201cIt seems David told Mary Jo he\u2019d be spending the holidays with Ben and Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it! That\u2019s a lie. This cruise has been planned for months and David was well aware of it. Why would he do something like this?\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t have an answer\u2014although she had her own opinion on David and his motives.</p><p>\u201cHe probably used the lie as another tactic to put the poor girl off,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThe way David manipulates people and then discards them like so much garbage infuriates me.\u201d Outrage echoed in every word.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that\u2019s exactly what he did,\u201d Grace murmured. She remembered how David had tried to swindle Charlotte out of several thousand dollars a few years ago. The man was without conscience.</p><p>\u201cThis poor girl! All alone at Christmas. It\u2019s appalling. If I could, I\u2019d wring David\u2019s neck myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have the feeling we\u2019d need to stand in line for that,\u201d Grace said wryly.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Olivia agreed. \u201cOkay, now that I know what this Mary Jo business is all about, tell me what happened to your arm.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively Grace\u2019s hand moved to her upper right arm. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna laugh,\u201d she said, smiling herself, though at the time it\u2019d been no laughing matter.</p><p>\u201cGrace, from what I heard, you were in a lot of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine. She ran into Cliff at the pharmacy when he was picking up your prescription.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Small towns were like this. Everything was news and nothing was private. That could be beneficial\u2014and it could be embarrassing. Olivia\u2019s daughter, Justine, knew, so Olivia\u2019s husband\u2014who happened to be the local newspaper editor\u2014did, too. It wouldn\u2019t surprise her if Jack wrote a humorous piece on her misadventure.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d Olivia repeated.</p> <p>Grace saw no reason to hide the truth. \u201cI got bitten by the camel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The camel? What camel?\u201d</p><p>Grace had to smile again. Olivia\u2019s reaction was the same as that of Dr. Timmons. According to the young physician, this was the first time he\u2019d ever treated anyone for a camel bite.</p><p>\u201cCliff and I are housing the animals for the live Nativity scene,\u201d she explained. \u201cRemember?\u201d The local Methodist church had brought in animals for the display. Grace wasn\u2019t sure where the camel had come from but as far as she was concerned it could go back there anytime. And it would. Yesterday had been the final day for the animals\u2019 appearances; they\u2019d be returning to their individual homes just after Christmas. True, she\u2019d miss the donkey, since she\u2019d grown fond of him. But the camel? Goodbye, Sleeping Beauty! Grace almost snorted at the animal\u2019s unlikely name.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cthe live Nativity scene. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see it. So that\u2019s how you encountered the camel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I went out to feed the dastardly beast. Cliff warned me that camels can be cantankerous and I thought I was being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not careful enough,\u201d Olivia said, sputtering with laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, it isn\u2019t that funny,\u201d Grace said, slightly miffed that her friend hadn\u2019t offered her the requisite amount of sympathy. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know it hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he break the skin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a she, and yes, she did.\u201d Grace\u2019s arm ached at the memory. \u201cSleeping Beauty\u2014\u201d she said the name sarcastically \u201c\u2014bit me right through two layers of clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you need stitches?\u201d The amusement had left Olivia\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, but Dr. Timmons gave me a prescription for antibiotics and then bandaged my arm. You\u2019d think it had been nearly amputated. This morning I had trouble finding a sweater that would go over the dressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d she said in a satisfied tone.</p><p>\u201cLet Cliff feed the camel from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d Grace figured she might as well go for broke on the sympathy factor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014the donkey bit you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the sheep stepped on my foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sheep can\u2019t weigh that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one did. I\u2019ve got an unsightly bruise on the top of my foot.\u201d She thrust out her leg and gazed down on it. Her panty hose didn\u2019t hide the spectacularly colored bruise at all.</p><p>\u201cOh, poor Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph. We haven\u2019t had much of a chance to talk in the last few days, so tell me what you\u2019re doing for Christmas,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty low-key,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cJustine, Seth and Leif are coming over tonight for dinner and gifts, then we\u2019re going to church at eight. What about you and Cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame. Maryellen, Kelly and all the grandkids are coming for dinner and then we\u2019re heading to the Christmas Eve service. Cliff\u2019s daughter, Lisa, and her family are here as well. Tomorrow we\u2019re all going over to Maryellen and Jon\u2019s for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I are having Christmas dinner alone. He\u2019s let on to everyone that he\u2019s cooking but between you and me, D.D.\u2019s on the Cove is catering.\u201d Olivia laughed, apparently amused by her husband\u2019s resourcefulness. \u201cJustine invited us,\u201d she added, \u201cbut we declined. Next year,\u201d Olivia said, and it sounded like a promise.</p><p>Everything would be back to normal by this time next year. Olivia would be finished with her treatments this spring. Seeing what her friend had already endured, and her quiet bravery in the face of what was still to come, had given Grace a deeper understanding of Olivia. Her strength and courage impressed Grace and humbled her. Like every woman their age, they\u2019d suffered\u2014and survived\u2014their share of tragedy and grief. And now Olivia was coping with cancer.</p><p>Grace stood and looked out the small window that offered a view of the interior of the library. Mary Jo sat with her shoulders hunched forward, cell phone dangling from one hand.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should get back to Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep me updated, won\u2019t you?\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks. And listen, Grace, stay away from that camel!\u201d She laughed, and then the line was disconnected.</p><p>The next time they met at the Pancake Palace, Grace intended to make Olivia pay for her coconut cream pie.</p><p>Grace called her husband quickly, then stepped out of her office and slipped into the chair next to Mary Jo. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot so well, I\u2019m afraid. I tried to call David. I have his cell phone number and I thought he\u2019d answer. It\u2019s Christmas Eve and he has to know I\u2019m waiting to hear from him.\u201d</p><p>Grace took Mary Jo\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cHe didn\u2019t answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s more than that. He...he had his number changed. Last week\u2014\u201d she struggled to speak \u201c\u2014I tried to reach him at his office in California and learned that he\u2019s quit his job. We both work\u2014worked\u2014for the same insurance company, which is how we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dare let my brothers know.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo had mentioned them earlier.</p><p>\u201cHow many brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree, all of them older. I\u2019d hoped David would be here with his parents, but I knew the odds that he\u2019d told the truth weren\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded, encouraging her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI think I told you my brothers want to make David marry me\u2014or at least pay for all the lies he\u2019s told. They decided they were going to come and confront him, and if not David, then his family.\u201d</p><p>Grace could only imagine how distressing it would be for Ben and Charlotte to return from the vacation of a lifetime to find Mary Jo\u2019s three angry brothers waiting for them. On Christmas Day, yet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important I talk to Ben and Charlotte first,\u201d Mary Jo concluded.</p><p>\u201cI think you should,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cExcept...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cExcept it looks like I\u2019ll have to go back to Seattle this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called all the places on the sheet you gave me and there aren\u2019t any vacancies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere? Not in the entire town? What about the Comfort Inn?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean everything\u2019s already reserved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s no room at the Inn.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cLinc,\u201d Mel shouted from the kitchen. Three Wyse Men Automotive had closed early due to the holiday.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Linc shouted back. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mary Jo?\u201d He\u2019d already searched half the house and hadn\u2019t found her. He knew she\u2019d taken the day off. Had she gone to the store, perhaps? Or to visit her friend Chloe? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you come to the kitchen you\u2019ll find out!\u201d</p><p>Linc followed his brother\u2019s voice and with Ned at his heels, entered the kitchen. As soon as Mel saw him, his brother thrust a sheet of paper into his hands. \u201cHere. This was behind the coffeemaker. Must\u2019ve fallen off.\u201d</p><p>Before he\u2019d read two words, Linc\u2019s face started to heat up. His stubborn, strong-willed, hardheaded, obstinate little sister had gone to Cedar Cove. Without her family, because she felt she knew best. Tossing the note to the ground, Linc clenched both his fists. \u201cOf all the stupid, idiotic things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ned asked.</p> <p>\u201cMary Jo\u2019s decided to go to Cedar Cove on her own,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cBy herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what I said?\u201d Mel snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Linc informed his youngest brother. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019d do anything this crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe drove her to it.\u201d Ned sank into a kitchen chair and splayed his fingers through his thick dark hair.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Mel challenged.</p><p>\u201cExplain yourself,\u201d Linc ordered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d Ned gazed up at them. \u201cAll that talk about confronting David and forcing him to do the honorable thing. The man hasn\u2019t got an honorable bone in his body. What were we thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we were thinking,\u201d Linc said irritably, \u201cis that David Rhodes is going to pay for what he did to our little sister.\u201d He looked his brothers in the eye and made sure they understood.</p><p>When their parents were killed, Mary Jo had only been seventeen. Linc, as the oldest, had been made her legal guardian, since there was no other family in the area. At the time, the responsibility had weighed heavily on his shoulders. He\u2019d gone to his two brothers and asked for their help in raising their little sister. Or at least finishing the job their parents had begun.</p><p>Both brothers had been equally committed to taking care of Mary Jo. Everything had gone smoothly, too. Mary Jo had graduated from high school the following May, and all three brothers had attended the ceremony. They\u2019d even thrown her a party.</p> <p>That autumn he\u2019d gone with Mary Jo to the community college and signed her up for classes. She hadn\u2019t taken kindly to his accompanying her, but Linc wasn\u2019t about to let her walk around campus on her own. Not at first, anyway. Cute little girl like her? With all those lecherous college guys who couldn\u2019t keep their hands to themselves? Oh, yeah, he knew what eighteen-year-old boys were like. And he\u2019d insisted she choose solid, practical courses, not that fluffy fun stuff they taught now.</p><p>All the brothers were proud of how well Mary Jo had done in her studies. They\u2019d all disapproved when she\u2019d dropped out of school and gone to work at that insurance company. More than once Linc had to bite his tongue. He\u2019d told her no good would come of this job.</p><p>The problem with Mary Jo was that she was too eager to move. She no longer wanted to live in the family home. For the last year, she\u2019d talked incessantly about getting her own place.</p><p>Linc didn\u2019t understand that either. This was their home. Linc saw to it that Mary Jo wasn\u2019t stuck with all the cleaning, cooking and laundry. They all did their part of the upkeep\u2014maybe not quite to her standards but well enough. That wasn\u2019t the reason she was so determined to live somewhere else.</p><p>No, Mary Jo had an intense desire for independence. From them.</p><p>Okay, maybe they\u2019d gone overboard when it came to dating. Frankly, Linc didn\u2019t think there was a man this side of Mars who was good enough for his little sister. Mary Jo was special.</p><p>Then Mary Jo had met David Rhodes. Linc had never found out exactly when that had happened. Not once in the six months that she\u2019d been dating him had she mentioned this guy. What Linc had noticed was how happy Mary Jo seemed all of a sudden\u2014and then, just as suddenly, she\u2019d been depressed. That was when her mood swings started. She\u2019d be happy and then sad and then happy again. It made no sense until he learned there was a man involved.</p><p>Even now that Mary Jo was pregnant with this man\u2019s baby, Linc still hadn\u2019t met him. In retrospect, that was probably for the best because Linc would take real pleasure in ripping his face off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>His younger brothers were clearly worried.</p><p>Linc\u2019s hand was already in his pants pocket, fingering his truck keys. \u201cWhat can we do other than follow her to Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk this through,\u201d Ned suggested, coming to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cMary Jo\u2019s going to have a baby. She\u2019s alone and pregnant and we all know Rhodes isn\u2019t in Cedar Cove. He\u2019s lied to her from the beginning. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s telling her the truth now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>Linc looked squarely into his youngest brother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Mom and Dad would have us do?\u201d he asked, allowing time between each word to make sure the message sank in.</p><p>Ned sighed. \u201cThey\u2019d want us to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly my point.\u201d Linc headed for the back door.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Ned raised his hand.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Mel cried out impatiently.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo left because she\u2019s mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let her be mad. By the time we arrive, she\u2019ll be singing a different tune. My guess is she\u2019ll be mighty glad to see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ned agreed. \u201cBut say she isn\u2019t. Then what?\u201d</p><p>Linc frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring her home anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might not want to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll come.\u201d Linc wasn\u2019t about to leave his little sister with strangers over Christmas.</p><p>\u201cIf we make demands, she\u2019ll only be more determined to stay,\u201d Ned told them.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other bright ideas?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>Ned ignored the sarcasm. \u201cBring her gifts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Linc didn\u2019t understand what he meant. They all had gifts for her and the baby that she could open Christmas morning, the way she was supposed to.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to know we love her and welcome the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we welcome the baby,\u201d Linc said. \u201cHe\u2019s our flesh and blood, our nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on a minute,\u201d Mel murmured, looking pensive. \u201cNed has a point.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t often that Mel agreed with Ned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo\u2019s pregnant, right?\u201d</p><p>That question didn\u2019t require a response.</p><p>\u201cAnd everyone knows how unreasonable women can get when they\u2019re in, uh, a delicate condition.\u201d</p><p>Linc scratched his head. \u201cMary Jo was like that long before she got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but she\u2019s been even more unreasonable lately, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Mel wasn\u2019t wrong there.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should bring her a gift just so she\u2019ll know how concerned we are about her and the baby. How much we care. We want her with us for Christmas, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woman doesn\u2019t like gifts?\u201d Linc said, thinking out loud.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Ned said, smiling at Mel. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Linc conceded. \u201cOkay, then, we\u2019ll each bring her a gift.\u201d</p><p>They returned to their individual bedrooms, planning to meet in the kitchen five minutes later. Linc had gone online a few weeks ago and ordered a miniature football, basketball and soccer ball for his yet-to-be-born nephew. He couldn\u2019t speak for the others, but he suspected they too had chosen gifts that were geared toward sports. At first he figured he\u2019d bring the football, but then he reconsidered. He\u2019d been after Mary Jo to save money and in an effort to encourage her, he\u2019d purchased a gold coin that he planned to present on her birthday in February. Perfect. He pocketed the coin and hurried to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Mel echoed.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Ned confirmed.</p><p>The three brothers hurried out to the four-door pickup Linc drove. Mel automatically climbed into the front passenger seat and Ned sat directly behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou got your gift?\u201d Linc asked Mel.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m bringing her perfume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Linc said approvingly. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually bought it for Annie, but since I\u2019m not seeing her anymore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cIncense,\u201d his youngest brother mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou brought her what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncense. She likes that stuff. It was gonna be part of her Christmas gift anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d Linc shook his head rather than ask any further questions. Whatever his brothers chose to bring Mary Jo was up to them.</p><p>He turned his key in the ignition, then rested his arm over the back of the seat and angled his head so he could see behind him as he reversed out of the driveway. He\u2019d reached the stop sign at the end of the block before it occurred to him to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cCedar Cove is south,\u201d Ned contradicted.</p><p>\u201cFor crying out loud.\u201d Linc pulled over to the curb. Leaning across his brother, he opened the glove box and shuffled through a pile of junk until he found the Washington State map he was looking for. Dropping it on Mel\u2019s lap, he said, \u201cFind me Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Mel immediately tossed it into the backseat. \u201cHere, Ned. You seem to think you know where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a guess,\u201d Ned protested. Nevertheless he started to unfold the map.</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t have time for guessing. Look it up.\u201d Linc put the truck back in gear and drove toward the freeway on-ramp. He assumed Ned would find Cedar Cove before he had to decide which lane to get into\u2014north or south.</p><p>He was nearly at the ramp before Ned cried out triumphantly. \u201cFound it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Which way should I go?\u201d</p><p>Linc watched his brother through the rearview mirror as he turned the map around.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cWhich way?\u201d Linc asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cSouth,\u201d Ned murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth,\u201d Ned said again, this time with more conviction.</p><p>Linc pulled into the lane that would take him in that direction. \u201cHow far is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ned stared down at the map again. \u201cA ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t tell me a darn thing. An hour or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, give me a minute.\u201d Ned balanced the map on his knees and studied it intently. After carefully walking his fingers along the edge of the map, Ned had the answer. \u201cI\u2019d say...ninety minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNinety minutes.\u201d Linc hadn\u2019t realized it was that far.</p><p>\u201cMaybe longer.\u201d</p><p>Linc groaned silently. Traffic was heavy, which was to be expected at noon on Christmas Eve. At the rate they were crawling, it would be hours before they got there, which made their mission that much more urgent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShould we confront the Rhodes family first thing?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.

Mary Jo had a driver\u2019s license but didn\u2019t need a vehicle of her own, living in the city as they did. Each of the brothers owned a car and she could borrow any one of them whenever she wanted.</p> <p>Ned sat back and studied the map again and after a few minutes announced, \u201cCedar Cove is on the Kitsap Peninsula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Mel muttered sarcastically. The traffic was apparently making him cranky, too.</p><p>\u201cSo she took the ferry over.\u201d</p><p>That explained it. \u201cWhich ferry?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cShe probably caught the one from downtown Seattle to Bremerton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr she might have gotten a ride,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>\u201cWho from?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t bother a friend on Christmas Eve.\u201d Ned seemed confident of that.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mel demanded.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo isn\u2019t the type to call someone at the last minute and ask that kind of favor,\u201d Ned told them. \u201cNot even Chloe or Casey\u2014especially on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>Linc agreed with his brother.</p><p>They drove in silence for another fifteen minutes before anyone spoke.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s okay?\u201d Ned asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cSure she is. She\u2019s a Wyse, isn\u2019t she? We\u2019re made of stern stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean physically,\u201d Ned clarified. \u201cLast night she seemed so...\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cSeemed what?\u201d Linc prompted.</p><p>Ned shrugged. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>Mel could be obtuse, which was only one of his character flaws, in Linc\u2019s opinion. He was also argumentative.</p><p>\u201cTo have the baby, of course,\u201d Linc explained, casting his brother a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s no reason to talk to me like that,\u201d Mel said. He shifted his weight and stared out the side window. \u201cI\u2019ve never been around a pregnant woman before. Besides, what makes you such experts on pregnancy and birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read a book,\u201d Ned told them.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Linc could hardly believe it.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Ned insisted. \u201cI figured one of us should. For Mary Jo\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo one book makes you an expert,\u201d Mel teased.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me smarter than you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mel argued.</p><p>\u201cQuit it, you two.\u201d Linc spent half his life settling squabbles between his brothers. \u201cYou.\u201d He gestured over his shoulder. \u201cCall her cell.\u201d</p><p>Ned did, using his own. \u201cWent right into voice mail,\u201d he said. \u201cMust be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her a message, then.\u201d Linc wondered if he had to spell everything out for them.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Who knows if she\u2019ll get it, though.\u201d</p><p>After that they drove in blessed silence for maybe five minutes.</p><p>\u201cHey, I just thought of something.\u201d Mel groaned in frustration. \u201cIf Mary Jo took the ferry, shouldn\u2019t we have done the same thing?\u201d</p><p>Good point\u2014except it was too late now. They were caught in the notorious Seattle traffic, going nowhere fast.</p><p>5</p><p>Mary Jo hated the idea of returning to Seattle having failed in her attempt to find either David or his family. He wasn\u2019t in Cedar Cove the way he\u2019d promised; not only that, his parents weren\u2019t here, either. Ben and Charlotte Rhodes would show up the next afternoon or evening, but in the meantime...</p><p>The thought of her brothers approaching the elderly couple, shocking them with the news and their outrageous demands, made the blood rush to her face. Her situation was uncomfortable enough without her brothers riding to the rescue like the superheroes they weren\u2019t.</p><p>The fact that Mary Jo had left on Christmas Eve was only going to rile them even more. Linc, Mel and Ned were probably home from the garage by now. Or maybe they\u2019d skipped work when they found her note on the coffeemaker and immediately set out in search of her. Maybe they were already driving up and down the streets of Cedar Cove....</p><p>Looking around, Mary Jo could see that the library was about to close. People were putting on coats and checking out their books. She wondered how an hour had disappeared so quickly. Now what? There wasn\u2019t a single vacant room in the entire vicinity, which meant the only thing to do was thank Grace Harding for her help and quietly leave.</p><p>She waited until the librarian stepped out of her office. The least she could do was let Grace know how much she appreciated her kindness. As she approached, Mary Jo rose from her chair.</p><p>All of a sudden the room started to sway. She\u2019d been dizzy before but never anything like this. Her head swam, and for an instant she seemed about to faint. Blindly Mary Jo reached out, hoping to catch herself before she fell.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo!\u201d Grace gasped and rushed to her side.</p><p>If the other woman hadn\u2019t caught her when she did, Mary Jo was convinced she would\u2019ve collapsed right onto the floor.</p><p>Slowly, Grace eased her into the chair. \u201cLaurie!\u201d she shouted, \u201ccall 9-1-1.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...no,\u201d Mary Jo protested. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, the assistant behind the front counter hurried over to join Grace and Mary Jo. \u201cThe fire department\u2019s on the way.\u201d</p><p>Mortified beyond words, Mary Jo leaned her head back and closed her eyes. Needless to say, she\u2019d become the library\u2019s main attraction, of far greater interest than any of the Christmas displays. Everyone was staring at her.</p><p>\u201cHere, drink this,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>Mary Jo opened her eyes to find someone holding out a glass of water\u2014again. Her mouth had gone completely dry and she accepted it gratefully. Sirens could be heard roaring toward the library, and Mary Jo would\u2019ve given anything to simply disappear.</p><p>A few minutes later, two firefighters entered the library, carrying their emergency medical equipment. Instantly one of the men moved toward her and knelt down.</p><p>\u201cHi, there.\u201d The firefighter\u2019s voice was calm.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Mary Jo returned weakly.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a bit light-headed. I wish you hadn\u2019t been called. I\u2019m perfectly okay.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her comment. \u201cYou stood up?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe room began to sway and I thought I was going to faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she did faint,\u201d Grace added, kneeling down next to the firefighter. \u201cI somehow got her back into the chair. Otherwise I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve crumpled to the floor.\u201d</p><p>The firefighter kept his gaze on Mary Jo. He had kind eyes and, despite everything, she noticed that he was attractive in a craggy, very masculine way. He was about her age, she decided, maybe a few years older.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Mack McAfee,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that guy\u2014\u201d he pointed to the other firefighter\u201c\u2014is Brandon Hutton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mary Jo Wyse.\u201d</p><p>Mack smiled, maintaining eye contact. \u201cWhen\u2019s your baby due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary seventh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn about two weeks then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had any other spells like this?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo was reluctant to confess that she had. After a moment she nodded.</p><p>\u201cRecently?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not uncommon, you know. Your body\u2019s under a lot of strain because of the baby. Have you been experiencing any additional stress?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m new to town. I guess that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t seen you around,\u201d Mack said. He opened a response kit he\u2019d brought into the library.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo lives in Seattle,\u201d Grace said, now standing behind Mack as the other firefighter hovered close by.</p><p>\u201cDo you have relatives in the area?\u201d he asked next.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d She shook her head, figuring she might as well admit the truth. \u201cI was hoping to see the father of my baby...only he isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNavy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I understood his family was from Cedar Cove, but apparently they\u2019re out of town, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen and Charlotte Rhodes,\u201d Grace murmured.</p><p>Mack twisted around to look up at Grace. \u201cThe judge\u2019s mother, right? And her husband. Retired Navy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid Rhodes is the baby\u2019s father,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not...together anymore.\u201d David had told her one too many lies. She knew intuitively that he\u2019d have no desire to be part of the baby\u2019s life.</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t speak as he took out the blood pressure cuff and wrapped it around her upper arm. \u201cHow are you feeling now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than mortified?\u201d</p><p>He grinned up at her. \u201cOther than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He took her blood pressure, a look of concentration on his face.</p><p>\u201cHow high is it?\u201d Grace asked, sounding worried.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Mack told them both. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly elevated.\u201d He turned back to Mary Jo. \u201cIt would probably be best if you relaxed for the rest of the day. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to stay off your feet, either. Don\u2019t do anything strenuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll...I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she should see a physician?\u201d Grace said. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to take her to the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t necessary!\u201d Mary Jo objected. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to cause all this fuss. I feel fine.\u201d</p><p>Mack met her gaze and seemed to read the distress in her eyes. \u201cAs long as you rest and stay calm, I don\u2019t think you need to see a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Although the library was closing, the doors suddenly opened and a tall, regal woman walked in. She was bundled up in a wool coat with a red knit scarf around her neck and a matching knit cap and gloves.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s the aid car out front?\u201d the other woman asked. Her gaze immediately rested on Mary Jo. A stricken look came over her. \u201cAre you in labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just...a little light-headed,\u201d Mary Jo assured her.</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cI already know who this must be. Mary Jo. Are you all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Olivia, Charlotte Rhodes\u2019s daughter.\u201d Grace gestured at her. \u201cShe\u2019s the woman I called to get the information about Ben and Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mary Jo shrank back in her chair.</p><p>\u201cDavid Rhodes is my stepbrother,\u201d Olivia explained. She smiled sympathetically at Mary Jo. \u201cAlthough so far, he\u2019s been nothing but an embarrassment to the family. And I can see that trend\u2019s continuing. But don\u2019t assume,\u201d she said to Mary Jo, \u201cthat I\u2019m blaming you. I know David far too well.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded mutely but couldn\u2019t prevent a surge of guilt that must have reddened her face, judging by her heated cheeks. She was to blame, for being naive in falling for a man like David, for being careless enough to get pregnant, for letting the situation ever reach this point.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Grace asked her friend a second time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Will at the gallery. We\u2019re going to lunch. I saw the aid car outside the library as I drove by.\u201d Olivia turned to Mary Jo again. \u201cI was afraid something like this had happened. Thank goodness for young Mack here\u2014\u201d they exchanged a smile \u201c\u2014and his partner over there.\u201d Brandon was helping an older couple with their bags of groceries and stack of books.</p><p>Mary Jo felt no less mortified. \u201cI should never have come,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d Olivia said firmly. \u201cBen would want to know about his grandchild.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo hadn\u2019t expected everyone to be so...nice. So friendly and willing to accept her\u2014and her dilemma. \u201cIt\u2019s just that my brothers are upset and determined to defend my honor. I felt I should be the one to tell David\u2019s family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you should,\u201d Olivia said in what appeared to be complete agreement.</p><p>Mack finished packing up his supplies. He placed his hand on Mary Jo\u2019s knee to gain her attention. When she looked back at him, she was struck by the gentle caring in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do as I suggested and rest? Don\u2019t get over-excited.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf you have any other problems, just call 9-1-1. I\u2019m on duty all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p> <p>Mack stood. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He hesitated for a moment and stared directly into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a good mom.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo blinked back tears. More than anything, that was what she wanted. To be the best mother she could. Her child was coming into the world with one disadvantage already\u2014the baby\u2019s father had no interest in him. Or her. It was all up to Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Mack said before he turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she called after him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest,\u201d Olivia said with an authority few would question. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you ate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a latte at Mocha Mama\u2019s before I came to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need lunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat,\u201d Mary Jo said, \u201cas soon as I get back to Seattle.\u201d There was the issue of her brothers, but she\u2019d just call Linc\u2019s cell phone and let them know she was on her way home.</p><p>\u201cYou drove?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I took the ferry across.\u201d</p><p>Grace and Olivia glanced at each other.</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good idea if you came home with me,\u201d Olivia began. \u201cIt won\u2019t be any inconvenience and we\u2019d enjoy having you.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo immediately shook her head. \u201cI...couldn\u2019t.\u201d Although Olivia was related to David, by marriage anyway, she didn\u2019t want to intrude on their Christmas. Olivia and her family certainly didn\u2019t need unexpected company. Olivia had stated that David was an embarrassment to the family, and Mary Jo\u2019s presence only made things worse. Bad enough that she\u2019d arrived without any warning, but it was beyond the call of duty for Olivia to take her in, and on Christmas Eve of all nights. Olivia must have plans and Mary Jo refused to ruin them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grace said emphatically. \u201cYou\u2019re coming home with me. It\u2019s already arranged.\u201d</p><p>This invitation was just as endearing and just as unnecessary. \u201cThank you both.\u201d She struggled to her feet, cradling her belly with protective hands. \u201cI can\u2019t let either of you do that. I appreciate everything, but I\u2019m going back to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to my husband and he agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grace cut her off, obviously unwilling to listen. \u201cYou won\u2019t be intruding, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo was about to argue again, but Grace talked right over her.</p><p>\u201cWe have my daughter-in-law and her family visiting us, but we\u2019ve got an apartment above our barn that\u2019s completely furnished. It\u2019s empty at the moment and you\u2019d be welcome to stay there for the night.\u201d</p><p>The invitation was tempting. Still, Mary Jo hesitated.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what Mack said?\u201d Grace reminded her. \u201cHe said it was important for you to remain calm and relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Olivia asked Grace. \u201cBecause I can easily make up the sofa bed in the den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to interfere with your Christmas,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Grace assured her. \u201cYou\u2019d have your privacy and we\u2019d have ours. The barn\u2019s close to the house, so if you needed anything it would be simple to reach me. There\u2019s a phone in the apartment, too, which I believe is still connected. If not, the line in the barn is hooked up.\u201d</p><p>The idea was gaining momentum in her mind. \u201cMaybe I could,\u201d Mary Jo murmured. As soon as she was settled, she\u2019d call her brothers and explain that she\u2019d decided to stay in Cedar Cove overnight. Besides, she was tired and depressed and didn\u2019t feel like celebrating. The idea of being by herself held more appeal by the minute.</p><p>Another plus was the fact that her brothers needed a break from her and her problems. For the last number of weeks, Mary Jo had been nothing but a burden to them, causing strife within the family. Thanks to her, the three of them were constantly bickering.</p><p>Ned was sympathetic to her situation and she loved him for it. But even he couldn\u2019t stand up to Linc, who took his responsibilities as head of the family much too seriously.</p><p>If her brothers were on their way to Cedar Cove, as she expected, she\u2019d ask them firmly but politely to turn around. She\u2019d tell them she was spending Christmas with David\u2019s family, which was, in fact, true. Sort of. By tomorrow evening, she would\u2019ve met with Ben and Charlotte and maybe Olivia and the rest of David\u2019s Cedar Cove relatives. They\u2019d resolve this difficult situation without her brothers\u2019 so-called help.</p><p>\u201cOne thing,\u201d Grace said, her voice falling as she glanced over at Olivia.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Mary Jo asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a slight complication.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo should\u2019ve known this was too good to be true.</p><p>\u201cThe barn\u2019s currently home to a...variety of animals,\u201d Grace went on to explain.</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t understand why this should be a problem, nor did she understand Olivia\u2019s smug grin.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an ox and several sheep, a donkey and\u2014\u201d she paused \u201c\u2014a camel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA camel?\u201d Mary Jo repeated.</p><p>\u201cA rather bad-tempered camel,\u201d Olivia put in.</p><p>Nodding, Grace pointed to her obviously bandaged arm. \u201cYou\u2019d be well advised to keep your distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, um, quite a menagerie you have living in your barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they don\u2019t belong to us,\u201d Grace said. \u201cThey\u2019re for the live Nativity scene, which ended last evening. We\u2019re housing them for the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe animals won\u2019t bother me.\u201d Mary Jo smiled. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t bother them.\u201d</p><p>Her smile grew wider as it occurred to her that she\u2019d be spending Christmas Eve in a stable\u2014something another Mary had done before her.</p><p>6</p><p>Olivia reluctantly left the library by herself. Weak as she was these days, it made more sense for Mary Jo to go home with Grace. Nevertheless, Olivia felt a certain obligation toward this vulnerable young woman.</p><p>Olivia had never had positive feelings toward her stepbrother, and this situation definitely hadn\u2019t improved her impression of him. Ben\u2019s son could be deceptive and cruel. She knew very well that David had lied to Mary Jo Wyse. Sure, it took two to tango, as that old clich\u00e9 had it\u2014and two to get Mary Jo into her present state. But Olivia also knew that David would have misrepresented himself and, even worse, abdicated all responsibility for Mary Jo and his child. No wonder her family was in an uproar. Olivia didn\u2019t blame them; she would be, too.</p><p>The drive from the library to Harbor Street Gallery took less than two minutes. Olivia hated driving such a short distance when at any other time in her life she would\u2019ve walked those few blocks. The problem was that those blocks were a steep uphill climb and she didn\u2019t have the energy. The surgery and subsequent infection had sapped her of strength and energy. Today, however, wasn\u2019t a day to dwell on the cancer that had struck her so unexpectedly, like a viper hiding in the garden. Today, Christmas Eve, was a day for gratitude and hope.</p><p>She parked outside the art gallery her brother had purchased and was renovating. Olivia had been the one to suggest he buy the gallery; he\u2019d done so, and it seemed to be a good decision for him.</p><p>Will was waiting for her at the door. \u201cLiv!\u201d he said, bounding toward her in his larger-than-life way. He extended his arms for a hug. \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same to you,\u201d she said, smiling up at him. Her brother, although over sixty, remained a strikingly handsome man. Now divorced and retired, he\u2019d come home to reinvent himself, leaving behind his former life in Atlanta. In the beginning Olivia had doubted his motives, but slowly he\u2019d begun to prove himself, becoming an active member of the town\u2014and his family\u2014once again.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you a tour of the gallery,\u201d Will told her, as he led her inside.</p><p>The last time Olivia had visited the town\u2019s art gallery had been while Maryellen Bowman, Grace\u2019s daughter, was the manager. Maryellen had been forced to resign during a difficult pregnancy. The business had rapidly declined once she\u2019d left, and eventually the gallery had gone up for sale.</p><p>Gazing around, Olivia could hardly believe the changes. \u201cYou did all this in less than a month?\u201d The place barely resembled the old Harbor Street Gallery. Before Will had taken over, artwork had been arranged in a simple, straightforward manner\u2014paintings and photographs on the walls, sculpture on tables.</p><p>Will had built distinctive multi-level glass cases and brought in other inventive means of displaying a variety of mediums, including a carefully designed lighting system. One entire wall was taken up with a huge quilt, unlike any she\u2019d seen before. At first glance she had the impression of fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Close up, it looked abstract, with vivid clashing colors and surreal, swirling shapes. But, stepping back, Olivia identified an image that suddenly emerged\u2014a dragon. It was fierce, angry, red, shooting out flames in gold, purple and orange satin against a background that incorporated trees, water and winding roads.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s by Shirley Bliss,\u201d Will said, following her gaze.</p><p>\u201cIt took me weeks to convince her to let me put that up. I only have it until New Year\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s magnificent.\u201d Olivia was in awe of the piece and couldn\u2019t tear her eyes from it.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t for sale, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cShe calls it Death. She created it shortly after her husband was killed in a motorcycle accident.\u201d He slipped an arm through Olivia\u2019s. \u201cCan\u2019t you just feel her anger and her grief?\u201d</p><p>The quilt seemed to vibrate with emotions Olivia recognized from her own life\u2014the time her 13-year-old son had drowned, more than twenty years ago. And the time, only weeks ago, that she\u2019d been diagnosed with cancer. When she initially heard the physician say the word, she\u2019d had a nearly irrepressible urge to argue with him. This couldn\u2019t be happening to her. Clearly there\u2019d been some mistake.</p><p>That disbelief had been replaced by a hot anger at the unfairness of it. Then came numbness, then grief and finally resignation. With Jordan\u2019s death and with her own cancer, she\u2019d experienced a tremendous loss that had brought with it fears of further loss.</p> <p>Now, fighting her cancer\u2014and that was how she thought of it, her cancer\u2014she\u2019d found a shaky serenity, even a sort of peace. That kind of acceptance was something she\u2019d acquired with the love and assistance of her husband, Jack, her family and, as much as anyone, Grace, the woman who\u2019d been her best friend her entire life.</p><p>\u201cMy living quarters are livable now, too,\u201d Will was telling her. \u201cI\u2019ve moved in upstairs but I\u2019m still sorting through boxes. Isn\u2019t it great how things turned out? Because of Mack,\u201d he added when Olivia looked at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cGetting the job here in town, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, since that meant he needed an apartment. At the same time, I needed out of the sublet, so it worked out perfectly.\u201d</p><p>After a quick turn around the gallery to admire the other pieces on display, Will steered her toward the door. \u201cWhere would you like to go for lunch?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnyplace in town. Your big brother\u2019s treating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, seeing you\u2019ve got all that money burning a hole in your pocket, how about the Pancake Palace?\u201d</p> <p>Will arched his brows. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d The Pancake Palace had long been a favorite of hers and in the past month or two, she\u2019d missed it. For years, Grace and Olivia would head over to their favorite high school hangout after aerobics class on Wednesday night. The coconut cream pie and coffee was like a reward for their exertions, and the Palace was where they always caught up with each other\u2019s news.</p><p>Goldie, their favorite waitress, had served them salty French fries and iced sodas back when neither of them worried about calories. These days their once-a-week splurge reminded them of their youth, and the nostalgic appeal of the place never faded.</p><p>Some of the most defining moments of their teenage years had occurred at the Pancake Palace. It was there that eighteen-year-old Grace admitted she was pregnant, shortly before graduation.</p><p>And years later, it\u2019d been over coffee and tears that Olivia confessed Stan had asked for a divorce after Jordan\u2019s death. And later, it was where Olivia told her she\u2019d been appointed to the bench. The Pancake Palace was a place of memories for them, good as well as bad.</p><p>\u201cThe Pancake Palace? You\u2019re really serious?\u201d Will said again. \u201cI can afford a lot better, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked and that\u2019s my choice.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cThen off to the Palace we go.\u201d</p> <p>Her brother insisted on driving and Olivia couldn\u2019t fault his manners. He was the consummate gentleman, opening the passenger door for her and helping her inside. The snow that had fallen earlier dusted the buildings and trees but had melted on the sidewalks and roads, leaving them slick. The slate-gray skies promised more snow, however.</p><p>Olivia had been out with her brother plenty of times and he\u2019d never bothered with her car door. She was his sister and manners were reserved for others.</p><p>She wondered if Will\u2019s solicitude was linked to her illness. Although he might\u2019ve been reluctant to admit it, Will had been frightened. His caring comforted her, particularly since they\u2019d been at odds during the past few years.</p><p>He assisted her out of the car and opened the door to the Pancake Palace. They\u2019d hardly entered the restaurant when Goldie appeared.</p><p>\u201cWell, as I live and breathe, it\u2019s Olivia!\u201d Goldie cried. Then she shocked Olivia by throwing both sinewy arms around her. \u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Goldie,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>The waitress had to be close to seventy and could only be described as \u201ccrusty.\u201d To Olivia\u2019s utter astonishment, Goldie pulled a hankie from her pink uniform pocket and dabbed at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever see you again,\u201d she said with a sniffle.</p><p>\u201cOh, Goldie...\u201d Olivia had no idea what to say at this uncharacteristic display of affection.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what Grace and I would\u2019ve done without you,\u201d Goldie said, sniffling even more. She wiped her nose and stuffed the hankie back in her pocket. Reaching for the coffeepot behind the counter, she motioned with her free hand. \u201cSit anyplace you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Goldie.\u201d Olivia was genuinely touched, since Goldie maintained strict control of who sat where.</p><p>Although Goldie had given her free rein, Olivia chose the booth where she\u2019d sat with Grace every Wednesday night until recently. It felt good to slide across the cracked red vinyl cushion again. Olivia resisted the urge to close her eyes and breathe in the scent of this familiar restaurant. The coffee had always been strong and a hint of maple syrup lingered, although it was long past the breakfast hour.</p><p>Goldie automatically righted their coffee mugs and filled them. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a turkey dinner with all the trimmings if you\u2019re interested,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Olivia still struggled with her appetite. \u201cWhat\u2019s the soup of the day?\u201d</p><p>Goldie frowned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t having just soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d the waitress chastised. \u201cYou\u2019re as thin as a flagpole. If you don\u2019t want a big meal, then I suggest chicken pot pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Will said.</p><p>Goldie ignored him. She whipped the pencil from behind her ear and yanked out the pad in her apron pocket. From sheer force of habit, or so Olivia suspected, she licked the lead. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s it gonna be? And make up your mind,\u2019 cause the lunch crowd\u2019s coming in a few minutes and we\u2019re gonna be real busy.\u201d</p><p>It was all Olivia could do to hide her amusement. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take the chicken pot pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice.\u201d Goldie made a notation on her pad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting pie \u00e0 la mode, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoldie!\u201d</p><p>One hand on her hip, Goldie glared at her. \u201cAfter all these years, you should know better than to argue with me.\u201d She turned to Will. \u201cAnd that goes for you, too, young man.\u201d</p><p>Will raised his hands in acquiescence as Olivia sputtered. \u201cI stand corrected,\u201d she said, grinning despite her efforts to keep a straight face.</p><p>Goldie left to place their order and Will grinned, too. \u201cI guess you were told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I was,\u201d she agreed. It was nice to know she\u2019d been missed.</p><p>Grace would get a real kick out of hearing about this. Olivia would make a point of telling her when they met at the Christmas Eve service later that evening.</p><p>Looking out the window, Olivia studied the hand-painted snowman, surrounded by falling snow. The glass next to Will was adorned with a big-eyed reindeer. A small poinsettia sat on every table, and the sights and sounds of Christmas filled the room as \u201cO, Little Town of Bethlehem\u201d played softly in the background.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t convince you to join us for Christmas dinner?\u201d Olivia asked her brother.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI appreciate the offer, but you\u2019re not up for company yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing Justine and her family tonight. It\u2019s just going to be Jack and me for Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. The two of you don\u2019t need a third wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be like that,\u201d Olivia protested. \u201cI hate the idea of you spending Christmas alone.\u201d</p><p>Will sat back. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll be alone?\u201d</p><p>Olivia raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou mean you won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He gave a small noncommittal shrug.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d She breathed his name slowly. She didn\u2019t want to bring up past history, but in her view, Will wasn\u2019t to be trusted with women. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing someone, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The fact that Will was being secretive didn\u2019t bode well. \u201cCome on,\u201d she urged him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t married, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That, at least, was a relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting over, Liv. My slate\u2019s clean now and I want to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>Olivia certainly hoped so. \u201cTell me who it is,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Her brother relaxed and folded his hands on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Shirley Bliss a few times.\u201d</p><p>Shirley Bliss. She was the artist who\u2019d created the dragon, breathing fire and pain and anger.</p><p>\u201cShirley,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe dragon lady.\u201d Olivia hadn\u2019t even met the woman but sensed they could easily be friends.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one,\u201d Will said. \u201cWe\u2019re only getting to know each other but I\u2019m impressed with her. She\u2019s someone I\u2019d definitely like to know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe invited you for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Will shifted his weight and looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Olivia frowned. \u201cEither she did or she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it like this. She hasn\u2019t invited me yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, Will! It\u2019s Christmas Eve. If she was going to invite you, it would\u2019ve been before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He grinned boyishly. \u201cActually, I thought I\u2019d stop by her place around dinnertime tomorrow with a small gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t blame a man for trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be by herself?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe has two teenagers, a daughter who\u2019s a talented artist, too, and a son who\u2019s in college. I haven\u2019t met him yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Will could say anything else, Goldie arrived at their booth, carrying two chicken pot pies. She set them down and came back with two huge pieces of coconut cream pie. \u201cMake sure you save room for this,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to remind you I didn\u2019t order any pie,\u201d Olivia said, pretending to disapprove.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Goldie returned gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s on the house. Think of me as your very own elf. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas to you, Goldie the Elf.\u201d</p> <p>Will reached for his fork and smiled over at Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI have the feeling it\u2019s going to be a merry Christmas for us all.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had the very same feeling, despite\u2014or maybe even because of\u2014their unexpected visitor.</p><p>7</p><p>Linc gritted his teeth. It was after two, and the traffic through Tacoma was bumper to bumper. \u201cYou\u2019d think it was a holiday or something,\u201d he muttered sarcastically.</p> <p>Mel\u2019s eyebrows shot up and he turned to look at Ned in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Linc barked.</p><p>\u201cIt is a holiday,\u201d Ned reminded him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that? I\u2019m joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to exit up here,\u201d Mel said, pointing to the exit ramp for Highway 16.</p> <p>Linc sighed in relief. They were getting closer, and once they found Mary Jo he intended to give her a piece of his mind. She had no business taking off like this, not when her baby was due in two weeks. It just wasn\u2019t safe.</p><p>His jaw tightened as he realized it wasn\u2019t Mary Jo who annoyed him as much as David Rhodes. If Linc could just have five minutes alone with that jerk...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s married,\u201d Linc said to himself. That would explain a lot. A married man would do anything he could to hide the fact that he had a wife. He\u2019d strung Mary Jo along, fed her a bunch of lies and then left her to deal with the consequences all on her own. Well, that wasn\u2019t going to happen. No, sir. Not while Linc was alive. David Rhodes was going to acknowledge his responsibilities and live up to them.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s married?\u201d Mel asked, staring at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cDavid Rhodes,\u201d he said. \u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>The exit was fast approaching and, while they still had twenty miles to go, traffic would thin out once he was off the Interstate.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not,\u201d Ned said blithely from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t what?\u201d Linc demanded.</p> <p>\u201cDavid Rhodes isn\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>Linc glanced over his shoulder. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo told me.\u201d</p><p>Ned and Mary Jo were close, and he was more apt to take a statement like that at face value.</p><p>\u201cHe probably lied about that along with everything else,\u201d Mel said, voicing Linc\u2019s own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Ned insisted.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked him out on the Internet,\u201d Ned continued with the same certainty. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of public record. David Rhodes lives in California and he\u2019s been married and divorced twice. Both his marriages and divorces are listed with California\u2019s Department of Records.\u201d</p><p>Funny Ned had only mentioned this now. Maybe he had other information that would be helpful.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say he\u2019s been married more than once?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>Ned nodded. \u201cYeah, according to what I read, he\u2019s been married twice. I doubt Mary Jo knows about the second time, though.\u201d</p><p>That was interesting and Linc wished he\u2019d heard it earlier. \u201cDid you find out anything else while you were doing this background search?\u201d he asked. He eased onto the off ramp; as he\u2019d expected, the highway was far less crowded.</p><p>\u201cHis first ex-wife, who now lives in Florida, has had problems collecting child support.\u201d</p><p>Linc shook his head. \u201cDoes that surprise anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cHow many children does he have?\u201d Linc asked next.</p><p>\u201cJust one. A girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Mary Jo know this?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cAbout him being a deadbeat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her,\u201d Ned admitted, adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t see any reason to upset her more than she already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Mel said. He leaned forward and looked up at the darkening sky. \u201cSnow\u2019s starting again. The radio said there\u2019s going to be at least three inches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnow,\u201d Linc muttered.</p><p>\u201cSnow,\u201d Ned repeated excitedly. \u201cThat\u2019ll make a lot of little kids happy.\u201d</p><p>Mel agreed quickly. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll have a white Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre either of you little kids?\u201d Linc snapped. His nerves were frayed and he\u2019d appreciate it if his brothers took a more mature outlook.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m still a kid at heart,\u201d Ned said, exhaling a sigh.</p><p>Considering Linc\u2019s current frame of mind, it was a brave admission. With a slow breath, Linc made a concerted effort to relax. He was worried about Mary Jo; he couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019d wanted the best for her and felt that he\u2019d failed both his sister and his parents.</p><p>To some extent he blamed himself for what had happened. Maybe he\u2019d been too strict with her after she turned eighteen. But to his way of thinking, she was under his protection as long as she lived in the family home.</p><p>Not once had she introduced him to David Rhodes. Linc was convinced that if he\u2019d met the other man, it would\u2019ve taken him all of two seconds to peg David for a phony.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna say when we find her?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>Linc hadn\u2019t worked out the specifics. \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that now. Main thing is, we\u2019re going to put her in the truck and bring her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t want to come with us?\u201d</p><p>Linc hadn\u2019t considered this. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she? We\u2019re her family and it\u2019s Christmas Eve. Mary Jo belongs with us. Anyway, that baby could show up any time.\u201d</p><p>Mel seemed distinctly queasy at the prospect.</p><p>Thinking back, Linc realized he should have recognized the signs a lot earlier than he had. In fact, he hadn\u2019t recognized them at all; she\u2019d told him and after that, of course, the signs were easy to see.</p><p>Not until the day Mary Jo rushed past him in the hallway and practically shoved him into the wall so she could get to the toilet in time to throw up did he have the slightest suspicion that anything was wrong. Even then he\u2019d assumed she had a bad case of the flu.</p><p>Boy, had he been wrong. She had the flu, all right, only it was the nine-month variety.</p><p>It just hadn\u2019t occurred to him that she\u2019d do something so dumb. An affair with the guy was bad enough, but to take that kind of chance...</p><p>Frowning, Linc glanced in his rearview mirror at his youngest brother. He was beginning to wonder about Ned. He\u2019d never seemed as shocked as he or Mel had, and Mary Jo had always confided in him.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d he casually asked.</p><p>Ned met Linc\u2019s gaze in the rearview mirror, his expression trapped. \u201cKnown what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Mary Jo was going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>Ned looked away quickly and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cShe told you as soon as she found out, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Ned cleared his throat. \u201cShe might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow early was that?\u201d Linc asked, unwilling to let his brother sidestep the question.</p><p>\u201cEarly,\u201d Ned admitted. \u201cI knew before David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew that early?\u201d Mel shouted. \u201cWhy\u2019d she tell you and not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d tell Linc,\u201d Ned told him. \u201cShe wanted to keep the baby a secret as long as she could.\u201d</p><p>Linc couldn\u2019t figure that one out. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d be able to hide the pregnancy forever. And why hadn\u2019t she trusted him the way she did Ned? Although he prided himself on being stoic, that hurt.</p><p>Mel tapped his fingertips against the console. \u201cDid she tell you how David Rhodes reacted to the news?\u201d</p><p>Ned nodded. \u201cShe said he seemed pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Linc said, rolling his eyes. \u201cThe pregnancy wasn\u2019t going to inconvenience him any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s why he could string Mary Jo along all this time,\u201d Ned suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned her, you know.\u201d Ned\u2019s look was thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she first started seeing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about David even before Mary Jo got pregnant?\u201d Linc couldn\u2019t believe his ears. Apparently Mary Jo had shared all this information with Ned, who\u2019d remained tight-lipped about most of it. If he wasn\u2019t so curious to uncover what his brother had learned, Linc might\u2019ve been downright angry.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Mel said. \u201cHow\u2019d she meet him?\u201d</p><p>Ned leaned toward the front seat. \u201cRhodes works for the same insurance company. He\u2019s at corporate headquarters in San Francisco. Something to do with finances.\u201d</p><p>His sister worked in the accounting department, so that explained it, he supposed. \u201cShe should\u2019ve come to work at our office the way I wanted,\u201d Linc said, and not for the first time. That was what he\u2019d suggested when, against his wishes, Mary Jo had dropped out of college.</p><p>From her reaction, one would think he\u2019d proposed slave labor. He never had understood her objections. He\u2019d been willing to pay her top wages, as well as vacation and sick leave, and the work wasn\u2019t exactly strenuous.</p><p>She\u2019d turned him down flat. Mary Jo wouldn\u2019t even consider working for Three Wyse Men Automotive. Linc regretted not being more forceful in light of what had happened. She might be almost twenty-four, but she needed his protection.</p><p>As they approached the Narrows Bridge, Linc\u2019s mood began to lighten somewhat. Yeah, Mary Jo needed him, and he assumed she\u2019d be willing to admit that now. Not just him, either. She depended on all three of her brothers.</p><p>Ned\u2019s idea that they bring gifts had been smart, a good way to placate her and prove how much she meant to them. Women, in his experience anyway, responded well to gifts.</p><p>Except that was probably the same technique David Rhodes had used.</p><p>\u201cDid he buy her gifts?\u201d Linc asked, frowning.</p><p>Ned understood his question, because he answered right away. \u201cIf you mean Rhodes, then yes, he got her a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers!\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning, at any rate, and then after she was pregnant he bought her earrings.\u201d</p><p>Linc sat up straighter. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>Ned snickered. \u201cHe said they were diamonds but one of them came loose so I dropped it off at Fred\u2019s for her. While he had it, I asked him to check it out.\u201d</p><p>Fred\u2019s was a local jewelry store the Wyse family had used for years. \u201cFake, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs phony as David Rhodes himself.\u201d</p><p>Mel twisted around and looked at Ned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Mary Jo, did you?\u201d</p><p>Ned shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to add to her heartache.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe she already knows.\u201d His sister might be gullible but she wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>\u201cI think she considered pawning it,\u201d Ned muttered, lowering his voice. \u201cShe didn\u2019t, so she might\u2019ve guessed....\u201d</p><p>The mere thought of his sister walking into a pawnshop with her pathetic bauble produced a stab of actual pain. \u201cIf she needed money, why didn\u2019t she come to me?\u201d Linc demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her that yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI plan to.\u201d Linc wasn\u2019t about to let this slide. \u201cWhat does she need money for, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants her own place, you know.\u201d</p><p>No one needed to remind Linc of that. Mary Jo did a fine job of informing him at every opportunity. But it wasn\u2019t going to happen now. With a baby on the way, she wouldn\u2019t be leaving the family home anytime soon.</p><p>Linc liked that idea. He could keep an eye on her and on the baby, too. Even if he married Jillian, which was by no means a sure thing, the house was big enough for all of them. His nephew would need a strong male influence, and he fully intended to provide that influence.</p><p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>His brother was like a kid squirming in the front seat, asking \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d every five minutes.</p><p>\u201cHey, look,\u201d Ned said, pointing at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s really coming down now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I hadn\u2019t noticed?\u201d Linc didn\u2019t have much trouble driving in bad weather; it was all the other drivers who caused the problem. Snow in the Seattle area was infrequent and a lot of folks didn\u2019t know how to handle it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mel said as they approached the first exit for Cedar Cove. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Not having any more specific indication of where they should go, Linc took the exit.</p><p>\u201cWhere to now?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>Linc could\u2019ve said, \u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d But he figured his guess was actually better. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what Mary Jo did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll chase down David\u2019s family. That\u2019s where she\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>Mel nodded. \u201cWhoever said the Wyse Men needed a star to guide them obviously never met the three of us.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t wait to see her husband. For one thing, she wanted to tell him about her stepbrother, get his advice.</p><p>David Rhodes...that...that\u2014she couldn\u2019t think of a word that adequately described how loathsome he was. She wanted him exposed. Humiliated, embarrassed, punished. Only the fact that Ben would be humiliated and embarrassed, too, gave her pause.</p><p>When Olivia pulled into her driveway on Lighthouse Road she was delighted to see that Jack was already home from the newspaper office. Impatiently, she grabbed the grocery bag of last-minute items and made her way into the house, using the entrance off the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d she called out as soon as she was inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Her husband met her in the kitchen and stopped short. \u201cSomeone\u2019s made you mad.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia finished unwinding the muffler from around her neck. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d she asked, not realizing she\u2019d been so obvious.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are shooting sparks. So, what\u2019d I do this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, silly.\u201d She hung her coat on the hook along with the bright red scarf her mother had knit for her. She stuffed the matching hat and gloves in the pockets, then kissed Jack\u2019s cheek.</p><p>As she filled the electric teakettle and turned it on, Jack began to put the groceries away.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to talk about it?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhodes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very one. The man is lower than pond scum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not news.\u201d</p><p>Early in her mother\u2019s marriage to Ben, his son had tried to bilk Charlotte out of several thousand dollars. He\u2019d used a ruse about needing some surgery his medical insurance wouldn\u2019t cover, and if not for Justine\u2019s intervention, Charlotte would have given him the money. David Rhodes was shameless, and he\u2019d dishonored his father\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cIs he in town?\u201d Jack asked. He took two mugs from the cupboard and set them on the counter; Olivia tossed a couple of Earl Grey teabags in the pot.</p><p>\u201cNo, or at least not as far as I\u2019m aware. And frankly it\u2019s a good thing he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more, and I haven\u2019t got a clue what he\u2019s done to upset you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got a young girl pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyebrows rose toward his hairline. \u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot more than two hours ago. She\u2019s young, probably twenty years younger than he is, and innocent. Or she was until David got hold of her. I swear that man should be shot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d He seemed shocked by her words. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that might be drastic. I\u2019m just so furious I can hardly stand it.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned.</p><p>With her hands on her hips, Olivia glared at her husband. \u201cYou find this amusing, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not about this young lady but I will admit it\u2019s a pleasant change to see color in your cheeks and your eyes sparkling, even if it\u2019s with outrage.\u201d He reached for her and brought her close enough to kiss her lips, allowing his own to linger. When he released her, he pressed his forehead to hers and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s an even greater pleasure to know all this indignation isn\u2019t directed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere near this upset with you, Jack Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember one time,\u201d Jack said, \u201cwhen I thought you were going to kick me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never have done that.\u201d Her arms circled his waist. They\u2019d found ways to make their marriage work, ways to compromise between his nature\u2014he was a slob, not to put too fine a point on it\u2014and hers.</p><p>Olivia liked order. Their bathroom dilemma was a perfect example. She\u2019d been driven to the brink of fury by the piles of damp towels, the spattered mirror, the uncapped toothpaste. The solution? They had their own bathrooms now. She kept the one off the master bedroom and he had the guest bath. Jack could be as sloppy as he wanted, as long as he closed the door and Olivia didn\u2019t have to see his mess.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I love you so much,\u201d Jack whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, leaning back to look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d be lost without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack...\u201d</p><p>The kettle started to boil, its piercing whistle enough to set the dogs in the next block howling. She tried to break free, but Jack held her fast. \u201cAdmit it,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d be lost without me. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>Grinning like a schoolboy, he let her go and she grabbed the kettle, relieved by the sudden cessation of that high-pitched shrieking.</p><p>Pouring the boiling water into the teapot, she covered it with a cozy and left the tea to steep. Then she opened the cookie jar and chose two of the decorated sugar cookies she\u2019d baked a few days earlier with her grandson\u2014a tree shape and a star. The afternoon had worn her out physically but she treasured every moment she\u2019d spent in the kitchen with Leif.</p><p>Just as she was about to pour their tea, the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cWant me to get that?\u201d Jack called from the other room.</p><p>A glance at Caller ID told her it was Grace.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she told him. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she said into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas to you, too,\u201d her friend said in return. \u201cI thought I\u2019d check in and let you know how everything\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the update?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Grace assured her.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo\u2019s resting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was asleep the last time I looked, which was about five minutes ago. The girl must be exhausted. She told me she didn\u2019t get much sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the apartment then, or at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe apartment. Cliff\u2019s daughter and her family are already here, so...\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with the idea of leaving Mary Jo alone, but it was probably for the best. This way she could rest undisturbed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something strange....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, for no reason I can understand, I decided to do a bit of housekeeping in the apartment yesterday. Cal\u2019s been gone a few weeks now, and I put clean sheets on the bed and fresh towels in the bathroom. It\u2019s as if...as if I was waiting for Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>That was a little too mystical for Olivia. \u201cI\u2019m so glad this is working out,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an animal-lover, too.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t surprise Olivia. She sensed that Mary Jo had a gentleness about her, a soft heart, an interest in others.</p><p>\u201cThe minute I brought her into the barn, she wanted to see all the Nativity animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept her away from that camel, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept us both away,\u201d Grace was quick to tell her.</p><p>\u201cThat beast is going to have to chew on someone else\u2019s arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, David\u2019s would be ideal,\u201d Olivia muttered.</p><p>Grace laughed, but sobered almost immediately. \u201cListen, Mary Jo has a concern I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got three older brothers who are probably on their way into town, looking for her, as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she want to be found?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI think she does, only she wants to talk to Ben and Charlotte before her brothers do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not trying to protect David, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. What she\u2019s afraid of is that her brothers might insist David marry her and she doesn\u2019t want to. At this point, she\u2019s accepted that she\u2019s better off without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it came at quite a price, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. A lesson with lifelong consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all seem to learn our lessons the hard way,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cI know I did.\u201d Her children, too, Olivia mused. Justine and James. As always, especially around the holidays, her mind wandered to Jordan, the son she\u2019d lost that summer day all those years ago. Justine\u2019s twin.</p><p>\u201cWhat time are Maryellen and Kelly coming by?\u201d she asked, changing the subject. Although Mary Jo would be staying in the barn, perhaps she should bring her over for dinner. Give her a chance to feel welcomed by Ben\u2019s second family. Cliff\u2019s daughter, Lisa, her husband and their little girl, April, were out doing some last-minute shopping, apparently, and not due back until late afternoon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy girls should be here around six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going straight to church after dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Grace told her. \u201cI was going to invite Mary Jo to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor dinner or Christmas Eve service?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth, actually, but I\u2019m having second thoughts.\u201d Grace hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWhy? And about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, about inviting Mary Jo to dinner. I\u2019m afraid it might be too much for her. We\u2019ll have five grandkids running around. You know how much racket children can make, and double that for Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do for her?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cShould I ask her to have dinner here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll talk to her when she wakes up and then I\u2019ll phone you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And tell her not to worry about her brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d Olivia echoed.</p><p>After setting down the phone, Olivia poured the tea and placed both mugs on the table, followed by the plate of cookies, and called Jack into the kitchen again.</p> <p>His eyes widened in overstated surprise. \u201cCookies? For me? You shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can still put them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d He grabbed the star-shaped cookie and bit off one point. \u201cWhat\u2019s this in honor of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had pie with lunch. So I\u2019m trying to be fair.\u201d</p><p>Knowing her disciplined eating habits, Jack did a double-take. \u201cYou ate pie? At lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoldie made me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoldie,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou mean Will took you to the Pancake Palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where I wanted to go.\u201d</p> <p>Jack sat down, grabbed the tree cookie and bit into that, too. \u201cYou\u2019re a cheap date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that remark. \u201cDid you enjoy lunch with Will?\u201d he asked, then sipped his tea. Jack was familiar with their sometimes tumultuous relationship.</p><p>\u201cI did, although I\u2019m a little worried.\u201d Olivia crossed her legs and held the mug in the palm of her hand. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in Shirley Bliss, a local artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not married, is she?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cA widow.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cThen it\u2019s okay if he wants to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know if I can trust my brother. It pains me to admit that, but still...\u201d She left the rest unsaid. Jack knew her brother and his flaws as well as she did. \u201cI want him to be successful here,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cHe\u2019s starting over, and at this stage of his life that can\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine it will be,\u201d Jack agreed. \u201cBy the way, who was that on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace. She called to update me on Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but she said we need to keep an eye out for three irate brothers who might show up looking for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vigilante posse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d But now that Olivia thought about it, it might not be so bad if Mary Jo\u2019s brothers stumbled onto David Rhodes instead. \u201cIf her brothers find anyone, it should be David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019d certainly be justice in that, but David\u2019s not going to let himself be found. And I think we should be focusing on the young woman, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His tone was gentle, but Olivia felt chastened. \u201cYes\u2014and her baby.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Mary Jo woke feeling confused. She sat up in bed and gazed around at the sparsely decorated room before she remembered where she was. Grace Harding had brought her home and was letting her spend the night in this apartment above the barn. It was such a kind thing to do. She was a stranger, after all, a stranger with problems who\u2019d appeared out of nowhere on Christmas Eve.</p><p>Stretching her arms high above her head, Mary Jo yawned loudly. She was still tired, despite her nap. Her watch told her she\u2019d been asleep for the better part of two hours. Two hours!</p><p>Other than in her first trimester, she hadn\u2019t required a lot of extra rest during her pregnancy, but that had changed in the past few weeks. Of course some of it could be attributed to David and his lies. Wondering what she should believe and whether he\u2019d meant any of what he\u2019d said had kept her awake many a night. Consequently she was tired during the day; while she was still working she\u2019d nap during her lunch break.</p><p>Forcing her eyes shut, Mary Jo made an effort to cast David from her mind. She quickly gave up. Tossing aside the covers, Mary Jo climbed out of bed, put on her shoes and left the apartment. The stairway led to the interior of the barn.</p><p>As soon as she stepped into the barn, several animals stuck their heads out of the stalls to study her curiously. The first she saw was a lovely horse. Grace had introduced her as Funny Face.</p><p>\u201cHello there, girl.\u201d Mary Jo walked slowly toward the stall door. \u201cRemember me?\u201d The mare nodded in what seemed to be an encouraging manner, and Mary Jo ran her hand down the horse\u2019s unusually marked face. The mare had a white ring around one eye and it was easy to see why the Hardings had named her Funny Face. Her dark, intelligent eyes made Mary Jo think of an old story she recalled from childhood\u2014that animals can talk for a few hours after midnight on Christmas Eve\u2014and she wondered what Funny Face would say. Probably something very wise.</p><p>The camel seemed curious, too, and thrust her long curved neck out of the stall, peering at Mary Jo through wide eyes, fringed with lush, curling lashes. Mary Jo had been warned to keep her distance. \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d she muttered, waving her index finger. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lure me over there with those big brown eyes. Don\u2019t give me that innocent look, either. I\u2019ve heard all about you.\u201d</p><p>After visiting a few placid sheep, another couple of horses and a donkey with a sweet disposition, Mary Jo walked out of the barn. She hurried toward the house through a light snowfall, wishing she\u2019d remembered her coat. Even before she arrived, the front door opened and an attractive older gentleman held open the screen.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Mary Jo,\u201d he said and thrust out his hand in greeting. \u201cCliff Harding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Harding,\u201d she said with a smile. She was about to thank him for his hospitality when he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cCall me Cliff, okay? And come in, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo entered the house and was greeted by the smell of roasting turkey and sage and apple pie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d Grace declared as she stepped out of the kitchen. She wore an apron and had smudges of flour on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked I slept for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously needed the rest,\u201d Grace commented, leading her into the kitchen. \u201cI see you\u2019ve met my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mary Jo smiled again. Rubbing her palms nervously together, she looked from one to the other. \u201cI really can\u2019t thank you enough for everything you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nonsense. It\u2019s the least we could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a stranger and you took me in without question and, well...I didn\u2019t think that kind of thing happened in this day and age.\u201d</p><p>That observation made Grace frown. \u201cReally? It does here in Cedar Cove. I guess it\u2019s just how people act in small towns. We tend to be more trusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a similar experience when I first moved here,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t accustomed to people going out of their way for someone they didn\u2019t know. Charlotte Jefferson\u2014now Charlotte Rhodes\u2014quickly disabused me of that notion.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, Mary Jo looked forward to meeting David\u2019s stepmother. The conversation would be difficult, but knowing that Charlotte was as kind as everyone else she\u2019d met so far made all the difference.</p><p>\u201cReally, Mary Jo,\u201d Grace continued. \u201cAll you needed was a friend and a helping hand. Anyone here would\u2019ve done the same. Olivia wanted you to stay with her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s been so wonderful.\u201d Thinking about the willingness of this family to take her in brought a lump to her throat. She bent, with some effort, to stroke the smooth head of a golden retriever who lay on a rug near the stove.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Buttercup,\u201d Grace said fondly as the dog thumped her tail but didn\u2019t get up. \u201cShe\u2019s getting old, like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Cliff walked over to the coffeemaker. \u201cIt\u2019s decaf. Are you interested?\u201d he asked, motioning in Mary Jo\u2019s direction with the pot. \u201cOr would you prefer tea? Maybe some chamomile or peppermint tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea, please. If it isn\u2019t any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever. I\u2019m having a cup myself.\u201d Grace began the preparations, then suddenly asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat any lunch, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not be, but that baby of yours is,\u201d Grace announced as if she had a direct line of communication to the unborn child. Without asking further, she walked to the refrigerator and stuck her head inside. Adjusting various containers and bottles and packages, she took out a plastic-covered bowl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause you any extra work,\u201d Mary Jo protested.</p><p>\u201cThe work\u2019s already done. Cliff made the most delicious clam chowder,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI\u2019ll heat you up some.\u201d</p><p>Now that Grace mentioned it, Mary Jo realized she really could use something to eat; she was getting light-headed again. \u201cCliff cooks?\u201d Her brothers were practically helpless around the kitchen and it always surprised her to find a man who enjoyed cooking.</p><p>\u201cI am a man of many talents,\u201d Grace\u2019s husband was quick to answer. \u201cI was a bachelor for years before I met Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t prepare meals, my brothers would survive on fast food and frozen entr\u00e9es,\u201d she said, grinning. Thankfully her mother had taught her quite a bit before her death. The brothers had relied on Mary Jo for meals ever since.</p><p>The thought of Linc, Mel and Ned made her anxious. She\u2019d meant to call, but then she\u2019d fallen asleep and now...they could be anywhere. They\u2019d be furious and frightened. She felt a blast of guilt; her brothers might be misguided but they loved her.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me a moment,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cI need to make a phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Grace told her. \u201cWould you like to use the house phone?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I have my cell up in the apartment. It\u2019ll only take a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have a problem with coverage. Try it and see. By the time you return, the tea and soup will be ready.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo went back to the barn and up the stairs to the small apartment. She was breathless when she reached the top and paused to gulp in some air. Her pulse was racing. This had never happened before. Trying to stay calm, she walked into the bedroom where she\u2019d left her purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sitting on the bed, she got out her cell. She tried the family home first. But the call didn\u2019t connect, and when Mary Jo glanced at the screen, she saw there wasn\u2019t any coverage in this area. Well, that settled that.</p><p>She did feel bad but there was no help for it. She\u2019d ask to make a long-distance call on the Hardings\u2019 phone, and she\u2019d try Linc\u2019s cell, as well as the house. She collected her coat and gloves and hurried back to the house.</p><p>A few minutes later, she was in the kitchen. As Grace had promised, the tea and a bowl of soup were waiting for her on the table.</p><p>Mary Jo hesitated. She really hated to ask, hated to feel even more beholden. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d appreciate using your phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s long distance, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019d be happy to pay the charges. You could let me know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Grace countered. \u201cOne phone call isn\u2019t going to make a bit of difference to our bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Still wearing her coat, Mary Jo went over to the wall phone, then remembered that Linc\u2019s number was programmed into her cell. Speed dial made it unnecessary to memorize numbers these days, she thought ruefully.</p><p>She\u2019d have to go back to the apartment a second time. Well, there was no help for that, either. \u201cI\u2019ll need to get my cell phone,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI can have Cliff get it for you,\u201d Grace offered. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you should be climbing those stairs too often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Mary Jo assured her. She walked across the yard, grateful the snow had tapered off, and back up the steep flight of stairs, pausing as she had before to inhale deeply and calm her racing heart. Taking another breath, she went in search of her cell.</p><p>On the off chance the phone might work in a different location, Mary Jo stood on the Hardings\u2019 porch and tried again. And again she received the same message. No coverage.</p><p>Cell phone in hand, she returned to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the call as quickly as I can,\u201d she told Grace, lifting the receiver off the hook.</p><p>\u201cYou talk as long as you need,\u201d Grace told her. \u201cAnd here, let me take your coat.\u201d</p> <p>She found Linc\u2019s contact information in her cell phone\u2019s directory and dialed his number. After a few seconds, the call connected and went straight to voice mail. Linc, it appeared, had decided to turn off his cell. Mary Jo wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that. Maybe he didn\u2019t want her to contact him, she thought with sudden panic. Maybe he was so angry he never wanted to hear from her again. When she tried to leave a message, she discovered that his voice mail was full. She sighed. It was just like Linc not to listen to his messages. He probably had no idea how many he\u2019d accumulated.</p><p>\u201cMy brother has his cell off,\u201d Mary Jo said with a defeated shrug.</p><p>\u201cHe might be in a no coverage zone,\u201d Grace explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t get good reception here at the ranch, although I do almost everywhere else in Kitsap County. Is it worth trying his house?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo doubted it, but she punched in the numbers. As she\u2019d expected, no answer there, either. Her oldest brother\u2019s deep voice came on, reciting the phone number. Then, in his usual peremptory fashion, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not here. Leave a message.\u201d Mary Jo closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said shakily, half afraid Linc would break in and start yelling at her. Grace had stepped out of the kitchen to give her privacy, a courtesy she appreciated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Cedar Cove,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ll be home sometime Christmas Day after I speak to David\u2019s parents. Probably later in the evening. Please don\u2019t try to find me. I\u2019m with...friends. Don\u2019t worry about me. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d With that she replaced the receiver.</p><p>She saw that Grace had moved into the dining room, setting the table. \u201cThank you,\u201d Mary Jo told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome. Is your soup still hot?\u201d</p> <p>Mary Jo had forgotten about that. \u201cI\u2019ll check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not, let me know and I\u2019ll reheat it in the microwave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she murmured. Even if it was stone-cold, she wouldn\u2019t have said so, not after everything Grace had done for her.</p><p>But as Mary Jo tried her first spoonful, she realized the temperature was perfect. She finished the entire bowl, then ate all the crackers and drank her tea. As she brought her dishes to the sink, Grace returned to the kitchen. \u201cMy daughters will be here at six,\u201d she said, glancing at the clock. \u201cAnd my daughter-in-law and her family should be back soon. We\u2019re having dinner together and then we\u2019re leaving for the Christmas Eve service at our church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice.\u201d Mary Jo had missed attending church. She and her brothers just seemed to stop going after her parents\u2019 funeral. She still went occasionally but hadn\u2019t in quite a while, and her brothers didn\u2019t go at all.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to join us?\u201d</p><p>The invitation was so genuine that for a moment Mary Jo seriously considered it. \u201cThank you for the offer, but I don\u2019t think I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Grace pressed. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mary Jo said again, \u201cbut I should probably stay quiet and rest, like the EMT suggested.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cYes, you should take his advice, although we\u2019d love it if you\u2019d at least join us for dinner.\u201d</p><p>The invitation moved her so much that Mary Jo felt tears spring to her eyes. Not only had Grace and her husband taken her into their home, they wanted to include her in their holiday celebration.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d want me here with your family,\u201d she said, struggling to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Grace asked. She seemed astonished by the comment. \u201cYou\u2019re our guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s Christmas and you\u2019ll have your...your family here.\u201d She found it difficult to speak.</p><p>\u201cYes, and they\u2019ll be delighted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a time for strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, just a minute,\u201d Grace said. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember the original Christmas story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Mary Jo had heard it all her life.</p><p>\u201cMary and Joseph didn\u2019t have anywhere to stay, either, and strangers offered them a place,\u201d Grace reminded her. \u201cA stable,\u201d she added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cBut I doubt those generous folks asked them to join the family for dinner,\u201d Mary Jo teased.</p><p>\u201cThat part we don\u2019t know because the Bible doesn\u2019t say, but I have to believe that anyone who\u2019d lend their stable to those young travelers would see to their other needs, as well.\u201d Grace\u2019s warm smile wrapped its way around Mary Jo\u2019s heart. \u201cJoin us for part of the evening, okay? I\u2019d love it if you met the girls, and I know they\u2019d enjoy meeting you.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t immediately respond. Although she would\u2019ve liked to meet Grace\u2019s family, she wasn\u2019t feeling quite right. \u201cMay I think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Grace said. \u201cYou do whatever you need to do.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward in the chair, Mary Jo supported her lower back with both hands, trying to ease the persistent ache. Sitting had become difficult in the last few weeks. It was as if the baby had latched his or her foot around one of her ribs and intended to hang on. Mary Jo was beginning to wonder if she\u2019d ever find a comfortable position again.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Grace surveyed the kitchen. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got everything under control. I thought I\u2019d sit down for a few minutes and have a cup of tea with you.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded. \u201cYes, please. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would I,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cHere, let me make some fresh tea. And what about some Christmas shortbread to go with it?\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>At the fire station, Mack McAfee sat by himself in the kitchen, downing yet another cup of coffee. The only call so far that day had been for the young pregnant woman who\u2019d had the dizzy spell at the library. For some reason, she\u2019d stayed in his mind ever since.</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t married, Mack had volunteered to work Christmas Eve and part of Christmas Day, allowing one of the other firefighters to spend the time with family. Unfortunately, his mother was none too happy that he\u2019d agreed to work over the holidays.</p><p>Mack\u2019s parents lived in Cedar Cove and his sister had, too, until she\u2019d left several months ago, her heart broken by that cowpoke who used to work for Cliff Harding. Linnette had taken off with no plan or destination and ended up in some podunk town in North Dakota. She seemed to love her new home out there in the middle of nowhere. Mack didn\u2019t understand it, but then it wasn\u2019t his life.</p><p>He was happy for Linnette, knowing she\u2019d found her niche. She\u2019d always said she wanted to live and work in a small rural town. As an experienced physician assistant, Linnette had a lot to offer a community like Buffalo Valley, North Dakota.</p><p>Gloria, Mack\u2019s oldest sister, had been given up for adoption as an infant; their relationship had only come to light in the past few years. Mack was just beginning to know her and so far he\u2019d discovered that they had a surprising amount in common, despite their very different upbringings. She\u2019d promised to stop by the house and spend part of Christmas with their parents, but she, too, was on the duty roster for tonight.</p><p>When Gloria had first moved into the area\u2014with the goal of reconnecting with her birth family\u2014she\u2019d worked for the Bremerton police. However, she\u2019d recently taken a job with the sheriff\u2019s department in Cedar Cove.</p><p>Mack\u2019s cell phone, attached to his waistband, chirped. He reached for it, not bothering to look at the screen. He already knew who was calling.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d Her cheerful greeting was strained and not entirely convincing.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Same to you and Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d</p><p>His mother was at loose ends. Not having any of her children with her during the holidays was hard for her. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty quiet here this afternoon,\u201d he said.</p><p>Corrie allowed an audible sigh to escape. \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t volunteered to work on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time his mother had brought it up. But as the firefighter most recently hired, he would\u2019ve been assigned this shift anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be lonely with just your father and me.\u201d Her voice fell and Mack sighed, wishing he could tell her what she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a wonderful Christmas,\u201d he said, sounding as positive as he could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she agreed in a listless voice. \u201cI decided to cook a ham this year instead of turkey. It\u2019s far less work and we had a turkey at Thanksgiving. Of course, I\u2019m going to bake your father\u2019s favorite potato casserole and that green bean dish everyone likes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mack didn\u2019t understand why his mother felt she had to review her dinner menu with him, but he let her chatter on, knowing it made her feel better.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d she said, abruptly changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should get married.\u201d</p> <p>If Mack had been swallowing a drink at the time he would\u2019ve choked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re settling down here in Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>He noticed that she\u2019d made it a question. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a steady job.\u201d She didn\u2019t add that this was perhaps his tenth career change in the last six years. Mack was easily bored and tended to jump from job to job. He\u2019d worked part-time for the post office, done construction, delivered for UPS and held half a dozen other short-term jobs since dropping out of college. He\u2019d also renovated a rundown house and sold it for a tidy profit.</p><p>Mack\u2019s restlessness had contributed to the often acrimonious relationship he\u2019d had with his father. Roy McAfee hadn\u2019t approved of Mack\u2019s need for change. He felt Mack was irresponsible and hadn\u2019t taken his life seriously enough. In some ways Mack supposed his father was right. Still, his new job with the fire department seemed to suit him perfectly, giving him the variety, the excitement and the camaraderie he craved. It also gave him a greater sense of purpose than anything else he\u2019d done.</p> <p>He and his dad got along better these days. Roy had actually apologized for his attitude toward Mack, which had come as a real shock. It had made a big difference in their relationship, though, and for that Mack was grateful.</p><p>\u201cYou think I should be married,\u201d he repeated, as though it was a foreign word whose meaning eluded him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how old I am, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He found his mother\u2019s decree almost humorous.</p> <p>\u201cHave you met anyone special?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d he protested. Yet the picture of Mary Jo Wyse shot instantly into his mind. He knew from the conversation he\u2019d overheard at the library that she was pregnant and single and that David Rhodes was her baby\u2019s father. He\u2019d also heard a reference to Charlotte and Ben Rhodes. He was familiar with them, but completely in the dark about David.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to pressure you,\u201d his mother continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it would be nice to have grandchildren one day.\u201d</p><p>Mack chuckled. \u201cIf you want, I\u2019ll get to work on that first thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack,\u201d she chastised, \u201cyou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He did but still enjoyed teasing her. While she was on the phone, he decided to take the opportunity to find out what he could about the father of Mary Jo\u2019s baby. \u201cCan you tell me anything about David Rhodes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDavid Rhodes,\u201d his mother said slowly. \u201cIs he related to Ben Rhodes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis son, I believe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me go ask your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Mom, don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you ask, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, someone mentioned him, that\u2019s all.\u201d Mack was reluctant to bring up Mary Jo; for one thing, it\u2019d been a chance encounter and he wasn\u2019t likely to see her again. Clearly she wasn\u2019t from here.</p><p>\u201cMack. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI treated a young woman at the library this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pregnant girl?\u201d Her voice rose excitedly.</p><p>Word sure spread fast in a small town, something Mack wasn\u2019t accustomed to yet. \u201cHow do you know about Mary Jo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo,\u201d his mother said wistfully. \u201cWhat a nice name.\u201d</p><p>She had a nice face to go with it, too, Mack mused and then caught himself. He had no business thinking about her. None whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cI met Shirley Bliss in the grocery store earlier,\u201d his mother went on to say. \u201cThe last thing I wanted to do was make a dash to the store. You know how busy they get the day before a big holiday.\u201d</p><p>Actually, he didn\u2019t, not from experience, but it seemed logical enough.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I ran out of evaporated milk. I needed it for that green Jell-o salad I make every Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Mack remembered that salad well; it was one of his favorites. His mother had insisted on making it, he noted, even though Mack wouldn\u2019t be joining the family for dinner.</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve used regular milk, I guess, but I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t taste the same. I don\u2019t like to use substitutes if it can be avoided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley Bliss, Mom,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Shirley. I saw her at the store. She was with her daughter, Tanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-k-a-y.\u201d Mack dragged out the word, hoping she\u2019d get to the point.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>\u201cHer given name is Tannith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanni\u2019s the one who told you about Mary Jo?\u201d he asked, bringing her back to the discussion.</p><p>\u201cNo, Shirley did.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWell, on second thought, it was Tanni\u2019s boyfriend, Shaw, who told her, so I guess in a manner of speaking it was her daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did Shaw hear?\u201d he pressed, losing track of all these names.</p><p>\u201cApparently Mary Jo came into Mocha Mama\u2019s this morning and was asking him a lot of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he suggested she ask Grace Harding about David Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Well, he was beginning to, anyway.</p><p>\u201cShirley said Shaw told her that Mary Jo looked like she was about to deliver that baby any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s due in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness! Do you think David Rhodes is the baby\u2019s father?\u201d his mother breathed, as if suddenly making the connection. \u201cIt makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He already knew as much but preferred not to contribute to the gossip obviously making the rounds. Regardless, Mack couldn\u2019t get Mary Jo out of his mind. \u201cDid Shirley happen to say where Mary Jo is right now?\u201d Maybe someone should check up on her. Mack had recommended she rest for the remainder of the day but he didn\u2019t like the idea of her being alone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his mother said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine, won\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume so....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>His mother laughed softly. \u201cWhere do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take a private eye\u2014which his father was\u2014to know the answer to that. \u201cShopping,\u201d Mack said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cRight. Your father\u2019s so efficient about everything else, yet he leaves gift-buying until the last possible minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that one year when the only store open was the pharmacy,\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe brought you a jigsaw puzzle of the Tower of London, two romance novels and some nail polish remover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was so proud of himself,\u201d Corrie said fondly.</p><p>\u201cWe all had a good time putting that puzzle together, didn\u2019t we?\u201d It\u2019d been one of their better Christmases, and the family still did jigsaw puzzles every holiday. A small family tradition had come about as a result of that particular Christmas and his father\u2019s last-minute gift.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call in the morning?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Mack promised. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll stop by the house as soon as I\u2019m relieved. It\u2019ll be late tomorrow afternoon. Save me some leftovers, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d his mother murmured. \u201cGloria\u2019s schedule is the reverse of yours, so she\u2019s coming over in the morning.\u201d Corrie sounded slightly more cheerful as she said, \u201cAt least we\u2019ll see you both for a little while.\u201d</p><p>After a few words of farewell, Mack snapped his cell phone shut and clipped it back on his waistband.</p><p>He\u2019d no sooner started getting everything ready for that night\u2019s dinner than Brandon Hutton sauntered into the kitchen. \u201cYou got company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Mack couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d come looking for him. He was new in town and didn\u2019t know many people yet.</p><p>\u201cSome guy and a woman,\u201d Brandon elaborated.</p><p>\u201cDid they give you a name?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>Mack walked toward the front of the building and as he neared he heard voices\u2014one of them unmistakably his sister\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLinnette!\u201d he said, bursting into the room.</p><p>\u201cMack.\u201d She threw herself into his arms for a fierce hug.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked. The last he\u2019d heard she was in Buffalo Valley and intended to stay there for the holidays.</p><p>She slipped one arm around his waist. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise. Pete suggested it and offered to drive me, so here I am.\u201d</p><p>Mack turned to the other man. In a phone conversation the month before, Linnette had told him she\u2019d met a farmer and that they were seeing each other. \u201cMack McAfee,\u201d he said, offering his hand.</p><p>Pete\u2019s handshake was firm. \u201cPleased to meet you, Mack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to meet you, too.\u201d He turned back to his sister. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Linnette giggled. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a clue. Dad, either. It\u2019s going to be a total shock to both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout five minutes ago. We decided to come and see you first, then we\u2019re going to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s out doing his Christmas shopping.\u201d</p><p>Linnette laughed and looked at Pete. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019d be shopping,\u201d Pete said laconically.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s busy cooking, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d This comment was directed at Mack.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite salad,\u201d he informed her. \u201cEven though I won\u2019t be there, she\u2019s making it for me. I\u2019m already looking forward to the leftovers. Oh, and she decided on ham this year.\u201d</p><p>Linnette laughed again. \u201cShe discussed her Christmas menu with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn minute detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Mom,\u201d Linnette murmured.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could see the expression on her face when you walk in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that we\u2019re going to surprise her.\u201d Linnette\u2019s wide grin was perhaps the best Christmas gift he could have received. His sister, happy again.</p><p>Mack hadn\u2019t seen her smile like this in...well, a year anyway.</p><p>\u201cCall me later and let me know how long it takes Mom to stop crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Linnette said.</p><p>His sister and Pete left for the house, and Mack returned to the firehouse kitchen, where he was assigned cooking duty that evening. He resumed chopping onions for the vat of chili he planned to make\u2014how was that for Christmas Eve dinner? He caught himself wishing he could be at his parents\u2019 place tonight, after all. Although he\u2019d just met Pete, Mack sensed that he was a solid, hard-working, no-nonsense man. Exactly what Linnette needed, and someone Mack wanted to know better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It seemed that Linnette had found the kind of person she needed, but had he? Mack shook his head.</p><p>And yet, he couldn\u2019t forget Mary Jo Wyse.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t remotely logical, considering that their relationship consisted mostly of him taking her blood pressure.</p><p>And yet...</p> <p>11</p><p>Linc drove down Harbor Street, peering out at both sides of the street. Fortunately, the snow had let up\u2014Ned was probably disappointed by that. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was searching for, other than some clue as to where he might locate his runaway sister. He\u2019d give anything to see that long brown coat, that colorful striped scarf....</p><p>\u201cNice town,\u201d Ned commented, looking around.</p><p>Linc hadn\u2019t noticed. His mind was on Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to go all out with the Christmas decorations,\u201d Mel added.</p> <p>Ned poked his head between the two of them and braced his arms against the back of the seats. \u201cLots of lights, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one that I can see,\u201d Linc mumbled, concentrating on the road ahead. His brothers were so easily distracted, he thought irritably.</p><p>They exchanged knowing glances.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Linc barked. He recognized that look. In fact, he\u2019d already seen it several times today.</p><p>\u201cIn case you weren\u2019t aware of it, there are lights on every lamppost all through town,\u201d Ned pointed out slowly, as if he was speaking to a child. \u201cThe street is decorated with Christmas lights. And that clock tower, too, with the Christmas tree in front of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking about traffic signals,\u201d Linc snapped.</p> <p>\u201cOh, signals. Yeah, you\u2019re right about that.\u201d As Linc drove through the downtown area, there\u2019d been just that one traffic light. Actually, he was going back to it. He made a sharp U-turn.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Mel asked, clutching the handle above the passenger window.</p><p>\u201cBack to the light\u2014the traffic light, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ned ventured with some hesitation.</p><p>Linc\u2019s mood had improved since they\u2019d arrived in Cedar Cove. The traffic was almost nonexistent and his sister was here. Somewhere.</p><p>He tried to think like Mary Jo. Where could she be? It had started to get dark, although it was barely four in the afternoon. Twilight had already settled over the snowy landscape.</p><p>\u201cPractically everything in town is closed for the day,\u201d Mel said, pressing his face against the passenger window like an anxious child.</p><p>\u201cStands to reason. It\u2019s Christmas Eve.\u201d Ned sounded as if he was stating something neither Linc nor Mel had discovered yet.</p> <p>Linc waited for the light before making a sharp left-hand turn. The road ended at a small traffic circle that went around a totem pole. The building to the right with the large mural was the library, and there was a large, mostly vacant parking lot situated to his left. Directly in front of him was a marina and a large docked boat.</p><p>The sign read Passenger Ferry.</p><p>Linc immediately went through the traffic circle and pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we stopping here?\u201d Mel asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining. I could use a pit stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Ned chimed in. \u201cLet\u2019s go, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI wanna hit the men\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Mary Jo get to Cedar Cove?\u201d he asked them both, ignoring their entreaties. \u201cThe ferry, right? Isn\u2019t that what we figured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she must\u2019ve taken it to Bremerton,\u201d Mel agreed. \u201cAnd then she rode the foot ferry across from Bremerton to Cedar Cove.\u201d He pointed to the boat docked at the end of the pier.</p><p>Linc playfully ruffled his brother\u2019s hair. \u201cGive the man a cigar.\u201d</p><p>Mel jerked his head aside. \u201cHey, cut it out.\u201d He combed his fingers through his hair to restore it to order.</p><p>Linc swung open the truck door and climbed out.</p><p>\u201cWhere you goin\u2019 now?\u201d Mel asked, opening his own door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for us to question why,\u201d Ned intoned and clambered out, too.</p><p>Linc sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask if anyone saw a pregnant girl on the dock this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Ned said enthusiastically. \u201cMeanwhile, we\u2019ll visit that men\u2019s room over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Linc grumbled, scanning the street as he waited for them. Unfortunately he hadn\u2019t found anyone to question in the vicinity of the dock. The only nearby place that seemed to be doing business was a pub\u2014imaginatively called the Cedar Cove Tavern.</p><p>\u201cI Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\u201d blasted out the door the instant Linc opened it. A pool table dominated one side of the establishment; one man was leaning over it, pool cue in hand, while another stood by watching. They looked over their shoulders when the three brothers came inside.</p><p>Linc walked up to the bar.</p><p>The bartender, who had a full head of white hair and was wearing a Santa hat, ambled over to him. \u201cWhat can I get you boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoke for me.\u201d Linc was driving, so he wasn\u2019t interested in anything alcoholic. Besides, he\u2019d need a clear head once he tracked down his obstinate younger sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer,\u201d Mel said. He propped his elbows on the bar as though settling in for a long winter\u2019s night.</p><p>\u201cCoke,\u201d Ned ordered, sliding onto the stool on Linc\u2019s other side.</p><p>The bartender served them speedily.</p><p>Linc slapped a twenty-dollar bill on the scarred wooden bar. \u201cYou seen a pregnant woman around today?\u201d he asked. \u201cSomeone from out of town?\u201d</p><p>The man frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t say I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s real pregnant.\u201d For emphasis Mel held both hands in front of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThen I definitely didn\u2019t,\u201d Santa informed them.</p><p>\u201cShe arrived by foot ferry,\u201d Ned told him. \u201cProbably sometime midmorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Santa murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t start my shift until three.\u201d He rested his bulk against the counter and called out, \u201cAnyone here see a pregnant gal come off the foot ferry this morning?\u201d</p><p>The two men playing pool shook their heads. The other patrons stopped their conversation, glanced at Linc and his brothers, then went back to whatever they were discussing.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like anyone else did either,\u201d the bartender said.</p><p>The brothers huddled over their drinks. \u201cWhat we gotta do,\u201d Mel suggested, \u201cis figure out what her agenda would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to find David\u2019s parents,\u201d Ned reminded them. \u201cThat\u2019s her agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Okay, they both had a point. Turning back to the bartender, Linc caught his attention. \u201cYou know any people named Rhodes in the area?\u201d</p><p>Santa nodded as he wiped a beer mug. \u201cSeveral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an older couple. They have a son named David.\u201d</p><p>The bartender frowned. \u201cOh, I know David. He stiffed me on a sixty-dollar tab.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they were talking about the same guy, all right. \u201cWhat about his parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen and Charlotte,\u201d Santa told them. \u201cReally decent people. I don\u2019t have anything good to say about their son, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Looking around, Linc saw a pay phone near the restrooms. \u201cI\u2019ll check if Ben Rhodes is in the phone book,\u201d he said, leaving his stool.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Santa muttered.</p><p>Linc removed the phone book from a small shelf. The entire directory was only half an inch thick. The Seattle phone book had a bigger section just of government agencies than the entire Cedar Cove White and Yellow Pages. He quickly found the listing for Ben and Charlotte Rhodes, then copied down the phone number and address.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he announced triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cShould we call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mel asked. He walked back to the bar and downed the last of his beer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give Mary Jo a heads-up that we\u2019re in town. I think the best thing to do is take her by surprise.\u201d</p><p>Ned nodded, although he seemed a bit uncertain.</p><p>Linc thanked the bartender, got some general directions and collected his change. He left a generous tip; it was Christmas Eve, after all. Then he marched toward the door, his brothers scrambling after him.</p><p>In the parking lot again, Linc climbed into the truck and started the engine. He\u2019d noticed that Harbor Street angled up the hill. He guessed David\u2019s parents\u2019 street wasn\u2019t far from this main thoroughfare. Trusting his instincts, he returned to the traffic signal, took a left and followed the road until it intersected with Pelican Court.</p><p>Within five minutes of leaving the tavern, Linc was parked outside Ben and Charlotte Rhodes\u2019s house.</p><p>The porch light was on, which boded well, and there appeared to be a light on inside, too. The house was a solid two-story dwelling, about the same age as the one he shared with his brothers in Seattle. White Christmas lights were strung along the roofline and the bushes were lighted, too. There was a manger scene on the front lawn.</p><p>\u201cThis is a neat town,\u201d Mel said. \u201cDid you see they have an art gallery? We passed it a couple of minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so interested in art?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cI like art,\u201d Mel muttered.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince now. You want to make something of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Linc said, puzzled by his brother\u2019s defensiveness.</p><p>Linc walked up the steps leading to the front door while his brothers stood out on the lawn. Mel amused himself by rearranging the large plastic figures in the Nativity scene.</p><p>Linc felt smug. If Mary Jo thought she\u2019d outsmarted him, she had a lesson to learn. He didn\u2019t want to be self-righteous, but he was going to teach his little sister that she wasn\u2019t nearly as clever as she seemed to think. He also wanted Mary Jo to understand that he had her best interests at heart\u2014now and always.</p><p>Leaning hard against the doorbell, he waited several minutes and when nothing happened, he pressed the bell a second time.</p><p>\u201cWant me to check out the backyard?\u201d Ned called from the lawn.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>His youngest brother took off and disappeared around the side of the house.</p><p>Mel trailed after Ned, while Linc stood guard on the porch. Since no one was bothering to answer\u2014although there seemed to be people home\u2014Linc stepped over to the picture window and glanced inside through the half-closed blinds.</p><p>A cat hissed at him from the windowsill on the other side. Or at least he assumed it was hissing, since its teeth were bared and its ears laid back. Startled, he took a deep breath and stepped away. Although there was a window between them, the cat glared at him maliciously, its intentions clear.</p><p>\u201cNice kitty, nice kitty,\u201d Linc remarked, although he knew the animal couldn\u2019t hear his attempt to be friendly. This cat was anything but. Linc didn\u2019t doubt for a moment that if he were to get inside the house, \u201cnice kitty\u201d would dig all his claws into him within seconds.</p><p>Linc hurried to the other side of the porch and leaned over the side, but that didn\u2019t provide him with any further information. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A minute or two later, his brothers were back. \u201cThe house is locked up. Door wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going the way Linc had planned. \u201cOkay, so maybe they aren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where are they?\u201d Mel demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201d Linc asked, growing irritated.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one with all the answers, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Ned said, coming to stand between his brothers. \u201cLet\u2019s skip the sarcasm. We\u2019re looking for Mary Jo, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue,\u201d Ned returned calmly. \u201cBut someone must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should ask a neighbor,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d Linc motioned widely with his arm.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will. I\u2019ll try...that one.\u201d Mel marched down the steps, strode across the street and walked up to the front door. He pounded on it. Even from this distance Linc could hear his knock.</p><p>An older woman with pink rollers in her hair pulled aside the drape and peeked out.</p><p>\u201cI just saw someone,\u201d Ned yelled. \u201cThere\u2019s someone inside.\u201d</p><p>Linc had seen her, too.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she answering the door?\u201d Mel asked loudly, as if the two of them had some secret insight into this stranger.</p> <p>\u201cWould you answer if King Kong was trying to get in your front door?\u201d Linc asked. Apparently Mel hadn\u2019t figured out that most people responded better to more sensitive treatment.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Mel shouted after several long minutes.</p><p>\u201cBe that way, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just doesn\u2019t want to answer the door,\u201d Ned shouted back.</p><p>Mel ignored that and proceeded to the next house.</p><p>\u201cKnock more quietly this time,\u201d Linc instructed.</p><p>Mel ignored that, too. Walking to the door, he pushed the buzzer, then turned and glanced over his shoulder. This house seemed friendlier, Linc thought. A large evergreen wreath hung on the door and lights sparkled from the porch columns.</p><p>Again no one answered.</p> <p>Losing patience, Mel looked in the front window, framing his face with both hands. After peering inside for several seconds, he straightened and called out, \u201cNo one\u2019s home here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to try?\u201d Ned asked Linc. Mel wasn\u2019t exactly making friends in the neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll do any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Ned admitted.</p><p>A piercing blare of sirens sounded in the distance, disrupting the tranquility of the night.</p><p>Mel hurried back across the street. \u201cEveryone in the neighborhood seems to be gone. Except for the lady with those pink things in her hair.\u201d</p><p>Despite their efforts, they obviously weren\u2019t getting anywhere. \u201cNow what?\u201d Ned muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou got any ideas?\u201d Linc asked his two brothers, yelling to be heard over the sirens.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Mel said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Linc said, not hiding his discouragement.</p><p>They sauntered back to the truck and climbed inside. Linc started the engine and was about to drive away from the curb when two sheriff\u2019s vehicles shot into the street and boxed him in.</p><p>The officers leaped out of their cars and pulled their weapons. \u201cGet out of the truck with your hands up!\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>Mary Jo hadn\u2019t intended to spill her heart to Grace, but the older woman was so warm, so sympathetic. Before long, she\u2019d related the whole sorry tale of how she\u2019d met and fallen in love with David Rhodes. By the time Mary Jo finished, there was a pile of used tissues on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s ever loved unwisely, my dear,\u201d Grace assured her.</p><p>\u201cI just feel really stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you trusted a man unworthy of your love?\u201d Grace asked, shaking her head. \u201cThe one who needs to be ashamed is David Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grace agreed. \u201cBut let me repeat a wise old saying that has served me well through the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mary Jo asked. She dabbed tears from the corners of her eyes and blew her nose.</p><p>\u201cTime wounds all heels,\u201d Grace said with a knowing smile. \u201cIt will with David, too.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo laughed. \u201cI guess the reverse is true, as well. I\u2019ll get over David and his lies....\u201d Her voice trailed off.... \u201cIs everyone in Cedar Cove as nice as you and Cliff?\u201d she asked a moment later.</p><p>The question seemed to surprise Grace. \u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2014Ms. Griffin\u2014certainly is.\u201d Mary Jo sighed and looked down at her hands. \u201cThat firefighter\u2014what\u2019s his name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack McAfee. He\u2019s new to town.\u201d</p><p>What Mary Jo particularly remembered was that he had the gentlest touch and the most reassuring voice. She could still hear it if she closed her eyes. The way he\u2019d knelt at her side and the protectiveness of his manner had calmed her, physically and emotionally.</p><p>\u201cHis parents live in town,\u201d Grace was explaining.</p><p>\u201cRoy McAfee is a retired Seattle detective turned private investigator, and his wife, Corrie, works in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d She recalled seeing Mr. McAfee\u2019s sign on Harbor Street. What a fascinating profession. She suspected Mack\u2019s father got some really interesting cases. Maybe not, though, especially in such a small town. Maybe she was just influenced by the mystery novels she loved and the shows she watched on television.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should change clothes before dinner,\u201d Grace said, rising from her chair with seeming reluctance. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed sitting here chatting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mary Jo told her. It\u2019d been the most relaxing part of her day\u2014except, of course, for her nap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo figured this was her signal to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I know Mack said you should rest, but Cliff and I would really like it if you joined our family for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Cliff?\u201d she asked, glancing over one shoulder, assuming he must be somewhere within sight.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out with his horses. They\u2019re his first love.\u201d Grace smiled as she said it.</p><p>Mary Jo had noticed the way Cliff regarded his wife. He plainly adored Grace and it was equally obvious that she felt the same about him. Mary Jo gathered they\u2019d only been married a year or two. The wedding picture on the piano looked recent, and it was clear that their adult children were from earlier marriages.</p><p>Then, without allowing herself to consider the appropriateness of her question, Mary Jo said, \u201cAbout what you said a few minutes ago...Have you ever loved unwisely?\u201d</p><p>Grace sat down again. She didn\u2019t speak for a moment. \u201cI did,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI married young and then, after many years together, I was widowed. I\u2019d just started dating again. It was a whole new world to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you seeing Cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019d been divorced for years and dating was a new experience for him, too. I\u2019d been married to Dan for over thirty years, and when another man\u2014besides Cliff\u2014paid attention to me, I was flattered. It was someone I\u2019d had a crush on in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Cliff know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first. You see, this other man lived in another city and we e-mailed back and forth, and he became my obsession.\u201d Grace\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cI knew all along that he was married and yet I allowed our Internet romance to continue. He said he was getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, but I believed him because I wanted to. And then I learned the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Cliff find out about this other man?\u201d</p><p>Regret flashed in her eyes. \u201cYes\u2014and as soon as he did, he broke off our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no! You nearly lost Cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019d learned the truth about Will by then and was crushed to lose Cliff over him. I was angry with myself for being so gullible and naive. I\u2019d lost a wonderful man because of my foolishness. For a long time I could hardly look at my own face in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel now,\u201d she murmured. Will, she thought. She\u2019d heard that name before....</p><p>\u201cIt does get better, Mary Jo, I promise you that. Will, the man I was...involved with, did eventually lose his wife. She divorced him and, while I believe he had genuine feelings for me, it was too late. I wanted nothing more to do with him. So you see, he really was the one who lost out in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff forgave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it took time. I was determined never to give him cause to doubt me again. We were married soon after that and I can honestly say I\u2019ve never been happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff is everything I could want in a husband.\u201d</p><p>The door off the kitchen opened and Cliff came in, brushing snow from his jacket. He hung it on a peg by the door, then removed his boots. \u201cWhen I left, you two were sitting right where you are now, talking away.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled at him. \u201cI was about to change my clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep Mary Jo entertained until I get back, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Grace hurried out, and Cliff claimed the chair next to Mary Jo. As he did, he eyed the crumpled tissues. \u201cLooks like you two had a good heart-to-heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d she admitted and then with a sigh told him, \u201cI\u2019ve been very foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Grace told you we\u2019ve all made mistakes in our lives. The challenge is to learn from those mistakes so we don\u2019t repeat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to get myself into this predicament ever again,\u201d Mary Jo said fervently. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d She hesitated, uncertain how much to tell him about her brothers. \u201cI feel like my family\u2019s smothering me. I have three older brothers and they all seem to think they know what\u2019s best for me and my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey love you,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so difficult. With my parents gone, they feel they should be the ones directing my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd naturally you take exception to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. But when I tried to live my life my own way and prove how adult I was, look what happened.\u201d She pressed both hands over her stomach, staring down at it. \u201cI made a mistake, a lot of mistakes, but I discovered something...interesting after I found out I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Cliff asked. He stretched his long legs out in front of him and leaned back, holding his coffee mug. She noticed that his hand-knit socks had a whimsical pattern of Christmas bells, at odds with his no-nonsense jeans and shirt.</p><p>\u201cWell, at first,\u201d she began, \u201cas you can imagine, I was terribly upset. I was scared, didn\u2019t know what to do, but after a while I started to feel really excited. There was a new life inside me. A whole, separate human being with his or her own personality. This tiny person\u2019s going to be part David, part me\u2014and all himself. Or herself,\u201d she added, refusing to accept her brothers\u2019 certainty that the baby was a boy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cliff smiled. \u201cPregnancy is amazing, isn\u2019t it? I can\u2019t pretend to know what a woman experiences, but as a man I can tell you that we feel utter astonishment and pride\u2014and a kind of humbling, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think David might\u2019ve felt like that in the beginning,\u201d Mary Jo whispered. He really had seemed happy. Very quickly, however, that happiness seemed to be compromised. By fear, perhaps, or resentment. She wanted to believe he\u2019d loved her as much as he was capable of loving anyone. She now realized that his capacity for feeling, for empathy, was limited. Severely limited. Barely a month after she learned she was pregnant with his baby, David had become emotionally absent. He continued to call and to see her when he was in town but those calls and visits came less and less frequently, and the instant she started asking questions about their future, he closed himself off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all that different with my horses,\u201d Cliff was saying.</p><p>His words broke into her reverie. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d What did he mean? They hadn\u2019t been talking about horses, had they?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve bred a number of horses through the years and with every pregnancy I feel such a sense of hopefulness. Which is foolish, perhaps, since even the best breeding prospects don\u2019t always turn out the way you expect. Still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Funny Face today.\u201d</p><p>Cliff\u2019s eyes brightened when she mentioned the mare. \u201cShe\u2019s my sweetheart,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe seems very special.\u201d Mary Jo remembered the moment of connection she\u2019d felt with this horse.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Cliff agreed. \u201cShe\u2019s gentle and affectionate\u2014a dream with the grandchildren. But as far as breeding prospects go, she was a disappointment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mary Jo found that hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s smaller than we thought she\u2019d be and she doesn\u2019t have the heart of a show horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you kept her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of selling Funny Face. Even though she didn\u2019t turn out like Cal and I expected, we still considered her a gift.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo released a long sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about my baby. I didn\u2019t plan to get pregnant and I know David certainly didn\u2019t want it, yet despite all the problems and the heartache, I\u2019ve come to see this child as a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe definitely is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe?\u201d She grinned. \u201cNow you\u2019re beginning to sound like my brothers. They\u2019re convinced the baby\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was using he in a generic way,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cI imagine you\u2019d prefer a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugged lightly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it, so I\u2019ll just leave it up to God.\u201d She was somewhat surprised by her own response. It wasn\u2019t something she would\u2019ve said as little as six months ago.</p><p>During her pregnancy, she\u2019d begun to reconsider her relationship with God. When she was involved with David, she\u2019d avoided thinking about anything spiritual. In fact, she\u2019d avoided thinking, period. The spiritual dimension of her life had shrunk, become almost nonexistent after her parents\u2019 death.</p><p>That had changed in the past few months. She thought often of the night she\u2019d knelt by her bed, weeping and desperate, and poured out her despair, her fears and her hopes. It was nothing less than a conversation with God. That was probably as good a definition of prayer as any, she mused. Afterward, she\u2019d experienced a feeling of peace. She liked to imagine her mother had been in the room that night, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got everything you need?\u201d</p><p>She realized Cliff had spoken. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d She hated to keep asking Cliff to repeat himself, but her mind refused to stay focused.</p><p>\u201cI was asking if you have everything you need for the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes...Thanks to my friends and my brothers.\u201d Mary Jo was grateful for her brothers\u2019 generosity to her and the baby. Their excitement at the idea of a nephew\u2014or niece, as she kept telling them\u2014had heartened her, even as their overzealous interference dismayed her.</p><p>Linc, who tended to be the practical one, had immediately gone up to the attic and brought down the crib that had once belonged to Mary Jo. He\u2019d decided it wasn\u2019t good enough for her baby and purchased a new one.</p><p>Mary Jo had been overwhelmed by his thoughtfulness. She\u2019d tried to thank him but Linc had brushed aside her gratitude as though it embarrassed him.</p><p>Mel was looking forward to having a young boy around\u2014or a girl, as she\u2019d reminded him, too\u2014to coach in sports. She\u2019d returned from work one day recently to find a tiny pair of running shoes and knew instantly they\u2019d come from Mel.</p><p>And Ned. Her wonderful brother, Ned, had insisted on getting her a car seat and high chair.</p><p>Mary Jo had knitted various blankets and booties, and her friends from the office had seen to her layette in what might have been one of the largest baby showers ever organized at the insurance company. Other than her best friend, Casey, no one had any inkling who the father was, and if they speculated, they certainly never asked. Regardless, their affection for Mary Jo was obvious and it made a difference in her life.</p><p>Grace returned just then and Mary Jo heard the sound of a car door closing. The front door opened a moment later and a girl of about five ran inside. \u201cGrandma! Grandma!\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m an angel tonight! I\u2019m an angel tonight!\u201d</p><p>Grace knelt down, clasping the child\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an angel in the Christmas pageant?\u201d</p><p>The little girl\u2019s head bobbed up and down. \u201cIn church tonight.\u201d</p><p>Grace hugged her granddaughter. \u201cOh, Katie, you\u2019ll be the best angel ever.\u201d</p><p>The girl beamed with pride. Noticing Mary Jo, she immediately walked over. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Katie. I\u2019m Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a baby, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>The door opened again and a young couple came in. The man carried a toddler, while the woman held a large, quilted diaper bag.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Mom,\u201d Grace\u2019s daughter said, kissing her mother\u2019s cheek. She turned to Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Maryellen. And I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re going to be joining us,\u201d she said, smiling broadly.</p><p>Mary Jo smiled back. She\u2019d never expected this kind of welcome, this genuine acceptance. Tonight would be one of the most memorable Christmas Eves of her life.</p><p>Now, if only her back would stop aching....</p><p>13</p><p>\u201cOfficer, let me explain,\u201d Linc said, doing his best to stay calm. His brothers stood on either side of him, arms raised high in the air. The deputy, whose badge identified him as Deputy Pierpont, appeared to have a nervous trigger finger.</p><p>The second officer was in his car, talking into the radio.</p><p>\u201cStep away from the vehicle,\u201d Pierpont instructed, keeping his weapon trained on them.</p><p>The three brothers could\u2019ve been playing the children\u2019s game, Mother, May I as they each moved forward one giant step.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing on private property?\u201d Pierpont bellowed as if he\u2019d caught them red-handed inside the bank vault at Fort Knox.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for our sister,\u201d Mel blurted out. \u201cShe ran away this morning. We\u2019ve got to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s about to have a baby,\u201d Linc said, feeling some clarification was required.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d the deputy asked, his tone none too friendly.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Linc said, fast losing patience, \u201cthis is where we thought she\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>The second officer approached them. His badge said he was Deputy Rogers. \u201cWe had two separate phone calls from neighbors who claimed three men were breaking into this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t breaking in,\u201d Mel insisted, turning to his brothers to confirm the truth.</p><p>\u201cI looked in the window,\u201d Linc confessed, shaking his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that was a crime.\u201d</p><p>Pierpont snickered. \u201cSo we got a Peeping Tom on our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one at home!\u201d Linc shouted. \u201cThere was nothing to peep at except a crazed cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to open the back door,\u201d Mel said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Rogers asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, because...\u201d Mel glanced at Linc.</p><p>As far as Linc was concerned, Mel was the one who\u2019d opened his big mouth; he could talk his own way out of this.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Rogers prodded. \u201cI\u2019d be interested to know why you tried to get into this house when your brother just told us you were searching for your sister and that you knew there was no one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Mel said hurriedly. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have tried the door, but I suspected Mary Jo was inside and I wanted to see if that elderly couple was at home or just hiding from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hide if the three of you came pounding on my door.\u201d Again this was from Deputy Rogers.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you, Jim?\u201d Pierpont said. Mel\u2019s comment seemed to verify everything the officers already believed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all go down to the sheriff\u2019s office so we can sort this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without my attorney,\u201d Linc said in a firm voice. He wasn\u2019t going to let some deputy fresh out of the academy railroad him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t break any law. We came to the Rhodes residence in good faith. All we want...all we care about is locating our little sister, who\u2019s pregnant and alone and in a strange town.\u201d</p><p>Just then another car pulled up to the curb, and a middle-aged man stepped out, dressed in street clothes.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re really in for it,\u201d Pierpont announced.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sheriff Troy Davis.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Sheriff Davis approached, Linc felt relieved. Troy Davis was obviously a seasoned officer and looked like a man he could reason with.</p><p>The sheriff frowned at the young deputies. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem here?\u201d</p><p>They both started talking at once.</p><p>\u201cWe got a call from dispatch,\u201d Pierpont began.</p><p>\u201cTwo calls,\u201d Rogers amended.</p><p>\u201cFrom neighbors, reporting suspicious behavior,\u201d Pierpont continued.</p><p>\u201cThe middle one here admits he was trying to open the back door.\u201d</p><p>Mel leaned forward. \u201cJust checking to see if it was locked.\u201d</p><p>Linc groaned and turned to his brother. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep your trap shut before we end up spending Christmas in jail.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, Mel did seem chagrined. \u201cSorry, Linc. I wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>Linc appealed directly to the sheriff. \u201cI understand we might have looked suspicious, peeking in windows, Sheriff Davis, but I assure you we were merely trying to figure out if the Rhodes family was at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you family or friends of Ben and Charlotte\u2019s?\u201d the man asked, studying them through narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur sister knows Ben\u2019s son,\u201d Ned told them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mel nodded emphatically. \u201cKnows him in the Biblical sense, if you catch my drift.\u201d</p><p>Linc wanted to kick Mel but, with all the law enforcement surrounding them, he didn\u2019t dare. They\u2019d probably arrest him for assault. \u201cOur sister\u2019s having David Rhodes\u2019s baby,\u201d he felt obliged to explain.</p><p>\u201cAny day now,\u201d Mel threw in.</p><p>\u201cAnd she disappeared,\u201d Ned added.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re guilty of anything,\u201d Linc said, gesturing with his hands, \u201cit\u2019s being so anxious to locate our sister. Like I said, she\u2019s alone in a strange town and without family or friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you check their identification?\u201d the sheriff asked.</p><p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t gotten around to that yet,\u201d Deputy Rogers replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see we\u2019re telling the truth,\u201d Linc asserted.</p><p>\u201cNone of us have police records.\u201d</p> <p>With the sheriff and his deputies watching carefully, Linc, Mel and Ned handed over their identification.</p><p>The sheriff glanced at all three pieces, then passed them to Pierpont. The young man swaggered over to his patrol car, apparently to check for any warrants or arrest records. He was back a couple of minutes later and returned their ID.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have records.\u201d He seemed almost disappointed, Linc thought.</p><p>The sheriff nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s your sister\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo Wyse,\u201d Linc answered. \u201cCan you tell us where we might find the Rhodes family? All we want to do is talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately Ben and Charlotte are out of the country,\u201d the sheriff said.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean they aren\u2019t even in town?\u201d Mel asked, sounding outraged. He turned to Linc. \u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Mary Jo must have discovered this information about the Rhodes family on her own. The only thing left for her to do was head back to Seattle. She wouldn\u2019t have any other options, which meant this entire venture through dismal traffic, falling snow and wretched conditions had been a complete waste of time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably home by now and wondering where the three of us are,\u201d Linc muttered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Ned shook his head. \u201cBut I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you doubt it?\u201d Linc challenged.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo can be stubborn, you know, and she was pretty upset last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should phone the house and find out if she\u2019s there,\u201d Linc said, although he had a sneaking suspicion that Ned was right. Mary Jo wouldn\u2019t give up that easily.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good idea to me,\u201d Sheriff Davis inserted.</p> <p>Linc reached for his cell phone and called home. Five long rings later, voice mail kicked in. If his sister had gone back to Seattle, she apparently wasn\u2019t at the house.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not there,\u201d Linc informed his brothers.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Ned sighed. \u201cI know Mary Jo, and she isn\u2019t going to turn tail after one setback.\u201d</p><p>This was more than a simple setback, in Linc\u2019s opinion. This was major.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried her cell phone?\u201d the sheriff suggested next.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we did. A few times. No answer,\u201d Linc said tersely.</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that now,\u201d Linc murmured. He reached for his phone again and realized he didn\u2019t know her number nor had he programmed it into his directory.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cAh, Ned, could you give me the number for her cell?\u201d</p><p>His youngest brother grabbed the phone from him and punched in Mary Jo\u2019s number, then handed it back.</p><p>Linc waited impatiently for the call to connect. After what seemed like minutes, the phone automatically went to voice mail. \u201cShe\u2019s not answering that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe her cell battery\u2019s dead,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cIt could be she\u2019s out of range, too.\u201d</p><p>Actually, Linc was curious as to why the sheriff himself had responded to dispatch. One would think the man had better things to do\u2014like dealing with real crime or spending the evening with his family. \u201cListen, Sheriff, is Cedar Cove so hard up for crime that the sheriff responds personally to a possible break-in?\u201d</p><p>Troy Davis grinned. \u201cI was on my way to my daughter\u2019s house for dinner when I heard the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to check us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Linc liked the sheriff. He seemed a levelheaded guy, whereas his deputies were a pair of overzealous new-bies, hoping for a bit of excitement. He\u2019d bet they were bored out of their minds in a quiet little town like Cedar Cove. The call about this supposed break-in had sent these two into a giddy state of importance.</p><p>\u201cThe only essential thing here is finding our sister,\u201d Linc reiterated to the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, we don\u2019t know where to find her,\u201d Ned put in.</p><p>The sheriff rubbed the side of his face. \u201cDid you ask around town?\u201d</p><p>No one at the pub had been able to help. \u201cNot really. We asked the guys at some tavern, but they didn\u2019t seem aware of much except how full their glasses were.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff grinned and seemed to appreciate Linc\u2019s wry sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very pregnant,\u201d Ned felt obliged to remind everyone. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like someone wouldn\u2019t notice her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mel once more thrust his arms out in front of him and bloated his cheeks for emphasis.</p><p>Linc rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Deputy Pierpont said thoughtfully. \u201cSeems to me I heard something about a pregnant woman earlier.\u201d</p><p>That got Linc\u2019s attention. \u201cWhere?\u201d he asked urgently. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a friend who\u2019s a firefighter and he mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Deputy Pierpont shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t remember. His name\u2019s Hutton. You could go to the fire station and ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Linc stepped forward and shook hands with the sheriff and then, for good measure and goodwill, with each of the deputies. \u201cThanks for all your help.\u201d</p><p>Troy Davis nodded. \u201cYou tell your sister she shouldn\u2019t have worried you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll tell her,\u201d Linc promised. He had quite a few other things he intended to say to her, too.</p><p>After receiving directions to the fire station, they jumped back in the truck. Finally they were getting somewhere, Linc told himself with a feeling of satisfaction. It was just a matter of time before they caught up with her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take them long to locate the fire station.</p><p>Rather than repeat their earlier mistakes\u2014or what Linc considered mistakes\u2014he said, \u201cLet me do the talking, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ned agreed quickly enough.</p><p>\u201cMel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the station house and asked to speak to the duty chief. The man eyed them cautiously.</p><p>Linc got immediately to the point. \u201cI understand that earlier today you responded to an incident involving a young pregnant woman. A firefighter named Hutton was mentioned in connection with this call. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>When the chief didn\u2019t reply, Linc added, \u201cIf so, we believe that\u2019s our sister.\u201d</p><p>The man raised his eyebrows, as if determined not to give out any information.</p><p>\u201cShe needs her family, chief.\u201d</p><p>There must\u2019ve been some emotion in Linc\u2019s voice, some emotion he didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d revealed, because the man hesitated, then excused himself. He returned a few minutes later, followed by a second man.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mack McAfee. He\u2019s the EMT who responded to the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Mary Jo?\u201d Linc asked. He extended his hand, and Mack shook it in a friendly fashion.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Linc\u2019s relief was so great he nearly collapsed into a nearby chair. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Ned blurted out. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t gone into labor or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, she had a dizzy spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDizzy?\u201d Linc repeated slowly and cast a startled look at his brothers.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean what I think it means?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>Linc felt sick to his stomach. \u201cI was twelve when Mary Jo was born and I remember it like it was yesterday. Mom got real dizzy that morning and by noon Mary Jo had arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not generally a sign of oncoming labor,\u201d Mack reassured him.</p><p>\u201cIt is in our family. Dad told me it was that way with each and every pregnancy. According to him, Mom had very quick deliveries and they all started with a dizzy spell. He barely made it to the hospital in time with Mary Jo. In fact\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was born while Dad parked the car,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cHe dropped Mom off at the emergency door and then he went to look for a parking space.\u201d</p><p>That tale had been told around the kitchen table for years. Once their father had parked the car and made his way back to the hospital, he was met by the doctor, who congratulated him on the birth of his baby girl.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d Linc asked with renewed urgency.</p><p>\u201cYou might talk to Grace Harding,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Grace Harding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe librarian.\u201d Mack paused for a moment. \u201cMary Jo was at the library when I treated her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe library?\u201d That didn\u2019t make any sense to Linc. Why had Mary Jo gone to the library?</p><p>\u201cWhat was she doing there?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t as important as where she is now,\u201d Linc said. \u201cMack, do you have any idea where she might\u2019ve gone after she left the library?\u201d He remembered seeing it earlier. The building with the mural.</p><p>Mack shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, although I told her to put her feet up and rest for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve gotten a hotel room.\u201d They should have realized that earlier. Of course! If Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes were out of town, that was exactly what Mary Jo would have done.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mack said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d check on her myself and discovered she isn\u2019t at any of the motels in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rooms available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess,\u201d Mack said slowly, \u201cis to Grace Harding\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy her place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it seems like the kind of thing Mrs. Harding would do. I have the Hardings\u2019 phone number. I could call if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Linc couldn\u2019t believe their good fortune. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The firefighter was gone for what seemed like a long time. He returned wearing a grin. \u201cYou can talk to her yourself if you want.\u201d</p><p>Linc bolted to his feet, eager to hear the sound of his sister\u2019s voice. He\u2019d been upset earlier\u2014angry, worried, close to panic\u2014but all he felt now was relief.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at the Harding ranch in Olalla.\u201d</p><p>The three brothers exchanged smiling glances. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019s feeling great, but she also said she\u2019s ready to go home if you\u2019re willing to come and get her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Linc couldn\u2019t have wished for anything more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you directions to the Harding place. She\u2019s on the phone now if you\u2019d like to chat.\u201d</p><p>Linc grinned, following Mack to the office, his brothers on his heels.</p><p>This was finally working out. They\u2019d get Mary Jo home where she belonged before Christmas.</p> <p>14</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d Mary Jo said, looking at Grace and her family. \u201cI want you to go on to the Christmas Eve service, just like you planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you positive?\u201d Grace seemed uncertain about leaving her behind.</p><p>Mary Jo had bowed to their entreaties and been their guest for a truly wonderful dinner, but she had no intention of imposing on them any further that evening.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d There was no reason for them to stay home because of her, either. This crazy adventure of hers was over; she\u2019d admitted defeat. Her brothers were on their way and she\u2019d be back in Seattle in a couple of hours.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet those young men,\u201d Grace said. \u201cBut it sounds as if they\u2019ll get here while we\u2019re at church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will meet them,\u201d Mary Jo promised. \u201cSometime after Christmas.\u201d In one short afternoon, she\u2019d become strongly attached to both Grace Harding and Cliff. Her two daughters, her daughter-in-law, their husbands and the grandchildren had made Mary Jo feel like part of the family. They\u2019d welcomed her without question, opened their hearts and their home to her, given her a place to sleep, a meal, the comfort of their company. In this day and age, Mary Jo knew that kind of unconditional friendship wasn\u2019t the norm. This was a special family and she planned to keep in touch with them.</p><p>While the fathers loaded up the kids and Cliff brought his car around, Grace lingered.</p><p>\u201cYou have our phone number?\u201d she asked as they stood by the front door.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Cell numbers, too.\u201d Mary Jo patted her pants pocket. Grace had carefully written out all the numbers for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call us soon.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Jo nodded. Grace was like the mother she\u2019d lost\u2014loving, protective, accepting. And now that she was becoming a mother herself, she valued her memory even more profoundly. It was Grace who\u2019d reminded Mary Jo of everything her mother had been to her, of everything she wanted to be to her own child. Even though her baby wasn\u2019t born yet, she felt blessed. Because of her pregnancy she\u2019d met Grace, and she was grateful for everything it had brought her. A new maturity, the knowledge that she could rise to the occasion, that she had the strength to cope. This brand-new friendship. And, of course, the baby to come.</p><p>\u201cIf your brothers are hungry when they get here, there are plenty of leftovers,\u201d Grace was saying. \u201cTell them to help themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Cliff brought the car closer to the house and got out to open the passenger door. Still Grace lingered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to phone if you need anything, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\u2014and thank you.\u201d Wearing her coat like a cloak, Mary Jo walked outside with her into the softly falling snow.</p><p>\u201cWait in the house,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine in the apartment. It\u2019s comfortable there.\u201d</p> <p>The two women hugged and Grace slid into the car seat next to her husband. Maryellen, Kelly and Lisa, with their families, had already left for the church.</p><p>Grace lowered the window. \u201cThank you for being so patient with Tyler,\u201d she said, giving her an apologetic look.</p><p>Mary Jo smiled, completely enchanted with the six-year-old who\u2019d received a drum for Christmas and felt obliged to pound away on it incessantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a talented little boy.\u201d In fact, she loved all of Grace and Cliff\u2019s grandchildren.</p><p>\u201cNow go inside before you get cold,\u201d Grace scolded.</p><p>But Mary Jo remained in the yard until the car lights faded out of sight. Then, pulling her coat more snugly around her, she strolled toward the barn. Several of the participants in the live Nativity scene were inside a corral attached to the barn and she went there first.</p><p>\u201cHello there, donkey,\u201d she said. \u201cMerry Christmas to you.\u201d</p><p>As if he understood that she was talking to him, the donkey walked toward her until he was within petting range. Mary Jo stroked his velvety nose, then walked back inside the barn.</p><p>\u201cHello, everyone.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her voice, Funny Face stuck her head over the stall door.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d Mary Jo greeted the mare. \u201cI understand you\u2019re very special to Cliff,\u201d she said. Funny Face nickered loudly in response.</p><p>Apparently curious as to what was causing all the commotion, the camel poked her head out, too. \u201cSorry, Camel,\u201d Mary Jo called, \u201cbut your reputation has preceded you and I\u2019m not giving you a chance to bite my arm.\u201d</p><p>After several minutes of chatting with the other horses, Mary Jo washed her hands at a sink in the barn and headed up the stairs to the apartment. About halfway up, her back started to ache again. She pressed one hand against it and continued climbing, holding onto the railing with the other.</p><p>When she reached the apartment, she paused in the middle of removing her coat as she felt a powerful tightening across her stomach.</p><p>Was this labor?</p><p>She suspected it must be, but everything she\u2019d heard and read stated that contractions began gradually. What she\u2019d just experienced was intense and had lasted several long, painful seconds. Another contraction came almost right away.</p><p>Mary Jo checked her watch this time. Three minutes later there was a third contraction of equal severity.</p><p>Only three minutes.</p><p>At the class she\u2019d attended, she\u2019d heard that it wasn\u2019t uncommon for labor pains to start at fifteen-minute intervals. Perhaps hers had started earlier and she hadn\u2019t noticed. That didn\u2019t seem possible, though. How could she be in labor and not know it?</p><p>The next pain caught her unawares and she grabbed her stomach and doubled over.</p><p>\u201cThat got my attention,\u201d she announced to the empty room.</p><p>Not sure what to do next, Mary Jo paced, deliberating on the best course of action. Her brothers were due any moment. If she told them she was in labor the second they arrived, they\u2019d panic. One thing Mary Jo knew: she did not want her three brothers delivering this baby.</p><p>None of them had any experience or even the slightest idea of what to do. Linc would probably order the baby to wait until they could get to a hospital. Knowing Mel and his queasy stomach, he\u2019d fall in a dead faint, while Ned would walk around declaring that this was just perfect. He was going to be an uncle to a baby born on Christmas Eve\u2014or Christmas Day, depending on how long this labor business was going to take.</p><p>Another pain struck and again Mary Jo bent double with the strength of it. She exhaled slowly and timed it, staring at her watch. This one lasted thirty seconds. Half a minute. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen this fast! Labor was supposed to last for hours and hours.</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t know what to do or who to call. Her mind was spinning, her thoughts scrambling in a dozen different directions at once. She considered phoning Grace. If she was going to give birth here, at the ranch, she wanted a woman with her\u2014and she couldn\u2019t think of anyone she\u2019d rather have than Grace Harding. But Grace had left just a few minutes before and the only way to reach her was by cell phone. Unfortunately, as she\u2019d learned earlier, coverage in this area was sporadic at best. And she hated to interfere with the Hardings\u2019 Christmas plans.</p><p>The second person she thought of was Mack McAfee. He\u2019d been so kind, and he was a trained medical technician. He was calm and logical, which was exactly what she needed. He\u2019d called\u2014when was it? Half an hour ago\u2014and urged her to go home with her brothers. There\u2019d be plenty of time to talk to Ben and Charlotte Rhodes after the baby\u2019s birth. Her brothers wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to confront David or his father now, anyway, and she\u2019d manage, somehow or other, to prevent it in the future, too. While she was speaking with Linc, she\u2019d realized how desperate her brothers had been to find her. Mary Jo hadn\u2019t meant to worry them like this.</p><p>If Linc or Mel or even Ned had reasoned with her like Mack had, she would\u2019ve listened. Too late to worry about any of that now...</p><p>Mary Jo went slowly back down the stairs to the barn. She didn\u2019t want to dial 9-1-1 and cause alarm the way she had with her dizzy spell at the library earlier, so she decided to call the fire station directly.</p><p>Sure enough, when she picked up the receiver she saw that Caller ID displayed the last number that had been received\u2014the firehouse. Mary Jopushed there dial button.</p><p>On the second ring, someone picked up. \u201cKitsap County Fire District.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over her at the sound of Mack\u2019s voice. \u201cMack?\u201d</p><p>There was a slight hesitation. \u201cMary Jo? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...Grace and her family left for Christmas Eve service at the church about ten minutes ago. I didn\u2019t go because my brothers are on their way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t arrived yet?\u201d He seemed surprised.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Mack groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll bet they\u2019re lost.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t doubt that for an instant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be there anytime,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI hate to bother you,\u201d she whispered and gasped at the severity of the next contraction.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo!\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she mentally counted until the pain subsided.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve gone into labor.\u201d</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cThen I should get out there so I can transport you to the birthing center.\u201d</p><p>At the rate this was progressing, he\u2019d better not lose any time. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>He must have sensed her fear, because he asked, \u201cHow far apart are the contractions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree minutes. I\u2019ve been timing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take all the birthing classes...I wish I had, but David said he\u2019d take them with me and it never happened. I went once but that was just last week and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine. If you want, I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not such a bad coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be a wonderful coach, but you have to remember I\u2019ve only had the one class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, instead of talking about it over the phone, why don\u2019t I hop in the aid car and drive over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRi-ight.\u201d At the strength of the last contraction, Mary Jo was beginning to think this was an excellent idea.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the barn at the moment.\u201d She gave a small laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with the animals from the live Nativity scene.\u201d</p><p>Mack laughed then, too. \u201cThat seems appropriate under the circumstances, but I want you to go to the house and wait for me there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather go back to the apartment if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d It was hard to explain but the place felt like home to her now, at least for this one night.</p><p>\u201cFine. Just don\u2019t lock the door. I\u2019ll be there soon, so hold on, okay?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any choice but to hold on. \u201cOkay. But Mack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.

She\u2019d swear the creature was laughing at her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t supposed to be happening yet.\u201d</p> <p>A sheep walked up to the gate, bleating loudly, and Mary Jo wagged her index finger. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear from you, either.\u201d</p><p>All the horses in their stalls studied her with interest, but the only one who looked at her with anything that resembled compassion was Funny Face.</p><p>\u201cWish me well, Funny Face,\u201d Mary Jo whispered as she started back up the stairs. \u201cI need all the good wishes I can get.\u201d</p><p>Absorbed in the cycle of pain and then relief, followed by pain again, Mary Jo lost track of time. Finally she heard a vehicle pull into the yard. A moment later, Mack entered the apartment, a second man behind him. They were both breathless; they must have run up the stairs.</p><p>Mary Jo was so grateful to see him she nearly burst into tears. Clutching her belly, she walked over to Mack and said hoarsely, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot...good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sign of your brothers?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Mack glanced over his shoulder at the second EMT.</p><p>\u201cThis is Brandon Hutton. Remember him from this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Mary Jo raised her hand and wiggled her fingers.</p><p>\u201cHow far apart are the pains now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill three minutes, but they\u2019re lasting much longer.\u201d</p> <p>Mack turned to the other man. \u201cI think we\u2019d better check her before we transport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>This was all so embarrassing, but Mary Jo would rather be dealing with Mack than any of her brothers. Mack would be impersonal about it, professional. And, most important of all, he knew what he was doing.</p><p>Taking her by the hand, Mack led her into the bedroom. He pulled back the sheets, then covered the bed with towels. Mary Jo lay down on the mattress and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mack announced when he\u2019d finished. \u201cYou\u2019re fully dilated. You\u2019re about to enter the second phase of labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, it means we don\u2019t have time to take you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s going to deliver my baby?\u201d she asked, fighting her tears.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like that\u2019ll be me,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>Mary Jo held out her hand to him and Mack grabbed it in both of his.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d he said with such confidence she couldn\u2019t help believing him. \u201cYou can do this. And I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d Mel taunted, \u201cwe\u2019re lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said as much thirty minutes ago,\u201d Linc said sharply. He didn\u2019t need his brother to tell him what he already knew.</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve gotten the Hardings\u2019 phone number,\u201d Ned commented from the backseat.</p><p>That was obvious. \u201cYou might\u2019ve mentioned it at the time,\u201d Linc snapped. They\u2019d been driving around for almost an hour and he had no idea where they were. Mack McAfee had drawn them a map but it hadn\u2019t helped; somehow they\u2019d gone in the wrong direction and were now completely and utterly lost.</p><p>To further complicate matters, a fog had settled in over the area. It seemed they\u2019d run the gamut of Pacific Northwest winter weather, and all within the last eight hours. There\u2019d been sleet and snow, rain and cold. Currently they were driving through a fog so thick he could hardly see the road.</p><p>\u201cRead me the directions again,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel flipped on the interior light, which nearly blinded Linc. \u201cHey, turn that off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to read these notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need the light,\u201d Ned told him. \u201cI\u2019ve got them memorized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where are we?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d Linc muttered in frustration.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Mel sighed deeply. \u201cFighting isn\u2019t going to help us find Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Linc pulled over to the side of the road and shifted to face his brothers. \u201cEither of you have any other ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go to the firehouse and start over,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cOnce we\u2019re there, we could get the Hardings\u2019 phone number,\u201d Ned added. \u201cWe could call and let Mary Jo know we\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>Linc gritted his teeth. \u201cFine. But have either of you geniuses figured out how to get back to the firehouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Mel glanced at Ned, who shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI guess we can\u2019t do that because we\u2019re lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Linc said. \u201cAny other ideas?\u201d He was feeling more helpless and frustrated by the second.</p><p>\u201cWe could always ask someone,\u201d Ned suggested next.</p><p>\u201cWho are we supposed to ask?\u201d Mel cried. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen another car in over half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a place down this road,\u201d Ned said in a tentative voice.</p><p>Linc stared at him. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d Mel didn\u2019t seem to believe him, and Linc wasn\u2019t convinced, either.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there, trust me.\u201d Ned\u2019s expression, however, did little to inspire Linc\u2019s confidence.</p><p>\u201cI remember the name,\u201d his youngest brother said indignantly. \u201cIt was called King\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of place was it?\u201d</p><p>Ned apparently needed time to consider this.</p><p>\u201cA tavern?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>Ned shook his head.</p><p>\u201cA gas-and-go?\u201d Mel offered.</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve been. There were a bunch of broken-down cars out front.\u201d</p><p>Linc didn\u2019t recall any such place. \u201cHow come I didn\u2019t see it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause you were driving.\u201d</p><p>That actually made sense. Concentrating on maneuvering down these back roads in the fog, it was all he could do to make sure his truck didn\u2019t end up in a ditch.</p><p>\u201cI think I saw it, too,\u201d Mel said a moment later. \u201cThe building\u2019s set off the road, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ned perked up. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith tires edging the driveway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have a prayer of finding it again?\u201d Linc asked his brothers.</p><p>Ned and Mel exchanged looks. \u201cI think so,\u201d Ned told him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Linc put the pickup back in gear. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d Ned told him.</p><p>Linc started down the road, then thought to ask, \u201cAre you sure this King\u2019s place is open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooked like it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mel concurred. \u201cThere were plenty of lights. Not Christmas lights, though. Regular lights.\u201d</p><p>Linc drove in silence for several minutes. Both his brothers were focused on finding this joint. Just when the entire trip seemed futile, Linc crested a hill and emerged out of the fog, which made a tremendous difference in visibility. Instantly he breathed easier.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Ned shouted, pointing down the roadway.</p><p>Linc squinted and, sure enough, he saw the business his brothers had been yapping about. Maybe there was some hope, after all.</p><p>Linc had no idea how his sister had ended up in the boondocks. He wished she\u2019d stayed in town, but, oh, no, not Mary Jo.</p><p>As they neared the building, Linc noticed a sign that said King\u2019s. Linc could see his brother\u2019s point; it was hard to tell exactly what type of business this was. The sign certainly didn\u2019t give any indication. True, there were beat-up old cars out front, so one might assume it was some sort of junk or salvage yard. The building itself was in ill repair; at the very least, it needed a fresh coat of paint. There wasn\u2019t a single Christmas decoration in sight.</p><p>However, the Open sign in the window was lit.</p><p>Linc walked up to the door, peered in and saw a small restaurant, basically a counter with a few stools, and a convenience store. He went inside and strolled up to the counter, taking a seat. Mel and Ned joined him.</p><p>Alarge over weight man wearing a stained white T-shirt and a white apron waddled over to their end of the counter as if he\u2019d been sitting there all day, waiting for them.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Linc murmured, reaching for the menu.</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>This guy was in a charming mood.</p><p>\u201cWhaddaya want?\u201d the cook asked.</p><p>\u201cCoffee for me,\u201d Linc said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the special?\u201d Mel asked, looking at a sign on the wall that said, Ask About Our Daily Special.</p><p>\u201cMeat loaf, mashed potatoes, corn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to order food, it\u2019s gotta be takeout,\u201d Linc told his brothers, although now that the subject had come up, Linc realized he was hungry, too. Famished, in fact.</p><p>\u201cWe do takeout,\u201d the cook said, filling Linc\u2019s mug with coffee that had obviously been in the pot far too long. It was black and thick and resembled liquid tar more than coffee.</p><p>\u201cIs that fresh?\u201d Linc risked asking.</p><p>\u201cSure is. Made it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Linc pushed the mug away. \u201cWe\u2019ll take three meat loaf sandwiches to go,\u201d he said, making a snap decision.</p><p>\u201cYou want the mashed potatoes with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have potato chips instead?\u201d Ned inquired.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay,\u201d Linc said, leaning back on the stool. \u201cDo you happen to know where the Harding ranch is?\u201d</p><p>The cook scowled at him. \u201cWho\u2019s askin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Linc didn\u2019t want to get into long explanations. \u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>Cook nodded. \u201cCliff\u2019s a...neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Maybe they were closer than Linc had thought.</p><p>\u201cRaises the best horses around these parts.\u201d The cook sounded somewhat grudging as he said this.</p><p>Linc knew car engines inside out but didn\u2019t have a clue about horses, and he had no idea how to respond.</p><p>Fortunately he didn\u2019t have to. \u201cYou fellows interested in buying one of Cliff\u2019s horses?\u201d the old curmudgeon asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Linc hoped that wasn\u2019t disappointing news. \u201cWe\u2019re, uh, supposed to be meeting our sister, who\u2019s staying at the Harding place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had directions,\u201d Mel explained.</p><p>\u201cBut we sort of got turned around.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn other words, we\u2019re lost,\u201d Linc said.</p><p>\u201cLemme make you those sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about giving us directions?\u201d</p><p>King, or whatever his name was, sighed as if this was asking too much. \u201cI could\u2014for a price.\u201d</p> <p>Linc slapped a ten-dollar bill on the counter.</p><p>The grouch eyed the money and shrugged. \u201cThat might get you there. Then again, it might not.\u201d</p><p>Linc threw in another ten. \u201cThis is all you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He pocketed the money and slouched off toward the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll be back with your order.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, he returned with a large white bag packed with sandwiches, potato chips and canned sodas. Linc decided not to ask how old the meat loaf was. He paid the tab and didn\u2019t complain at the price, which seemed seriously inflated.</p> <p>\u201cAbout those directions?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>Ned took out the map the firefighter had drawn and spread it on the linoleum counter. The route from Cedar Cove to the Harding place looked pretty direct, and Linc didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d managed to get so confused.</p><p>\u201cThe King\u2019s gonna set you straight,\u201d the grouch told them.</p><p>\u201cGood, because we are lost,\u201d Mel said, dragging out the last word.</p><p>\u201cBig-time lost,\u201d Ned added.</p><p>This was a point that did not need further emphasis. Linc would\u2019ve preferred his brothers keep their mouths shut, but that wasn\u2019t likely to happen.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re here,\u201d King informed them, drawing a circle around their current location. He highlighted the street names at the closest intersection. \u201cYou\u2019re near the corner of Burley and Glenwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Linc said.</p><p>\u201cYou need to head east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEast,\u201d Linc repeated.</p><p>\u201cGo down about two miles and you cross the highway via the overpass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, got that.\u201d</p><p>The grouch turned the directions around and circled the Harding ranch. \u201cThis is where Cliff and Grace Harding live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, all you do after you cross the highway is go east. Keep going until you see the water, then turn left. The Harding place will be about three-quarters of a mile down the road on the left-hand side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Linc said. Those directions seemed easy enough for anyone to follow. Even the three of them.</p><p>The grouch frowned at hi, and Linc assumed he was hinting for more money, which he wasn\u2019t about to get. Grabbing their sandwiches, Linc handed the bag to his youngest brother and they piled out the door.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Ned called over his shoulder. Apparently he hadn\u2019t grasped yet that this man wasn\u2019t doing any kind of celebrating.</p><p>The grouch\u2019s frown darkened. \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Linc waited until they were back in the vehicle before he commented. \u201cMiserable old guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA regular Scrooge,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Ned tore open the sack and passed one sandwich to Linc and another to Mel. Linc bit into his. The old grouch made a good meat loaf sandwich, surprisingly enough, and right now that compensated for a lot.</p><p>The three of them wolfed down the food and nearly missed the sign for the highway overpass.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two, I\u2019m driving,\u201d Linc said, swallowing the last bite. \u201cPay attention, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Ned stared out at the road.</p><p>\u201cHe said to drive until we can see the water,\u201d Linc reminded them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark,\u201d Mel protested. \u201cHow are we supposed to see water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know when we find it,\u201d Ned put in.</p><p>Linc rolled his eyes. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d</p><p>Linc couldn\u2019t tell how far they\u2019d driven, but the water never came into view. \u201cDid we miss something?\u201d he asked his brothers.</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d Mel insisted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say when we\u2019d see the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Linc agreed, but he had a bad feeling about this. The road wasn\u2019t straight ahead the way the grouch had drawn it on the map. It twisted and turned until Linc was, once again, so confused he no longer knew if he was going east or west.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that King guy would\u2019ve intentionally given us the wrong directions, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cYou paid him twenty bucks.\u201d</p><p>Linc remembered the look on the other man\u2019s face. He\u2019d wanted more. \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Mr. Scrooge back there needs three visitors tonight,\u201d Ned suggested. \u201cIf you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had three visitors\u2014us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I think he was trying to con us,\u201d Linc muttered.</p><p>\u201cI guess he succeeded,\u201d Mel said, just as Ned asked, \u201cBut why? What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is that he\u2019s trying to make us miserable,\u201d Linc said. \u201cAs miserable as he is, the old coot.\u201d</p><p>The three of them fell into a glum silence. It sure didn\u2019t feel like any Christmas Eve they\u2019d ever had before.</p><p>16</p><p>By the time Grace and Cliff arrived at church for the Christmas Eve service, both her daughters and their husbands were already seated. So were Lisa, Rich and April. Maryellen held Drake, who slept peacefully in his mother\u2019s arms. Katie, as well as Tyler, were with the other local children getting ready for the big Christmas pageant.</p><p>Katie was excited about being an angel, although Tyler, who\u2019d been assigned the role of a shepherd, didn\u2019t show much enthusiasm for his stage debut. If he displayed any emotion at all, it was disappointment that he couldn\u2019t bring his drum. Kelly had explained to him that the shepherds of the day played the flute, not drums, because drums would frighten the sheep. The explanation satisfied Tyler, who was of a logical disposition, but it didn\u2019t please him.</p><p>Grace and Cliff located a pew directly behind her daughters and Lisa. As they slipped in, Grace whispered that she\u2019d prefer to sit closest to the aisle, craving the best possible view of her grandchildren\u2019s performances. Once they were seated, Cliff reached for her hand, entwining their fingers.</p><p>Maryellen turned around and whispered, \u201cIs everything all right with Mary Jo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Grace still didn\u2019t feel comfortable about leaving her alone. But Mary Jo had been adamant that Grace join her family, so she had. Now, however, she wished she\u2019d stayed behind.</p><p>Cliff squeezed her hand as the white-robed choir sang Christmas hymns, accompanied by the organist. \u201cO, Come All Ye Faithful\u201d had never sounded more beautiful.</p><p>Olivia and Jack, carrying his Santa hat, came down the aisle and slid into the pew across from Grace and Cliff. Justine and Seth accompanied them. From a conversation with Justine earlier in the week, Grace knew Leif had gotten the coveted role of one of the three Wise Men.</p><p>As soon as Olivia saw Grace, she edged out of her pew and went to see her friend. Olivia had wrapped a red silk scarf around her shoulders, over her black wool coat. Despite everything she\u2019d endured, she remained the picture of dignity and elegance.</p><p>She leaned toward Grace. \u201cHow\u2019s Mary Jo?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>Grace shrugged. \u201cI left her at the house by herself, and now I wish I hadn\u2019t. Oh,\u201d she added, \u201capparently her brothers are in town....\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d</p><p>Grace quickly shook her head. \u201cMary Jo actually seemed relieved to hear from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she going home to Seattle with her family, then?\u201d Olivia stepped sideways in the aisle to make room for a group of people trying to get past.</p><p>Grace nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow did they find out she was with you?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cThey tracked her down through Mack McAfee. He phoned the house and talked to her directly. Then Mary Jo spoke with her oldest brother and decided it would be best to go back to Seattle.\u201d Grace had been with her at the time and was astonished by the way Mary Jo\u2019s spirits had lifted. Whether that was because of her brothers or because of Mack...Grace tended to think it was the latter.</p><p>\u201cMack appeared to have a calming effect on her when I saw them at the library,\u201d Olivia said, echoing Grace\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI noticed it after she got off the phone, too. Apparently he suggested she should return home with her brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cFor her own sake and theirs. And for Mom and Ben\u2019s...\u201d She paused, shaking her head. \u201cAs necessary as it is for them to know about this baby, I\u2019d rather it didn\u2019t happen the second they got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer real fear was that her brothers were going to burst onto the scene and demand that David do the so-called honorable thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid and the word honor don\u2019t belong in the same sentence,\u201d Olivia said wryly.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo\u2019s brothers were arriving any minute. I\u2019d like to have met them. Or at least talked to them.\u201d Grace would\u2019ve phoned the house, but by now Mary Jo should be well on her way to Seattle.</p><p>Olivia straightened. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up after the service,\u201d she said and slid into the opposite pew, beside Jack.</p><p>No sooner had Olivia sat down than Pastor Flemming stepped up to the podium. He seemed to be...at peace. Relaxed, yet full of energy and optimism. The worry lines were gone from his face. Grace knew this had been a difficult year for the pastor and his wife, and she was glad their problems had been resolved.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he said, his voice booming across the church.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d the congregation chanted.</p><p>\u201cBefore the children come out for the pageant, I\u2019d like us all to look at the Christmas story again. For those of us who\u2019ve grown up in the church, it\u2019s become a familiar part of our lives. This evening, however, I want you to forget that you\u2019re sitting on this side of history. Go back to the day the angel came to tell Mary she was about to conceive a child.\u201d</p><p>He opened his Bible and read the well-known passages from the Book of Luke. \u201cI want us to fully appreciate Mary\u2019s faith,\u201d he said, looking up. \u201cThe angel came to her and said she\u2019d conceive a child by the Holy Spirit and she was to name him Jesus, which in those days was a common name.\u201d He paused and gazed out at his congregation.</p><p>\u201cCan you understand Mary\u2019s confusion? What the angel told her was the equivalent of saying to a young woman in our times that she\u2019s going to give birth to God\u2019s son and she should name him Bob.\u201d</p><p>The congregation smiled and a few people laughed outright.</p><p>\u201cRemember, too,\u201d Pastor Flemming continued, \u201cthat although Mary was engaged to Joseph, she remained with her family. This meant she had to tell her parents she was with child. That couldn\u2019t have been easy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think her mother and father thought? What if one of our daughters came to us and said she was pregnant? What if she claimed an angel had told her that the child had been conceived by the work of the Holy Spirit?\u201d Again he paused, as if inviting everyone to join him in contemplating this scenario. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pastor Flemming grinned. \u201cAlthough I have two sons and no daughters, I know what I\u2019d think. I\u2019d assume that a teenage girl\u2014or her boyfriend\u2014would say anything to explain how this had happened.\u201d</p><p>Most people in the congregation smiled and agreed with nodding heads. Grace cringed a little, remembering as vividly as ever the day she\u2019d told her parents she was pregnant. She remembered their disappointment, their anger and, ultimately, their support. Then she thought of Mary Jo and turned to exchange a quick glance with Olivia.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d the pastor went on, \u201cthis child, the very son of God, was growing inside her womb. Mary revealed remarkable faith, but then so did her family and Joseph, the young man to whom she was engaged.\u201d</p><p>Something briefly distracted the pastor and he looked to his left. \u201cI can see the children are ready and eager to begin their performance, so I won\u2019t take up any more time. I do want to say this one thing, however. As a boy, I was given the role of a shepherd standing guard over his sheep when the angel came to announce the birth of the Christ Child. When I grew up, I chose, in a sense, the very same job\u2014that of a shepherd. Every one of you is a member of my flock and I care for you deeply. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d the congregation echoed.</p><p>As he stepped down from the podium, the children took their positions on the makeshift stage. Grace moved right to the end of her pew to get a better view of the proceedings. Katie stood proudly in place, her gold wings jutting out from her small shoulders and her halo sitting crookedly atop her head. She couldn\u2019t have looked more angelic if she\u2019d tried.</p><p>Tyler had borrowed one of Cliff\u2019s walking sticks to use as a staff. He was obviously still annoyed to be without his precious drum, glaring at the congregation as if to inform them that he was doing this under protest. Grace had to smother a laugh.</p><p>Oh, how Dan would\u2019ve loved seeing his grandchildren tonight. Their grandson was like his grandfather in so many ways. A momentary sadness came over her and not wanting anyone to sense her thoughts, Grace looked away. She didn\u2019t often think about Dan anymore. She\u2019d loved her first husband, had two daughters with him, and through the years they\u2019d achieved a comfortable life together.</p><p>But Dan had never been the same after Vietnam. For a lot of years, Grace had blamed herself and her own failings for his unhappiness. Dan knew that and had done his best to make things right in the letter he wrote her before his death.</p> <p>Christmas Eve, however, wasn\u2019t a night for troubled memories. The grandchildren Dan would never know were onstage, giving the performances of their young lives.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Grace noticed Angel, the church secretary, rushing down the side aisle and toward the front. She went to the first pew, where Pastor Flemming sat with his wife, Emily.</p><p>Angel whispered something in his ear and the pastor nodded. He left with her. Apparently there was some sort of emergency.</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s a star in the East,\u201d Leif Gunderson, Olivia\u2019s grandson, shouted. As one of the three Wise Men, he pointed at the church ceiling.</p><p>\u201cLet us follow the star,\u201d the second of the Wise Men called out.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Cliff tapped her arm that she realized Angel was trying to get her attention. She stood in the side aisle and motioned with her finger for Grace to come out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d Cliff asked as she picked up her purse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll tell you as soon as I find out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Grace hurried down the center aisle to the foyer, reaching it just as Angel did. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle I was even in the office,\u201d Angel said.</p><p>This confused Grace. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the phone call,\u201d she explained. \u201cI went to get a pair of scissors. Mrs. Murphy, the first-grade Sunday School teacher, needed scissors and I thought there was a pair in my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone call,\u201d Grace reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, sorry. It was from some young firefighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack McAfee?\u201d Grace blurted out.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Brandon Hutton. At any rate, he wanted to speak to the pastor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas there been an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I don\u2019t know. I think it would be best if you talked to Pastor Flemming yourself. He asked me to get you.\u201d</p><p>Dave Flemming was on the phone, a worried expression on his face. When he saw Grace, he held out the receiver. \u201cYou\u2019d better take this.\u201d</p><p>Grace dismissed her first fear, that there\u2019d been an accident. Everyone she loved, everyone who was important to her here in Cedar Cove, was inside the church.</p><p>\u201cThis is Grace Harding,\u201d she said into the receiver, her voice quavering slightly.</p><p>\u201cMs. Harding, this is EMT Hutton from the Kitsap County Fire District. We received a distress call from a young woman who\u2019s currently at your home.\u201d</p><p>Grace gasped. \u201cMary Jo? She\u2019s still at the house? Is she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so, ma\u2019am. However, she\u2019s in labor and asking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you be transporting her to the hospital? Shouldn\u2019t I meet you there?\u201d Grace would notify Cliff and they could leave together.</p><p>From the moment she\u2019d left the house, some instinct had told her she should\u2019ve stayed with Mary Jo. Some inner knowledge that said Mary Jo would be having her baby not in two weeks but now. Tonight.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be transporting her, Ms. Harding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, why not?\u201d Grace demanded, wondering if it was a jurisdictional matter. If so, she\u2019d get Olivia involved.</p><p>\u201cIt appears Ms. Wyse is going to give birth imminently. We don\u2019t have time to transport her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not alone, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. EMT McAfee is with her.\u201d</p><p>Mack. Thank goodness. \u201cWhat about her brothers?\u201d she asked. Surely they\u2019d arrived by now.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else here, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s heart started to pound. \u201cI\u2019ll get there as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne last thing,\u201d Officer Hutton added. \u201cDo you normally keep camels in your barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But be warned. She bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already attempted to take a piece out of me. I managed to avoid it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She set down the receiver and turned to Pastor Flemming. \u201cA young woman who\u2019s staying with us has gone into labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll collect my husband and get going.\u201d Grace hated to miss the pageant but there was nothing she could do about it.</p><p>Returning to the pew, she explained to Cliff what was happening. Maryellen twisted around and Grace told her, too.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have anything for the baby, does she?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>Grace hadn\u2019t even thought of that. She had blankets and a few other supplies for her grandchildren, but the disposable diapers would be far too big.</p><p>\u201cJon and I will stop by the house and get some things for Mary Jo and the baby and drop them off. I\u2019m sure I still have a package of newborn-size diapers, too.\u201d</p><p>Grace touched her daughter\u2019s shoulder, grateful for Maryellen\u2019s quick thinking.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring Lisa, Rich and April back to the house,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss this for the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a more ideal way to celebrate Christmas!\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d Mack assured Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she cried, exhaling a harsh breath. Giving birth was hard, harder than she\u2019d ever envisioned and the pain...the pain was indescribable.</p><p>The second EMT came back into the bedroom. \u201cI talked to your friend and she\u2019s on her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d It was difficult for Mary Jo to speak in the middle of a contraction. The pain was so intense and she panted, imitating Mack who\u2019d shown her a breathing exercise to help deal with it.</p><p>Mack held her hand and she squeezed as tight as she could, so tight she was afraid she might be hurting him. If that was the case, he didn\u2019t let on.</p><p>\u201cGet a cool damp washcloth,\u201d Mack instructed the other man.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d As though thankful for something to do, Brandon Hutton shot out of the room and down the hallway to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check you again,\u201d Mack told her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She clung to his hand, gripping it even tighter.</p><p>\u201cI need you here. Beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo, I have to see what position the baby\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d She closed her eyes. Sweat poured off her forehead. Now she knew why giving birth was called labor. This was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done. Unfortunately there wasn\u2019t time to go to any more classes, or to finish reading the books she\u2019d started.... She\u2019d thought she had two more weeks. If only she hadn\u2019t waited for David, or believed him when he\u2019d said he wanted to attend the birthing classes with her. This was what she got for trusting him.</p><p>Suddenly liquid gushed from between her legs. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYour water just broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d forgotten about that. She had a vague recollection of other women\u2019s stories about their water breaking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked. What she hoped was that it meant her baby was almost ready to be born and this agony would come to an end.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better now, right?\u201d</p><p>Mack hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she demanded. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour labor may intensify.\u201d</p><p>This had to be a cruel joke. \u201cIntensify.\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine how the pains could get any stronger than they were now. \u201cWhat do you mean...intensify?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contractions will probably last longer....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>Although she\u2019d discovered this was Mack\u2019s first birth, he knew so much more than she did. He\u2019d at least studied it and obviously paid attention during class. Mack had joked that he was getting on-the-job training\u2014and so was she, but that part didn\u2019t seem so amusing anymore.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s fully in the birth canal. It won\u2019t be long now, Mary Jo. Just a few more pains and you\u2019ll have your baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Mary Jo didn\u2019t know how much more of this she could take.</p><p>\u201cRest between contractions,\u201d Mack advised.</p><p>Brandon Hutton returned with a damp washcloth. Mack took it from him and wiped her face. The cool cloth against her heated skin felt wonderfully refreshing.</p><p>At the approach of another pain, she screamed, \u201cMack! Mack!\u201d</p><p>Instantly he was at her side, his hand holding hers. Her fingers tightened around his.</p><p>\u201cCount,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three...\u201d</p><p>The numbers droned on and she concentrated on listening to the even cadence of Mack\u2019s voice, knowing that by the time he reached fifty, the contraction would ease. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Halfway through, she started to pant. And then felt the instinctive urge to bear down. Arching her back, Mary Jo pushed with every ounce of her strength.</p><p>When the pain passed, she was too exhausted to speak.</p><p>Mack wiped her forehead again and brushed the damp hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cWater,\u201d she mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Brandon Hutton tore out of the room, like a man on a quest.</p><p>Recovering from the pain, she breathed deeply, her chest heaving. She opened her eyes and looked up at Mack. His gaze was tender.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand much more of this...I just can\u2019t.\u201d Tears welled in her eyes and rolled down the sides of her face.</p> <p>Mack dabbed at her cheeks. As their eyes met, he gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cYou can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else,\u201d he told her. They continued to hold hands.</p><p>Brandon came back with the water. \u201cHere,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mack took the glass and held it for Mary Jo, supporting her head. \u201cJust a sip or two,\u201d he cautioned.</p><p>She nodded and savored each tiny sip.</p> <p>The sound of a car door slamming echoed in the distance.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Mary Jo said, grateful the other woman had finally arrived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring her up.\u201d Brandon quickly disappeared from the room.</p><p>Another pain approached. \u201cNo...no...\u201d she whimpered, gathering her resolve to get through this next contraction. She closed her eyes and clung to Mack, thanking God once more that she wasn\u2019t alone. That Mack was with her...</p><p>Mack automatically began to count. Again she felt the urge to push. Gritting her teeth, she bore down, grunting loudly for the first time, straining her entire body.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo.\u201d Grace\u2019s serene voice broke through the haze of pain. \u201cI came as soon as I heard.\u201d</p><p>The contraction eased and Mary Jo collapsed onto the mattress, sweat blinding her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s in the birth canal,\u201d Mack told her friend.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cHold on to her hand and count off the seconds when the contractions come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...don\u2019t leave me.\u201d Mary Jo couldn\u2019t do this without Mack at her side.</p><p>\u201cI need to deliver the baby,\u201d he explained, his words so gentle they felt like a warm caress. \u201cGrace will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Reluctantly Mary Jo freed Mack\u2019s hand.</p><p>Grace slipped into his spot. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>\u201cHow would you do that?\u201d Grace asked, clasping her hand.</p><p>Somehow she found the strength to smile. \u201cI squeeze hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to hurt me,\u201d Grace said reassuringly. \u201cYou squeeze as hard as you need to and don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d She reached for the damp cloth and wiped Mary Jo\u2019s flushed and heated face.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t have anything for the baby,\u201d she whispered. That thought suddenly struck Mary Jo and nearly devastated her. Her baby wasn\u2019t even born yet, and already she was a terrible mother. Already she\u2019d failed her child.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I don\u2019t even have a blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen and Jon are stopping at their house for diapers and baby blankets and clothes for a newborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen still has all of Drake\u2019s clothes, so that should be the least of your worries, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d A weight lifted from her heart.</p><p>Another pain approached. Mary Jo could feel herself pushing the infant from the womb. She gritted her teeth, bearing down with all her strength.</p><p>Grace, her voice strong and confident, counted off the seconds. Again, when the pain was over, Mary Jo collapsed on the bed.</p><p>In the silence that followed, Mary Jo could hear the sound of her own harsh breathing. Then in the distance she heard the laughter of children.</p><p>\u201cThe kids...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe grandchildren are outside with Cliff,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cLaughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell Cliff to keep them quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no. It\u2019s...joyful.\u201d This was the way it should be on Christmas Eve. Hearing their happiness gave her hope. Her baby, no matter what the future held, would be born surrounded by people who were kind and encouraging.</p><p>Giving birth in a barn, the stalls below filled with beasts, children running and laughing outside, celebrating the season, hadn\u2019t been part of Mary Jo\u2019s plan. And yet\u2014it was perfect.</p><p>So perfect.</p><p>This was a thousand times better than being alone with strangers in a hospital. None of her brothers would\u2019ve been comfortable staying with her through labor. Maybe Ned, but even her youngest brother, as much as he loved her, wouldn\u2019t have done well seeing her in all this pain.</p><p>Mack had been with her from the first, and now Grace.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered to them both.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mary Jo, thank you,\u201d Grace whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so honored to be helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d She smiled tremulously at Grace, then Mack. How she wished she\u2019d fallen in love with him instead of David. Mack was everything a man should be....</p><p>Another pain came, and she locked her eyes with his for as long as she could until the contraction became too strong. She surrendered to it, whimpering softly.</p><p>\u201cThe head\u2019s almost there,\u201d Mack said when the pain finally released her. \u201cYour baby has lots of brown hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother pain or two and this will be over,\u201d Grace promised.</p><p>\u201cThank God, thank God,\u201d Mary Jo said fervently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a good mother,\u201d Grace told her.</p><p>Mary Jo wanted to believe that. Needed to believe it. All night, she\u2019d been tortured with doubts and, worse, with guilt about arriving at this moment totally unprepared.</p><p>\u201cI want to be a good mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cI love my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Grace whisked the damp hair from her brow.</p><p>Mary Jo was drenched in sweat, her face streaked with tears. \u201cI\u2019m never going through this again,\u201d she gasped, looking at Grace. \u201cI can\u2019t believe my mother gave birth four times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll women think that,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI know I did. While I was in labor with Maryellen, I told Dan that if this baby wasn\u2019t the son he wanted, he was out of luck because I wasn\u2019t having another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you hold your baby in your arms, nothing else matters. You forget the pain.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps clattered up the stairs. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>It was Maryellen, Grace\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d Grace called out.</p><p>Maryellen hurried into the room, then paused when she saw Mary Jo and smiled tearfully. Her arms were filled with baby clothes.</p><p>A pain overtook Mary Jo. Again it was Mack she looked to, Mack who held her gaze, lending her his strength.</p><p>She was grateful that Grace was at her side, but most of the time it had been Mack who\u2019d guided and encouraged her. He had a way of comforting her that no one else seemed to have, not even Grace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well,\u201d Mack told her. \u201cWe have a shoulder....\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo sobbed quietly. It was almost over. The baby was leaving her body. She could feel it now, feel the child slipping free and then the loud, fierce cry that resounded in the room.</p><p>Her relief was instantaneous.</p><p>She\u2019d done it! Despite everything, she\u2019d done it.</p><p>With her last reserve of strength, Mary Jo rose up on one elbow.</p><p>Mack held the child in his arms and Brandon had a towel ready. Mack turned to her and she saw, to her astonishment, that there were tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have a daughter, Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA daughter,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cA beautiful baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Her own tears came then, streaming from her eyes with an intensity of emotion that surprised her. She hadn\u2019t given much thought to the sex of this child, hadn\u2019t really cared. Her brothers were the ones who\u2019d insisted she\u2019d have a son.</p><p>They\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cA daughter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have a daughter.\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>\u201cThe natives are getting restless,\u201d Jon Bowman reported to Grace when she camed own from the apartment. After watching the birth of Mary Jo\u2019s baby, Grace felt ecstatic. She couldn\u2019t describe all the emotions tumbling through her. Joy. Excitement. Awe. Each one held fast to her heart.</p><p>Katie, April and Tyler raced around the yard, screaming at the top of their lungs, chasing one another, gleeful and happy. Jon went to quiet them, but Grace stopped him.</p><p>\u201cLet them play,\u201d she told her son-in-law. \u201cThey aren\u2019t hurting anything out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly and Lisa are inside making hot cocoa,\u201d Cliff said, joining Grace. \u201cAnd Paul\u2019s looking after Emma.\u201d He slid his arm around her waist. \u201cEverything all right up there?\u201d He nodded toward the barn.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s wonderful. Mary Jo had a baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s marvelous!\u201d Cliff kissed her cheek. \u201cI bet you never guessed you\u2019d be delivering a baby on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>Grace had to agree; it was the last thing she\u2019d expected. She was thankful Mary Jo hadn\u2019t been stuck in some hotel room alone. These might not have been the best of circumstances, but she\u2019d ended up with people who genuinely cared for her and her baby.</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t know Roy and Corrie McAfee\u2019s son well, but Mack had proved himself ten times over. He was a capable, compassionate young man, and he\u2019d been an immeasurable help to Mary Jo. In fact, Grace doubted anyone could have done more.</p><p>After he\u2019d delivered that baby girl, Mack had cradled the infant in his arms and gazed down on her with tears shining in his eyes. An onlooker might have thought he was the child\u2019s father.</p><p>The other EMT actually had to ask him to let go of the baby so he could wash her. After that, Grace had wrapped the crying baby in a swaddling blanket and handed her to Mary Jo.</p><p>The two EMTs were finishing up with Mary Jo and would be transporting her and the baby to the closest birthing center. Maryellen had stayed to discuss breastfeeding and to encourage and, if need be, assist the new mother.</p><p>Grace had felt it was time to check on the rest of her family.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a full and busy night,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cFuller than either of us could\u2019ve imagined,\u201d Grace murmured.</p><p>A car pulled into the yard. \u201cIsn\u2019t that Jack\u2019s?\u201d Cliff asked, squinting into the lights.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014it\u2019s Olivia and Jack.\u201d Grace should\u2019ve known Olivia wouldn\u2019t just go home after Christmas Eve services. She\u2019d briefly told Olivia what was happening before she\u2019d hurried out of the church, fearing she\u2019d caused enough of a distraction as it was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack parked next to Cliff\u2019s vehicle.

But I was there.\u201d</p><p>Being with Mary Jo had brought back so many memories of her own children\u2019s births. Memories that were clear and vivid. The wonder of seeing that beautiful, perfectly formed child. The elation. The feeling of womanly power. She remembered it all.</p><p>\u201cIf not you, then who?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cMack McAfee. The other EMT, Brandon, was there, too, but it was Mack who stayed with Mary Jo, who helped her through the worst of it. By the time I arrived, the baby was ready to be born.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she was happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo had been, but she hadn\u2019t really needed Grace; she and Mack had worked together with a sense of ease and mutual trust.</p><p>Grace almost felt as if she\u2019d intruded on something very private. The communication between Mack and Mary Jo had been\u2014she hesitated to use this word\u2014spiritual. It was focused entirely on the birth, on what each needed to do to get that baby born. Grace felt moved to tears, even now, as she thought about it.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, listen!\u201d Tyler shouted. He pounded on his drum, making an excruciating racket.</p><p>Grace covered her ears. \u201cGently, Tyler, gently.\u201d</p><p>Tyler frowned as he looked up at her. \u201cI was playing my best for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemember the song about the little drummer boy?\u201d Olivia asked him.</p><p>Tyler nodded eagerly. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says in the song that he went pa-rum-pum-pum-pum, right?\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded again.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say he beat the drum like crazy until baby Jesus\u2019s mother put her hands over her ears and asked him to go next door and play.\u201d</p><p>Tyler laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, try it more slowly now,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>Tyler did, tapping on the drum in a soft rhythm that was pleasing to the ear.</p> <p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Grace told her grandson.</p><p>\u201cCan I play for the ox and the lamb?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the song they kept time, remember?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Tyler raced away to show his cousins what he\u2019d learned and to serenade the animals.</p><p>\u201cCome in for a cup of coffee,\u201d Cliff suggested to Olivia and Jack.</p><p>\u201cWe should head home,\u201d Jack said. His arm rested protectively on Olivia\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure everything turned out well,\u201d Olivia explained. \u201cDo you think I could see Mary Jo and the baby for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Grace said with a smile.</p><p>The two women left the men outside to chat while Grace led the way up to the small apartment. Brandon Hutton sat on the top step with his medical equipment, filling out paperwork. He shifted aside and they skirted around him.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo?\u201d Grace asked, standing in the doorway to the bedroom. \u201cWould it be okay if Olivia came in to see the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That would be fine,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>When they walked into the bedroom, they found Mary Jo sitting up, holding her baby in her arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Olivia whispered as she reached the bed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t feel so tiny a little while ago.\u201d Mary Jo looked up with a comical expression. \u201cI felt like I was giving birth to an elephant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it, though,\u201d Olivia said and tenderly ran her finger over the baby\u2019s head. \u201cShe\u2019s just gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve believed how much you can love such a tiny baby.\u201d Mary Jo\u2019s voice was filled with wonder. \u201cI thought my heart would burst with love when Mack put her in my arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name for her?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I had one picked out, but now I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a special baby born on a special night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the same thing,\u201d Mary Jo said, kissing the newborn\u2019s forehead. Her gaze fell lovingly on the child. \u201cWhen I was first pregnant...I was so embarrassed and afraid, I prayed God would just let me die. And now...now I see her as an incredible gift.\u201d</p><p>Grace had felt that way when she discovered she was pregnant with Maryellen all those years ago. It was shortly before her high school graduation; she\u2019d been dating Dan Sherman and their relationship had always been on-again, off-again. She\u2019d dreaded telling him she was pregnant, even more than she\u2019d dreaded telling her parents.</p><p>For weeks she\u2019d kept her secret, embarrassed and ashamed. But like Mary Jo, she\u2019d learned to see the pregnancy as an unexpected gift, and the moment Maryellen was placed in her arms, Grace had experienced an overwhelming surge of love. The birth hadn\u2019t been easy, they never really were, but as soon as she saw her daughter, Grace had recognized that every minute of that pain had been worth the outcome.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything,\u201d Olivia was saying to Mary Jo, \u201cplease don\u2019t hesitate to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That\u2019s so kind.\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned to Mack, who hovered in the background. \u201cAre you taking her to the birthing center in Silverdale?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving in about ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t keep you,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019ll stop by sometime tomorrow afternoon,\u201d she promised Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cOh, please don\u2019t,\u201d Mary Jo said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas\u2014spend that time with your family. I\u2019ll get in touch soon. Anyway, I\u2019ll be with my own family.\u201d She looked up, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo?\u201d Grace asked in alarm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Mack\u2019s voice was equally worried.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cThey never showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The entire matter had slipped Grace\u2019s mind. \u201cMary Jo\u2019s brothers were due here\u2014\u201d she checked her watch \u201c\u2014three hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere could they be?\u201d Mary Jo wailed.</p><p>Grace tried to reassure her. \u201cThey\u2019re probably lost. It\u2019s easy enough with all these back roads. They\u2019ve never been in this area before, have they?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. As soon as they arrive, I\u2019ll tell them what happened and where to find you.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo smiled down at the infant cradled in her arms. \u201cThey\u2019ll hardly believe I had the baby,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut then it\u2019s hard for me to believe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell your parents about the baby yet. Give them a chance to settle back into their routine before you let them know about David and me\u2014and the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say a word until you and I agree the time is right.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded.</p><p>Grace was impressed that Mary Jo wanted to spare Ben and Charlotte the unsavory news of David\u2019s betrayal until they were more prepared to accept it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you now,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cBut like I said, if you need anything, anytime, please call. You\u2019re practically family, you know.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo thanked her softly. \u201cYou all feel like family to me.... Everyone\u2019s been so wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Grace walked down the stairs with Olivia. She was surprised to see Jack and Cliff still outside, huddled with the children.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Cliff up to now?\u201d Grace wondered aloud.</p><p>Jack glanced over then. \u201cYou gotta see this!\u201d he said, waving at Olivia. He sounded like a giddy child.</p><p>As soon as Grace saw the huge carton of fireworks Cliff had dragged out, she groaned. \u201cCliff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was saving them for New Year\u2019s Eve, but I can\u2019t think of a better night for celebrating, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all safe in their stalls. Don\u2019t worry about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Buttercup? She hates that kind of noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s locked in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we, Grandpa, can we?\u201d</p><p>The children were jumping up and down, clapping their hands with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cWhy right now?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Cliff sent her a look of pure innocence. \u201cI was just casting about for a way to keep the grandkids entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d She sighed loudly, holding back a grin.</p><p>\u201cOkay if we stay and watch?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Grace and Olivia exchanged looks. As they\u2019d often had occasion to observe, most men were little boys at heart.</p><p>\u201cIf you must,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>The front door opened and Kelly stepped out with Paul, who still held the baby. Grace\u2019s daughter balanced a large tray filled with mugs and Lisa followed with a tin of Christmas cookies.</p><p>\u201cAnyone for hot chocolate?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a cup,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Grace added.</p><p>Paul glanced over at the kids. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFireworks in a few minutes,\u201d Grace told him.</p><p>\u201cWow! Great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d Olivia whispered under her breath, and then both Olivia and Grace broke into giggles, just like they had when they were schoolgirls.</p><p>19</p><p>\u201cHow did we get so lost\u2014twice?\u201d Linc groaned. The only thing left to do was return to Cedar Cove and start over. That sounded easy enough, except that he no longer knew how to find the town.</p><p>\u201cThat King did us wrong,\u201d Mel muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Linc said sarcastically. He was past frustration, past impatience and past losing his cool. All he wanted was to track down his pregnant sister and bring her home. That shouldn\u2019t be such an impossible task, and yet...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going back to King\u2019s,\u201d Ned said in disgust.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Mel spat. \u201cIf I ever go back to Cedar Cove, which is unlikely.\u201d</p><p>Frankly, Linc was of the same mind, at least as far as King went. The man had blackmailed him into paying for directions and then completely misled him. True, the sandwiches weren\u2019t bad, but he\u2019d overcharged them. The old coot had an evil streak a mile wide. If he thought it was fun to misdirect them, then he had a perverse sense of humor, too. Perverse? Downright twisted!</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a phone that works,\u201d Ned suggested, not for the first time. His brother had harped on that for the last half hour. Their cell phones were useless out here. But it wasn\u2019t as if there was a phone booth sitting on the side of the road just waiting for them to appear.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you find one, Ned, and I\u2019ll be more than happy to pay for the call.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ned didn\u2019t respond, which was definitely for the best.</p><p>\u201cWhat we need is a sign,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Linc bit off a sarcastic comment. They needed a sign, all right, and it had better be one from heaven. He could only imagine what Mary Jo must be thinking. By now his sister probably figured they\u2019d abandoned her, yet nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Ned suddenly cried, pointing into the distance.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d Linc demanded.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Mel said, leaning forward and gazing toward the sky.</p><p>Linc saw a flash of light. He pulled over to the side of the road and climbed out of the truck. He needed to stretch his legs, anyway, and the cold air would revive him. Sure enough, someone was setting off fireworks. The sky burst with a spectacular display of lights.</p><p>\u201cWow, that was a big one,\u201d Mel said, like a kid at a Fourth of July display.</p><p>His brothers didn\u2019t seem to appreciate the gravity of their situation. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s nice, but how\u2019s that going to help us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said I should find a phone,\u201d Ned reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWhoever\u2019s setting off those fireworks must have a phone, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d Linc agreed. He leaped back into the truck, his brothers with him. \u201cGuide me,\u201d he shouted and jerked the transmission into drive.</p><p>\u201cTurn right,\u201d Ned ordered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be driving across someone\u2019s pasture, that\u2019s why.\u201d Obviously Linc was the only one with his eye on the road.</p><p>\u201cThen turn as soon as you reach an intersection,\u201d Mel told him.</p><p>Linc had never liked taking instructions from his younger brothers and he gritted his teeth. As the oldest, he\u2019d always shouldered responsibility for the others. He had no choice now, however\u2014not that things had worked out all that well with him in charge.</p><p>At the first opportunity, Linc made a sharp right-hand turn, going around the corner so fast the truck teetered on two wheels. It came down with a bounce that made all three of them hit their heads on the ceiling. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull over for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Linc eased to a stop by the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Mel had apparently seen another display in the heavens. \u201cThat star!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich way now?\u201d Linc asked with a sigh.</p> <p>\u201cGo straight.\u201d</p><p>Linc shook his head. The road in front of him was anything but straight. It twisted and curved this way and that.</p><p>\u201cLinc,\u201d Mel said, glaring at him. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d He came to a straight patch in the road and floored the accelerator. If anyone had told him he\u2019d be chasing around a series of dark roads, desperately seeking guidance from a fireworks display, he would\u2019ve laughed scornfully. Him, Mr. Great Sense of Direction? Lost? He sighed again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting close,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, stop!\u201d Ned yelled.</p><p>Linc slammed on the brakes. The three of them jerked forward and just as abruptly were hurled back. If not for the seat belts, they would\u2019ve been thrown headfirst into the windshield.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Mel roared.</p><p>\u201cMaybe don\u2019t stop quite so suddenly,\u201d Ned added in a voice that was considerably less hostile.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait.\u201d Mel cocked his head toward the sky. \u201cOkay, continue down this road.\u201d Mercifully it was flat and straight.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Ned said a minute later.</p><p>Once more Linc slammed on the brakes, only this time his brothers were prepared and had braced themselves.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Ned shouted. \u201cThis is it. We\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>Linc didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. \u201cWe\u2019re where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Harding ranch,\u201d Mel answered.</p><p>Then Linc saw. There, painted on the rural route box, was the name Cliff Harding. To his left was a pasture and a large barn.</p><p>\u201cI think I see a camel,\u201d Linc said. He\u2019d heard about people raising llamas before but not camels.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Ned mumbled. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just an ugly horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA camel? No way,\u201d Mel insisted.</p><p>\u201cI say it\u2019s a camel.\u201d Linc wondered if his brother\u2019s argumentative nature had something to do with being a middle child. Ned, as the youngest, was usually the reasonable one, the conciliator. Whereas he\u2014</p><p>\u201cA camel?\u201d Mel repeated in an aggressive tone. \u201cWhat would a camel be doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Ned broke in. \u201cThis is where Mary Jo\u2019s waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Linc turned into the long driveway that led to the house and barn. The fireworks had stopped, but some kind of party seemed to be taking place, because the yard was filled with people. There was a bunch of little kids running around and the atmosphere was festive and excited.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an aid car here.\u201d Ned gestured urgently in its direction.</p><p>\u201cDo you think someone\u2019s hurt?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Linc said slowly, thoughtfully. This was what he\u2019d feared from the first. The minute he\u2019d heard about Mary Jo\u2019s dizzy spell he\u2019d suspected she was about to give birth. \u201cI think Mary Jo might have had her baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she isn\u2019t due for another two weeks,\u201d Mel declared.</p><p>Ned opened the truck door. \u201cInstead of discussing it, let\u2019s go find out.\u201d</p><p>A middle-aged woman approached as Linc got out of the truck. \u201cYou must be Mary Jo\u2019s brothers,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Grace Harding. Merry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>The woman looked friendly, and Linc appreciated the pleasant greeting. \u201cMerry Christmas to you, too. Sorry for the delay....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got lost.\u201d</p><p>How helpful of Mel to point out the obvious.</p><p>\u201cSome guy named King gave us the wrong directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing\u2019s Gas and Grocery?\u201d A man came up to them, extending his hand. \u201cCliff Harding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d Ned answered.</p><p>Cliff pinched his lips together, but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Linc shook hands with Grace\u2019s husband. \u201cLinc Wyse,\u201d he said, introducing himself. \u201cMy brothers, Ned and Mel.\u201d</p><p>Hands were shaken and greetings exchanged all around.</p><p>\u201cWe were wondering if you were ever going to find the place,\u201d Cliff told them.</p><p>\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the fireworks, we probably wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Mel admitted.</p><p>Linc ignored him and glanced at the aid car. \u201cMary Jo?\u201d He couldn\u2019t bring himself to finish the question.</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cShe had the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy,\u201d Mel said confidently. \u201cRight?\u201d His eyes lit up with expectation.</p><p>\u201cA girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl?\u201d Linc was shocked. \u201cMary Jo had a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound disappointed,\u201d Grace said, studying him closely.</p><p>\u201cNot...disappointed. Surprised.\u201d</p><p>Ned felt obliged to explain. \u201cFor some reason, we were all sure she was having a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t. You have a niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a niece,\u201d Linc said to his brothers. Mel gave him a congratulatory slap on the back that nearly sent him reeling. He suddenly realized what this all meant. He was an uncle. He hadn\u2019t thought of himself in those terms until that very moment.</p><p>\u201cThe EMTs are bringing Mary Jo and the baby down now,\u201d Grace was saying.</p><p>\u201cCan we see the baby?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd talk to Mary Jo?\u201d Mel added.</p><p>Grace warmed them with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can.\u201d</p><p>A little boy raced up to her. \u201cGrandma, Grandma, can I play my drum for the baby and Mary Jo?\u201d</p><p>Grace crouched down so she was eye level with her grandson. \u201cOf course, Tyler, but remember you have to play quietly so you won\u2019t disturb the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>Two EMTs rolled Mary Jo toward the aid car on a gurney.</p><p>As soon as she saw her brothers, Mary Jo\u2014holding the sleeping newborn in one arm\u2014stretched out the other. \u201cLinc, Mel, Ned...oh, my goodness, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>They hurried over to her side.</p><p>\u201cYou had a girl,\u201d Mel said, staring down at the bundle in her arms.</p><p>\u201cShe looks just like you,\u201d Ned commented.</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t,\u201d Linc chimed in. \u201cShe looks like the Wyse family\u2014like all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd like herself,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we were so late,\u201d Ned apologized.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we got lost.\u201d</p><p>If Mel announced that to one more person, Linc might be tempted to slug him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they taking you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTo the birthing center in Silverdale,\u201d one of the EMTs answered.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have any trouble finding it,\u201d Cliff assured them. \u201cI\u2019ll draw you a map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Mel shuddered noticeably.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better follow the aid car,\u201d Linc said.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo, we brought you gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ned.\u201d Her face softened as she looked at the three of them. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry about the things we said.\u201d Again this came from Ned, who was more willing to acknowledge he was wrong than either Mel or Linc.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mel agreed.</p><p>Linc muttered something under his breath, hoping it would pass for an apology. He did feel bad about the way everything had gone and the pressure they\u2019d put on Mary Jo. They hadn\u2019t meant to. Their intentions had been the best, although he could see now that they\u2019d gone too far. Still, he wasn\u2019t letting David Rhodes off the hook. The man had responsibilities and Linc was as determined as ever to see that he lived up to them.</p><p>\u201cLinc, Mel, Ned, I want you to meet Mack McAfee,\u201d his sister said, her arm out to the EMT. \u201cOh, I forgot,\u201d she added. \u201cYou guys met earlier.\u201d</p><p>Linc nodded at the other man. So did Mel and Ned.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Mack said. \u201cAnd congratulations on your brand-new niece. Oh, and this is my partner, Brandon Hutton.\u201d</p><p>Once more the brothers nodded.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have managed without them,\u201d Mary Jo said fervently.</p><p>Linc thanked them both. \u201cOur family\u2019s much obliged to you for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust part of the job,\u201d Brandon said.</p><p>\u201cIt was an honor,\u201d Mack told them. \u201cI have to tell you this was the best Christmas Eve of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d Mary Jo said. She looked at Mack, and the two of them seemed to maintain eye contact for an extra-long moment.</p><p>\u201cNow, Grandma?\u201d Tyler stepped up to Grace, a small drum strapped over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNow, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>The youngster set his sticks in motion. Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum, pa-rum-pum-pum-pum.</p><p>Linc glanced over at the barn and saw the ox and the lamb in the paddock. They seemed to be keeping time to the drum, bowing their heads with each slow beat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mary Jo was right. This was the best Christmas Eve of his life. Of all their lives.</p><p>20</p><p>Mary Jo woke to find Mack McAfee standing in the doorway of her private hospital room. \u201cMack,\u201d she whispered. Her heart reacted to the sight of him, pounding extraordinarily hard. She hadn\u2019t been certain she\u2019d ever see him again.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, walking into the room.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Actually, she was sore and tired and eager to get home, to be with her family.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d She sat up in bed and selfconsciously brushed her fingers through her hair.</p><p>Mack produced a bouquet of roses, which he\u2019d been hiding behind his back. \u201cFor you, Mary Jo.\u201d He bowed ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, where\u2019d you get these on Christmas Day?\u201d</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cI have my ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right, I got them in the hospital gift shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of...I saw someone I knew who had a key and she let me in.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo brought the fragrant flowers to her nose and breathed in their fresh scent. The vase was lovely, too. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have, but I\u2019m thrilled you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure your brothers would remember to send flowers.\u201d</p><p>Her brothers. Just thinking about the three of them, all bumbling and excited, made her want to laugh. They\u2019d practically shoved each other out of the way last night, fussing over her and the baby. They\u2019d been full of tales about their misadventures in Cedar Cove and the people they\u2019d met and their near-arrest. Mel had a few comments about a meat loaf sandwich, too\u2014and then they\u2019d all decided they were hungry again. Their gifts of the gold coin, the perfume and the incense were on the bedside table.</p><p>When they\u2019d arrived at the hospital, her brothers wouldn\u2019t let her out of their sight\u2014until the physician came into the room to examine her and then they couldn\u2019t leave fast enough.</p><p>They\u2019d returned for a few minutes an hour later\u2014apparently well-fed\u2014to wish her a final good-night and promise to come back Christmas Day. Then they\u2019d all trouped out again.</p><p>\u201cI stopped at the nursery to see...\u201d Mack paused. \u201cDo you have a name for her yet?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded. \u201cNoelle Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle for the season and Grace after Grace Harding?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo smiled, nodding again.</p> <p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Mack told her. \u201cThe name\u2019s just right. Elegant and appropriate.\u201d</p><p>His approval pleased her. She didn\u2019t want to think too closely about how much his opinion meant to her\u2014or why. She understood that they\u2019d shared something very special, something intimate, while she was in labor. But that didn\u2019t mean the bond they\u2019d experienced would last, no matter how much she wanted it to. She had to accept that Mack had come into her life for a brief period. Soon she\u2019d go back to Seattle with her family, and he\u2019d go on living here, in Cedar Cove. It was unlikely that she\u2019d see him again; there was no real reason to. The thought was a painful one.</p><p>\u201cNoelle Grace was a joy to behold,\u201d Mack said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWas she asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, she was screaming her head off.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo instantly felt guilty. \u201cOh, the staff should\u2019ve woken me. It\u2019s probably her feeding time.\u201d</p><p>Mack pulled up a chair and sat down beside the bed. \u201cNope, she just needed her diaper changed and to be held a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone hold her?\u201d The nursery was crowded with newborns and there were only a couple of nurses on duty.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Mack admitted, somewhat embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t! I\u2014I\u2019m just surprised they\u2019d let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d Mack looked away and cleared his throat. \u201cI might\u2019ve led the nurse to believe that Noelle and I are...related.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo burst out laughing. \u201cMack, you didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And I have to say that as soon as I settled her in my arms, Noelle calmed down, stopped crying and looked straight up at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought her into the world, after all.\u201d She probably didn\u2019t need to remind Mack of that; nevertheless, she wanted him to know she hadn\u2019t forgotten what he\u2019d done for her.</p><p>The night before, she\u2019d told her brothers that she would never have managed if not for Mack, and that was true. He\u2019d been her salvation. She wanted to tell him all this, but the right words escaped her. Besides, she wasn\u2019t sure she could say what was in her heart without getting teary-eyed and emotional.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you stopped by...I was going to write you and Brandon and thank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our job.\u201d Those had been Brandon\u2019s words, too, and in his case, she assumed they were true. But Mack...Dismissing her appreciation like that\u2014it hurt. Not wanting him to see how his offhand comment had upset her, she stared down at the sheet, twisting it nervously.</p><p>Mack stood and reached for her hand, entwining their fingers.</p><p>\u201cLet me explain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is part of what we agreed to do when we accepted the job with the fire department.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cBut the call from you wasn\u2019t an ordinary one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d she asked and looked up, meeting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never delivered a baby before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Me, neither,\u201d she said and they smiled at each other.</p><p>\u201cIt was one of the highlights of my life, being there with you and Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too\u2014I mean, you being there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His words were low and filled with intent. He leaned forward and braced his forehead against hers. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Noelle sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us,\u201d she repeated, afraid she was beginning to sound like an echo.</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s okay with you,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She nodded, trying not to act too excited. \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in Seattle,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind the drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could take the ferry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mack seemed just as eager to visit as she was to have him come by. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She wanted him there as soon as possible. \u201cThe doctor said he\u2019d release Noelle and me this afternoon. My brothers are picking us up at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs tomorrow too soon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mary Jo was convinced the happiness that flowed through her must have shone from her eyes. She didn\u2019t think she could hide it if she tried. \u201cThat would be good,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Mack.\u201d</p><p>Just then the nurse showed up carrying Noelle. \u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>Mary Jo held out her arms for her baby, born on Christmas Eve in Cedar Cove, the town that had taken her in. A town whose people had sheltered her and accepted her. The town that, one day, she\u2019d love to call home.</p><p>Home for her and Noelle. </p> </body></html>"]
