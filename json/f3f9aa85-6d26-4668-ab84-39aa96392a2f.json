I blinked at the dry, rough desert of Arizona as it flew past my window, trying to remember what was happening. This wasn\u2019t a dream, this wasn\u2019t a scenario; this was real. I was in the back of an SUV driven by a thuggish man and the ex-boyfriend of my nightmares was right beside me. I had given Camden a second chance at life, at love, at everything by taking a step backward with mine. I was Javier\u2019s prisoner now, his six years of chasing after me having finally come to a close.</p><p>I was trapped with a man who would either love me or kill me. There was no middle ground with Javier Bernal.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d he repeated. I caught him wave his hand dismissively out of the corner of my eye, his watch catching the sun that streamed in through the tinted windows. \u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t matter. I know.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to take the bait. I wanted to keep looking out the window, pretending this didn\u2019t exist. I wanted to ignore the anger that started to prick at my toes, rising up my limbs, and the disgust and defeat that was about to sink in my chest.</p><p>He had found me.</p><p>\u201cYou tracked my cell phone,\u201d I said, my tongue sticking to the roof of my dry mouth.</p><p>He chuckled. The hair on my arms stood up.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously? Your cell phone. Angel, you aren\u2019t Jason Bourne.\u201d</p><p>I both wanted to laugh derisively at the way he pronounced Jason and sneer at the use of my old pet name, Angel. I was Angel six years ago. That angel had died on broken wings and with a broken heart.</p><p>He continued, \u201cI can\u2019t track your phone unless I have physical access to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were tracking the car,\u201d I said, still to the window.</p><p>Another chilling laugh. \u201cTracking that car all this time? I had people looking out for it \u2013 you took quite a big chance driving around in a flashing \u2018find me\u2019 sign. But no, there was no tracking device in the car. Why would I plant one in my own car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone might steal it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>His voice lowered over that last phrase, twisting in a curiously compassionate way. I brought my eyes over to look at him and immediately regretted it. I realized that up until that moment, I\u2019d been trying to see through him like he was a hologram.</p><p>Javier\u2019s hair was longer now, but just as thick and dark. His face had thinned out a bit over the years and his build was somehow wider, stronger. He looked like a citron-eyed lion in a white linen suit, a creature that felt larger than the sum of his parts. The more I stared at him, the more the space around me became smaller.</p><p>He smiled at me, his eyes glinting. It wasn\u2019t a kind smile and I quickly cast my eyes downward, feeling that the less eye contact we made, the better it was for me. I caught a glimpse of his Wish tattoo on his wrist, partially covered up by his watch.</p><p>\u201cEllie Watt,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to figure out your real name. In fact, it was almost like your name came floating in my window one day. So, you must realize that when you\u2019re on the run and using your real name, well, any fucking idiot can track you down.\u201d</p><p>I blinked hard and ripped my head to the window again. I\u2019d been so careful with Camden\u2019s name, going through all the steps to make sure he could never be found as Connor Malloy. I barely did the same for myself. The minute we knew that Javier and his men were after me in Palm Valley, the minute we headed for Nevada, I should have been more careful, more cautious. I should have concentrated more on myself than on Camden. Javier had tracked me to the resort in Laughlin and after that I thought I was playing it smart by taking on an old persona.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t smart enough.</p><p>\u201cI had people waiting in Las Vegas, you know,\u201d he said and I could sense him examining his fingernails. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that\u2019s where you\u2019d be going next, that you needed to keep laundering your money. You were cocky enough to stay on the Strip. One of my men saw your car \u2013 my car \u2013 driving through. Followed you to your hotel, where you went through a half-hearted attempt to hide it.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed hard. Disgust was beating out defeat at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI realize now, Angel, that I didn\u2019t know you very well at all. I don\u2019t know who I knew. But I do know you\u2019re not an idiot. You wanted me to find you. Perhaps you\u2019ve been asking for it since you ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I said, trying to keep my breath from shaking.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI told you. To the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have many pasts. Pick one.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his seat, his legs splayed open, the tip of his knee touching my leg for a brief second. Just a tap. His way of reminding me where I was. I eyed the rocky landscape flying past and wondered when it became too reckless to jump out of a moving vehicle.</p><p>\u201cChild safety locks,\u201d he whispered and I wished he\u2019d get the fuck out of my head. \u201cAnd our past. Do you remember it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Although it wasn\u2019t that much of a lie. I\u2019d had so many pasts, that it was easy to bury them all with each other. When I left Javier all those years ago, I only remembered the pain he brought me, the humiliation and deceit for as long as I needed to. For as long as I needed to become someone else, to never make the same mistakes again. Then I let it go.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just trying to hurt me.\u201d His couldn\u2019t have sounded less sincere.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty. Do you have any water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. First we have something to discuss.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head and shot him a deadly look. \u201cWe have nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his wide mouth twitched up into a smile. I wondered how I ever found this man charming. I must have been out of my mind.</p><p>My phone rang, jarring me. I reached for my jean pocket but Javier was quicker. His fingers wrapped around my wrist twisting it painfully away from me while he deftly got the phone out with his other hand. He held my arms down, pinning me against my door, and checked the screen. His eyes blazed for an instant before he punched the button for the window to go down and then chucked my cell out of it.</p><p>In a second, the window was back up and he was sitting in his seat like he never moved and my wrists were left aching in my lap. He smoothed his hair back behind his ears and grinned to himself. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get you a new phone.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my wrist, the red marks from his fingers quickly fading. He\u2019d never used force on me before, at least not in a non-sexual way, and to tell you the truth, it was sobering. For the first time since I\u2019d gotten in the car, I was actually afraid.</p><p>What had I gotten myself into?</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about this Camden McQueen.\u201d</p><p>My heart rattled in my chest. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know more about him than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out a lot, yes. But you ... you seemed to be intimate.\u201d</p><p>Acid burned along his words, seeping through his smooth fa\u00e7ade. I really didn\u2019t want to discuss my relationship with Camden though I felt like doing so out of spite. It bothered him, somehow, after all this time, that I had been with another man. And I guess somewhere, somehow, I still held a grudge.</p><p>\u201cI fucked him, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d I said bluntly. I told Camden I loved him too, I thought to myself, playing with the sentence like a hand grenade but deciding it was safer keeping it inside.</p><p>Javier stiffened beside me for an instant. \u201cSo crude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him against my better judgement. \u201cWhat is it that you want, Javier? I\u2019m sure it can\u2019t be whether I got nailed by Camden or not, because you have your answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want,\u201d he said slowly, drawing it out. He licked his lips. \u201cI want you and I to work together.\u201d</p><p>I nearly laughed. In fact a small snort escaped from my lips.</p><p>He raised one perfect brow and tilted his head toward me. \u201cYou find this funny?\u201d</p><p>My fingers were splayed against my collarbone. \u201cI find this horrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEden,\u201d he said, then squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head. \u201cEllie. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re here just for the sake of being here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. You fucking kidnapped a mother and child in order to get me. You paid I don\u2019t know how much money. You have me now. For whatever you want. And you\u2019re telling me, after all these years, you found me because you want us to work together?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were on me, growing more golden in the light. Steady. Not blinking. Unnerving if I wasn\u2019t so sure this was a test. He who looks away first, loses. I wasn\u2019t losing yet, not when I was unaware of the prize.</p><p>I stared right back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said after a few beats. He licked his lips again and it made me realize how thirsty I was. \u201cI could have found you long ago, if I really wanted to. I would have let you go. The car, the money, the lack of answers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lack of answers?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou just left. No note, no phone call. No answers.\u201d He slowly broke into a grin and then turned his attention to the window where a truck was thundering down the highway, dirty exhaust in its wake. \u201cYou know I love my answers, angel. You left me as high and dry as my mother\u2019s bed sheets.\u201d</p><p>My mouth gaped, tongue fumbling for something concrete. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? I left you high and dry ...\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNo matter, it\u2019s the past.\u201d</p><p>It was the past. The past he was totally wrong about.</p><p>\u201cYou cheated on me!\u201d I spat out, instantly ashamed at how much passion there was in my voice.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. He raised his hand in the air as if to shut me up. \u201cI did. I forget that sometimes, that what I did was wrong on some accounts. But that\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nothing. What he did, me finding him in bed with some ginger-haired bitch, it shaped who I was. It ruined my heart, my ability to love, to trust, to ... live. He scarred me just as much as Travis did. It wasn\u2019t nothing. Maybe, maybe it should have been.</p><p>I took in a deep breath, knowing he probably loved the fact that I was getting so riled up. \u201cOkay, so it was nothing. You could have found me years ago, so you say. Why now? You\u2019re lonely, is that it? Having a lot of money not getting your dick up enough?\u201d</p><p>His eyes fastened into slits. \u201cI\u2019m not the person I was six years ago, my dear. And, I can see, neither are you.\u201d</p><p>He was right about that. Javier had obviously changed for the worst. Had I?</p><p>Stupid question.</p><p>\u201cI can understand why you think I\u2019d pursue you for, uh, delicate reasons,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case. We both want the same thing. And for once, I think you have the upper hand in getting it.\u201d</p><p>My forehead scrunched. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you need lessons in being a con artist.\u201d</p><p>I saw the first genuine smile yet stretched briefly across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot better at other things, Ellie. You have something that I don\u2019t. You have access, contacts, and in some cases ... womanly charms. Jesus knows how I fell for them once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes glide up my body from my jean-clad legs to my bare arms. To where the tattoo, his tattoo, wrapped around my bicep like an anaconda, squeezing the life out of me.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I won\u2019t help you?\u201d I said, rubbing at my parched throat. I was thirsty and the more I thought about what Javier might do if I ever refused him dried me out even more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll refuse,\u201d he said with total confidence. He leaned forward and tapped on the tinted glass that separated the driver from us. \u201cAgua, dos,\u201d he said and the bald-headed driver leaned down and brought out two water bottles. Javier handed one to me and the window went back up.</p><p>I quickly unscrewed the cap and took a large swig. It was cool and strangely sweet and took a lot to quench my thirst.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d I repeated, wiping my mouth.</p><p>He slowly sipped his water, his eyes on me, far too intimate, far too observant. \u201cI have ways of making you see the bigger picture. Now, drink up.\u201d</p><p>At that, I immediately brought the bottle away from my lips.</p><p>\u201cSo suspicious, Ellie,\u201d he crooned. I felt the bottle slipping out of my hands as I tried to grasp it. He plucked it from me and pressed down on my shoulder so I was back against the seat. His fingers were rougher than I remembered but hot, like they were fueled by a radiator. Everything was starting to go loose and numb. The interior of the car swirled.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d he went on, leaning forward and peering into my eyes. \u201cYou have a right to be so. Eden White was far too trusting.\u201d</p> <p>My head had lolled back onto the seat. I could see the lightning jags of gold and green meeting his pupils, the tiny lines that formed at the corner of his eyes, the one strand of salt-colored hair that dared to show its face at his widow\u2019s peak. Javier had aged. There was nothing scarier.</p><p>\u201cSleep well, my angel.\u201d His voice came to me on a wave of vibration. There were swirls of light and then everything went black.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>She\u2019d lied. She fucking lied.</p><p>I should have seen it coming, should have known this wasn\u2019t going to end easily. I should have known it the minute Javier called that there was no way he\u2019d let her go once he had her. He wasn\u2019t weak like me, I\u2019ll give him that. He wasn\u2019t the one left in the rock garden, two assfuck thugs\u2019 meaty hands wrapped around him, holding him in place as he watched her leave. No, that was me. Camden McQueen.</p> <p>I had to watch her leave again, but this wasn\u2019t high school and this wasn\u2019t a hallway.</p><p>She left me in a cloud of dust, a swirl of crushed cherry blossoms that choked my heart.</p><p>I must have been screaming in the aftermath, outside of my body with my old friend rage. I hated this part of being me \u2013 when I lost it, lost myself \u2013 the blackness that settled into my bones, that took over and booted my brain out of my skin. I was seeing everything from another angle and it looked just as fucked from up here.</p><p>And there was crying. My beautiful son, Ben, just three years old, was crying in his mother\u2019s arms and I knew I needed to get control back. Screaming, fighting, it wasn\u2019t going to solve anything. I had to think about him, and my ex-wife Sophia. I had to think about getting us out of there or getting Javier\u2019s men out of my tattoo parlor, Sins &amp; Needles. I needed control.</p><p>I shut my mouth, nearly clamping down on my tongue, as my heart ached and crumbled and slowed in my throat. The tunnel vision ended and suddenly the desert sky was as bright as it had ever been.</p><p>The SUV \u2013 Ellie \u2013 was now long gone.</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hands off me,\u201d I snarled, jerking out of their grasp. Their stupid, thick fingers finally let go. I turned around and finally got a good look at them. They were both built like linebackers, large heads with nothing inside, programmed to do Javier\u2019s bidding. Pussies to the core.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to leave or do you want me to call the cops on you?\u201d I asked, knowing I wasn\u2019t about to get my father involved, the sheriff of Palm Valley and someone who could easily out-asshole them while grinding me down in the process.</p> <p>The men exchanged a look but were silent.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Raul said from behind me, the stairs creaking as he came down. I\u2019d forgotten he had been there, hovering behind Sophia and Ben during the whole transaction like a yellow jacket in a fancy suit. \u201cThat is, unless they\u2019re already on their way because of the scene you just caused.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed down the volcano in my chest and exhaled sharply through my nose as his skinny, catcher\u2019s mitt face came closer. \u201cIf you think that was me making a scene, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d</p><p>His smile was wry, it belonged to a prick with empty power. If I wasn\u2019t certain that the thugs were carrying guns, I would have kicked his teeth in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d he said, folding his arms across his chest. My eyes focused on the scar at his jaw and for a painful second I saw the ones on Ellie\u2019s leg, felt them under my tattoo gun, under my hands, under my tongue.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d he continued, snapping me out of it before I could further drown.</p><p>I glared. \u201cNone of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged like Javier Jr. \u201cIf you were a smart man, you\u2019d leave this place. Take your wife and your kid and your dirty money and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Ex-wife, I wanted to say but the dirty money comment stung even more.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d I challenged stupidly. I should have shut my mouth again, just kept it all in and go but I felt like being an annoyance, if anything.</p><p>He raised his brow. \u201cOr nothing. We,\u201d he nodded at the thugs and their blank, bloated faces, \u201care done with you.\u201d He jerked his head to the street, where people were driving past like lives weren\u2019t being threatened and ruined and changed before their eyes. The men nodded and the three of them walked past me, out of my trampled rock garden where plants would still continue to thrive even when I left the shop to cobwebs and dust. Because I had to leave, though on no account of Raul. I had to leave because I\u2019d made my decision weeks ago.</p><p>Raul stopped on the sidewalk, the heat rising off of it. He took a pair of shades out of his jacket pocket and handled them for a moment, his eyes two dark dots in the harsh sun.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said louder, voice thick, \u201cjust because we are done with you, doesn\u2019t mean Javier is. Don\u2019t go looking for her, whatever you do. Or it\u2019s your funeral. And hers.\u201d</p><p>He slipped the sunglasses on his face and he and the thugs disappeared down the street toward whatever getaway they had planned.</p><p>Although I believed him when he said he was done with us, it didn\u2019t make me feel any safer. I slowly turned around and looked at Sophia and Ben. She was holding onto his hand, my boy leaning up against her leg. In her other hand was the briefcase full of money. She held onto that just as tightly.</p><p>Our eyes met, perhaps really, truly, for the first time today. Man, even with her in the shade of the porch, I could see her eyes blazing, full of fire, and not the type I wanted to go up in. Fuck it, there was no avoiding it. I\u2019d avoided this for way too long.</p><p>After everything \u2013 everything \u2013 I\u2019d gone through, it was ridiculous that I\u2019d feel the slightest bit scared of my ex-wife. But I was. I could admit it. I\u2019d admit to anything at this point. I was afraid of what she was going to make me feel, of what she couldn\u2019t wait to make me feel.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ellie was in a car with Javier. Was she afraid too? Was she afraid of what Javier could possibly make her feel? Or, was that fear exclusively mine?</p><p>I brushed it out of my thoughts like a loose strand of hair and walked up the stairs to them, my fingers flicking past one another, trying to disperse the nervous energy that was building up.</p><p>I stopped in front of Sophia, on the last step so I was at her level. She was petite, not so much in shape, only height. She was always a foot smaller than me though her hips and thighs had weight to them, something that lured me in all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said thickly, my eyes on hers, and meaning it.</p><p>I never thought she\u2019d let go of the briefcase. And when she did, it landed on the porch with a bang that echoed in the overhang and the next thing that happened was her open palm meeting my face. She hit me fast, a quick draw, one side of my cheekbone, then the other with the back of her hand, catching the corner of my lip. It stung like hell and I sucked in my breath. Because getting angry would do me no good \u2013 getting angry was the reason she was my ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that,\u201d I said quietly, avoiding her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u2019 she cried out, spittle falling out of her mouth. Ben, bless his innocent heart, whimpered and hugged his mother tighter, refusing to cry. \u201cYou shut up. You asshole! You ...\u201d</p><p>She trailed off and just when I thought all of this was too much for her, she hit me again. Then she burst into tears, her head hung down, briefcase at her feet. I couldn\u2019t help but look at Ben, my son, who was looking up at me like I was not only a bad man, the bad man that made his mother cry, but a total stranger. I was a stranger to both of them and it didn\u2019t matter how many letters I wrote. We were all lost to each other.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said softly and wrapped my arms around her. She stiffened but let me hold her. I stretched one hand down and placed it on Ben\u2019s head and we stood there for a good few minutes, a family by blood not heart, while she continued to cry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin,\u201d she said, her voice muffled into my tear-soaked chest.</p><p>\u201cI did a stupid thing,\u201d I told her, figuring it was better to attempt it or not.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, the edge returning to her voice. She raised her head, her face inches from mine. I remembered how hard it used to be for me to not kiss her and how easy it was now. The bruises around her eye and cheek where someone \u2013 Javier? \u2013 had hit her were blooming. It made me feel sick all over again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered and she pulled out of my grasp. \u201cI had the best intentions for Ben in mind throughout all of it. I wanted to escape this life, the life your ... brothers ... put me in.\u201d</p><p>She wiped hard at her tears like they burned. \u201cYou put yourself in that life. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit you,\u201d I said and even she looked a bit shocked at the way I admitted it after all this time. I placed my hands on her shoulders and held her firmly, lowering my head, eyeing her closely. \u201cI hit you. There\u2019s no excuse. I\u2019m done excusing myself. I hit you and I hate myself for it and I hate that it ruined what we had. A family. I can never take it back and I have to live with it. I\u2019m sorry, Sophia. Really, truly for what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, seeming to take it in. I didn\u2019t expect her to forgive me and I didn\u2019t even care if she did. As I said to Ellie once, I didn\u2019t regret the consequences of my actions but I did regret the action. And I had been making excuses for it all this time, blaming Sophia for something that was entirely my fault. My temper, my anger, my old friend rage \u2013 I wanted to finally kick it to the curb. I wanted to own it, destroy it. Wasn\u2019t that what second chances were about? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I crouched down and pulled up the briefcase. I put it in her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t earn this money. I didn\u2019t ask for it. I hate what it stands for. If it can give us a second chance, then maybe it\u2019s not all for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I wanted a second chance with you?\u201d she said. She was right. I never assumed she would.</p><p>\u201cBecause it feels like the right thing to do, to try. Listen, Sophia. I can\u2019t let you go back to the way things were. Your brothers ... they turned you over to a fucking madman. That life, that wasn\u2019t a life, that\u2019s not a family. I can be your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you\u2019re in love with another woman,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWho was she? Who was this woman who was worth all of this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn old friend,\u201d I said simply, ignoring the nails in my heart. I didn\u2019t even want to say her name, not now while we stood there in Palm Valley, where I could almost feel her getting farther and farther away. I had to focus on what I had right in front of me: Ben and Sophia. Money for a new life. I had to make sure they were safe first before I could even indulge in thoughts about Ellie.</p><p>I hated that I had to choose.</p><p>\u201cPlease, let\u2019s just get out of here. Somewhere safe. We can lay it all out, discuss our next move.\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked behind her at the shop, my beautiful shop, built on lies and ink. \u201cThis isn\u2019t safe? It\u2019s your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will never be safe. And it\u2019s done being my home.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, seeming to understand. \u201cSo what, you\u2019re going to leave right now, like this? Your father ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already left, Sophia. I shouldn\u2019t even be here.\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have been so careless to think a man like Javier wouldn\u2019t go after me and take the things I loved. He gave some of them back to me and I had to make it work.</p><p>I looked at the GTO, the car that Ellie named J\u00f3se, sitting in the driveway. It had seen so much already. It was time for it to see more.</p><p>I grabbed Sophia\u2019s hand and tried to grab Ben\u2019s but he pulled away from me. Would he recognize himself inked on the back of my leg? Would he one day realize how much he meant to me? I wanted to feel like a father again. I wanted him to feel like he had a dad.</p><p>We had just reached the car when I heard someone call out from the street.</p><p>\u201cCamden!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d I swore under my breath and turned to look. It was Audrey Price, one of my clients. Her pale skin glowed under the hot sun like skin cancer waiting to happen. On her arm was the sleeve of cherry blossoms I had partly filled in a few weeks back. The day I met Ellie. The same cherry blossoms I would later add to Ellie\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d I heard Sophia whisper.</p><p>\u201cA client,\u201d I said and put on my most charming smile as Audrey approached us. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Audrey? How\u2019s the tat?\u201d</p><p>She stopped in front of us and quickly glanced at Sophia over her retro shades. She took her in first, then Ben, who was still as quiet as a mouse. Finally she looked to me.</p><p>\u201cI came to see you the other day. You were closed,\u201d she said uneasily, and slid her shades back on.</p><p>I shrugged as casually as I could muster. \u201cGoing on a vacation with my family.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, then her head swung to Sophia and Ben again for a better look. Her mouth dropped open. In the stark light, it wasn\u2019t obvious off the bat that Sophia had been knocked around. \u201cFamily? I ... I had no idea you were ... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I told her, knowing that Audrey was running over a few scenarios in her head. She\u2019d always had a female hard on for me, that much was obvious. It didn\u2019t help that I tattooed her ass late one night and in turn she sucked my dick. Now, all of that, combined with what seemed like a hidden wife and child and obvious case of spousal abuse, probably made things seem that much more wrong.</p> <p>She never really knew Camden McQueen, did she?</p><p>She smiled tightly at me and I went on, trying to put her at ease. \u201cI\u2019m just going off for a bit, need some quality time, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll re-open when I return. Did you want another session? Let me take a look.\u201d</p><p>I reached for her arm as I would normally do, to inspect my work, just to see how it was holding up and if it had somehow gotten more beautiful as it melded with the skin, something I\u2019d notice time and time again. They say tattoos are permanent, but in my eyes they adapt, ever changing.</p><p>She jerked her arm away as if my fingers were needles themselves and shot me another one of those awkward smiles. \u201cI should be going.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my fear, the kind that would paralyze me and keep me here to make sure I wasn\u2019t given a bad name, so no one would think ill of me. \u201cAlright, well drop by in a week or so.\u201d I could see now I was no longer the hot tattoo artist but something more sinister. In a week, she wouldn\u2019t return. And I wouldn\u2019t be here anyway.</p><p>Audrey gave me a vague nod, turned and quickly walked away, her sex heels echoing on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cAre all your clients that awkward?\u201d Sophia asked as she moved over to the passenger side door of the car.</p><p>\u201cI guess none of this looks very good,\u201d I said with a forced shrug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beyond looking good,\u201d she said, throwing the briefcase inside and squinting at me gravely. \u201cBecause this is all very, very bad, Camden. I don\u2019t think you realize how bad this all is.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the thing was, I did.</p><p>I took one last look at Sins &amp; Needles and got in the car, not even feeling the heat that only an old car can hold.</p><p>I\u2019d only been driving for twenty minutes before the depraved finality of everything settled in. Beneath my hands was the wheel of a car that wasn\u2019t mine and wasn\u2019t his and wasn\u2019t hers but it was all I had left. I had lived too fast and too hard and now I was just supposed to accept it, accept that it was a parting gift, like the briefcase in Sophia\u2019s hands, my reward for giving up my love.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t giving up, was I? Every bone in my body ached to turn the GTO around, to go back for Ellie, to take her from something she didn\u2019t need to do, from a life she didn\u2019t need to return to. From a love that never was, that could never be what she needed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to run out of gas,\u201d Sophia spoke up, her voice hoarse and emotionless. My eyes drifted sideways to Ben sleeping on her lap and my lungs burned like I\u2019d swallowed a pint of sand. I couldn\u2019t give up on Ellie. But I couldn\u2019t give up on Ben either. My choice had been made when I drove away from Palm Valley, I just didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d get my second chance one more time.</p><p>I pulled the car over to the next gas station and filled up as quickly as possible. I needed to keep it together, I needed to keep control. I needed, needed, needed.</p><p>The passenger door opened and Sophia got out, Ben still in her arms, still asleep. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some food,\u201d she said, nodding at the convenience mart with the garish lights that wouldn\u2019t hide a thing.</p><p>I put the pump back in the receiver. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave Ben with me? You don\u2019t need to take him with you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wake him. He\u2019ll sleep as long as I\u2019m holding him.\u201d</p><p>Things I should know about my own kid. Things that I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me with him?\u201d I asked coming around the car.</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cNo, Camden. I don\u2019t. You might be his father by birth but that\u2019s the only father you\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote letters ...\u201d I trailed off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>It fucking figured. My heart began to pump loudly in my ears, my fingers twitched. \u201cI did, Sophia. I wrote him. I sent you money too, but I\u2019m guessing you never saw any of that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted to the store and back. She licked her lips and looked back at me. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t gotten a dime from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I muttered, trying hard to keep myself from pounding my fist on the back of the car.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel better, I believe you.\u201d</p><p>I raised a brow and unclenched my fist. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that.\u201d Still, she walked off toward the store, Ben\u2019s head on her shoulder.</p><p>I sat back in the car and rested my head on the steering wheel. I needed to think and think fast.</p><p>I had two problems. Sophia and Ellie. Both seemed impossible to fix, to make right, but it didn\u2019t matter. I had Sophia in my hands and that was the one I\u2019d have to fix first.</p><p>Sophia was turned over to Javier by her brothers in exchange for the money I stole from them. It didn\u2019t really surprise me, not really. They\u2019d always been the types to throw each other under a bus if it meant coming out on top. Her whole family was fucked up that way, rotten to the core. Ellie had theories that they were tied to the Mafia but they weren\u2019t Sicilian, just Italian. They were tied to something big and bad, that\u2019s all I knew.</p><p>Now, obviously Sophia couldn\u2019t go back to them. She wasn\u2019t living with her brothers. Last I knew they were at least in LA, near her in Silverlake. They were too close for comfort and I was pretty sure if they ever saw my head popping up in their neighborhood, they\u2019d shoot it clean off. I had to convince Sophia to leave LA with Ben. I had to get them somewhere far away and safe. At the depth of mud I was sunk in, I couldn\u2019t take things to the police, not without going to jail myself. Fuck, if I really thought about it, there was a grocery list of felonies I\u2019d committed in the last week alone.</p><p>Once I got Sophia away, maybe even in another state, Oregon, who knows where, I\u2019d contact Gus, the guy Ellie vouched for. We could get Sophia a new name. We had money. We could start again.</p><p>It sounded all too familiar.</p><p>What about Ellie?</p><p>What about Ellie?</p><p>What about Ellie?</p><p>What happened to her? Every day I was apart from her was a day she was farther and farther away. Three lives were at stake here and I couldn\u2019t save all of them at the same time.</p><p>I exhaled loudly feeling nothing but hopeless and my eyes fell to the passenger side. The briefcase was gone. I sat up and craned my neck to look at the store. I couldn\u2019t see Sophia inside. No ...</p><p>Panic rose inside me. She wouldn\u2019t take the money and leave me here? She didn\u2019t hate me that much. She couldn\u2019t ...</p><p>I didn\u2019t know her at all, did I?</p><p>I quickly got out of the car, my footsteps sounding hard on the asphalt in a rare moment of quiet from the highway. The store looked empty for all I could see and we were the only car on the lot.</p><p>I opened the door, the bell jangling too loud for my liking. A double-chinned man with fuzzy grey hair was looking at a crossword puzzle. The store was empty.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said trying to hide the anxiety in my voice. The clerk didn\u2019t even look up. I walked over and leaned over the counter, getting between him and the puzzle. Finally his tired, red eyes met mine. I knew those eyes, they were desert eyes, dried out from too much sun and too little joy.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the man asked. I could sense he was about to reach under the counter for the alarm so I backed off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you see a woman and a young boy come in here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He frowned then relaxed a bit. \u201cI saw a woman. Can\u2019t say I saw a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she petite, you know, short, dark hair, Italian looking?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his lips together in thought. I didn\u2019t have time for him to ponder this shit. I needed to find out if Sophia left me and fast.</p> <p>\u201cThink!\u201d I barked, losing control for a moment. \u201cWas she here?\u201d</p><p>The man froze, taken aback. At the same time, I heard a door slam behind me. I turned to see Sophia coming out of the restroom with Ben at her side. Her eyes were drawn thin, eyeing me suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d I said, turning and giving Ben the most genuine smile I could muster. Relief never felt as soothing as it did just then.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you think I went?\u201d she asked. I nodded at the briefcase. She shook her head and quickly pushed the door open. \u201cCome on, sweetie,\u201d she crooned to Ben.</p><p>I followed her out to the car, trying to burn away the guilty feeling. My first thought was that Sophia had taken the money and run. I wondered when I\u2019d ever trust anyone again.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumbled to her after I got in the car and pulled it back on the highway. The sun was sliding low in the sky, casting a warm golden light that made you feel warm and safe, like your mind was flipping through photographs of summers long ago. It was nostalgic and good and terribly misleading. I hated this time of day.</p><p>She was silent, mulling over my distrust.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said again, passing the road-side dinosaurs of Cabazon. \u201cI thought you\u2019d left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would think that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m tired,\u201d Ben finally spoke, tugging on her sleeve as she held him. His voice brought tears to my eyes. I\u2019d never heard him speak before. My mouth was torn between a gap and a smile. In another life, this would have been ordinary and I would have brought the car around and shown Ben the dinosaurs. In another life, he would see me as his father. In another life I wouldn\u2019t be trying to find a new one for us all.</p><p>\u201cWatch the road,\u201d Sophia said, tapping her hand on the dashboard and I looked up in time to see I was crossing over the dividing line. I corrected myself, my heart racing loud, and rubbed my forehead until I could feel. I needed to hold it all together, if only for a little while longer.</p> <p>I swallowed hard and let out a long, calm breath. \u201cSophia, we need to think about the next steps. You can\u2019t go home again.\u201d As eloquently and non-invasive as I could, I explained what we needed to do. To my amazement, she didn\u2019t put up a fight, even when I said she\u2019d have to change her name and cut off all contact with her old life. Perhaps she knew that Ben\u2019s well-being was worth every sacrifice.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said as she smoothed back Ben\u2019s thick, beautiful hair. My god, he was going to be a lady-killer one day. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just up and leave like that.\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cWe have to go back to the apartment so I can get my stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t even in town anymore. They\u2019re in Fresno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>She shot me a dirty look. \u201cThey might have sold me out, but I\u2019m their sister. I knew their plans for the week before any of this happened.\u201d</p><p>I flipped down the visor, squinting at the sun which was spearing the I-10 with golden flames. \u201cSophia ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cAren\u2019t you ... surprised? Upset? You are their sister and they sold you out.\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her seat, silence blanketing us. \u201cYes. I am surprised and I am upset. I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Camden. One minute I was at home feeding Ben, the next ...\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and her whole body started shaking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I soothed her. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it. We\u2019ll get you home tonight but in the morning, we\u2019re gone. For good. You understand what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>Sophia nodded. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t see LA again.\u201d</p><p>I hoped, for all our sakes, that she was right.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>I woke up in hell.</p><p>At first, I couldn\u2019t see anything but flashing lights and moving shapes. That alone did not make it hell. Neither did the increasing urge to vomit and the pounding blood in my head that made me wince painfully with each breath.</p><p>What made it hell was when my eyes opened enough to focus on the flashing lights. It was the soft, baby-new glow of morning being scattered by an azure blue curtain that waved back and forth by an open window. Despite the bars that created zebra shadows on the carpeted floor, the window was familiar.</p><p>The curtain was too. I\u2019d picked out that curtain from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, thinking the blue matched the surf outside. I\u2019d hung that curtain myself.</p><p>Six years ago.</p><p>I sat up, limbs and head heavy with a tincture of chemicals, panic and total disgust. I was back in our old bedroom, the one I used to share with Javier. I was back.</p><p>And the slippery son of a bitch had drugged me.</p><p>I got out of bed and nearly fell flat on my face, my legs tangled in the sheets. The room had stayed the same. Save for the security bars on the window, everything looked exactly as it had before. For six years, it had stayed the same while the man who slept there grew something terrible in his heart. I could see it in his eyes, the coldness, the games. Or maybe I could see now what I couldn\u2019t see then.</p><p>There was no use dwelling on it. He wanted me to swim in this past, that\u2019s why I was here. He wanted the past to drown me. I wouldn\u2019t let it. I wouldn\u2019t let him win. I was Ellie Watt, not Eden White, and I was stronger than this.</p><p>I had no past. There was only now.</p><p>I took the next step \u2013 as unsteady as I was \u2013 and tried the door. It wasn\u2019t locked.</p><p>I peered out into the hallway and fought the memory that wanted to intrude, that time I discovered Javier slitting the throat of one of his friends. I shot down the memory, threw fresh dirt over it. I moved on and moved down the hall, my feet bare and sticking to the hardwood floor.</p><p>Sunlight dazzled the kitchen, streaming in through the large windows that overlooked the dune grass, sand and ocean. Javier was sitting at the table, drinking orange juice and flipping through the Los Angeles Times, eyes darting from page to page.</p><p>It could have been a Norman Rockwell painting. I was about to throw red paint on it.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck is going on?\u201d I asked, one hand leaning against the wall.</p><p>He finished flipping to the end of the paper \u2013 agonizing seconds of paper flipping through his deft fingers \u2013 before he laid it down and looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, looking amused without smiling. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>It took all of my self-control to keep from tackling him across the table and clawing his eyes out. I knew we weren\u2019t alone though. I knew there were people, somewhere, watching us, making sure I was following the straight and narrow. I knew I had to keep everything inside as much as I could.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell am I here?\u201d I asked, my jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cBecause I live here,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, just a twitch at the corner of his snake-like mouth. \u201cPainful memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I said. I instantly regretted it when his grin broadened.</p><p>\u201cI see. So they are.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my hair back behind my ears, as if that would help me think. \u201cWhy am I here? Why am I here where you live?\u201d I mimicked his accent.</p><p>He folded his hands in front of me and the damn watch started glinting like a gold spark in the sun stream. \u201cI brought you here because this is our first task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst task?\u201d I asked dumbly.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said, gesturing to the seat across from him. Where I always used to sit. Same damn seat. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I crossed my arms across my chest. His eyes briefly lasered in on my cleavage. \u201cI want you to tell me what the task is. I want to know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head. \u201cSo impatient, my angel.\u201d</p><p>I shot to the opposite side of the table and shoved my finger in his face. My razor blade necklace swung like a pendulum. \u201cTalk. You owe me that much, you piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>He eyed my finger and had the courtesy to wipe the smile from his face. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I backed off, my nerves firing in all directions. I waited, shoving my itching hands in my back pockets.</p><p>He breathed in delicately through his nose and folded up the newspaper as he spoke. \u201cThe task, why I brought you here, why I sought you, finally, is this ... I know what you\u2019ve been doing for the last however many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix. You know it\u2019s been six.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brow. \u201cTime flies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAlright. You\u2019ve been a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like my parents,\u201d I filled in, knowing what else he\u2019d throw in there.</p><p>His smile wavered for a second. \u201cYes. Just like them. Anyway, I\u2019m not judging.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be rich.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing that. Being generally immoral, such a far cry from the Eden White I loved.\u201d</p><p>The way he said loved creeped me out. It was like watching the devil say it himself. The word didn\u2019t belong on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAnd while you\u2019ve been Ellie Watt, I\u2019ve been ... making adjustments. Making money. Going places. Moving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s moving up, then I\u2019m moving out,\u201d I muttered under my breath, making sure he could hear me.</p><p>\u201cNo more Dire Straits?\u201d he asked. \u201cBilly Joel now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, I know about you. I know why you were with me, at least for some of it. I know the truth about your scars. I know the truth about Travis.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, the hairs standing up on my arms and prickling along my neck like tiny ants. Of course he knew. I remembered what Jim had told me about Javier already.</p><p>Jim.</p><p>My uncle Jim. My only real family. The memory of him hit me like a brick. But it wasn\u2019t anything nice. It wasn\u2019t the good times. It wasn\u2019t something fucking normal. It was when he was dead. The bullet in his head, his shocked expression as he hit the floor in that motel room.</p><p>And I was staring, just feet away, at the man who killed him.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Javier asked.</p><p>What would be the point in bringing it up? Jim didn\u2019t deserve to be mentioned in his presence. Another memory to bury deep inside.</p><p>\u201cSo you know the truth,\u201d I said with a shrug. \u201cMust have been enlightening for you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely. \u201cIt was. Ellie ... if I had known what Travis had done. If I had known then ...\u201d</p><p>Right. If he had known that I sought him out under false pretences, pretending to be interested in him in order to get closer to Travis, I\u2019m sure things would have been just peachy between us. I could only imagine what Javier would have done if he discovered at the time that our whole relationship was based on a lie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one and the same, don\u2019t you see? I no longer work for Travis. I went my own way a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA regular Stevie Nicks,\u201d I said, masking the sorrow that picked at me. Uncle Jim. His memory kept floating to the surface.</p><p>He went on, \u201cTravis ... I grew more powerful than him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must be very proud.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head in agreement, not receiving my sarcasm. \u201cThere were too many traitors in his organization. He\u2019d gone mad with power. Things were unraveling. He began consorting with our rivals, Los Zetas. The very people who killed my parents. If I hadn\u2019t split, I might have died.\u201d</p><p>What a shame, I thought.</p><p>\u201cI had Raul and Alex. I had a few others. I had the means and the connections. I left here and headed to Florida. I made a good life for myself.\u201d He noticed my expression. \u201cYes, maybe running drugs isn\u2019t a noble life. But neither is conning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d I said through grinding teeth, \u201cIs. The. Task?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTravis hurt you, Ellie. He was the reason you found me those years ago. You wanted revenge for your scars, for your life, for what he\u2019d done to you. I\u2019m handing you the gun. Together, we can get your revenge. And I can get mine.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything sounding absolutely ridiculous, I had to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s your revenge? What did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, his eyes drifting to the LA Times again. Why he was reading the LA paper when we were in Ocean Springs, Mississippi was beyond me. Everything was beyond me. \u201cWhat matters is that I said I would kill any man that hurt you. Now, you have seen that I keep my word. I keep my promises. Travis hurt you, maybe more than anyone else. I want him dead from the barrel of my gun.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed uneasily. \u201cMaybe you oughta turn the gun on yourself then.\u201d Because you hurt me, too, is what I didn\u2019t say.</p><p>He blinked warmly. \u201cMaybe I will. But first, this is the task. We kill him. Together. Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. Promises are promises.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. It was raining down on me in slick fragments that I just couldn\u2019t grasp. One minute Camden and I were heading for a new life together. In the next I was with Javier, who wanted me to kill the drug lord that ruined my life. As much as I believed in revenge, I couldn\u2019t muster up the rage that blinded me enough to do such a thing. I couldn\u2019t do much of anything except try and get my brain up to speed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a con artist,\u201d I stated. \u201cNot a killer for hire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said softly. He got up, pushing his chair back and leaning on the table. \u201cUnfortunately, you don\u2019t have much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched. I would not let fear set in. Fear made me weak. Fear had drugged me.</p><p>\u201cI always have a choice.\u201d I grimaced at my warbling voice.</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d he said, walking around the table. His wing-tipped shoes echoed in the kitchen. \u201cThe choice you did have \u2013 to stay with Camden or turn yourself over to me \u2013 you took. Now you have to live with the consequences. It\u2019s time for you to own your decision.</p><p>His eyes were getting to be too much. I looked to the floor. \u201cWhy do you need me to do this? Why can\u2019t you kill him yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we are enemies now, my dear. Because he knows to look out for me. Because I have tried before and yes, I failed. I am not perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever said you were,\u201d I muttered. My heart was threatening to beat out of my chest but as long as I kept my eyes on the floor and my head clear, I was going to be okay. No fear. I had to play it cool, play it safe and have no fear. The minute my mind started focusing on the what ifs was the moment I lost it.</p> <p>I was very close to losing it.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said coming up to me. My body seized with his just inches away. I concentrated on his black shoes, expensive leather with scuffed tips. Tailored suit pants. It didn\u2019t go. His shoes should have been shiny and as black as oil. \u201cYou. You can get to him. You can get close. You don\u2019t even have to pull the trigger.\u201d He said trigger like it was a new sexual position.</p><p>Another thought I didn\u2019t need.</p><p>He took another slow step forward. I sucked in my stomach.</p><p>His voice lowered till it was rough and smooth like ice in a milkshake. \u201cYou can get your revenge. The revenge you couldn\u2019t get with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t need revenge anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re lying to yourself.\u201d</p><p>I dared myself to look him in the eye. I raised my chin defiantly, pretending I was suited in armor. \u201cMaybe lying is what I do best.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at my lips and let out a small laugh. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of searching for that something to put your demons to rest?\u201d</p><p>I ignored him. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of pretending you know me when you don\u2019t know shit? You didn\u2019t even know I was Ellie Watt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew enough,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019ll help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, he doesn\u2019t know who you are. You can get in. You can get close.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head in disbelief. \u201cLike hell he doesn\u2019t know who I am. Javier. I was your ... I was here. I lived with you for a fucking year. Travis knew about me, you told me he did. He saw pictures of us, of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look completely different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll know.\u201d I started shaking my head up and down and back and forth. \u201cOh, he\u2019ll know. How can he not?\u201d</p><p>Javier frowned and rubbed at his chin. I could almost see puzzle pieces coming together behind those eyes. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t know you when you were a child. And he didn\u2019t know you when you were with me. And he doesn\u2019t know you now.\u201d His head dipped. \u201cAngel, you were nothing to him. Unmemorable. He probably doesn\u2019t even remember pouring that acid down your leg. You\u2019re nothing special. Not to him.\u201d</p><p>I felt like I\u2019d been slapped in the face and it took my fingers digging into my pockets like desperate claws to keep from slapping him in the face. Lord knows he deserved it and more. But now wasn\u2019t the time. Because as much as it hurt for Javier to say it, I knew he was right. I had always thought that Travis was watching out for me in the way that I watched out for him. But who was I to him? Just a ten-year-old girl with stupid, reckless, selfish parents. He got his money back. He probably never gave a second thought to what he did to me. He was the be all and end all in the back of my mind, my heart, my spine, my soul. His actions piloted every moment until now. And they would probably affect the next. I knew he hadn\u2019t given me more thought than just that moment, when he scarred me. It was as natural as wiping his ass. He probably woke up the next day and forgot all about what he did to me. I wasn\u2019t special. I was a mere second to him yet he\u2019d become my Moby Dick. In some way, he\u2019d become my everything. Too many monsters had inserted themselves into my life.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d Javier whispered. Sugar sweet. Poison. \u201cHe ruined your life and it didn\u2019t mean a thing. He\u2019ll do that to you. That\u2019s how he got so far. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to take him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything with you,\u201d I snarled, finding violence in my veins.</p><p>That smirk of his. \u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind. You did before.\u201d</p><p>Then he moved away from me in one swift moment. He plucked the orange juice off the table, drank it empty and slammed it down. \u201cI have some business to attend to. I\u2019ll be back, you\u2019ll be delighted to know. In the meantime, make yourself ... at home.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a wink and then ran down the stairs to the front door. It opened before he even got there, a burly man on the other side of it. The door closed, sealing me in the prison of my past.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>I dreamed about Ellie.</p><p>We were walking together between the rows of date palms on her Uncle Jim\u2019s farm. As usual, my dreams were vivid. I could smell the dates as they squished beneath our feet, the earthiness of sun and soil. Me, in my high school gear: long black trench coat which was never as hot as it looked, vinyl pants that were as hot as they looked, black doc martens that I\u2019d drawn on with a silver Sharpie. Ellie was wearing the same boots, albeit smaller. I had decorated hers with gold scribbles. She was dressed in jeans and a strappy top, her uniform. Jackasses made fun of her for wearing pants in the California desert, even in the heart of summer, but I loved her in that. The jeans adapted to her body as she developed over the years, from lean and lanky to lean and curvy.</p><p>We\u2019d always been the only kids in Palm Valley who wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in shorts.</p><p>We walked along the rows, the sun dappling through the leaves making me feel happy. It was always a peculiar feeling but I was used to it when I was around her. Being around Ellie gave me peace and acceptance. Real life only settled in when she left.</p><p>In the dream, I reached for her hand and pulled her towards a date palm. A ladder had been left there after harvesting.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She shook her head, her brow wearing a faint sign of panic. She looked so fucking cute, it was always so damn hard not to kiss her. I remember always wanting to and never working up the nerve. She had let me be so true and free (as free as a teenager can be) but that was the one thing I could never let on \u2013 how much I wanted her, needed her. It was puppy love at its dirtiest.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I had said to her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re afraid of heights.\u201d</p><p>Her fourteen-year-old face grew hard with stark determination. I knew that would work on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d she said. She grabbed the ladder and began to speed up it.</p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d I called after her and followed.</p><p>We seemed to climb on and on, forever and forever, the palm tree stretching from twenty feet to thirty feet to fifty feet to a hundred. We finally reached the top, crawling through the thick fronds like kittens in a jungle. I took every opportunity to touch Ellie, my hand on her arm, her back, her thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Ellie said as she settled in. Her eyes were fastened to the horizon.</p><p>In the distance you could see the San Jacinto Mountains looming like lions. They were on fire, the peaks flickering with flames that edged their way down the mountainsides and toward the towns below. The fire spread like a blanket of lava over the valley, faster and thicker until it reached her uncle\u2019s farm. Date palms disappeared in front of our eyes, going down like blackened matchsticks, leaving tiny puffs of smoke floating above a sea of red.</p><p>Ellie looked at me, young and scared. She reached for my hand as the hiss and pop of the fire gathered at the base of our tree.</p><p>\u201cWill you burn with me?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr will you go free?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her face as the heat pressed in. \u201cI\u2019ll burn with you.\u201d</p><p>My lips touched hers for one second. Our screams covered us in the next. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCamden,\u201d a voice came shuddering through the dark. \u201cCamden, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Soft hands on my arm, shaking me awake.</p><p>I opened my eyes. Instead of seeing Ellie\u2019s face in a sea of flames I saw Sophia\u2019s, peering at me with something a little less than concern. Her hands were still shaking me but she was keeping her distance, clutching her mauve robe to her chest. I blinked and tried to sit up.</p><p>I was on her couch in her tiny, toy-strewn living room. There was a fuzzy darkness that came with dawn. Light was taking its time outside her windows.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I groaned while pinching the bridge of my nose. I\u2019d fallen asleep with my glasses on, ensuring that the frames felt permanently pressed into my skin. We\u2019d gotten to her apartment as night was falling. After scoping out the joint and peering through the blinds every five minutes, watching for her brothers or anything suspicious, I stayed up for as long as I could. It was a second story unit with views of the street, easy pickings. Sophia didn\u2019t seem as worried as I thought she would be. Perhaps her focus was on Ben. He may have been young but he was observant and knew something bad was happening. Sophia did what she could to make sure he was calm and happy before putting him to bed.</p><p>I had watched from the doorway. It was as close as I could get without intruding. My heart pinched as she sang him a nursery song, the same one that she sang to him since he was a baby. When I was around. In those days, she\u2019d pick him up during his midnight cries and whisper it, so soft and so sweet. Sometimes I\u2019d take over, just to give her a break. I could never hit her high notes \u2013 I wasn\u2019t much of a singer. But Ben would stop crying, just like that.</p><p>Later, when Sophia started pulling out of the marriage, out of life in general, I sang that song all the time. After a while, it stopped working. He missed his mother. I did too. And no matter how soothing I tried to sound, I couldn\u2019t stop Ben\u2019s tears. Things crumbled beyond repair.</p><p>Ben was a year old when I last saw him, days before the divorce was final. Though I was now looking at the face of an older boy all curled up in his bed, in some ways it was like I never left. I knew him, deep inside, and everything on the surface was slowly catching up.</p><p>He was almost asleep, round face, my beautiful boy, when he opened his eyes and stared right at me from across the room.</p> <p>\u201cMama, who is that?\u201d he asked, as if seeing me for the first time. It felt like I turned a tattoo machine on my heart.</p><p>She brushed back his hair. \u201cNo one you need to worry about. Sleep well, my Ben.\u201d</p><p>Any other time, I would have said something. The words, the anger, were fighting their way out of my chest and up my throat. To be brushed aside like that. I was his motherfucking father. But now wasn\u2019t the time for my own insecurities, for the tragedy of our family. As long as Sophia and Ben were around her traitorous brothers, they were in danger. I needed to save them first.</p><p>The technicalities could come after.</p><p>And that\u2019s how I ended up falling asleep on the couch. Sophia retired to her room, something I had no interest in being a part of, even if the offer was on the table (which it wasn\u2019t). I lay down on the couch and waited. Waited for people who never came. Waited for the reason to run.</p><p>\u201cYou were yelling,\u201d Sophia said, straightening up. She started tugging at her dark hair, something she did when she was nervous. \u201cI thought you were in pain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d I reassured her.</p><p>\u201cA bad dream. You cried out for that woman. For Ellie.\u201d</p><p>It was weird to hear her say Ellie\u2019s name. She didn\u2019t say it with venom though, just curiosity. I couldn\u2019t blame her. Ellie and I had quite the story and she hadn\u2019t heard any of it. There was no point in explaining, not when the wound was still raw.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake Ben?\u201d I asked, suddenly worried. My eyes darted to the hallway where his door was open. His room was still dark and quiet.</p><p>She shook her head and smiled. It was a sad smile. \u201cHe sleeps in. And he sleeps through everything. Just like his father.\u201d</p><p>I watched her face carefully for telltale signs of insincerity. There wasn\u2019t any.</p><p>I carefully smiled back. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten better. I get up at nine now.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cOh, nine. Must be nice being a tattoo artist, your clients are probably all hung over anyway and stumbling in at noon.\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t exactly true but of course that was the stereotype of people with tattoos. Despite the popularity of shitty yet hot tattoo artist chicks and the locust swarm of hipsters, people still had the wrong idea about tattoos and the artists that gave them. They were untrustworthy, dirty, trashy and dishonest as a whole. Yet I\u2019d tattooed valedictorians and soccer moms. I\u2019d inked businessmen and actors. Reverends and teeny boppers. Tattoos were self-expression at its rawest and most permanent form. They weren\u2019t for one set of people or another.</p><p>Despite the facts, I was used to the stereotype. It wouldn\u2019t die but then neither would I as long as I ignored it. Even Sophia, who met me because she got a fucking tattoo, clung on to it like it was the only way to describe me.</p><p>Of course, the fact that I turned into a money launderer didn\u2019t really help my case. I\u2019d never much cared for what people thought of me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care when they stumble in, as long as they let me use their body as a canvas.\u201d Then I would continue to be immortal. My ink, my work, my self, would live on. I didn\u2019t say that to her though \u2019cause that would definitely add another bar to the my ex-husband is a nutjob scale.</p><p>Her features drew together. \u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you keep being a tattoo artist? Or will you try something else?\u201d</p><p>The way she said \u201csomething else\u201d reminded me of the way my dad often talked about my choice of career.</p><p>\u201cOne step at a time, Sophia,\u201d I reminded her, easing myself to my feet. Sleeping on a thin couch never did my back any good and I had a strange feeling that I needed to be agile today.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to make you coffee?\u201d I asked, my head starting to ache for it.</p><p>She studied for a moment before shaking her head. \u201cWhere are my manners? You stay. I\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>She swept herself into her tiny kitchen. \u201cMy father gave me one of those Keurig coffee makers for Christmas last year. I love it.\u201d</p><p>Her father. My eyes did another sweep of the room and even in the fuzzy dawn I noted things I hadn\u2019t the night before. Flatscreen TV, not new though nothing to scoff at. Ikea couch that I\u2019d slept on. Ben didn\u2019t have an obscene amount of toys, but from the ones that I saw, they looked new. Despite Sophia telling me that her dickhead brothers never passed on a dime of my child support, she seemed to be doing well enough for herself. This could have been her father \u2013 always Mr. Madano to me \u2013 or her job (she was an aesthetician) or the government. It should have made me feel good inside, to know she was doing okay without my money going through, yet for some reason it made me more mad. It highlighted the money that was wasted. It made me feel like a fucking chump.</p><p>The coffee machine whirred and spurted from the kitchen and in minutes I had a steaming cup of coffee in my hands. The mug had a picture of Ben on it, smiling, wearing reindeer antlers on his head.</p><p>\u201cYou still take it black?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSome thing\u2019s don\u2019t change,\u201d I said with a nod, taking a sip. It tasted good. Not as good as I made it, but good enough. The way I did it took patience, as do all the best things in life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing glasses now,\u201d she noted.</p><p>I smiled and took them off, slipping them into my pocket. \u201cI was just trying something. I\u2019m putting my contacts back in.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my cell and glanced at the time. 630AM. No calls or texts. I wasn\u2019t really surprised.</p><p>I cleared my throat as I sat down on the couch and Sophia hovered above me like a nervous bird, darting her head down for a quick sip.</p><p>\u201cHow fast do you think you can get yourself packed up?\u201d I asked, feeling like the neck of the hourglass was starting to widen. \u201cI\u2019ll help of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said and shrugged, her face noncommittal. \u201cNot long.\u201d</p><p>I squinted at her. \u201cNot long? You\u2019re packing up your whole life, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>I was getting the impression that the severity of what we were taking on wasn\u2019t sinking in. I leaned forward, elbows on knees and tried to rein her in. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t easy. I know this doesn\u2019t even feel real. But, Sophia, you know what your brothers did to you. What makes you think they wouldn\u2019t do it again? What makes you think you\u2019d ever be safe if you kept going on like you are? What about Ben?\u201d</p><p>I know I reached her. A pain expression flashed across her eyes, then it was gone. She smiled politely. \u201cI know what I have to do, Camden, and I will do it. Whether I\u2019m calm about it or freaking out, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it must be done. I\u2019d rather do it now and worry about it later. Give me until 11AM. I\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d</p><p>It was a specific time, but I liked that about her. After our coffees were done, the sun was up, trying aimlessly to cut through the Los Angeles fog that covered the city like parchment paper. I helped Sophia gather most of the important stuff \u2013 clothes, books, documents \u2013 while Ben slept. She was trying to keep his distress to a minimum, she said. I wondered how well a three and a half year old can adjust to a new life. If he was anything like his father, I figured pretty well.</p><p>After he\u2019d had his breakfast of banana Cheerios, as Sophia was trying to clean him up, I asked her where the briefcase was.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, sounding strangely cagey.</p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very safe to have fifty thousand dollars just sitting around in a briefcase, do you? I\u2019m going to deposit some of it at the bank.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and patted Ben on the butt. \u201cBen, go to your room and get your Bubby.\u201d</p><p>Ben nodded and ran off to his bedroom. I looked back at her. She was tugging at her hair.</p><p>\u201cLook, you can come with me,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s smart if we deposit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. We can\u2019t. We\u2019ll set an alarm off if we deposit more than ten thousand,\u201d she said.</p><p>I chewed on my lip for a second, watching her. \u201cI know that. We aren\u2019t going to get dinged. The money technically isn\u2019t dirty anyway. I can deposit nine thousand in my bank account and nine in yours. That gives us eighteen grand that we know will be safe. We can repeat this tomorrow. And then the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ...\u201d She kept shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cSophia, what is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>I watched her throat move as she swallowed hard. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>I threw up my hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s the fucking difference? Look, we don\u2019t have time to squabble over money here. As much as I hate it, the money is ours. We need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have the money that you and Ellie stole?\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, trying to be casual and totally failing. \u201cYou and Ellie stole my brothers\u2019 money. You have that money in your bank account already, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s ...\u201d The money we laundered. The checks from the casinos. Ellie had them. Either they were still on her or they were in the car somewhere. With the trauma of the last day, I\u2019d forgotten all about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, where is it?\u201d she shrieked. \u201cYou can\u2019t hold out on me, Camden.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hands. \u201cWhoa, calm down, okay? There\u2019s a lot going on. There are the checks that we got from the casinos. I think they\u2019re on Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me,\u201d she said, walking toward me. \u201cThey\u2019re in the car somewhere, aren\u2019t they?\u201d She yelled the last bit. \u201cYou have them!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe, I\u2019ll look,\u201d I said, trying to placate her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re there, we\u2019re depositing it in your account, today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so now there\u2019s a rush?\u201d</p><p>She smiled quickly. \u201cNow it\u2019s legit. These kinds of transactions won\u2019t make the bank suspicious. It\u2019s just casino winnings, right? We can deposit the cash some other day. We\u2019ll just be really careful with it.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, feeling strange about everything. Was she really afraid that I\u2019d hide money from her? Didn\u2019t she understand I was doing and risking everything to protect them, to provide for them, to do the best I could?</p> <p>Or maybe Sophia had a supremely fucked-up idea of what a family was all about.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d I told her. \u201cGrab Ben. We\u2019ll search the car and if we\u2019re lucky, I\u2019ll go deposit what we find.\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly and grabbed her purse from the counter.</p><p>\u201cAnd the briefcase?\u201d I asked, blocking her.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s in my room. We\u2019re not taking it with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather we did. It\u2019s safer on us than here.\u201d</p> <p>I could tell she wanted to argue but maybe she figured it wouldn\u2019t do any good. She gave me an agreeable sigh and then came back with the briefcase in hand. I let her hold onto both it and Ben, things I wasn\u2019t allowed to touch.</p><p>It only took a few seconds for me to locate three of the checks. They were in a metal box in the trunk, the place where Ellie carried a \u201cspare life.\u201d Unfortunately, one check was made out to Ellie, two were made out to Connor Malloy, and one was made out to Camden McQueen. They were all worth about seven thousand dollars each, which meant Ellie must have the remaining checks on her. I wanted to think that was a good thing, that she\u2019d have money, wherever she was. But I had a bad, bad feeling that she wouldn\u2019t get to use them.</p><p>After I calmed Sophia down and told her that I could eventually deposit Connor Malloy\u2019s check, once our new life was underway and I got some help from Gus, we headed off to the nearest bank branch that Camden McQueen belonged to. All I had to do was smile at the teller when she commented on my \u201clucky Vegas winnings\u201d and that was it. The money was in the bank. It was a small amount in the grand scheme of things, but it was a start. And I hoped to god that was enough for Sophia to start showing a little faith in me.</p><p>Yet, as we drove back to her apartment, she became more quiet and nervous. She was pretty much ripping her hair out as we pulled up to the tiny complex.</p><p>I popped the GTO in park and stared at her earnestly. \u201cAre you afraid that your brothers are back?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just afraid.\u201d Then she started to cry. Ben squirmed in the child seat we had outfitted in the back.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, putting my hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay? This shit sucks and I know I\u2019m the last person you want to be running away with, but maybe things will all work out for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it?\u201d she sobbed through wet, nasty tears. \u201cHow can you and I ever work?\u201d</p> <p>I sucked in my breath before saying, \u201cMaybe it can work if there\u2019s love. If not for each other, at least for Ben.\u201d</p><p>This only made Sophia cry louder. I was never very good at being sappy. Good thing my job wasn\u2019t writing greeting cards.</p><p>I sighed and sat back in the seat, ignoring the fact that it was feeling more and more like my car when it very much wasn\u2019t. I rubbed her back, despite her flinching from my touch.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset, but we\u2019re almost packed. We\u2019re about ready to go.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed but didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start bringing your stuff down? I don\u2019t want to take Ben back in there if we\u2019re only going to rip this life away from him.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. I nodded and left her in the car and took the car keys \u2013 the briefcase was in the trunk after all. I made my way up the stairs to the unit, the sun beating down on my back like a hot hand, and opened the door.</p><p>I was wondering how Sophia would adjust, if she would ever adjust, if maybe we\u2019d part ways in a few months after our new lives got settled and if she\u2019d take Ben away from me again, when I stepped into the apartment.</p><p>Something was different. Something was off.</p><p>For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t tell what it was, whether it was a smell or the fact that all the shades were drawn but I suddenly knew I wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>I suddenly knew the reason why Sophia stayed in the car.</p><p>I suddenly knew there would be no new life for me.</p><p>Not if I didn\u2019t act on instinct.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Before there was a shuffle, the sound of a gun\u2019s cartridge being handled, and the exhale of breath, I ducked. A gun fired from somewhere behind the couch. My own gun was out of reach, tucked away in the car\u2019s glove compartment. I had to improvise.</p><p>I rolled out of the way and sprang to my feet in time to meet the face of one of Sophia\u2019s brothers. He was the one I called sloppy seconds or \u201cNot Vincent.\u201d I was taller than Not Vincent and a fuckload angrier. Before he could fire again, I brought my elbow down between his eyes until I heard the crunch of cartilage. Then I struck him in the throat, driving his Adam\u2019s apple in until he and his gun dropped to the floor. Out of my reach. I had no time to think or act before launching myself over the couch right before another gun went off.</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d it was Vincent, his slimy, manipulative voice. \u201cThis can end now.\u201d</p><p>I kept my mouth shut. I had nothing to say to him, no bargains to be made. I heard him take a step closer, coming from maybe Ben\u2019s room. In the distance there were a few cries, worried neighbors. This was going to all happen fast, before the cops showed up. Vincent was in a hurry. He planned to kill me now, make it look like I was a break-in. A domestic dispute. Perhaps Sophia would back his claim and the brothers would look heroic.</p><p>\u201cThis bullet can go straight through the couch.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Fuck Ikea for making such flimsy furniture. I listened for the sounds of Not Vincent, trying to gauge if he was still a threat to me. He\u2019d fallen so fast\u2014had I killed him? I couldn\u2019t hear him sputtering.</p><p>Vincent went on, sounding breezy, apparently not caring that his brother was hurt or possibly dead. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a few seconds to tell us where the rest of the checks are. The checks with my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have your money,\u201d I grunted, trying to breathe in and out, trying to get oxygen into my brain. Think, Camden, think.</p><p>\u201cWhat Javier gave me was a bonus,\u201d he said, closer now. Maybe just a few feet away. He was right behind me and he wasn\u2019t pulling the trigger until I gave him the answer. \u201cI still want what you dared to steal from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas all the money worth handing over your only sister and nephew to a drug lord?\u201d I spat out.</p><p>Vincent chuckled. \u201cIt was practically Sophia\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>The room froze. It was hard to breathe.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired of people fucking you over?\u201d he went on.</p><p>Apparently, I hadn\u2019t been tired enough.</p><p>My eyes fought through the disgust that had lodged itself in my chest and drifted to the floor. One of Ben\u2019s toys, a robotic dog, was lying a foot away from me, half covered by the couch\u2019s slipcover.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the rest of the checks are,\u201d I said while my arm slowly reached over. My fingers curled around the toy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Vincent said. Now he was right on the other side of the couch. I could practically feel his breath. If he took one more little step, he\u2019d be able to see me, hands on the robotic dog, my shoulder pressed against the couch back. He would see me waiting.</p><p>Ready.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t cash them anyway,\u201d I told him. \u201cThey\u2019re all in Ellie\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll make her cash them for me.\u201d</p><p>That would have been a believable threat if I hadn\u2019t known that Ellie was with Javier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019d have to go through another psychopath first,\u201d I sneered.</p><p>\u201cYou really are na\u00efve, aren\u2019t you, tat boy? What makes you think that wouldn\u2019t be a problem? What makes you think this isn\u2019t all part of the plan?\u201d</p><p>Plan? I shook my head, refusing to be riled up by him. He knew all the right buttons to push. \u201cAll of this for forty grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy money gets you rich,\u201d he said. The gun cocked.</p><p>It was time to move.</p><p>I pressed down on the button on the robotic dog\u2019s back and flung it up and over the couch to the right. It barked as it went, loud and jarring and I hoped it was enough to confuse him. Flying robot dogs probably weren\u2019t part of his \u201cplan.\u201d</p><p>It worked.</p><p>In one second the dog exploded into silver smithereens as Vincent shot it.</p><p>In the next second I focused all my energy into a squat, my years of surfing at Long Beach finally coming into play, and with a giant groan I sprung up and out, my shoulder driving into the couch back. Ikea made flimsy couches but they were that much easier to move.</p><p>I felt the couch awkwardly make contact with Vincent, his gun going off but up in the air, cracking a hole in the ceiling. I kept driving the couch forward until it knocked him down and was out of my way. He cried out and the gun went off again, this time whizzing over my shoulder and crashing through the window. I burst out the door just in time.</p><p>I leaped down the stairs three at a time, my back feeling like a bull\u2019s-eye, not knowing when Vincent was going to fire on me. The sunlight was so bright, so terrible and out of place after what I\u2019d gone through.</p><p>As I neared the car, I noticed it was empty. There was no time to process where Sophia and Ben were. For once, I wasn\u2019t worried about them and I was proven right when I jumped in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>With my hand on the gearshift, I stared up through the windshield to the apartment. Sophia and Ben were standing a few doors down, huddled with a neighbor and watching me, watching everything. She was crying and playing the part. It sickened every bone in my bloody body.</p><p>Against my better judgement I stuck my head out the window and yelled at her. \u201cI\u2019m coming back for him!\u201d Call me crazy, call me whatever you will, there was no way in hell I\u2019d let my son live with that devil of a woman. I would come back for what was mine.</p><p>She held Ben close to her side and gave me a look of Oscar-worthy revulsion. \u201cOver my dead body!\u201d The neighbor, a round Latino woman, was watching our exchange with horror no doubt for the poor, ex-wife. That poor, poor double-crossing bitch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I said to myself, though I wondered if it was loud enough to hear, if it would come back to haunt me. I wondered if I meant it.</p><p>I popped the car in reverse and peeled back out of the parking lot as Vincent came staggering out of the apartment, waving his gun around like he had a chance of hitting me.</p><p>I was already gone before he could steady his hand. The GTO roared down the quiet sunny streets of suburban Los Angeles, and I wondered when the fuck I\u2019d stop being a chump and if I\u2019d ever get to see my son again.</p><p>If I\u2019d ever get my life back and take charge.</p> <p>But I had to.</p><p>I wanted to.</p><p>I was going to find Gus.</p><p>And then I was going to find Ellie.</p><p>And nothing, absolutely nothing, would get in my way.</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>My escape artist skills had grown rusty. Which wasn\u2019t really all that surprising since I\u2019d apparently turned into quite the shit trickster as well. Whether I\u2019d grown too confident and too cocky by driving that damn, damn car around or I was doing it, as Javier had suggested, because I wanted to get caught, I was obviously losing my touch. I decided that I\u2019d become too cocky, because wanting the vile Mexican to actually find me was a whole other can of worms that I wasn\u2019t about to dive into.</p><p>Besides, I had bigger problems. Like getting caught right after I made a break for it.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t really blame a girl for trying.</p><p>After Javier had left me in that rotten house to whatever business he did (strangling puppies was my guess), I spent the rest of the day devising a plan to escape. It probably would have been time better spent if I had thought about what Javier had propositioned me with but I was so certain I could get out of it that I didn\u2019t even have to think about the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d</p> <p>Another reason why I was losing my touch: a good con artist always examines all the scenarios, the \u201cwhat ifs,\u201d the multiple ways the game can play out. But I did none of that. Instead I observed the burly man on the other side of the front door and the smaller man in the black suit who was stationed by the French doors in the kitchen, guarding the way to the balcony like some bored bouncer at a club. I decided I\u2019d fake out the smaller guard, maybe hit him over the head with something (he was smaller after all and the kitchen was full of blunt objects, even if all the knives were conveniently gone) and make a run for it. Once on the beach, I could book it down to one of the neighbors, providing he hadn\u2019t paid off everyone on the sandy strip. There was a chance that he did. Javier didn\u2019t just split from Travis without being extremely thorough.</p><p>I should have mulled on that observation a little bit longer. At around five in the evening, when the sun was low in the West and the shore looked fuzzy with light, I had knocked on the kitchen door. Through the glass, I could see the short man ignoring me so I rapped again and stared at him impatiently until he turned to look.</p><p>I made the motion for him to open the door, all while keeping a heavy pestle from a pestle and mortar set nestled in my hidden hand like a police club. Finally he opened the door and gave me an expectant look.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I told him, all smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you realize this but I\u2019ve effectively been kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>His face remained frozen except for one brow that rose.</p><p>\u201cAnd, well, I was wondering if you had it in your heart to let me go,\u201d I went on. This was a long shot, playing to a man\u2019s sense of decency and morality. As if he\u2019d chose that over going against Javier\u2019s orders.</p><p>As I expected he shook his head ever so slightly. His focus was at least on me. I chose that moment to scratch behind my ear with my free hand and let go of a quarter I\u2019d kept hidden in my fingers. It was like a magic trick gone wrong, but the point was that he wasn\u2019t expecting a shiny quarter to fall out from behind my ear and clank down on the floor. His eyes followed it and before they had a chance to look back up at me, I\u2019d raised the pestle and smashed it down into his temple. The sweet spot.</p><p>He cried out, much louder than I was expecting and grabbed his head. I saw a flash of red but didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it. I pushed him down and to the side and then jumped up onto the balcony railing. Without hesitating I leaped down, falling a whole story but landing with a clump onto the soft sand below. A sharp pang shot up from my left ankle, my weakest one, but I ignored it and started running.</p> <p>At first it felt like quicksand, like one of those horrible dreams where you\u2019re trying to run but can\u2019t. Only this was no dream. I made it as far as the property edge where a row of flax separated Javier\u2019s property from the neighbors, flax I\u2019d once planted because it looked tropical and pretty, when I was tackled from behind.</p><p>I face-planted into the sand as arms went around my legs and brought me down. I kicked out, trying to hit the assailant but it was too late. The person was now straddling me across my waist, preventing me from flipping over or fighting. I bucked, I tried, but they were too strong.</p><p>I violently turned my head, cheek burning against the grains of sand and peered up. His face was in shadows caused by the setting sun behind him, but I knew it was Javier. ... and he was smiling. I could always see that flash of white teeth.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me,\u201d I said, sand coating my lips as I spoke against it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He sounded smug in his simplicity.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing, waiting for me to run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with a cock of his head. \u201cI wanted to see if you\u2019d learned anything.\u201d</p><p>I tried to move again, to throw him off with surprise, but his legs were like steel.</p><p>\u201cI learned that your chances of escaping diminishes quickly after the first twenty-four hours of kidnapping,\u201d I told him with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cI heard what you said to Felipe. You think this is kidnapping?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him with the one eye. \u201cYou are so fucking delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I believe you are the delusional one, my angel. I never threatened you with force. You didn\u2019t have to come with me into the car. You chose me, Ellie. You chose to leave him and his lovely family. This was your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me go,\u201d I spat out. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I need you. Please tell me you didn\u2019t spend the whole day trying to think of silly little ways of escaping instead of giving me an answer.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him and his mind-reading ways. \u201cLet me go, Javier. If you\u2019re not keeping me here by force, then you\u2019ll get the fuck up and let me walk away.\u201d My voice shook a little.</p><p>He grew silent and I could hear nothing except the waves and hushed Spanish in the distance. It sounded like his henchmen, somewhere nearby watching the scene, keeping an eye on their boss to see what he was going to do next.</p><p>What he did do next surprised me if not them. He cleared his throat and said, \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Then he got to his feet and stepped away, dusting the front of his pant legs and adjusting his suit jacket. Same scuffed wingtips as earlier. He waved out his arm toward the street, as if highlighting the way to go.</p><p>\u201cYou are free to go, Ellie Watt. I cannot keep you here if you don\u2019t want to be here. I thought you were someone else. I suppose I was mistaken. Even I can make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what the hell he was doing but I wasn\u2019t going to waste an opportunity. I snapped up to my feet as quickly as I could and stood across from him, a little unsteady.</p><p>He pointed at me, letting his finger trail up and down my body. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a lot of sand.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down. I looked like icing powder exploded all over my jeans and t-shirt. I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSo I can just go,\u201d I said warily. This stunk to high heaven.</p><p>He nodded gravely. \u201cI brought you here because I thought I was doing you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was going to do you a favor,\u201d I corrected him.</p><p>His eyes relaxed. \u201cThis is something we both want. You know you want it, need it, crave it.\u201d</p><p>No, I wouldn\u2019t start bargaining. I wouldn\u2019t examine what my revenge meant to me now. Being with Camden had taught me that revenge wasn\u2019t the be all and end all of my existence anymore, that I could go legit like I had once planned and going legit, going moral meant not throwing it all to shit and killing a man, no matter how evil that man was.</p><p>The man who ruined your entire life, your entire family, your soul, something whispered from some deep dark place inside me. It used to be a familiar voice and that alone made me realize that I\u2019d changed over the last little bit. It once was familiar and now was strange and buried.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Javier asked with false politeness. I could see his eyes burning gold and green with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d I said, \u201cis what I\u2019m thinking. Now, I\u2019m going to walk and pretend I never saw you. You\u2019re going to pretend you never saw me. You can go onto kill Travis if it makes you happy. I won\u2019t condemn you for it though I can\u2019t say the same for everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fair,\u201d he said, clasping his hands together like he was about to teach a sermon on the beach. \u201cAdi\u00f3s, my dear angel. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t work this out.\u201d</p><p>I watched him for a few beats, my peripheral vision picking up his henchmen who were far out of reach, watching, perhaps as confused as I was. Something was up, obviously, I wasn\u2019t that much of an idiot. But I figured I should probably run for my life while I could.</p><p>I\u2019d turned on my heel and was about to sprint away to the road when he cleared his throat. Here it came. The catch.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cthere will be consequences for your lack of loyalty.\u201d</p><p>My jaw came a tiny bit unhinged. I froze in my tracks for a second, then slowly turned to face him. \u201cLoyalty?\u201d</p><p>He twisted his lips in agreement. \u201cYes. I thought you would have stayed loyal but you\u2019re no different from the rest of them. Remember Miguel? When I found out how disloyal he\u2019d been. He was a traitor.\u201d</p><p>My face was making expressions that I couldn\u2019t control. Disbelief and a flood of impatience lay thickly on my tongue. \u201cI don\u2019t ... I don\u2019t even know what to say. Are you saying that I\u2019m disloyal to you? Javier ...\u201d I burst out laughing and leaned forward, hands on my knees. \u201cJavier, you really have lost it haven\u2019t you? You fucking need to be loyal before you can be disloyal.\u201d</p><p>His expression was stone. \u201cYou were loyal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was loyal and then I caught you in bed screwing some fucking chick. How is that for loyal?!\u201d I was yelling the last bit, hoping that his henchmen had picked up on it. Not that it mattered to them but somehow it mattered to me that they knew how fucking delusional this man was.</p><p>He frowned and took a step forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Angel. I didn\u2019t realize that it had such an impact on you, to affect you all these years later.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed, pushing all my ire into them and I jabbed my finger into the air. \u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re sick, you know that?\u201d Not only was he trying to make it seem like I was some hung-up ex-girlfriend, he was quasi-threatening me. Slit my throat for not going along with some fucked-up plan? Is that what he was seriously suggesting? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart was beginning to beat loudly in my head, throwing me off a bit. Was I panicking? Or just getting a major mind fuck?</p><p>Run, my gut screamed at me.</p><p>And so I did. I didn\u2019t have time to get sucked into whatever trap he had planned. He seemed to think I\u2019d be too caught up on old feelings and sentiment to go anywhere but that bitch was wrong. Javier\u2019s betrayal was a learning experience. It taught me to never let my guard down. To never trust men like him.</p><p>I ran across the sand, along the flax and to the path that led between his house and the next. The road was almost at my feet. I had no car but I had memory and I knew if I ran fast enough, long enough, I\u2019d hit up a payphone by the fried chicken joint and then I\u2019d be calling Gus for one big favor.</p> <p>Before I could hit the pavement, I hit someone else.</p><p>I shrieked and leaped back. I\u2019d run right into Raul, who was raising his hands like he didn\u2019t mean me any harm though his eyes said otherwise. Pinched and vulture-like, he made my blood curdle.</p><p>\u201cRaul, you\u2019re back,\u201d Javier\u2019s voice came from behind me. Fuck he was fast, my eyes darting to the side of Raul, where freedom lay. I could still run. Raul wouldn\u2019t stop me if Javier wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI had to make sure Camden got away in good faith,\u201d he answered, his scars stretching as he talked.</p><p>And the mention of Camden\u2019s name filled my limbs with gravity.</p> <p>My jaw clenched. \u201cHow is Camden?\u201d I asked, taking the risk, the bait, the whatever.</p><p>Raul looked over my head at Javier, trading a look I couldn\u2019t read. \u201cOh, he\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I was about to get him to elaborate when Javier spoke. \u201cFine for now.\u201d His words were laced with grease.</p><p>I turned to face him. That smug son-of-a-bitch look was back on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, fine for now?\u201d</p><p>Raul walked over to Javier and stood beside him. There was a difference in him now, something that wasn\u2019t there six years ago. Raul had become Javier and Javier had become Travis.</p> <p>Javier smiled diplomatically. \u201cWell, you do know our score hasn\u2019t been settled, Ellie. That\u2019s why I gave you the chance to redeem yourself.\u201d</p><p>My head jerked back. \u201cScore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stole money of mine. I never saw that money again. In fact, I paid a lot to bring you here. You\u2019ve put me about a hundred grand in the hole.\u201d</p><p>My skin was starting to prickle in hot flashes. \u201cI don\u2019t have a hundred grand. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have some money, I saw you in Vegas, pretending to gamble. Lucky for you, I don\u2019t need your money. It\u2019s the principle of the whole thing. You may not feel loyal to me anymore but you should at least feel like you owe me something. Don\u2019t you have some kind of code, or are you just that immoral now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking pathetic human being,\u201d I jeered, surprised I was even able to form words when my blood was pumping outrage. How dare he insinuate that I was the one with the skewed morals when he was a cold-blooded killer and womanizing, drugging, manhandling bastard.</p><p>He tilted his head and eyed me with fake disappointment like I was a disobedient child. Or maybe it was real and if it was, that was much more fucked up. \u201cSuch an angry little angel. Your wings are certainly dirty. They\u2019re black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe heart you once wanted. What does that say about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says get to the point. You\u2019re obviously not letting me go. There\u2019s a catch to all of this and it involves Camden and a score. So tell me what the hell it is so I can decide how screwed I am.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how screwed you are, I only know how you liked to be screwed.\u201d</p><p>My upper lip wrinkled. \u201cSick pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is true,\u201d he said unapologetically. He clapped his hands together, his watch jangling. \u201cOkay, Ellie. You know what I want. I\u2019ve told you repeatedly. I need your help in getting to Travis. And you don\u2019t have to help me, as you now know. But you should understand that I want this bad enough to call in that little score we must settle. You can help me out of good faith. Yet you won\u2019t. Because a woman like you doesn\u2019t have anything good or anything that resembles faith.\u201d He drew out the word faith like it was foreign to him.</p><p>\u201cYou done trying to be an asshole or do you want to throw psychopath in there?\u201d</p><p>His features grew hard and I instantly regretted opening my mouth. There was nothing more troubling than Javier when he got serious.</p><p>\u201cSince you won\u2019t help me on your own good conscience,\u201d he said in a clipped voice, \u201cI\u2019m giving you a choice. Just like the one you had before, only, more ... detailed. You help me with Travis and in return I\u2019ll settle your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Did I mention Camden McQueen is part of your debt now?\u201d</p><p>My heart came to a sudden stop, crashing into my chest, shards of glass in my veins.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He smiled though it was cold as a gravestone in winter. \u201cI gave Camden money for you. That\u2019s more money I lost. Because of you. And based on that, I see that Camden\u2019s well-being is part of your debt now. Not his ex-wife\u2019s, not his son\u2019s ... I can\u2019t be bothered with them. Camden, now, I could destroy him with the snap of my fingers. That is, if you don\u2019t help me. So ... what shall it be? Your pride and freedom? Or the chance to save not only a man you think you love, or at least took pity on, but the chance to kill the man who put those scars on your leg and in your heart.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re the one who left the scars on my heart, I thought to myself. I felt like I was swallowing down a cotton ball. I could barely look at him. \u201cYou promised me you wouldn\u2019t hurt Camden, that you would let him go. And you don\u2019t break your promises.\u201d</p><p>He exchanged a satisfied look with Raul before smiling at me. \u201cThis is true. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve become such a threat to Travis. Because I have my own code that never wavers. Integrity is missing from too many men these days.\u201d He noted my face grow red with anger and went on quickly, \u201cI gave Camden the money. I gave him his wonderful family back. That was what I promised and I did just that. This, Ellie, this is a whole new game with a whole new set of promises. Now, what I need to know is, are you ready to play?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready to play anything, but if I could protect Camden, then I was going to do everything I could.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>God bless apathetic teenagers. If it wasn\u2019t for the bleached blonde girl who was busy doing her nails a sick shade of green as I paid for my gas and a mound of energy drinks, I wouldn\u2019t have made it to Gus\u2019s. I\u2019d probably have been arrested, my ass thrown in jail for who the fuck knows what anymore.</p><p>The dry and perpetually unamused girl barely glanced at me and certainly never picked up the Los Angeles Times that day. If she had, she would have noticed that yours truly was on the cover. Not a big picture \u2013 that was reserved for a report on the country\u2019s economics around Christmas time \u2013 but I was there, in the corner, right under the headline \u2018Los Angeles Brothers Shot Trying to Stop Domestic Dispute.\u2019</p><p>I so called it.</p><p>After I left the scene of the ambush \u2013 Sophia\u2019s set-up \u2013 I sped up the I-5 until I\u2019d reached the town of Valencia. I finally checked into a motel under Connor Malloy and started planning my next steps.</p><p>They all involved Gus.</p><p>I brought out the number that Ellie had given me and let it ring a few times before hanging up in fear. What if Gus wanted nothing to do with me without Ellie? What if he wasn\u2019t as trustworthy as Ellie had seemed to think? I barely knew a thing about the guy except that he was an ex-LAPD officer, the same police department that was probably combing Sophia\u2019s apartment for clues. I was glad that I never brought anything into her house except a case of contacts and solution. Everything else had stayed in the car, including the briefcase.</p><p>Gus would have to be worth the risk. I\u2019d have to trust Ellie, even from afar. He was the only way I could find her, somehow I knew this.</p><p>I dialed his number again and this time he picked up gruffly, with a slight accent that I couldn\u2019t place. Maybe Texas or the deep South. It wasn\u2019t obvious but lately I\u2019d been paying more attention to these types of things.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cIs this Gus? Ellie\u2019s Gus?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. Then, \u201cIs this Connor Malloy?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cNot quite. I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to assume from the tone of your voice and the fact that Ellie\u2019s not on the phone, that something\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>My smile faded. I clutched the receiver hard and sat up straighter on the motel bed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn her power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ... that I don\u2019t know.\u201d I explained, as briefly as I could, what had happened. I left out the part about Sophia and her brothers. That could wait, or so I thought. Besides, I was still too angry and exposed over it. To talk about it, dwell about it, would rub the wound raw.</p><p>Gus seemed concerned but fairly calm about the whole thing. I liked that he didn\u2019t lose his shit over it though at the same time I hoped Ellie was as important to him as I hoped she was.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVentura,\u201d I lied, picking the closest town that could still have the same area code.</p><p>He grunted then told me his address: 141 Rosewood Drive, Pismo Beach. It sounded too pretty.</p><p>\u201cMeet me tomorrow at noon,\u201d he said, then hung up.</p><p>It was only luck that got me there at noon. After I saw my face in the paper, the same paper I managed to swipe on my way out without the teenager noticing, I kept my face down and my driving calm as I worked my way up the coast. The ocean was glittering like blue scales, the cliff sides were lush with December rains. It was so gorgeously beautiful here in contrast to my life in the desert that my heart thumped for Gualala, for me and Ellie on the beach there, living in the freedom that only the surf can bring.</p><p>I stopped at one empty lookout spot on my way up and got a better look at the newspaper. There were a few things that were wrong about it which might have saved my ass without me knowing it.</p><p>In the statement, Sophia had told the cops about us getting back together in Palm Valley and wanting to start a new life before I turned on her and beat her up. I was in the process of stealing her money, \u201cchild support\u201d she was saving, when she called for her brothers to help. One of the brothers was in serious condition in the hospital with a broken larynx (and nose, I was sure, since I busted that fucker up), while the other escaped unscathed. Sophia told the police that I was driving a green ford Mustang but she had no idea what the plate number was. In fact, I was driving an olive green Pontiac GTO with racing stripes. Not at all like a Mustang, not to most people anyway. I was more than grateful for her lack of interest in cars.</p><p>The next thing that saved me thus far was the fact that the picture of me was one of hers. It was from a few years ago, taken at a friend\u2019s picnic. My hair was surfer shaggy and dark brown, no glasses. At that I quickly took my contacts out, flicking them out the GTO\u2019s window and slipped my glasses back on. This wasn\u2019t a Clark Kent thing. The fact that the article stated I had black hair now and I was covered in tattoos was enough to bust me. Most people would be looking at that picture of me, smiling, dimples, younger, so maybe they wouldn\u2019t notice. They\u2019d be looking for him, not clean-cut nerd, not until they got really close and hopefully by then I\u2019d be gone and it would be a case of them shaking their heads in my wake saying, \u201cnah, it couldn\u2019t be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, other than those two little glints of luck, I was screwed. My name, Camden McQueen was out there, in the paper. And perhaps I was even on the news, being pumped into the minds of every citizen of this fair fucking country.</p><p>Camden McQueen. Wife-beater. Thief. The worst of the worst.</p><p>My mind reeled back to seeing Audrey the other day. She would have put two and two together really fast. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was calling the news now to tell them about her escape from Camden McQueen, the bad, bad man who tattooed asses and kidnapped wives and children.</p><p>As if on cue, my phone rang. I looked at the display and sucked in my breath. It wasn\u2019t Audrey. It was my father.</p> <p>He knew.</p><p>My father knew I was a wanted criminal. That could be the only reason he was calling.</p><p>I expected to feel ashamed or guilty or something along those lines. But for some sick and twisted reason, I felt defiant. Like I\u2019d actually committed it and I did it to prove a point. I secretly felt that way during the whole money laundering operation, like somehow I was sticking it to the jackass. Now, I wasn\u2019t just sticking it, I was driving in a stake like the biggest fuck you.</p><p>Too bad none of it was true.</p><p>Too bad I knew my father would not accept this without a fight. And that was something I couldn\u2019t even let myself think about, not at this stage.</p> <p>So, obviously I didn\u2019t answer it. I just watched it ring and ring and ring again. Then I put it on silent and continued cruising up the coast until the idyllic shores of Pismo Beach appeared.</p><p>Gus\u2019s house was a little ways from the beach, down a winding road that barely had room to fit one car. It was a lush and strangely idyllic area, as pretty as I thought it would be and not really fitting for the man I was about to meet.</p><p>His house was small, the size of a cottage, but well-kept. The garden in the front was overgrown but still tidy, like organized chaos. It was like he could bully the plants into behaving even though he probably weeded the place once a year. My rock garden was easy to maintain but it didn\u2019t have the same kind of beauty. I think I\u2019d been in the desert for too long.</p><p>I rapped on the door and could hear a shuffling on the other side. I knew he was peering through the peephole which was one step better than I thought he\u2019d do. After I\u2019d picked up the newspaper I was so damn certain that he\u2019d pull out of the whole deal. I think he thought I wanted Connor\u2019s social security numbers and that alone was aiding and abetting a known felon.</p><p>In fact, the longer I stood there on his steps, a young girl on a pink bike peddling cheerily past his slat-wood fence, the more I thought about what a mistake this was. This was an ex-cop. I was a fugitive. I was a lovesick idiot and a sitting duck.</p><p>Before I could change my mind and head back to the car, the door opened a crack and I got a glimpse of a wary eye, grey beard, heavy jowls.</p> <p>\u201cCamden McQueen?\u201d he sounded even gruffer in person.</p><p>What was the use in lying now?</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHello, Gus.\u201d</p><p>He grunted and then opened the door. \u201cYou better get in here before someone sees you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and walked in. The carpeting underfoot was worn but soft, the house smelled like a cabin. It was dark. The TV was playing in the background, a movie from the 1940\u2019s. I picked out Peter Lorre\u2019s voice though it wasn\u2019t Casablanca.</p><p>He shut the door behind him and set about locking the many deadbolts he had before finally sliding the chain across.</p><p>\u201cTough neighborhood?\u201d I asked. \u201cI saw a girl on a My Little Pony bike outside, she looked kind of nasty.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh. In fact he looked the opposite of amused. He leaned back against the door and folded his arms across his wide chest, his beer gut sticking out to infinity. His gaze leveled me.</p> <p>\u201cSomething tells me this isn\u2019t the time to be making jokes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if you realize it or not, but I\u2019m not here to be your friend. I\u2019m not here to give you advice. I\u2019m here to give you what you need because I made a promise to Ellie once and it seems by you being here she\u2019s calling in on that promise. I\u2019ll help you if you understand that I\u2019m not doing it to be nice. I\u2019m not doing it to be good. I\u2019ve got my own life that I\u2019ve sliced out for myself here and if I can avoid putting it through the burner, I will.\u201d</p><p>I was biting my own lip without knowing it. He was waiting for me to say something.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, Gus,\u201d was the best I could come up with. Talking to him was a bit like talking to my dad and though I\u2019d like to think Gus wouldn\u2019t suddenly slap me in the face or call me a faggot, there was always the chance that he would. He was unpredictable and completely detached and that combination was a bit frightening.</p><p>\u201cHow about you go sit down and tell me what the hell is going on,\u201d he said, gesturing to the couch.</p><p>I nodded, feeling more stupid by the minute and took a seat on his grey leather couch while he disappeared into his kitchen. I watched the movie on TV for a few seconds and recognized it as Arsenic and Old Lace with Cary Grant until Gus came back in the room with a beer. For himself.</p><p>He sat down on the recliner across from me and cracked the top of the can, chugging down half of it before slamming it on the coffee table in either annoyance or exuberance. Foam fell down the sides.</p><p>\u201cYou. Talk.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, calming breath and got into it again, rehashing the story, telling him everything I told him before.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about being wanted by the LAPD?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>And here it came. I eyed the window, expecting to see a squadron pull in right through his garden, squashing the gardenia.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t help me,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAnd I need you to help me. To help Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did you say you knew Ellie for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI went to high school with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she came back into my life two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d His eyes were steel as he drank the rest of his beer, slower this time.</p><p>\u201cAnd, well, she was trying to rob me. I was on to her. We struck a deal, I\u2019d ignore her attempt to steal from me if she\u2019d help me escape my old life. She agreed. We took the money and ran.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe laundered the money in the casinos,\u201d I went on. \u201cWe got caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the police?\u201d he asked, looking confused.</p><p>\u201cNo, by Javier,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do know who that is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m very aware of who that is. I just don\u2019t know why the cops are after you now.\u201d</p><p>With a pained sigh, I went into my side of things. The after story.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d I finished off, \u201cthat really has nothing to do with the problem at hand. Javier has Ellie and I don\u2019t know where or what he\u2019s doing to her.\u201d</p><p>I almost saw a smile on his face but it looked like it was sucked up by his beard.</p><p>\u201cIt has everything to do with the problem at hand if you\u2019re wanted by the police,\u201d he said like I was a moron. \u201cTrying to track down Ellie just got a little bit harder with your fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Fuck up, huh. You know, I was having a real hard time figuring out why the hell Ellie would send me to this guy. So far he was a steaming pile of dickshit. Still, I bit my lip purposely, to keep myself from blowing up and saying something I\u2019d regret. My old friend rage had been welcomed in the shootout yesterday, but not today. Today I needed to suck it up and behave and quit making things worse for myself.</p><p>\u201cSo will you help me track her?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cAnd why do you want to find her so bad?\u201d</p><p>I gave him an incredulous look. \u201cBecause she\u2019s in danger. If you know who Javier is, then you know he\u2019s a bad man. He shot her uncle in the head.\u201d</p><p>Gus shook his head. \u201cPoor Jim.\u201d And I realized that maybe he knew him too. I was about to apologize when Gus continued, \u201cShe is in danger of some kind, that is certain. The man she\u2019s with is not the man he was and the man he was ... well, let\u2019s just say he went from bad to worse. That still doesn\u2019t explain why you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy I care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be hightailing it to Canada. Get your fake numbers and go. You should be creating your new life, your escape, not heading after Ellie. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ...\u201d how did I even explain it.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you in love with her?\u201d</p><p>I guess that explained it.</p><p>I nodded. No hesitation. All cards on the table. \u201cYes, to both.\u201d I almost said some bullshit like \u201cWe\u2019re in love,\u201d but I couldn\u2019t even say if that was true. All I knew is what I felt. And that the woman that I loved, that I always loved, had sacrificed herself for me. There was no getting past that. She\u2019d embedded herself in my skin, like a tattoo I could never give myself.</p><p>\u201cWell that certainly makes things messy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked leaning back in the chair. The hostility on his face was replaced with pity. I wasn\u2019t sure which one I liked better.</p><p>\u201cLove is messy,\u201d I said. Another greeting card worthy sentiment.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a tattoo artist?\u201d he said, getting out of the chair and changing the subject. He went into the kitchen and came out again, this time with two beers. He handed me one, which I thanked with a nod. I fucking needed this.</p><p>I took a long swig before I answered. \u201cI am. I used to work at a shop in LA before I opened up Sins &amp; Needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe front,\u201d he filled in.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cBut I did actual work there. I had steady clientele. It really was enough to live on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why bother with money laundering?\u201d</p><p>My mouth flapped open and closed. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice. I get the feeling that you don\u2019t know how to say no.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I said no when I stole the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look where that got you. The best way to say no is before you start. Say no now, not later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise words,\u201d I muttered, gulping more of the beer down. \u201cYou having second thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t agreed to anything, now have I? I\u2019m just hearing you out.\u201d</p><p>This was getting ridiculous. All this talk and he still wasn\u2019t sold.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m wasting my time then,\u201d I said, standing up. I felt better standing. I was a tall guy and I liked to remind people of that. If they couldn\u2019t take me and my tattoos seriously then they at least took my height and muscle.</p><p>I started for the door. \u201cI just thought maybe you cared about Ellie since she seemed to care about you ... that you cared whether an innocent woman lived or died.\u201d</p><p>And at that, he laughed. Maybe I was being a little bit dramatic but it seemed the only way I could get his attention.</p><p>\u201cInnocent?\u201d he sputtered out. \u201cFirst of all, we both know that Ellie Watt is the furthest thing from innocent.\u201d</p><p>The funny thing was, although that was technically true, that Ellie thieved and lied and charmed her way through life, I still saw an innocence in her. When I tattooed her, I saw it all over her leg and swimming in her eyes. For all she\u2019d done, for the heartless, cruel, selfish person she could be, there was an innocence deep inside \u2013 there was still a ten-year old girl who\u2019d lost everything, who never learned to love without repercussions, who never let her real self be free. That was the Ellie I had seen all through high school, the one who hid behind jeans and a tough attitude. The real her, the purity, was never allowed to come out. She had her soul on a very tight leash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd second of all?\u201d I prodded him.</p><p>\u201cSecond of all, you\u2019re insinuating that I don\u2019t care. Ellie and I never saw each other much over the last few years and I still looked on her like I would a daughter. A very badly behaving daughter that should be permanently grounded, but a daughter nonetheless. Whether I care or not should have nothing to do with whether I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the ceiling in exasperation. \u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I could take all the information you just gave me and go find her myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike it\u2019s that easy,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cIt is when you\u2019ve got connections, firearms, and an idea of where she\u2019s going. Of course, you\u2019re still ignoring the big question here and it\u2019s the only reason why I\u2019m hesitant to involve you in any of this.\u201d</p><p>How the fuck did he just do that? He turned something that was my idea, my plan, and made it into his.</p><p>And I was biting like a fish on a hook.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big question then?\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed at his beard. \u201cDoes Ellie want to be found?\u201d</p><p>I thought maybe I was hearing it wrong because that didn\u2019t sound like an actual question. Gus noted the look on my face because he said, \u201cYou see. You didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she wants to be found. She went off with a psychopath, a dangerous uncle killer. She did it to save me and my family. She had to.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, seemingly to himself. \u201cShe probably did have to, you\u2019re right. But that psychopath is also her ex-boyfriend. Ex-love of her life. The man, the catalyst, that made her the person she is today. You should have known the twenty-year-old Ellie. She was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the fourteen-year-old Ellie. She was already damaged.\u201d I was spitting out the words like shrapnel, appalled by what Gus was suggesting. It created an empty space beneath my ribs that kept threatening to break open. \u201cEllie hated Javier with a passion. Feared him.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened. \u201cShe always feared him, from day one, and that never did her any good. And hate, well we all know love and hate. Hate is the other side of the coin. It takes one good toss to get it facing down. It can happen quicker and easier than you would think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you talking Stockholm Syndrome now?\u201d That I could understand a little better. What he was suggesting was beyond my realm of comprehension.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIn a way. It\u2019s just, with someone like Ellie, it\u2019ll be really hard for her not to fall back into old habits. Javier was her biggest habit of all.\u201d</p><p>The hole was opening, my heart threatening to sink in. I dug my fingernails into the palms of my hands and wished they were sharper.</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cIt would be Stockholm syndrome on steroids.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly, somehow, in some sick fucking twisted way, that scenario was a million times worse than the one I had envisioned. I thought the worst thing that could have happened would be Javier killing Ellie. Now I knew, I saw, it could get much, much worse.</p><p>She could fall back in love with him. He could seduce her and set that soul free.</p><p>And, in the end, still leave her dead.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>ELLIE</p><p>Pain saturated my dreams. When I woke up the next morning, lying there stiff in our old bed, I realized I really bungled up my ankle when I jumped off the balcony. Looking back, it was a stupid move, leaping away like I was in an action movie. Granted, I was trying to escape a drug lord\u2019s henchman, so desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p>After Javier blackmailed me into agreeing to help him, I went straight to the room and didn\u2019t come out even when he knocked on the door and told me dinner was ready, like we were roommates or some shit. I was this close to opening the door and breaking his perfect teeth, but it seemed the angrier I acted toward him, the more he liked it. He was delusional enough to equate hatred with passion and I\u2019d seen the way he\u2019d been appraising me, like some cocky player who assumes every woman is in love with him.</p><p>The thing was, I had been in love with him once. I\u2019d been more than in love with him \u2013 it bordered on something between love and obsession, between Romeo and Juliet teenage dramatics and something real. But, it never was real. Over the years, I had convinced myself of that. I had to. It was the only way I could make sense of what he had done and what I needed to do to get over it. What Javier and I shared was a deadly cocktail of intense hormones and lies. True love doesn\u2019t have a sick desperation to it, an undercurrent of doom. People who burn that brightly still get burnt in the end and I\u2019m sure if it hadn\u2019t been for him cheating on me, it would have ended some other way. The whole relationship had been based on deceit and it was only a matter of time before it would have caught up with me.</p><p>Now, of course, Javier knew the lie. I hoped it ripped his heart out just a little bit when he found out that all that time Eden White wasn\u2019t who he thought she was. Probably not, though. He was different now, bolder and more exaggerated, all of his flaws magnified and his good side gone. He wouldn\u2019t know the meaning of sentiment, though I had a feeling that it at least ate at his sense of pride, something he had too much of anyway.</p><p>I knew I shouldn\u2019t have been lying there thinking about him and the past and the ways things had changed. Giving him all that thought was giving him too much credit. It was a hard thing not to do when you were stuck in his house, the house you shared together. It gave a sense of comfort and familiarity that was all an illusion. If this was six years ago, I could figure out what to do next and how to get out of it. I could escape once again and go find Camden. I would find a way to keep him safe, even if it meant having to watch him start a new life with his family.</p><p>The very thought of him and Sophia brought a heavy knot into my stomach. That was another thing I was trying to keep on the back burner, the fact that he was with his family. It shouldn\u2019t have made me feel so ... desolate ... but it did. And it was partially my fault. I mean, I know I did the right thing, maybe the first right thing I ever did in my life. And yet, it didn\u2019t feel right or good. It only made me feel a bit resigned that we\u2019d even gotten in that position in the first place. If I could go back in time and change things, I would have split with Camden as soon as we left Vegas. I would have sent him up to Gualala on his own and gotten out of there before I fell in love with him. And, since we\u2019re talking about a fictional time machine here, I would have saved Uncle Jim in the process.</p><p>The knot in my gut started to twist and bleed, a whole new, less-selfish set of feelings cutting through. Uncle Jim, whose face I still saw in my sleep, the man who\u2019d been so much to me yet was willing to sell me out for a bit of cash. I still didn\u2019t know how to deal with his death, feeling so much anger for what he tried to do to and so much fucking shame that he died on account of me.</p><p>And that\u2019s what made things that much more confusing and hard to figure out, like puzzle pieces that never belonged together. The Javier of six years ago would have never killed my dear uncle, no matter how badly he hurt me. That Javier wouldn\u2019t have kidnapped a mother and her child and smacked her around (or even hired his thugs to do it). That Javier, for all his smooth intensity and seemingly blind devotion (seemingly, being the key word), wouldn\u2019t bribe me to help him kill someone. That Javier was the one I knew and the only one I could try and figure out. This Javier was a stranger and a dangerous one at that. I had no sense of affection in his eyes, no hint of remorse or respect in his movements. As much as I pretended I wasn\u2019t, I was afraid of this Javier in a way I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on.</p><p>I\u2019d fallen asleep with my clothes on, Javier, Camden and Uncle Jim on my mind, so when I finally woke up with my buggered ankle, I decided I\u2019d had enough of submitting to my thoughts. I carefully got out of bed and decided a shower would be a good idea after being dusty and dirty for the last three days. Soap and water had a way of clearing my head unlike anything else (except maybe some well-done sex). When I was finished, I searched under the sink for an Ace bandage and found one, making sure my ankle was wrapped well. It probably wasn\u2019t even as bad as a sprain, but I had to make sure that I wasn\u2019t going to make it worse.</p><p>After the shower I contemplated putting back on my jeans and stained t-shirt when a morbid thought crossed my mind. I wrapped the towel around tightly lest Javier suddenly burst inside the bedroom and went to the closet I used to use. When I left Javier that one morning, I barely took anything of mine.</p><p>I opened up the door and sucked in my breath. All my clothes were still there. Jeans, palazzo pants, tissue thin tank tops, maxi dresses and skirts that reached the floor. A year\u2019s worth of wardrobe belonging to a scar-shy twenty year old. I couldn\u2019t believe they were still there, that he\u2019d saved my clothes all this time. I thought he would have burned them in a beach bonfire the moment he discovered I\u2019d left him without a trace (and stolen his favorite car and a bunch of his money). Maybe he was more sentimental than I gave him credit for.</p><p>Or maybe, dangerously obsessed. I couldn\u2019t rule out that one either, considering where I was and how I got there.</p><p>I took in a deep breath through my nose and shook out the edginess. It didn\u2019t matter what the answer was because there was no use in figuring him out. For whatever reason, my old clothes were here and they were clean and that\u2019s exactly what I needed to feel even remotely human.</p><p>I quickly pulled out a pair of jeans, super soft from years of wear, and tried to shimmy them on. Well, as clean and comfortable as they were, they barely fit over my thighs. I was a thin girl but my legs and ass were always on the gratuitous side and I guess my twenty-year-old body had been a lot more waif-like than I had thought. I was sure it would have bothered any other girl to know she\u2019d gained weight, but since meeting Camden, I\u2019d refused to feel bad about my body anymore. He had loved it, my curves, my scars, the way I was now and that wasn\u2019t something to toss away, especially when his safety wasn\u2019t as concrete as I had originally thought.</p><p>I mulled that over, wondering how it was that Javier could get to Camden at any moment \u2013 was he being bugged, monitored? Did he have a person on the inside? Was it Sophia? I remembered the way she eyed the briefcase like it held every wish she ever had. Then I pushed those thoughts out of the way, deciding I\u2019d soon get it out of Javier instead, and selected a pair of wide-legged pants, a tight spaghetti strap top and a cropped cardigan with three-quarter-length sleeves. Just long enough to hide the tattoo on my arm, the tattoo that Javier had kept staring at like it still meant something.</p><p>I smoothed back my hair, black as ink when it was still wet, and didn\u2019t bother with the makeup I had in my purse. I had no one to impress, not this time. I opened the door and was immediately met with the rich smells of frying bacon and brewing coffee. My stomach growled on impact, turning over on itself, reminding me that I hadn\u2019t eaten a thing so far.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Javier said from the table, looking like a carbon copy of yesterday. Once again, he was dressed in a suit, albeit this one was sand-colored and had a plain white tee instead of a dress shirt. He was also reading the Los Angeles Times again and shaking his head in amusement at whatever was on the page. \u201cGreen mustang? Oh, that hurts my soul.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes flew over to the stove where the bacon was done frying, only a few pops and sizzles accompanying the smell.</p><p>He waved his hand in that direction, eyes still glued to the paper. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you were still on a hunger strike, but I made enough. There\u2019s toast as well, one hundred percent whole-grain. It\u2019s supposed to be good for you.\u201d He said this all absently, like he wasn\u2019t secretly hoping I\u2019d eat it. Fuck my own spite this time, hunger was winning out.</p><p>I picked up a plate he had left out and started scooping up all the rest of the bacon and eggs, deciding to commit to it. I pressed the pieces of bread into the toaster and attacked the pot of coffee next.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s milk and cream in the fridge,\u201d he said and I could feel him watching me now.</p> <p>I shrugged and filled my cup, turning around and leaning against the counter. \u201cI take it black now.\u201d</p><p>He eyed my pants. \u201cYou found your old clothes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and took a sip. It was so strong it was almost poisonous, yet it was exactly what I needed. \u201cI did. Are you going to start an Ellie museum or something?\u201d</p><p>I thought that would get a reaction out of him. No such luck. \u201cGlad you\u2019re looking a little more ... elegant for our expedition today.\u201d</p><p>My body jerked. \u201cExpedition?\u201d I couldn\u2019t be meeting Travis, I wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t ready and there was no plan. The thought of seeing him after all these years, never mind the fact that I was supposed to help kill him \u2013 an idea that, despite everything, left my heart feeling numb \u2013 nearly brought me to my knees.</p> <p>He raised his brows, still so very expressive. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my angel, we\u2019re just scoping things out, as you say. I would not throw you in the pool without a noodle.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at that phrase, ignoring the tiny twang in my brain that reminded me of how charming I used to find his lapses in the English language, and said, \u201cSo what is the plan then? Where\u2019s my ... noodle?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, too wide for his damn face. \u201cYou made a joke? You must be liking it here then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself and get to the point.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his chin in one smooth sweep. \u201cAh. We\u2019re going to take a look at some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is all.\u201d</p><p>At that, the toast in the toaster popped with a loud bang and I nearly jumped out of my skin. Unfortunately, Javier noticed this.</p><p>\u201cYou seem nervous,\u201d he commented. And to make matters worse, he got out of his chair and took a step toward me. I flattened up against the counter wondering if a coffee pot to the head would be my way out of this. Then he stopped a few feet back, close enough for me to smell his earthy cologne, close enough to grab me if he wanted to, but not close enough to be doing anything wrong. He was good at that, skirting the line between coincidence and intent.</p><p>I looked at the toast, sitting just out of reach. To get it I\u2019d have to turn around and I didn\u2019t want my back to him. I could almost imagine his breath at my neck and that wasn\u2019t a good thing.</p><p>He smiled softly, following my eyes, then leaned over and plucked the toast out of the toaster, dropping it on my plate. He almost handed the plate to me and then stopped.</p><p>\u201cWould you like honey with that?\u201d he said, his eyes blazing into me like the aforementioned sweet.</p><p>I managed to shake my head, aware that I wasn\u2019t really breathing. Just go, please, I thought, a strange kind of desperation running through me, that fear I couldn\u2019t place.</p><p>Ever observant, he picked up on this.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d he said, voice low and smooth and far too familiar to my liking. \u201cAre you afraid, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>I could pretend I wasn\u2019t. But Javier liked to make people feel the emotions he thought they should be feeling. In layman\u2019s terms, if I lied, he\u2019d make me afraid.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I said, averting my eyes. I didn\u2019t want to see his reaction, not the real one deep inside where his soul used to be.</p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, keeping my attention focused on the fridge, the clean chrome, the lack of magnets and calendars and take-out menus. The things that used to be there. Life.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you afraid of me, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>If I told him the truth, that I really didn\u2019t know, he\u2019d make it into something it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d</p><p>His head twitched in surprise. \u201cIs that really what you think?\u2019</p><p>I honestly didn\u2019t know, not anymore. I knew he\u2019d keep me around for as long as he needed me but I had no idea what it all meant when this was over. He hadn\u2019t promised me my life yet.</p><p>\u201cOther than the fact that you\u2019re an asshole, yes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to get it. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was for your so-called morals. Your score?\u201d I noticed that the plate in his hand was shaking ever so slightly. Something was happening.</p><p>Then it was gone. He swallowed hard. \u201cI guess it\u2019s that then. Either way, I\u2019m not hurting you.\u201d</p><p>No, I thought, just Camden and me if I don\u2019t do what you say.</p><p>\u201cYou did in the car,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou grabbed my wrist ...\u201d</p><p>He was truly puzzled. I was starting to feel like an idiot for having no control of my mouth. So much for being tough as nails.</p><p>\u201cThen I am sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you were so delicate. I knew that Eden wouldn\u2019t mind that sort of thing. I could bite her hard enough to draw blood and she liked it.\u201d</p><p>He was standing too close to me to be saying those words. I took the plate out of his hand finally, for some action to take, to ignore what he was saying and the visual I had of the two of us, younger and in throws of uninhibited passion.</p><p>\u201cThat was different,\u201d I managed to say when I found my voice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the same person back then.\u201d</p><p>Javier nodded, his eyes fastened to every inch of my face. \u201cNeither was I. One must wonder if we changed for the better, hmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we barely crawled out of a burning wreckage alive.\u201d</p><p>His brows knit together delicately. \u201cI\u2019d say we evolved. We grew stronger.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a hard look. \u201cWe ruined each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see it one way, I see it another. It was good for something. Once upon a time I thought it was good for everything.\u201d</p><p>Me too, I thought, then buried it.</p><p>He watched me for a few moments, wheels turning behind those hawk eyes. It used to kill me never knowing what he was thinking. Now, I didn\u2019t want to know. Our exchange had got a little too close for comfort.</p><p>I still couldn\u2019t rule out the fact that he would never hurt me. Fool me once and all that jazz.</p><p>When he was satisfied with his observations, his attention darted over to my plate. \u201cYour bacon is getting cold.\u201d</p><p>So it was. And then he left, turning sharply away from me and snapping up the newspaper from the table. He rolled it up as if he was going to punish a bad dog and walked swiftly to the staircase. I had to wonder where he was sleeping, perhaps in the spare bedroom downstairs. Perhaps I was alone here at night.</p><p>\u201cWhen is the expedition?\u201d I called out after him.</p><p>He paused and looked like he was going to say something smart-assey when his cell phone rang, a sci-fi type ringtone. He frowned and fished it out.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he said, clearly annoyed already by whoever was calling. He listened and as I moved over to the table with my plate, I watched his face contort in absolute rage, a look that, for all his short-temperedness, I very rarely saw on him. It made me sit down and shut up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean they\u2019re gone?\u201d he practically screamed into the phone. \u201cDid they see her?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he was looking at me and switched to Spanish, lowering his voice as if it took all the effort in the world. It probably did.</p><p>Now, Eden White never knew Spanish and Ellie Watt was still pretty rusty at it but she knew some. I couldn\u2019t make out everything he said and I was probably wrong on what I was interpreting anyway, but what I could gather was that it involved me. Or some other woman but I was going to assume it was about me. It was a problem that I was here or someone knew I was here. Not a he, but a group of people it seemed. Of course, that could be more my paranoia talking than my grasp of Spanish.</p><p>Suddenly Javier jabbed at his phone and slipped it in his jacket pocket. Javier\u2019s back was to me, which was somehow more frightening because he could be turning into a drug cartel Hulk and I wouldn\u2019t know it until he turned around.</p><p>He sighed, loudly, gazing up at the ceiling, his fingers clenching and unclenching. Part of me was happy to see him so pissed off, that things weren\u2019t going his way, the other part was scared. Because he could take it out on me. Because things might have just gotten worse.</p><p>I waited there at the table, afraid to eat, afraid to move, afraid to breathe.</p><p>Finally he turned around, his skin dark red at the temples but otherwise looked calm. He gave me a smile that read false. \u201cChange of plans.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brow and remained silent.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Mexico.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>She was in my dreams again, Ellie. Only this time, the fire that consumed us came from within. I was in a black, cavernous room with no walls, no windows, and a floor made of ebony satin. She was lying at my feet, naked and curled up, sleeping.</p><p>Her eyes opened and she saw me. She smiled. I could barely bring my eyes away from her body. She was curved in all the right places, places that felt like home to me, like the area underneath her ass where it melted into her thighs, or where her full breasts swooped up into her soft arms. Her nipple ring sparkled, diamonds now, and I felt myself grow instantly hard, wanting nothing more than to tug at it with my teeth. She groaned with so much pleasure when I had done it before. I\u2019d give anything to hear that sound, even if it wasn\u2019t real.</p><p>She turned over onto her back, her breasts inviting me for a taste. Beckoning me with her finger, her sly look almost undid me. I was naked as well, my erection impressive. I\u2019d heard that I was a \u201cbig boy\u201d from many women and looming over Ellie like this, seeing the raw hunger in her eyes, the anticipation, I couldn\u2019t have been more grateful. I was petty, even in my dreams.</p><p>I dropped down to my knees and crawled over her, pinning her body between my limbs, the contrast of the dark hair of my legs to the milky white of hers, the cherry blossoms more delicate and vibrant than ever. I brushed my cock against the fine hair of her pubic bone, pressing it up against her belly, a heavy weight between us. Her breath quickened, mine deepened. I wanted nothing more than to thrust it inside of her, feel her warmth, her wetness, her tight grip that felt better than heaven.</p><p>I reached under her back and with a deft move, flipped her over and pulled her up so she was on all fours, back arched, ass widening beneath me. She wiggled it, just slightly, and the sight nearly made me come. I was a hair trigger.</p><p>I licked my fingers, then trailed them down the slit of her ass, feeling her pucker before dipping them down into the lake of her cleft. She was so fucking wet, so wet for me. I drew the moisture up and swirled my finger into her, one then two. I hadn\u2019t known Ellie long enough in an intimate way to know if she was into anything anal. But it was a dream and I didn\u2019t care. I\u2019d have my way with her and she\u2019d love it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My breath hitched and she let out little fluttery moans that made my balls tighten. I slowly edged myself into her, feeling the heat and the impossible tightness, the taboo, the dirtiness. The wonderful, mouth-gaping dirtiness. We both cried out as I thrust in deep, my cock being squeezed until I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore.</p><p>Then something changed. A wave of cold came out from the darkness and along with it, the shadowy silhouette of a man. There was only shape to him and thick substance, like a figure had been sculpted out of black tar and clay. The chill he brought made me stop dead, my fingers resting softly on the cheeks of her ass.</p><p>The man came closer and still he had no features. Ellie\u2019s head was up and watching him, like a playful cat, while I remained lodged inside her. He stopped right in front of her face and she reached for him with one hand, taking his black erect appendage into her mouth and crying out with pleasure.</p><p>I shut my eyes tight, willing myself to be the one she was sucking off. My dreams could be somewhat lucid when I wanted them to.</p> <p>When I opened them, it had worked. My cock was in Ellie\u2019s mouth, her tongue running and up and down the underside. But now, the black shape was where I had been, pounding her hard from behind. I watched, unable to stop Ellie from sucking me off, not wanting the pleasure to end, while watching the blackness as it spread over her. I came loudly, spurting into her mouth, which she swallowed happily. Then she came, the pounding coming to a climax.</p><p>The man of black matter smiled. A flash of white teeth against the abyss.</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>I woke up on Gus\u2019s couch in the middle of the night, my dick in my hands, pumping myself until I was coming all over my stomach with sticky bursts. I bit my lip to keep from crying out, from waking up Gus, and once the sensation faded, I noticed with embarrassment that I\u2019d pulled my shirt up in my sleep, avoiding a mess.</p> <p>I lay back, breathing hard, staring up at the ceiling. As far as sex dreams went, that one took the cake. I didn\u2019t feel a sense of relief and peace as I normally did after climaxing. I felt empty. I felt dirty \u2013 and not the good kind of dirty.</p><p>I wiped up the mess with a few tissues and threw them in the trash. The door to his room was closed and I could hear him snoring loudly. There was no way I\u2019d be going back to sleep now, even though the microwave clock said it was 4AM. The dream had thrilled then scared me and I didn\u2019t want to give it thought, to give it power, to think what it had meant. I had to find Ellie first, then I\u2019d deal with my subconscious.</p><p>Yesterday, after Gus had put it in my head that Ellie could be suffering from \u201cStockholm syndrome on steroids\u201d, I could tell he was half-expecting me to pull out. To give up, to let Gus carry on the plan. It was probably what he wanted anyway, better off him than some bumbling puppy who was wanted by the police.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t. I was invested, as deep as I could be and as emotionally connected to Ellie than I\u2019d ever been to anyone. In some ways, even Ben. I didn\u2019t quite know why but that was the thing about love sometimes. It gave you few reasons and the rest was out of your hands.</p><p>Last night, I had told Gus that I was going to find her no matter what. If he wanted to help, then great. But if he didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t stop me. Now that I knew exactly what was at stake \u2013 Ellie\u2019s life, Ellie\u2019s heart \u2013 I was all in.</p><p>\u201cEven if Ellie doesn\u2019t want to leave and Javier dies by my own bloody hands, I\u2019m in it to the end,\u201d I had said.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because my veins were bulging out of my forehead or that I felt like a thousand suns were burning through my body and out of my eyes, but Gus finally nodded and said \u201calright.\u201d He would help me get Ellie back.</p><p>To be honest, I think the idea of killing Javier put a little motivation in him, like a drop of blood in a shark tank. It wasn\u2019t something I was banking on but I was prepared to do it. To know that Gus would be there to back me up helped, and also it made me realize the lengths I was prepared to go to save her, even on my own. It made me realize that in saving her, I might lose myself, lose any morals or convictions I once had. Camden McQueen might end up a stranger to even me when it was all said and done.</p><p>And I was going to have to be okay with that.</p><p>In fact, from the way I watched Gus go through his collection of firearms and give me the lowdown on each one, the tiny visceral thrill that shot through me, I was probably going to be more than okay with that. I was probably going to welcome it with open arms.</p><p>I never did end up falling back asleep, the memory of the dream and the real memory of Ellie clashing violently with each other. I did what I could to hold it all together, the same way I\u2019d been doing it for the last few days, ever since she left with him. When I\u2019d feel rage creeping on up, saturating my limbs from the inside out, I mentally quarantined the feeling. I imagined taking the anger, the panic, the injustice, and funneled it into a compartment in my head. I took it out of my heart and my lungs and the muscles that wanted to curl my hands into fists and have me explode. It was the only way I was able to think clearly, to do what needed to be done.</p><p>Each minute I spent with Gus I realized I needed to become more like him, cool and distant. Somehow it worked for him and as time went on, it began to work for me. I even applied it to Sophia and Ben and my fucking father who wouldn\u2019t stop ringing me until Gus destroyed my cell with a quick stomp of his boot. I filed it away, until I felt smooth and snag-free inside, like a machine.</p><p>Our plan, according to Gus was fairly straightforward and simple. We\u2019d head out to Mississippi where Ellie had lived as a girl and where she met Javier years later. We\u2019d poke around, he\u2019d ask a few of his contacts and hopefully find some sort of a trail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Javier Bernal still lives in the state,\u201d Gus had told me as he threw a duffel bag into the GTO. It landed in the trunk with a clatter and I knew it contained more than his clothes and toiletries. He was a bit wary about taking the car, even with the newspaper reporting it as a green Mustang but since his only vehicle was a beat-up caf\u00e9 racer motorbike, he didn\u2019t have much of a choice. I was relieved. As strange as it sounded, I could see why Ellie hung onto the car all those years. There was something very empowering about it, like it made you invincible. Maybe after that stunt on the Vegas highway I superstitiously believed in it.</p> <p>I was about to hop in the driver\u2019s seat when Gus waved me off with a gruff gesture of his hand. \u201cNope,\u201d he said, slipping on a pair of amber aviators. \u201cToo risky with you driving. You\u2019re sitting in the passenger seat, looking straight ahead, never to the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just lie down in the back then?\u201d I wasn\u2019t questioning his methods but his tone of voice didn\u2019t help.</p><p>He gave me the are-you-an-idiot look. \u201cIf someone notices it\u2019s only going to draw more suspicion. Look, as of right now, the photo circulating on the news is a far cry from what you look like. They\u2019re looking for a pretty boy with a dumbass smile, you look like a piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>This was going to be a fun ride. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Now get in before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>I almost wanted him to but I decided to suck it up and file my feelings toward Gus away too.</p><p>Once we\u2019d cleared the streets of Pismo Beach and were heading inland toward the I-5, I asked Gus what he knew about Javier.</p><p>He pursed his rough lips as if he wasn\u2019t sure I was worthy of the information. Then he talked.</p><p>\u201cAs I told you before, I hadn\u2019t kept in touch with Ellie too much over the years. We\u2019d talk on the phone around Christmas time \u2013 she was really good at calling \u2013 but other than that it was more that I would help her out when I could. Fake IDs, information on people, yadda yadda. During that time, she never once mentioned Javier. It was like the moment she left him, she erased his memory from her head. And she seemed to be doing fine. What is the point in bringing up the past anyway? So I never spoke a word about him, even though I was keeping tabs \u2013 mainly out of curiosity, mainly for her sake. No one just up and leaves a gang member, it doesn\u2019t happen. I was so sure he\u2019d come after her right away, but from what I could tell, he never did. He stayed put in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. And then he began to build his empire.\u201d</p><p>A chill laced my blood. Empire?</p><p>Gus went on. \u201cI\u2019d heard it through my grapevine that Travis and Javier were butting heads. He started getting friendlier with their rivals, Los Zetas in particular. That was unheard of, not to mention stupid for someone like him, but Travis Raines cared more about power than loyalties. He believed that their cartel could go grow stronger if they became allies instead of enemies and thought going back to Mexico would help. Never mind the explosion of violence in the country, the fighting, the tourists who were getting caught in the middle, the fact that it turned into one big shit show and it was getting international attention. Javier did not agree. Javier thought it was too dangerous, too chaotic, and that Travis would slowly lose control. He would rather die than make peace with his rivals. It came down to Javier staying behind and Travis booting him out. Javier siphoned a few key players of his, people who still had loyalty to a cause, instead of to Travis. I still don\u2019t know who\u2019d win in a fight, but Javier at least has charm to mask his brutality, something Travis doesn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>I winced at the word charm. I remembered meeting Javier for the first time, in that caf\u00e9 in Palm Valley. I wouldn\u2019t say he had charm but he definitely had something. Mystery, if I wanted to sound quixotic about it.</p><p>\u201cThere was an incident, of course,\u201d he continued. \u201cBefore Travis left, he\u2019d managed to get two of Javier\u2019s men killed. And once he made it to Mexico, he went one step further and hunted down one of Javier\u2019s sisters. Raped her, killed her, all that big stuff. This was about three years ago, mind you, though nothing really came of it. Javier still stayed in the US and began leaching from another cartel, trying to build his own power. That was his revenge, I suppose. Who knows, maybe Javier didn\u2019t give two shits about his sister. Nothing would surprise me with that guy.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat, watching the green hills whiz by. \u201cYou knew all this stuff, all this time and you never told Ellie.\u201d</p><p>He looked chagrined or maybe that was wishful thinking. \u201cIt didn\u2019t concern her. And by the time it did concern her ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you obviously knew he was coming after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d stopped paying attention about a year ago. I got dragged down into some money and health problems, I just didn\u2019t have the time. Javier seemed to be holding steady and at that point I figured he\u2019d never come looking for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich begs the question, why now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to find out. I doubt it was something as simple as hearing a love song on the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is as simple in that he\u2019s still in love with her.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, his eyes hazy behind the aviators. \u201cMen like Javier don\u2019t know what love is. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Ellie did know. And that\u2019s what concerned me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing that I thought was odd,\u201d Gus added. \u201cAbout a few months before I stopped keeping tabs on him, I\u2019d heard there was a couple that jumped ship \u2013 they\u2019d been working for Javier and then went to the other side. To Travis. Javier sent some men after them but who knows what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple?\u201d It didn\u2019t seem like the line of work that a husband and wife would get roped into, like opening up a bed and breakfast.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah. A couple. An older couple at that. White folks. Amanda and Bob Williams.\u201d</p> <p>There was something loaded in what he was saying but I wasn\u2019t getting it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I used to be friends, good friends, with Amelie and Brian Watt.\u201d</p><p>The light went off in my head. AW. BW. Same initials.</p><p>\u201cEllie\u2019s parents?\u201d I asked in disbelief. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Just a gut feeling. I hadn\u2019t talked to them since they up and left poor Ellie with her uncle. I wouldn\u2019t put it past them, I don\u2019t see the point of it all. Why go through all of that with their daughter only to go back to the man that did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they got into some trouble.\u201d It would have to be some major fucking trouble to go back to Travis or work for Javier. Was that a matter of Javier recruiting her parents, hoping he would get close to them or was it the other way around? No matter the reason, my damaged, beautiful girl was still getting screwed over, even without her knowing it.</p><p>The anger must have been showing on my face because Gus tapped the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cHey aggro, don\u2019t you go losing it on me. You said you were prepared to do whatever you could to get her back. Things are only going to get harder and more complicated from here on out.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in my breath and sat back in the seat, giving him a quick nod. We fell into silence punctuated by the staticky radio. I fell into my own head, facing my fears.</p> <p>I wondered what Ellie was doing right then and where she was. I wondered if she had any idea about her parents, if Javier would tell her and taunt her with it. I wondered just what the hell he wanted with her, a question that would drive me crazy until I knew. It couldn\u2019t be as simple as a love struck ex-lover, not when Gus had explained what had gone on over the years. Javier hadn\u2019t simply followed Ellie all that time, like she presumed. He went ahead and built up an \u201cempire.\u201d Was it a matter of the ex-boyfriend trying to make something of himself before attempting to win her back? In a way, I understood that. But I didn\u2019t want to understand him. I didn\u2019t want to think about how she got under my skin the same way she apparently got under his. I didn\u2019t want to find any similarities between us.</p><p>I could never turn into him.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>Later that day, we set off. I barely had time to pack, which was ironic since I actually had things to pack when I shouldn\u2019t have. Javier brought me a large carry-all bag for me to stuff my old clothes inside. It was creepy as hell, folding up my old stuff, knowing that we headed to another country like some couple on vacation.</p><p>\u201cI hope I don\u2019t need my real passport,\u201d I remarked as I hauled the bag out of the room. I had only one passport in my bag and it belonged to Eleanor Willis and I\u2019d never crossed a border with it before. Gus had made it for me, so I assumed it would hold up, but this wasn\u2019t the time to test it out. Getting busted with a drug cartel leader would be very, very bad for me. Almost as bad as not being busted.</p><p>Javier stood at the end of the hall, white pants, white shirt, looking like the devil in a snowbank. \u201cAngel, this is Mexico. And you\u2019re an American. They wouldn\u2019t even look at your ID. I, on the other hand ... well I\u2019m pretty sure it won\u2019t be so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re crossing the Rio Grande against the flow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s messy,\u201d he said. He took a step forward to take the bag from me, but I held on tightly and yanked it out of his reach. He glared ever so slightly, then turned on his heel and went down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be crossing over in style,\u201d he tossed over his shoulder and headed out the front door, held open by the burly man who I think was called Carl or Carrell. It was hard to tell with his accent sometimes.</p><p>I followed, the bag dragging behind me. Outside the air was bright and airy, like it wanted to fool me again with that whole vacation feeling. Palm trees and live oak waved in the breeze, a very picturesque scene that people never thought could happen in Mississippi. Even though my years in the state were full of emotional turmoil, there was a beauty here than most people overlooked. For me, the beauty had turned a shade deadly.</p><p>The SUV was roaring in the driveway with Javier climbing in the back seat. Oh joy, I was going to be trapped with him again. That peculiar kind of fear, the one that made me wince with disgust, came trickling down my neck. Or maybe that was sweat. The temperature was unseasonably hot.</p><p>Raul took the bag from me and tossed it in the trunk, then held the back door open like he was the perfect gentleman. I suppose I could have been thankful that it was Javier I had to sit with, not Raul, but a creep is a creep.</p><p>I hopped in, buckled my seatbelt lest Javier try and do it for me, and leaned against the armrest on the door. Every part of me was crammed up away from him. He wasn\u2019t trying to get close but the scene from the kitchen earlier was still fresh in my mind. I did not want to feel his breath on me ever again. The memories and the reality did not jive.</p><p>After we were driving for a few minutes and notably not taking the highway, I had to ask, \u201cIsn\u2019t Mexico in the other direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience, my angel,\u201d he said, his eyes glued to the front of the car, a small smile on his face.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have fucking patience, especially when he kept calling me that name but I had to remind myself the more I gave, the more he wanted. I bit down on my lip to keep quiet and brought my cardigan around me, for modesty\u2019s sake and to ward off the Arctic air-conditioning.</p><p>Ten minutes later we were pulling up to yet another familiar place. The marina where Javier used to keep his sailboat. Another disturbing trip down memory fucking lane.</p><p>I suppressed a shudder, knowing Javier was watching me like some science experiment. How much of our past can I torture her with? Am I breaking down her defenses? And other such thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou remember this place?\u201d he asked delicately.</p><p>I ignored him and spoke to the window as the SUV pulled into a loading zone lined with wheelbarrows. \u201cI don\u2019t have amnesia. Why the hell are we here?\u201d</p><p>He made a tsking sound, the type that made me look at him just to see how disappointed he looked. \u201cEllie, really.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at the marina. The panic started somewhere below my gut. He couldn\u2019t be serious. He wasn\u2019t that delusional was he?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to Mexico on your boat,\u201d I said, more of a statement than a question. Even if I was jumping the gun a bit, at least it was out there.</p><p>He gave me that sly smile again. \u201cWould that be a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened and closed like a fish, no words coming out. I knew that Javier probably had to lie low as we traveled across the country, but this seemed a bit extreme.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same boat, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. He opened his door and hopped out just as Raul opened mine.</p><p>Javier\u2019s old sailboat was a sleek, gorgeous thing that held far too many moments for us. It was big enough to sail anywhere, really, but that wasn\u2019t the point. I could barely handle being in the same vehicle as Javier, let alone a boat.</p><p>I guess I must have stood there shaking my head or something crazy like that, because Raul\u2019s cold fingers clamped around my forearm and yanked me forward.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I growled back, yanking my arm away from him.</p><p>Javier gave both of us an amused look as he walked off toward the docks. \u201cThis trip will be easier if the two of you learn to play nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I yelled after him. A family decked in nautical gear were unloading their car nearby and gave me an odd look. In fact they gave all of us an odd look and I couldn\u2019t blame them. Big bald driver was hauling our bags out of the back of the black SUV, while the devil in white led the way for one henchmen and the damsel in distress. I wondered if we appeared suspicious enough for them to report us. Technically we weren\u2019t doing anything illegal but if I had seen a similar scene, my radar would be going wild.</p><p>But, what would happen if I mouthed to the father, with his wary eyes and nervous twitch, to \u201chelp me.\u201d What would he do? And would he really help? What would I even say? Could I get away and still ensure that Camden would go untouched? Or was my freedom always going to be joined to him in that fate?</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. I was used to being the one trying to get away, not the one wanting to be caught. I just walked toward the docks, feeling like oxygen was slowly being leached from me, that the further we got away from solid ground, the less chance I had. For life, for liberty, for love, maybe for everything. My situation kept changing from day to day, moment to moment, and I wasn\u2019t quick enough to keep up.</p><p>Just when I thought my legs were turning to jelly, we stopped on the furthest dock in front of what I first thought were a bunch of sailboats all tied together in a row. I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cThis is my new masterpiece,\u201d Javier said with a too-wide smile, his arms spread wide, as if he built the boat himself.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t kidding when he said it wasn\u2019t the same boat. I didn\u2019t even think you could call it a boat, it was more like a floating apartment complex, a hotel on the sea, a mothership. This boat, this yacht, this monster had to be almost 200-feet long and one of the largest things I had ever seen. It had two masts that seemed to stretch into the hazy heavens, it sparkled in the sunlight, glossy navy and white paint and teak accents, and boasted a crew of four people, all men in their twenties, who stood in a row on the deck sides like subjects greeting the King. There were less obvious ways of jetting off to Mexico but this wasn\u2019t one of them. Javier was nothing if not obvious sometimes.</p><p>He\u2019d been waiting for my reaction, for me to say something, but I couldn\u2019t do it. He wanted me to be impressed when all I could think about, despite the size of the sea beast, was that I was going to be stuck on that ship for quite some time, with no way off except a watery grave.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you introduced to the crew and settled,\u201d he said, waving at the driver to bring the bags on board. I peered at the boat\u2019s name as everyone shuffled around me. It was called Beatriz, which happened to be the name of his oldest sister. I wondered why it was named after her, if something happened, when I realized I didn\u2019t care. I couldn\u2019t care. Men like Javier used sympathy as a fuel.</p><p>\u201cAre you having second thoughts?\u201d Javier asked from up above, holding his hand out for me. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have to come with us, you know this.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if he was saying it for the benefit of the crew, who were all facing forward, stony yet eager expressions on their faces, dressed in black shorts and black polo shirts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watched them carefully as I said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t come with you, you\u2019ll kill Camden McQueen. It\u2019s not a hard choice to make.\u201d Out of the corner of my eye I saw Javier sneer, but none of the boys even blinked. They couldn\u2019t have been much younger than me by a few years, but apparently they were already jaded and hardened to this life. Javier\u2019s empire was a lot larger, and went a lot younger, than I had thought. It made me wonder what lives they must had led to get dragged into this kind of mess. Super yacht or not, I could only hope Javier paid them well.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve made your choice,\u201d Javier said calmly, though I could see his temples going red. \u201cSo take my hand and come aboard.\u201d</p><p>I ignored his hand and walked up the stairs to the deck.</p><p>The boat, as Javier soon explained, was a 187 ft, 550 tonne Royal Huisman Mega Ketch. Everything else went over my head as I got the grand tour. All I could gather was that it must have cost tens of millions of dollars, all filthy, bloody drug money. It had a flybridge in the middle of the boat, like a raised deck complete with outdoor dining, sofas and a damn barbeque. There was a private sitting area at the very back with a spiral staircase that led down to an office and Javier\u2019s gigantic owner\u2019s bedroom. There were three levels in total, with dining and living rooms, a theatre deck for movies, a copious amount of bedrooms and spacious bathrooms, and the rear of the boat even folded open with the hiss and whir of hydraulics to provide a sunbathing and diving platform. It was to be my prison for the next six days until we reached the city of Veracruz.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Javier asked as my bags were placed in the room that was to be mine, conveniently right next door to his.</p><p>I looked him squarely in the eye. \u201cI liked your other boat better.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched in amusement. \u201cYou always had simple tastes, Ellie. Except, perhaps, for me.\u201d</p><p>He spun around and started to shut the door before he paused and said, \u201cWe set sail in an hour. You might want to get one last look at land. You won\u2019t be seeing it for a while.\u201d</p><p>The door closed with a sleek click, leaving me alone in my cabin. It was spacious enough but I could already feel the walls starting to come closer.</p> <p>It turned out I missed the big farewell. After I\u2019d unpacked a few items, I lay down on the bed to ponder my fate when exhaustion had taken over. The next thing I knew, I was very slowly rolling out of the bed and coming face to face with the upholstered cabin wall.</p><p>I sat up and blinked at the light that was streaming through what I thought was a shuttered window but was actually a well-disguised panel of lights meant to mimic daytime. I got up, finding my sea legs, and started fiddling with the lights, turning them from morning brightness to night. But they always sprung back, pre-programmed. The fact that Javier could even control the way his crew perceived the days was chilling.</p><p>I made my way out of the cabin and went down a narrow hallway lined with handrails. The boat was no longer heeling over, making walking seem painless. Aside from water making gentle sloshing sounds along the length of the boat, you couldn\u2019t even tell you were on a ship. It was that big, like being on an airbus compared to a seaplane.</p><p>The hallway led me past three more cabin doors, all closed, before I came to a small set of stairs, flooded with natural light. The area I was in ended about mid-ship, which meant the crew\u2019s quarters were at the front of the ship and had a separate entrance. I cautiously climbed the stairs until I recognized I was on the second deck, the main living area. The back was open, not fully enclosed, the sea breeze fluttering through. Past the elaborate dining table set-up, teak table and white high-backed chairs that could easily rival any house, I could see Raul and another man I hadn\u2019t seen before sitting lazily on the couch, drinks in their hands, the wind ruffling their hair. They both looked at me sharply, unkindly, before turning back to each other, talking in Spanish. Behind them I could see the lower deck, all smooth wood, Javier\u2019s private cockpit and the stern of the ship, the American flag waving in the breeze. The water here was green and a few islands dotted the horizon, slowly disappearing in our wake.</p><p>I went up another flight of stairs, holding onto the rail in case the boat decided to pitch and came up to the top deck, half covered like a pilothouse. Javier was there, sitting in a leather captain\u2019s chair, hands on one of the two steering wheels, eyes focused ahead through the wide, tinted windshield. A large sail had billowed out from the mast, an immense noise that reminded me of happier times, but that didn\u2019t make any sense to my brain, since the only time I\u2019d ever been on a sailboat would have been with Javier.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d he said without turning to face me. His hair was waving slightly against the nape of his neck. I found it annoying how his longer hair still suited him. It shouldn\u2019t have, it should have made him look more like a cheesy drug lord but instead it didn\u2019t. My stomach twisted.</p> <p>I turned my attention to the large cockpit, at the military-esque row of the glowing radar screens, GPS and weather charting systems at his fingertips, at the sofa and chairs in the open area behind me, another fantastic viewpoint. I took it all in yet it didn\u2019t seem to stick. Nothing in this situation seemed to be real.</p><p>\u201cI passed right out,\u201d I said when I recovered my thoughts. \u201cDid you drug me again?\u201d</p><p>He let out a small laugh. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t drug you anymore.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t find it particularly amusing but I was glad he at least promised it.</p><p>\u201cHere, take a seat,\u201d he said, gesturing to the co-pilot chair. \u201cCan I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head but sat down next to him. There was a pleasing amount of space between us and having another wheel at my fingertips was exciting in a novel way.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if I start steering?\u201d I asked, closing my fingers around the suede covering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll counter-steer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will override you.\u201d</p> <p>I pressed my lips together and watched as the water flew past the boat, delicate white sea spray that matched the fluffy clouds. In the distance were ghostly shapes, oil rigs obscured by the haze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this far out before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon it will be blue water,\u201d he said, shaking the glass in his hand, the ice cubes rattling. Gin and tonic. \u201cAnd then there will be no land in sight.\u201d He finally turned to look at me. \u201cDoes that scare you?\u201d</p><p>Actually, it did. And so did he.</p><p>Instead, I gave him a shrug and turned my attention back to the sea, to the dizzying heights of the mast. It was only then that I noticed a crow\u2019s nest about halfway and one of the crew members up there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d I asked. The young man looked like a black blob amongst the size of the mast.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being punished.\u201d</p><p>I stared dumbly at Javier. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me? What for?\u201d</p><p>He shook his glass and took a long sip before saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he was looking at you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe my ears.</p><p>\u201cLooking at ... how was he looking at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier, you can\u2019t punish the guy, he\u2019s just a fucking kid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should know better. You\u2019re the lady of the boat and you deserve respect.\u201d</p><p>This was doing my head in.</p><p>\u201cRespect? You wouldn\u2019t know respect if it crawled up your ass and died. You\u2019re blackmailing me, how is that for respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a special relationship with you,\u201d he said softly, then looked back at the boy on the crow\u2019s nest, eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing with me,\u201d I said and got out of the chair. Javier reached over and grabbed me by the bicep and I was thankful for the layer of cardigan between our skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurting you,\u201d he said but pulled me closer to him. His eyes burned into me, mine burning right back.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I struggle?\u201d I sniped, raising my arm, letting him know I was all for it. Anything to let me hold something above him.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll change my tactics,\u201d he said, getting up and taking a step closer.</p><p>\u201cYou stay back,\u201d I said, so glad that we were alone in the cockpit. I didn\u2019t want anyone else to see how this was playing out, seeing me so damn weak.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d he teased nastily. \u201cYou\u2019ll hit me?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it, I really did. It\u2019s all I ever wanted since we left the dust of Palm Valley behind. But not like this. Not when he wanted it. Why did my ex-boyfriend have to be such a sick son of a bitch?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room,\u201d I said, jerking my arm away from him. His grip loosened and his hand slid down to my wrist where he held on. It felt electric in an extremely disturbing way.</p><p>\u201cDinner is going to be ready soon,\u201d he said, voice lower, smoother, as if he was confiding in me. \u201cOne of the boys, Marc, is actually a very good cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving yourself isn\u2019t proving a point, you know.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t starving myself, not really. I just knew he\u2019d take pleasure in watching me eat, food that probably was absolutely delicious, and I didn\u2019t want to give him anything. I was already doing enough for him, coming on this trip, committing to something I didn\u2019t even want to think about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d I told him. Then I snatched my hand out of his grasp and walked off quickly down the stairs and down another, until I was back in the bowels of the ship. I went in my cabin door, locked it, and sat on the bed, my knees brought up to my chest. I had a whole evening to think, hoping the rock of the boat would jostle my brain into reacting.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the way things were going. Well, that was an understatement. For maybe the first time ever, I was in a bad situation and I didn\u2019t have a plan to get out of it.</p><p>I pulled up the wide leg of my pants and gazed at the bright pink and red flowers that adorned the scars. The beauty of it was breathtaking, the way something so ugly had been transformed into something so lovely, all by Camden\u2019s very skilled hands and his very skilled heart. A rush of emotions began to flood up from my chest, choking me. It felt like an unending flow, the budding blooms the source, and I let out a small sob that caught me by surprise. I hadn\u2019t let myself think about Camden, to feel, and now it was catching up with me. He wasn\u2019t here. He was somewhere else. And until he was placed in danger again, because of something I would or would not do, I had to get over him. He wasn\u2019t here with me. He was with his ex-wife and his kid and knowing the good person that Camden was, the messed up and angry but undeniably good soul that he had, he would be with her. Maybe falling in love with her again, or maybe not, but he was with her and I was alone. I was here. And though I\u2019d lived so much of my life on my own, being with Camden, no matter how brief, brought me something I never had. He made me feel safe, whether I was in arms or at his side or just in his presence. For the first time, I had a protector \u2013 and I never knew I needed one until then.</p><p>Now he was gone and I was on my own. I\u2019d been alone long enough to know I wanted more, someone to believe in me, to love me, to have my back and serve as a shield at the front. It made me realize that I wasn\u2019t invincible, immortal, and that I wasn\u2019t always going to be able to make it on my own. Of course, now I had no choice. Camden was gone and though I\u2019d been good about keeping him out of my head, ignoring the little welts on my heart, the pain \u2013 the strange emptiness \u2013 was surprising. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My defenses were crumbling.</p><p>There was a knock at my door and I quickly shoved the pant leg down. Javier hadn\u2019t seen the tattoo yet. I felt like if he saw it, he\u2019d be intruding on a private memory, I\u2019d feel like his very eyes would taint it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, brushing the hair off my face while checking to see whether my eyes had leaked tears or not. They hadn\u2019t. I was good.</p><p>The handle was jiggled, followed by another knock. I sighed and got off the bed, unlocking the door. I took a step back and it opened. Raul stuck his head in. Not that I wanted to see Javier, but I especially didn\u2019t want to see him.</p> <p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked, all beaky nose and widow\u2019s peak. \u201cI thought I heard you crying.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. He couldn\u2019t have looked less concerned, in fact it looked like he found the whole thing to be funny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, do you mind giving me some privacy?\u201d</p><p>His face grew still for a moment before he smiled. \u201cSure thing. You know, if you ever need to talk, to someone who understands, who is just outside of the equation, you know you can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>As if that didn\u2019t sound insincere enough, his eyes traveled down to my chest and back and he ran the tip of his tongue over his teeth.</p> <p>Before I could tell him to get the fuck out he winked at me and then shut the door. I locked it again, hoping he could hear it, and went back to the bed. I put my fingers up my pant leg, tracing them over the scars, imagining Camden\u2019s hands on top of mine. Then I lay on my side and hoped for sleep to come so I didn\u2019t have to suffer a moment longer.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>We had gone as far as La Cruces, New Mexico when we met the first of Gus\u2019s contacts. After following I-10 for the last few days, the blistering sun making the interior of the GTO swelter like a fat man\u2019s armpits, with minimal stops for gas and sleep, La Cruces was a sight for sore eyes.</p><p>As was Gus\u2019s contact. Lydia DuShane was a Louisiana native who gave up running her battered coffee shop after Hurricane Katrina to run a pie shop in La Cruces. Though she was an older lady, late fifties, she was one who\u2019d aged better than any of the plastic-coated women in LA. Her skin was relatively smooth and freckled, hair a mixture of red and grey, and blue eyes that were nicely wrinkled from smiling too much. She made me feel immediately at home, which was a bit jarring considering what Gus had told me about her.</p><p>\u201cWhen she\u2019s not baking pies, she\u2019s bounty hunting,\u201d he\u2019d said as we pulled into town.</p> <p>\u201cUh,\u201d I said, fidgeting in my seat, \u201cisn\u2019t that kind of a problem for me?\u201d</p><p>Gus gave me a dry look. \u201cHey, kid, there\u2019s no bounty on your head yet. Besides, you\u2019re with me. You\u2019re one of the good guys.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brow. Right.</p><p>Soon after Lydia sat us down in her shop, the last remaining customers in her store dwindled out as it approached the 3PM closing time. We had two fresh pieces of apricot blueberry pie in front of us. That, combined with the steaming cups of coffee and the vintage posters of farm life on the walls, did work as a wonderful front. Who would ever believe that sweet, patient Lydia had a knack for nabbing America\u2019s Most Wanted?</p><p>Yet, after she\u2019d flipped the sign to Closed on the front door and locked it, sliding down into the booth with us, she took out a small netbook and slipped on a pair of glasses, ready to get down to the point.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re hunting Javier Bernal, is that right?\u201d she asked. I could see her flicking from website to website in her glasses\u2019 reflection.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI know everyone. If I\u2019m not keeping tabs, I\u2019m not doing my job.\u201d</p> <p>I leaned forward eagerly. \u201cIs he wanted for something?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNah, not yet. The police have ideas but then again half the force is corrupt anyway in Mississippi. You think the New Orleans PD is bad, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d She took her eyes off the screen and tilted her head at me. \u201cI like to know what the baddies are doing so when they do finally do something to get them in trouble, and believe it catches up to all of them, I know their next step. I was watching this one guy for years before he slipped up and was wanted for a DUI. Considering the guy\u2019s unofficial rap sheet, I knew the reward would be a big one. I knew where his safe house was and I nabbed him the next day. Cops were already on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do it? I mean, you\u2019re not frail but ...\u201d</p><p>She smiled slyly in a satisfied way. \u201cI\u2019m a woman. And that\u2019s the secret. I\u2019ve been around the block. You\u2019d be surprised what a retiree can get away with. Ain\u2019t that right, Gus?\u201d</p><p>Gus scratched at his beard and I could have sworn his cheeks turned a shade of pink. That was something to ask him about later, even though I knew his answer would be a glare and a grunt.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cSo where is Mr. Bernal now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOcean Springs, Mississippi,\u201d she said, sitting back in her chair. \u201cAre you boys going to eat your pie or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to but we really need to get a move on,\u201d I said apologetically. I got up but Gus\u2019s arm shot out and he planted me back down</p><p>\u201cRelax, Camden, we\u2019ll get there,\u201d he said. \u201cA town isn\u2019t enough. We need a plan.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. We can plan in the car. If he\u2019s in Ocean Springs and that\u2019s where Ellie lived with him, then I have no doubt that he\u2019s living in the same house he was six years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Ellie?\u201d Lydia asked, eyes wide and shining.</p><p>I shot Gus a look to keep quiet but he ignored me. \u201cEllie Watt. She\u2019s Bernal\u2019s ex-girlfriend and is, we think, being more or less held hostage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie Watt,\u201d she said, tapping her pink fingernails on the table. \u201cEllie Watt. She\u2019s no innocent, is she? She wrapped up in the cartel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said quickly and probably too defensively. I cleared my throat. \u201cNo, she was never involved in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not innocent. She\u2019s a con artist,\u201d Gus supplied</p><p>\u201cWas a con artist,\u201d I corrected him.</p><p>He gave his head a shake. \u201cA tiger doesn\u2019t change their stripes, Camden boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie\u2019s better than a tiger,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cEither way,\u201d Lydia voiced slowly, \u201cEllie Watt has been wanted for something before. She was on my radar, briefly.\u201d</p><p>Gus and I both looked at her. \u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She pursed her lips, flamingo pink like her nails, a color I\u2019d used many times in my work, and began scrolling through her files again. After a few tense moments, she shrugged, giving up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. This was like three years ago. It wasn\u2019t anything major, maybe just twenty grand, or I would have gone after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut her name was Ellie Watt ...\u201d I reinstated. \u201cNot Eden White or Ellen Williams or anything like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Ellie Watt. I remember because my sister\u2019s name is Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Now that was troubling. Ellie hadn\u2019t been Ellie since high school. Whoever had placed a bounty for her was someone from a very long time ago. I glanced over at Gus and his furrowed brow told me he was thinking the exact same thing.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you do think of anything else, please let me know, I\u2019ve got my cell,\u201d Gus said. \u201cAbout Ellie that is. Everything about Bernal, we\u2019d like to know now.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI can tell you he\u2019s got several bodyguards around him at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaul,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that he\u2019s very careful, almost to a point. He never slips up, at least not enough for me to act on. The man has patience and is ruthless and that\u2019s a mighty terrible combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us something we don\u2019t know,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>It was loud enough for her to shoot me a sharp look. \u201cTell me what your plan is when you find her?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Gus but he was staring at the wall now, eyes drifting over a pastoral landscape, too green field, bright red barn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said slowly when Gus didn\u2019t respond. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really worked out the kinks yet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled before growing serious. \u201cWell let me tell you this, there are some things in life that you can do by the seat of your pants and there are others you need to plan. What I said about Bernal being careful, it\u2019s no lie. He\u2019ll smell you a mile away if you\u2019re on his territory. If he has his ex-girlfriend, and they\u2019re in the place they used to share together, I would bet he wouldn\u2019t give her up easily. You\u2019re obviously after her for a reason. He was too.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and tried to bury the seeds of doubt that were popping up in my head, the fact that I was green, new to this, didn\u2019t know what the fuck I was doing. I was a tattoo artist for crying out loud, not a vigilante. Hell, I wasn\u2019t even a bounty hunter like this middle-aged lady was. I had absolutely no skills to my credit except that I knew how to fire a gun and could kick the shit out of any unarmed man. And I doubted I\u2019d be able to throw a couch and get away with it a second time.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for your time Lydia,\u201d Gus suddenly said, getting to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t stay for pie, but the kid is right. We need to get going so we could start planning.\u201d</p><p>I quickly took my piece of pie and wrapped it in a mound of napkins from the dispenser. \u201cFor energy,\u201d I said, trying to give her an easy smile. I think I failed. Her own smile faltered in return.</p><p>As we were leaving the shop, I saw Lydia pull Gus aside and whisper to him, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to come. For company? Just for old times?\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI\u2019ll be alright, Lyd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about you. You\u2019ve been through so much, and this man, Bernal ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you.\u201d He patted her on the shoulder and I quickly turned and headed to the car so they wouldn\u2019t know I\u2019d been eavesdropping.</p><p>She waved goodbye for us, standing on the stoop of her shop, as we got into the car and roared off down the sunny, dusted, desert streets, sand it seemed I could never escape.</p><p>I shot Gus a look. \u201cI guess we need a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a plan and a prayer,\u201d he said. He eyed me over his glasses. \u201cBut you knew that already, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I did. Yet knowing it didn\u2019t make it easier.</p><p>I started nibbling on the pie \u2013 absolutely messy but delicious \u2013 and got to thinking. We would descend upon Ocean Springs soon.</p><p>Tomorrow I might be able to hold Ellie in my arms again.</p><p>Tomorrow I might also lose everything.</p><p>Ocean Springs definitely wasn\u2019t what I pictured when I thought of Mississippi. Granted, we had driven through Biloxi and Gulfport, still a mix of new casinos and post-Katrina destruction. But Ocean Springs was fresh and charming. A little too quaint for someone like Javier, though what did I know?</p><p>We pulled into the small town in the late afternoon, the humidity swept away by the incoming breeze of evening. We didn\u2019t even spend a night in a hotel, instead Gus had me take over during the idle of the night, somewhere in Texas. He figured it was safe enough to not draw any suspicion, our car anonymous amongst the others on the dark stretch of highway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While he snored from the backseat, utterly out in a matter of seconds, I had more time to think and go over the plan.</p><p>Gus had known where Ellie shacked up with Javier, in case of emergencies. We were able to locate it using his cell phone\u2019s GPS, as close into the street view as we could go. Looked like a nice place, a fact that kind of picked at my heart a bit. It was ridiculous to be jealous over this, over something that happened a long time ago, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I always was a jealous guy. I guess it came from insecurities and all that nonsense. Well, that\u2019s what the shrink had told me all those years ago when my father would shuttle me off to him once a week. Even though I knew that Ellie despised Javier, that she was in a terrible place and needed my help \u2013 our help \u2013 I thought about what must have attracted her to him in the first place. What caused her to give up on her revenge and live with this man? The beauty of their house and the location disguised the truth.</p><p>Gus had decided we\u2019d first need to do to a bit of a stakeout \u2013 which totally went against what I wanted to do, which was to pretty much barge in there and take out everyone in our path. That method would probably get me killed but every second that we spent staking out the joint was a second that I felt we were losing her. Still, Gus was right. Of course. I\u2019d started wanting to second-guess him out of spite but the fact was he knew what he was doing.</p><p>After the stakeout, when we got an impression of how many people were there and how they were armed (that\u2019s, assuming, they were inside \u2013 this was just our hunch after all), we\u2019d formulate our plan of attack. One person to act as a diversion, the other to rescue Ellie. Obviously the trick would be the diversion so we didn\u2019t get caught. It also depended on how many men were there and if Ellie was heavily protected or not. Gus seemed to think that she wouldn\u2019t be. Javier probably had his bodyguard or Raul. Javier, like everyone in the world by now, had to know I was on the run from the police and would want to stay low, so coming for Ellie would be the last thing I\u2019d do.</p> <p>Javier would have totally underestimated me.</p><p>Once we followed the GPS\u2019s chirpy voice down a few seaside streets we eased up several blocks away. Javier\u2019s car was still Javier\u2019s car and our cover would be blow in a second if we were to come any closer.</p><p>Gus brought the duffel bag into the back seat and began sorting through the weapons. Yeah, that word pretty much encompassed what he\u2019d packed. An assault rifle, a few handguns of various calibers, plus a sniper rifle. Then there were two knives, a small axe, a small plastic bottle, hornet spray, various gas lighters and a container of Coffee Mate.</p><p>I picked up the Coffee Mate and shook it. \u201cNow what\u2019s really in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee Mate,\u201d he said, face serious. \u201cYou get a cloud of that in the air, there\u2019s nothing more flammable. Not to mention how easy fireballs are to make.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkaaay,\u201d I said. My nerves were starting to twitch a bit. I wasn\u2019t counting on doing anything that involved igniting a puff of non-dairy creamer. Also made me wonder if people knew what they were putting in their coffee every morning.</p><p>I nodded at the unmarked bottle, afraid to touch it. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, breast milk?\u201d</p><p>His eyes twinkled at that though his mouth remained flat. \u201cA bleach bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should stick to guns,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t want this to turn into Gus\u2019s science experiment.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou just use your own, you\u2019re more comfortable with it.\u201d</p><p>I was. I also had a secret weapon. I wasn\u2019t planning on using it but if I ever got the chance \u2013 if I happened to come across Javier alone \u2013 well it paid off to plan ahead. Guns didn\u2019t always have a way of making people talk.</p> <p>Gus slipped one gun into his boot, a knife went into a sheath under his pant leg, and he tucked another gun into the waistband of his jeans. He seemed to consider the bleach bomb for a bit before he grabbed the can of hornet spray and stuffed that in the front of his pants.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m going to assume here that I\u2019m the diversion,\u201d I said, grabbing a small backpack I had stowed in the back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to watch them for a bit, but yes, that\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>As childish as it seemed, I\u2019d wanted to be the one who came breaking into the house in a blaze of glory and rescuing my woman. But things didn\u2019t work out the way they did in the movies. Instead I\u2019d have to fake and run and leave the rest up to Gus.</p><p>At first I assumed we\u2019d be waiting until nightfall but Gus assured me that daytime was the safest. This was an affluent neighborhood and Javier was the leader of a Mexican drug cartel. They couldn\u2019t get away with a lot during the day, so the risk of a shootout was kept to a minimum. That said, we\u2019d be in a lot of shit if we were spotted though sadly, that was the risk we were going to have to take. I was a wanted man now, what the hell was the difference? Might as well get nabbed for something I actually did.</p><p>We left the car and started walking toward the house, taking the street that dipped along by the ocean. It was stunningly beautiful, the glimpses of crashing waves that you could spot between the properties, the way the sun was setting in golden shimmers. Still, the scenery did nothing to abate the anxiety that was starting to eat at me. I\u2019d never experienced panic attacks, not the way that Ellie had anyway, but this was as close to one as I\u2019d ever felt. I thought my lungs were shrinking with each and every step we took. The gun tucked into my jeans felt like a bomb about to go off, my backpack felt weighted and heavy.</p><p>Luckily, Gus and I didn\u2019t look out of place. He was wearing a yellow and pink Hawaiian shirt that I joked made him look like a combination of Jimmy Buffet and Nick Nolte when he got arrested for drunk driving; I had on a baseball cap and a long-sleeved grey Henley shirt that covered up all my tats. We both had sneakers and sunglasses. We could have been a father and son going out for their sunset walk. No one would suspect that Gus was a walking weapon.</p><p>Soon we were upon Javier\u2019s house, looking the same as it did on Google maps. Only this wasn\u2019t a concept, an idea, an image on a phone. This was the house, all white with its raised porch overlooking the beach. Idyllic and deadly. And Ellie could have been inside, maybe in one of the windows that had bars on it. The thought caused a jolt of anger to run through me.</p> <p>As usual, Gus picked up on it. \u201cTake it easy,\u201d he whispered out of the side of his mouth. We were just walking past, two guys on a walk. No one should suspect anything, not if we kept going on our easy going way.</p><p>Once we were a few yards from the house, Gus stopped and pretended to look at his watch. \u201cWhat time is sunset, do you know?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. Was that code for something? I could barely even think.</p><p>I could tell his eyes were on me underneath the glasses. He lowered his voice, pretending to adjust his watch. \u201cJust the one car. Recognize it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to find my vocal chords.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go see how Dana\u2019s garden is doing,\u201d he said more loudly and began walking again. I followed, wondering if we were being watched or followed but knew I couldn\u2019t even look around to check. The skin at the back of my neck prickled.</p><p>We turned down the next street and once we were out of sight, he pulled me to the side into the flowering bushes of someone\u2019s yard.</p><p>\u201cWe might be lucky,\u201d he whispered gruffly. \u201cOne car means less people. Maybe. Either way, I\u2019m going to go around and up through the beach. Enter from there, probably from the main floor. I didn\u2019t like the looks of those windows but I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s where she\u2019s being kept. Unless Javier is that paranoid. Which the bastard probably is. Still. You wait here.\u201d</p><p>He brought out his cell from his pocket and checked the time. He took off his watch and handed it to me. \u201cIn five minutes from now, you knock on the door or ring the doorbell and ask if Dana Prescott is home. They\u2019ll tell you, you have the wrong house and give directions. Maybe. And hopefully you\u2019ll be on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d I said with a grimace. \u201cWho is Dana?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cShe lives around the corner. I Googled home businesses in Ocean Springs and her location came up the closest. Home computer services. You\u2019ll be more believable if you\u2019re asking about someone who lives here. Maybe Javier and his pals are the good neighborly types.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a neighborhood watch,\u201d I said. The shakiness had come up into my voice. I needed to hold it together if I was going to be any help.</p><p>He gave my shoulder a hearty slap. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine. You\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time to go. Then you run, you get back to the car and you bring the car three houses down. Ellie and I will be running along the beach and will come in between that red house I pointed out. You got it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. He watched me for a few moments to make sure, then suddenly he was off and running in the opposite direction, moving a lot quicker than I gave him credit far. He disappeared down the next street, heading for the beach.</p><p>I slid the watch around my wrist, my hands shaking, the leather slipping. Five minutes. Five minutes. Five minutes.</p><p>Oh shit, Camden, I told myself and suddenly my head was between my legs, nausea sweeping through me like a bat out of hell. I hadn\u2019t been this nervous in a long time. Not even when Ellie and I were going to get Sophia and Ben. The last time I\u2019d felt this nervous was when I was planning to catch Ellie in the act of robbing me.</p><p>I had to admit that still stung from time to time. How the whole time I knew she was scoping me out, wanting my money, not giving a shit about leaving me high and dry. Not caring about her old friend Camden, the doormat, the lovesick puppy, the goth queen. She looked me in the face and lied time and time again. And then she broke into my house and robbed me.</p><p>But that was the old Ellie. When she traded herself in for me, the sacrifice she made for my freedom, for Sophia and Ben\u2019s freedom, I knew that old Ellie was dead. Still, being here now in Mississippi, in the very place where she gladly lived a lie for over a year, a part of me had to wonder if the old Ellie would be resurrected. It was something I tried not to think about, because it only added an unnecessary fear. The fear that when Gus and I came to get her, that she would not go.</p><p>I looked down at my watch. It was time.</p><p>I breathed in deeply through my nose, adjusted the cap on my head and came out of the Gardenia hedges, striding down the road and turning onto Javier\u2019s street. There was the house, just as before, and for once I could gaze at it through the cover of sunglasses and take it all in. After all, I was just looking for someone now, Dana Prescott, and heard she lived here at 425 East Beach Road. I heard she had a lovely garden and fixed computers.</p><p>Fuck, what was I doing?</p><p>It was too late. Gus was probably somewhere on the beach, heading to the house like a lost beachcomber and without a diversion, Ellie\u2019s chances of getting out of there would get a lot more difficult. I had to keep going. One foot in front of another. A gun tucked in my jeans. A new weapon in my backpack.</p><p>I walked down the bend of his driveway, past moody, weeping trees and went straight for the front door. Half of the house at the back was on stilts, leaving a spot big enough to park two cars \u2013 the black SUV being the only one there \u2013 and to the side a stone walkway led to the front door, trimmed by flowering pots. It was surprisingly well-maintained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stopped on the low stoop and fought the urge to hesitate. If they were gang members worth their salt, they\u2019d already have spotted me and were watching my every move. If I looked to the window to the side of the door, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d see the venetian blinds move. But I was there to see Dana and no reason to cast a suspicious eye upon the house.</p><p>Seeing there was a doorbell, I rang it, a loud chime that nearly made me jump out of my shoes. I had to, had to, had to watch myself. I needed to do this for her sake, my sake, Gus\u2019s sake.</p><p>Be cool.</p><p>The door opened and a short Hispanic man appeared, dressed casually in a white polo shirt and khaki shorts. Did we even have the right house? He didn\u2019t look to be much older than me and his posture was relaxed. The only thing that gave me a hint right away was the fact that he had a bandage across his temple, the area red and raised.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked. He was polite too, though I detected a hint of suspicion in his tone.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHi, is Dana home?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDana? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does live here though, right? 425 East Beach?\u201d</p><p>The man crossed his arms and I got a glimpse of some pretty bad-ass tribal tattoos on his biceps. I could take him, easily, but he\u2019d put up a good fight. He leveled his stare at me. \u201cThis is 425 but there is no Dana here. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He was about to close the door when I raised my hand to stop him. A ballsy move but I wanted to make sure Gus had enough time.</p><p>The man eyed my hand, then fixed his eyes on me. He didn\u2019t look relaxed anymore. He looked annoyed. I was pressing my luck.</p><p>I kept grinning like an idiot, like I wasn\u2019t picking up on the obvious signals he was giving me. \u201cDo you know if there\u2019s a Dana in the neighborhood? She\u2019s supposed to offer computer services.\u201d I patted my backpack. \u201cGot my laptop right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I do know is that if you don\u2019t get the fuck out of here right now, I\u2019m going to break your balls with my foot.\u201d</p><p>I let my smile fall because that\u2019s what anyone would have done. I was half-tempted to break his balls. Instead, I raised both hands as a peace offering and gave a meek, \u201cSorry man, sorry,\u201d while backing away.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t move. He kept staring at me. I started thinking, maybe, just maybe he already deduced something about me, maybe something was given away.</p> <p>Then I heard a gunshot.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>\u201cSo, how would you like to kill Travis, Ellie? A bullet to the head or something more subtle?\u201d</p><p>I turned and glared at Raul. It was day two at sea and the massive yacht was already starting to feel too small. I was alone only in my cabin. Everywhere else I went it was either Raul, or the other guy, or one of the crew boys. Unlike the other two, the crew boys were nice enough and kept their distance lest they incur the wrath of Javier, but I could tell they were watching me. Little matching spies all in black.</p><p>Oddly enough, Javier hadn\u2019t been around a lot. Most of the time he was at the helm of the ship, even though one of the crew boys seemed to be extremely adept at handling a sailboat, even one of this size. Javier always had a thing for control, but I started to get the feeling he was avoiding me. It was somewhat unwelcome and I couldn\u2019t figure out why.</p><p>\u201cWho said I\u2019m killing Travis?\u201d I shot back at him and took a large, medicinal gulp of my wine. I had been sitting in the \u201ctheatre lounge\u201d area, hiding out from the relentless sun and trying to occupy my frazzled mind with books. The peace didn\u2019t last long. Raul had sat down across from me, leaning back in the seat, one leg crossed, drink in hand. His eyes had gotten extra lecherous, even though I was wearing breezy pants and a flowing peasant top. His eyes were so much more intrusive than Javier\u2019s.</p><p>Raul tipped his chin down and smiled. \u201cI suppose you think Javier will be the one to do it, that you\u2019re just the trap. The bait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I muttered and looked down at the book I was attempting to read, Stephen King\u2019s Duma Key. It seemed fitting, the storm and boat on the cover.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that bother you,\u201d he continued, \u201cknowing he only sees you as a pawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather him see me as a pawn than anything more than that,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he mused. \u201cAnd I see you mean that too. Do you still have feelings for him?\u201d</p><p>I lowered the book again and gave him the most disgusted and incredulous look that I could muster. Considering I was already buzzed from the glass of wine, I\u2019d say it was probably pretty good. The drunker I got, the nastier I became \u2013 facial expressions included.</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint you, Raul,\u201d I drew out the syllables in his name, mocking it. \u201cWhatever feelings I had for Javier died six years ago, when I found him cheating on me.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cOh yes. That. Have you ever asked him about it?\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped a bit. Raul knew. This was public knowledge. Oh, of course it was. Javier was probably screwing everyone, calling anyone with legs \u2013 even scarred ones \u2013 his angel and coming all over them. Somewhere deep inside I flushed at that last memory and shook it off.</p><p>\u201cNo I haven\u2019t because I honestly don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to find that chick and shake her fucking hand. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I\u2019d probably be wasting my life, attached to a complete psychopath with an addiction to pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd being a con artist wasn\u2019t a waste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, a shrink?\u201d I asked and looked away. The book wasn\u2019t helping anymore. The wine was. I got up and made a move to the bar (there was one in every single room on this ship, a total booze cruise) but Raul beat me to it. He was quicker than he looked and within seconds my wine glass was being filled with expensive Sauvignon Blanc and I was slightly too buzzed to care.</p><p>He sat back down across from me and brushed back his hair. My god, why did cartel members have to be so ugly? I\u2019d lucked out when I picked Javier for my plan all those years ago. He was the only one who was pleasing to look at. Even more than pleasing, when you added in the fact that he had that whole primal animal vibe that slithered off of him.</p><p>Why was I thinking so many pleasant adjectives about a man who was blackmailing me and essentially holding me hostage on a ship that launched Raul in my direction at every turn?</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to kill him?\u201d he continued after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if I had you in my possession, I\u2019d set you free.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cRight. And I\u2019m not in his possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s in your possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, what do you want? If you want to annoy me, you\u2019re succeeding. If you want to be creepy, you\u2019re succeeding at that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just wondering how it is that you\u2019re going along with all of this so well. It\u2019s like you belong here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called making the best of a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>Raul leaned forward and lowered his voice. \u201cI think you only do your best in bad situations. Because you\u2019re a bad, bad little girl, Ellie Watt. And I can teach you to be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Javier\u2019s voice broke in.</p><p>I swallowed the sour feeling in my mouth and looked over at Javier who was standing by the entrance to the lounge, eyes boring into Raul in a most unsavory way.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s annoying me,\u201d I said, not caring if it got me in shit with either of them.</p><p>Raul only smiled, his eyes darting to me and back to Javier. \u201cI\u2019m trying to prepare Ellie here for what\u2019s to come. You know, Javier, for an assassin, she\u2019s awfully blas\u00e9 about the whole thing. Doesn\u2019t that worry you? Perhaps she might flake out, maybe fuck everything up. On purpose, no less. She really seems to harbor some sort of grudge against you.\u201d</p><p>Javier didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cShe\u2019ll get it, sooner or later. And I trust her.\u201d</p><p>I almost snorted wine through my nose. Javier trusted me? I\u2019d dump him over the side of the ship at the first opportunity if I knew that Raul wouldn\u2019t kill me right afterward.</p><p>\u201cThat trust might get you killed, se\u00f1or,\u201d Raul said bitingly.</p><p>I raised my brow at that comment but Javier\u2019s face was blank.</p><p>Finally he cleared his throat and said, \u201cWell, Raul, I think you\u2019re done with annoying Ellie for today. Why don\u2019t you go join Roberto at the helm, huh?\u201d</p><p>Raul narrowed his eyes at him and got up. He left the room without saying a word, brushing past Javier with utter disdain.</p><p>The whole exchange had put a weird vibe in the room. For some reason I felt like things had gotten even more off-balance, or perhaps that was the combination of the wine and the ship. Not seeing land for twenty-four hours couldn\u2019t help.</p><p>Javier folded his arms and looked at me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I raised my glass of wine. \u201cDrinking away the blackmailing blues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d he said, though his tone was flat. He walked over, smooth and sleek. That whole primal animal analogy came darting in my brain again. Today he was a cat dressed head to toe in olive green. He stopped right behind the chair I was sitting in, so I had to twist around to look up at him. \u201cWhat was he talking to you about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how I was going to kill Travis.\u201d And if I had feelings for you anymore. Of course I didn\u2019t want to say that. I didn\u2019t even want to go there.</p><p>He peered down at me. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t all. He said he was going to teach you to be a bad girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what he meant by that ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I don\u2019t like the way he talks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what. If you want to go stick Raul all the way up the crow\u2019s nest, you have my full support.\u201d</p><p>Finally his mouth twisted into a smile. He raised his brow and nodded at my glass. \u201cI say the drinking is working. You\u2019ve got a little spring in your step.\u201d</p><p>For one split second I was able to fool myself into thinking we were old lovers who were having a lovely cruise together, old sparring partners, shooting the shit. But things couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth.</p><p>His face grew colder as he studied me. He turned around and left the room, calling over his shoulder, \u201cEnjoy your book. Dinner is at six.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t remind me to eat like he\u2019d been doing at every meal, even though that\u2019s one of the reasons the wine was hitting me so hard. And just for that, I decided I would finally partake in dinner. My stomach punched me in anticipation and I went back to reading.</p><p>As much as I hated to admit it, dinner was fabulous. The snapper was so fresh I could have sworn that they\u2019d just caught it off the side of the boat. The coconut rice and mango salad was amazing. The cocktails, syrupy hurricanes, were phenomenal. It was almost good enough to make me forget why I\u2019d been avoiding meals in the first place.</p><p>I did my best to put a damper on my enjoyment of the food and instead paid attention to what was going on around me. It was just the four of us since the crew had their own mini mess hall in their quarters. The other man I came to learn was Peter. He seemed fairly intelligent if not quiet most of the time. I didn\u2019t know why he was there with us or what he did but Javier seemed to treat him with respect. Maybe it just seemed that way because he was getting increasingly short with Raul while Raul was acting more and more like a petulant child. I could feel Javier\u2019s authority over him crumbling brick by brick and it kind of scared me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once dinner was over, cleared away by the boys who seemed to appear out of nowhere, Raul and Peter retreated to their cabins, leaving me and Javier sitting across from each other at the dinner table. When the last tray was cleared and we were left alone, I felt the weight of the star-filled sky crushing me. The boat\u2019s deck was lit up with tons of mood lights, making his eyes shine as he gazed at me.</p><p>It was a steady gaze, not adoring or concerned. But interested. He had always seemed so intrigued by me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful out,\u201d he said, his voice dull. \u201cYou can see so many constellations out here. None of those city lights. You can feel how ... insignificant we really are. Can you feel it?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if this was a trap or a trick question. Still, I nodded. \u201cYes. Like God might flick me away with his finger.\u201d</p> <p>He tilted his head, his mouth drawing into a slight pout. \u201cGod would never do that to you. You\u2019re Ellie Watt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I am,\u201d I said, hiding my uneasiness with another sip of my hurricane.</p><p>\u201cYou always are. I see that now. I might have only seen bits and pieces of you before. But now, you\u2019re ... formidable.\u201d</p><p>Was that a compliment? If it was, I didn\u2019t think I could take it as one since it came from him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt is a compliment,\u201d he said, back to that whole mind reading thing. \u201cYou\u2019re so strong. I\u2019m lucky to have you.\u201d</p> <p>I nearly rolled my eyes then decided it was a little more serious than that action portrayed. \u201cJavier,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cyou don\u2019t have me. Your only luck is how far you\u2019ve gotten in life without someone chopping your head off. Yes, I am strong. And I\u2019m afraid that Raul is right. You shouldn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, taken aback at the sincerity in his voice. \u201cWhy? Why? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever hated a person more than I hate you.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to mull that over, his eyes shining even more. He took a sip of his drink, then sat back in his chair and placed his hands behind his head. \u201cThat\u2019s funny. You treat me quite well for someone you hate. What do you do to the people you love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know.\u201d I blurted it out before I realized my mistake. The alcohol was ruining me. I was saying things I\u2019d once locked inside my head.</p><p>His eyes widened momentarily. I saw a look in them that I never wanted to see again. I quickly drank the rest of my drink and slammed the glass down on the teak table. \u201cWell, here I am drunk and talking absolute nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>He appraised me before saying, \u201cApparently. But I find your lack of censorship amusing. Care to entertain someone that you hate by having another drink with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you drugging me again? Because if I have another drink I\u2019ll probably pass out anyway and you\u2019ll have to get one of your little crew boys to drag me back to my room.\u201d</p><p>His face became instantly stern. \u201cNo one touches you on this boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even you?\u201d I asked wryly, testing him, pushing him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Not even me. You are not mine to touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course not. I\u2019m just yours to use as a pawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he said. Then he got up and held out his hand. \u201cCome join me and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what?\u201d I asked, eyeing his hand like it had some disease.</p> <p>\u201cExplain what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t know what you heard from Raul but I want to make some things clear.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand what the point of that was. What did it matter what he told me? I probably wasn\u2019t going to like it, which didn\u2019t matter if it meant keeping Camden alive. I was in a shitty situation and I was tired of trying to wrap my head around it.</p><p>Finally I put my hand in Javier\u2019s and he helped me to my feet. His hands were warm and rough. Familiar and strange.</p><p>As soon as I was up though, he dropped my hand like it was a hot coal. I\u2019d found that to be the strangest thing about this whole thing with him. He really did see me as a pawn, not as his ex-lover or ex-girlfriend. Of course I still saw his eyes on me from time to time and that hopeful expression on his face. But for the most part, whatever feelings, mentally, physically, whatever, he had for me in the past, they weren\u2019t the same anymore. He was detached, unpassionate, and utterly focused on this task at hand, the one my brain kept skirting. Part of me found his distance admirable. I couldn\u2019t have wanted him to keep playing the part of the creepy, obsessive ex-lover. The one who kept all my clothes yet took six years to come chasing after me.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t understand this Javier. And maybe that\u2019s the reason why I let him pour me a stiff drink and why I followed him down the stairs to the main deck and to the back of the ship where his private cockpit was. I wanted to understand him, whether it would do me any good or not. Understanding the enemy was to my advantage, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>I hadn\u2019t spent any time at his cockpit before, a round depression that led down to his office and quarters below, two curved couches on either side, plus a bar that popped up with the touch of a button.</p><p>I sat down on one couch, spreading my legs out, hoping that would deter him from sitting near me. It worked though I had a feeling he was going to sit opposite from me anyway.</p><p>\u201cI think this is the best part of the ship,\u201d I said. I put my head back and looked up at the stars. I still felt the weight of the universe on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite too. It reminds me of the old boat.\u201d</p><p>My mind jumped back to the first time I stepped foot on his old boat. The first time we made love on it. He wanted to stain me. And he did, just not in the way he had hoped.</p><p>I knew I shouldn\u2019t have been thinking of it \u2013 it was the booze, plus Raul\u2019s words that had implanted the seeds there. But I was thinking it and before I knew it, I was saying it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cheat on me?\u201d I kept my eyes on the stars, feeling the dark bruise-colored sky lift a bit.</p><p>Javier was silent. Stunned or formulating an excuse. Maybe preparing to tell the truth. I didn\u2019t know what I hoped to gain out of this aside from having a weight lifted. Unanswered questions can stay with you a long time, riding on your shoulders, wearing you down.</p><p>I heard him take a sip of his drink and place it on the side table. The sounds were all louder now, the drone of the engine since we weren\u2019t under sail, the water as it crashed behind the stern of the boat.</p><p>\u201cI cheated on you more than once,\u201d he said cautiously, as if he was waiting for me to spring up and kill him. I didn\u2019t. It hurt my pride just a tad but the anger was on the way out.</p><p>I cleared my throat, feeling stupid despite the circumstances. \u201cI see. It figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I would be the one with the wool pulled over my eyes. The whole time I thought I was keeping a secret from you and you were the one keeping it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, it wasn\u2019t exactly like-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t matter. Forget I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t forget you asked. What if I asked why you lied to me all that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cIt does matter,\u201d he said loud enough to make me jerk to attention. He was gripping his glass, eyes blazing. \u201cI was a different man then, just a boy, but I did love you and I never would have done anything to intentionally hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove and respect don\u2019t have to go hand in hand,\u201d I retorted, recalling what a wise woman had once told me. And they say you never meet anyone worthwhile at roadside bars. I still had that woman, Marda\u2019s, driver\u2019s license in my scrapbook.</p><p>\u201cThat can be true,\u201d he conceded. \u201cI had reasons for being unfaithful. It went beyond sex and love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved her?\u201d I exclaimed, feeling sick despite myself. I could blame the wine and the boat all I wanted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. But I had revenge. You of all people should know how far you are willing to go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does revenge have to do with sleeping with someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does revenge have to do with loving me?\u201d he said, his voice collapsing over the last two words so they spun out in a hush.</p><p>I slowly sat up, feeling dizzy. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter but I did love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke me,\u201d he replied. His eyes went to steel.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to hear any of this anymore. \u201cWhy did you cheat on me? And don\u2019t give me that revenge shit. If it was this revenge, this thing, then tell me exactly how it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Patricia,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oh, so she had a name. A dumb one at that.</p><p>He continued, looking down into his glass, \u201cShe was a nice girl. Nice enough. Pretty. She liked me. That\u2019s all I needed. She was the sister of Enrique Morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Enrique Morrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnrique was one of the higher ups in the Los Zetas. Patricia lived in New Orleans, he was in Nuevo Laredo. I got to know her, I suppose in the same way you got to know me. I used her to get to him.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cAnd did you get to him? Did it work?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and shook the ice in his glass. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d</p><p>He eyed me briefly. \u201cThey are both dead. I killed them. Killed her first, in front of him, to prove a point. Held her down and took her hand. Then slit her throat. And made him watch. Then, when I thought he\u2019d suffered enough, I cut off his head. Seemed fitting, considering the Los Zetas practically think they invented the act.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open. I needed to shut it. To say I was horrified was an understatement. \u201cYou ... you did that to the woman you were cheating on me with?\u201d A memory flashed in my head, the one of when I found them together, that terrible act of intimacy, him calling her pet names as they lay beside each other on the bed \u2013 my bed \u2013 laughing. They looked so ... in love. So in touch with each other. That\u2019s what had hurt me the most, more than the sex.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do that to her?\u201d I said softly. \u201cYou ... that you were capable of that when I was with you ... I ...\u201d</p><p>He finished his drink then filled up my own glass with more. I was too stunned to wave him off. \u201cThis happened a few months after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just a young kid,\u201d I said, unable to accept it. Seeing him kill his best friend in our kitchen was one thing. But knowing that just a few months after I left him he was the kind of man who was capable of murdering a woman he was sleeping with, pretending to be in love with, in such a brutal way, to prove an awful point was ... I didn\u2019t even know what it was.</p><p>\u201cEverything changed after you left,\u201d he said, watching me closely. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>A burst of indignation flared up inside my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare blame this on me. Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left without even a note ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked another woman, in our bed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, it meant nothing.\u201d</p><p>I nearly crushed the glass with my hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that at the time! I didn\u2019t know how little she meant to you. How obviously little human life means to you! You did what you did and you never had to do it. Your so-called excuse only makes things worse. Fuck, Javier! All of this for nothing. Just so you could have your fucking revenge and kill people. You\u2019re nothing but a beast, a cold-hearted monster, not even fit to have two legs. Not even worth that heart beating in your chest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was staring at me like he hadn\u2019t even heard a word I said, so I added, with as much venom as I could muster. \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few times, then put his arm around the back of the couch and eyed his watch and the wish tattoo it was covering up. \u201cWell, at least disgust is still something.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, words and sentences trying to come together inside but nothing fit. Nothing made any sense. I downed the rest of my drink in one go.</p><p>\u201cYou said we ruined each other,\u201d he went on, his voice lower now. \u201cBoth of us wouldn\u2019t be here now if we hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I wiped my mouth. \u201cAnd what makes you think I like where I am?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his ankle on his knee, a flash of dark gold skin between his Topside shoes and navy pants. No socks.</p><p>\u201cBecause I introduced you to your true self. I made you see the world as you were born to see it. You\u2019re not good, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him. \u201cYou sound like Raul now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am nothing like Raul. I only see the truth. I opened you up to the life you were born to live. You came from ... you only knew this growing up. It is in your blood just as it is in my blood. We lead the lives we were meant to, lives that are exciting and dangerous and full of power. We are strong. We are so alike, so very alike, that sometimes I wish you had told me back then who you really were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou would have killed me if you found out,\u201d I said. I feared it then but I knew it now. My hand would have been tossed into the sea, like that angel doll.</p><p>He seemed to consider that, angling his head. \u201cMaybe I would have. I loved you so much, so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoving someone enough to kill them?\u201d</p><p>He smiled caustically. \u201cIt\u2019s the romantic in me.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he reached forward and put his hand on my knee. I flinched, my heart exploding in my chest, my eyes frozen wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you are afraid of me, my dear,\u201d he said, his fingers tightening on my knee ever so slightly. \u201cI\u2019m glad I disgust you. The more you feel these things so strongly, the more you\u2019ll realize how right I am. That you and I are the same. That I can help you get what I have\u2014the power, the pride, the respect. I can make you my queen. And you\u2019ll give up on trying to be good, to be better. You are better now.\u201d</p> <p>I felt as if something was lodged in my throat. \u201cI sacrificed my life in order to save Camden and his family. I am good.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, his lips going to my ear. I held absolutely still, watching the dark waves roll past beyond his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou sacrificed nothing and gained everything. You chose to be with me. Now own it.\u201d His breath tickled hot, even when he pulled away.</p><p>After placing his drink on the side table, he began to descend the stairs into his quarters, his silhouette stark against the glow of the cabin. His voice called out, \u201cSleep well, angel,\u201d and was carried away by the night wind on the Gulf. Even then, I still felt his breath on my neck. The lingering heat. Those damaging words that were oh so slowly getting under my skin.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>One moment I was backing away from the guy slowly, hands in the air in a show of peace. In the next a gunshot rang out from somewhere inside the house. I froze in place, forgetting what Gus had told me, which was to run and get the hell out of there. Instead I acted on instinct.</p><p>As the man whipped around in surprise to stare back into the house, I grabbed the gun out of my waistband. I was smart to do so because in the next second, before he even turned back around to see me, to see the pistol, he was going for the gun he had on him.</p> <p>Unfortunately for him, I beat him to it. I held the gun steady in my hand, pointed right at his head and said calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking move.\u201d</p><p>The man raised his hands slowly and a stupid smile was plastered on his face. \u201cHey man, we don\u2019t want no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus!\u201d I yelled at the house, coming closer until I was a foot away, gun still aimed and ready. \u201cEllie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the man said in surprise. \u201cYou are here for the bitch.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, I whipped the neck of the gun on his temple, right on his injury.</p><p>The man cried out and grabbed his head, dropping to the ground but I grabbed him by his shirt collar and pulled him back up. I flung him against the door, his head rattling against it and shoved the gun underneath his chin.</p><p>\u201cListen to me you piece of shit,\u201d I said, my voice breaking with rage. \u201cWhere is she? You tell me where she is. Tell me!\u201d</p><p>The man didn\u2019t look scared at all. The blackness settled in, stoking the fire, and made me drive the end of the gun further into his throat, until I was sure I could feel his pulse riding down the barrel.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d I screamed, not caring if I was attracting attention. If that gunshot was for Ellie ... so help me God. I\u2019d burn the entire house down with everyone in it.</p><p>He clamped his lips shut, as if daring me to shoot him. I knocked him in the temple again, the blood running harder down his face and then dragged him inside the house. It was dark on the first floor but the upstairs led to rooms bathed in the sunset.</p><p>\u201cGus!\u201d I yelled again.</p><p>\u201cUp here,\u201d he said from the second floor. He sounded fine.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? I\u2019ve got someone but he won\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine won\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>I went up the stairs, dragging the man up until the polo shirt began to rip. I dug one hand into his arm and kept the gun firmly pressed against his ribs. He kept stumbling over the steps thanks to the blood in his eyes but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>I walked into a small sitting area and a kitchen that faced a porch through two French doors. One of the doors was open, a salty breeze coming through. This is where Ellie would have had her dinners. Had she cooked for him? Did they have morning coffees together?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d said Gus and I followed his voice down a hallway to an open door at the end, ignoring the cramp in my hand from holding the gun so tightly. I peered inside the room and saw Gus standing at the foot of an unmade bed, a bullet hole in the wall. On the floor was a large bald guy, shot in the shoulder, a gun a foot from his open hand. Blood was soaking the carpet beneath him.</p><p>I know what I\u2019d just done to the man in my hands, but the sight still took my breath away.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Gus nodded, eyes still on him, as if he was expecting the guy to jump up from the grave. \u201cUnfortunately I had to shoot first, then ask the questions.\u201d He looked to me, noticing the guy for the first time. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cHe answered the door. He knows about Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Gus shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and kicked the guy\u2019s leg. \u201cI just do. They\u2019re gone, Javier and her. Raul. His bodyguards. These guys are sloppy. They\u2019re the ones who get left behind to water the plants.\u201d</p><p>The man in my hands grunted, as if insulted by that remark.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess we should try and get him to talk,\u201d Gus said coming closer. He peered at the man, then shot me a look I could have taken as impressed on any other day. \u201cRe-injuring an injury. Smart boy.\u201d He pointed at the bed. \u201cHere, set him down. We\u2019ve both got guns, he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I yanked him forward and then pushed him so he went flying. Blood sprayed on the sheets. It was only then that I realized what I was seeing. Ellie and Javier\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>I almost joined the man on the bed, if only to smell the pillow. I needed to know that she had slept here, that she was alive, just to remember what she smelled like. But I kept it together. Instead I noticed a pile of clothes leading into the bathroom. I went over, confident that Gus was watching Javier\u2019s house sitter and picked it up. Ellie\u2019s jeans. Her tank top. The very ones she was wearing the day she went with him.</p><p>I held them to me, like they were some injured creature.</p><p>\u201cNo blood,\u201d Gus said, his gun out and aimed at the man though his eyes were on the clothes. \u201cJust dirty. Weren\u2019t ripped off either by the looks of it.\u201d</p><p>I took a step into the bathroom. The shower was dripping sporadically, the towel damp to the touch. She was here. She showered. Shed her dirty clothes. And then what? What did she wear? Was she alone getting changed or ...</p><p>I had to choke back the bile that was flooding my throat. The thought of Javier and Ellie together. Her naked, him touching her. Taking advantage of her.</p><p>The blackness spread quickly. I felt myself floating away.</p><p>I spun around, throwing her clothes in the sink and marching right up to the boy, gun back in his face.</p><p>\u201cDid Javier hurt her?\u201d I seethed, spitting in his face.</p><p>The boy let out a little laugh and I immediately whipped the gun across his face. It cracked, crashing against bone and teeth.</p><p>\u201cHey, Camden,\u201d Gus said sternly but gently. I pretended I didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it to the other side to make things even,\u201d I threatened. \u201cNow tell me if he hurt her. Tell me what happened to her. Tell me where she is.\u201d</p><p>The man spit out blood and peered up at me through a running red eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything. Except that she deserves whatever is coming for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d Gus warned me. I bit down on my tongue until I tasted copper, my lungs squeezing and squeezing, a hot black hand wrapped around them, egging me on, wanting me to let loose and drive that gun back into the guy\u2019s head. I knew he was saying this shit to aggravate me and it fucking worked. He didn\u2019t see how serious I was. He didn\u2019t know how far I would go.</p><p>Even I didn\u2019t know how far.</p><p>But part of me was really curious.</p><p>\u201cRope,\u201d I grunted through grinding teeth. \u201cGet some rope, Gus.\u201d</p><p>Gus hesitated but went straight to the closet. He opened and let out a low whistle through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, not taking my eyes off the guy. He was still staring back at me, daring me to do something, to shoot him. I didn\u2019t want to shoot him. I wanted answers.</p><p>\u201cEllie\u2019s clothes,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThey\u2019re all here. That nutter saved them all these years.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t helping. \u201cRope, Gus.\u201d</p><p>I heard metal jangling and he came over to me with a belt. \u201cBelts work just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need three more. We\u2019re tying him to the bed.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and came back with more. \u201cDo you mind telling me what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI want answers. Then we\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you better make it fast because unless they have gunfights here every evening, someone\u2019s going to report that. You can probably bet on the cops showing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll go fast if he talks. If he doesn\u2019t talk, we\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled at that. I took the energy I wanted to pummel into his face and put it toward wrapping the belt around one arm and looping it around one of the bedposts. Gus took care of the rest. Because the guy was quite short, we had to improvise around his legs with the addition of Javier\u2019s silk ties. It felt somewhat poetic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t take long before the man was tied spread eagle on the bloody bedspread. He still didn\u2019t look scared, didn\u2019t look like he was in any pain, didn\u2019t look like he was worried.</p><p>\u201cNow, talk,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou both are so dead,\u201d he said, slurring his words around his fat lip. \u201cWhat are you going to do, shoot me in the leg? You\u2019ll only attract more attention to yourself. Besides, I\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good,\u201d I said, coming closer. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a nice experiment then, to see if I come close.\u201d I wasn\u2019t really sure who was talking, the words that were coming out of my mouth, the strange sense of calm, almost a high, that was replacing the rage. It scared me more than the anger had, than the blackness. This was something else. Sinister.</p> <p>\u201cCamden, maybe you should let me handle this,\u201d Gus said taking a step closer.</p><p>I waved him off. \u201cYou can have the next go. I think he\u2019ll tell us where she went.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged off the backpack and pulled out my secret weapon, my tattoo machine. It had ink in it too still, bright blue.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Gus asked, even though we all knew what it was.</p><p>\u201cTattoo gun,\u201d I explained. \u201cWell, we call it a machine. In this case, gun seems more fitting. Doesn\u2019t fire bullets but it can fire a lot of pain if you apply it in the right place and press down hard enough.\u201d I took the needle and pressed it against the man\u2019s stomach just below his chest, feeling his pulse underneath his skin. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered if I could tattoo\u2019s someone\u2019s organs. You know someone is going to ask for that someday.\u201d</p> <p>Finally I saw the man\u2019s eyes widen ever so slightly. I smiled back. \u201cReally,\u201d I went on. \u201cI\u2019m curious. Care to be my experiment ... what did you say your name was?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s jaw wiggled back and forth. Debating.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your first question. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamden, we don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>I ignored Gus. \u201cThis is a liner needle, thick enough. Similar to what did the tattoos around your arms. Except that yours was done properly and I\u2019ve made some adjustments with the length of the needle. I bet I could at least puncture your stomach if I pressed hard enough. Maybe fill it with ink? Wouldn\u2019t that be something? I\u2019d tattoo you from the inside out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Gus muttered under his breath.</p> <p>I plugged in the machine and stepped on the foot petal. \u201cYour name,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>The man hesitated. I didn\u2019t. I plunged the tattoo needle into the middle of his abdomen, just below his rib cage, pressing it as far as it would go. It felt so incredibly wrong to do this, going against everything I\u2019d ever been taught. It went beyond art now. It took me to another level. A bad place.</p><p>The man cried out from the pain and I kept the needle there as deep as it would go. An inch of a vibrating tattoo needle was a pain that no one should ever feel.</p><p>I almost felt sorry for him. Then I remembered who was on the line.</p><p>\u201cF-Felipe,\u201d he stuttered, \u201cFelipe Alvaraz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d I said, taking the needle out of his chest. A swirl of red blood and bright blue ink came together to form an overflowing pool of purple. \u201cNext question. Is Ellie okay? Is she hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s not hurt. She\u2019s f-fine. She\u2019s the one who did this to my head.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. Good girl.</p> <p>\u201cAnd where is Javier taking her? What does he want with her?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s lips formed a thin line. I raised the machine, reminding him.</p><p>\u201cTell me and I won\u2019t do anymore. Where are they going and why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong answer. Gus, hold the back his head please.\u201d</p><p>Gus didn\u2019t move. I shot him a steely glance. He was frowning at me, the most concerned I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cGus, do it now. We don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded ever so slowly and then leaned across the bed, pressing his big hands down on the man\u2019s forehead. He shook his head back and forth, trying to escape but Gus put his other hand on his chin, pinning him in place.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Camden?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWomen are going crazy for permanent eyeliner tattoos these days. Thought I\u2019d jump in on a trend. Get some practice on what not to do.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes flew to me in horror. I felt nothing. I didn\u2019t have any nerves left and my hand was as steady as a rock. If this was what it felt like to be Javier, putting that bullet in Uncle Jim\u2019s head, well in some sick fucking way I could understand the pull.</p><p>\u201cHold him steady. I don\u2019t want to miss.\u201d</p><p>I took the machine, turning it on again, relishing the buzzing and held it just above Felipe\u2019s eye. \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt less if you keep your eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>Actually it didn\u2019t matter. But he didn\u2019t have to know that.</p><p>I lowered the needle and the man shut his eyes tightly, struggling under Gus\u2019s sure grip. I pressed it, just a bit, into the scrunched up eyelid. The man cried out. Then I pressed it in further, like puncturing a really dense grape.</p><p>Screams filled the room.</p><p>\u201cCamden, stop,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cTell me where they went and why he has her or I\u2019ll remove it with your eyeball still attached.\u201d I pressed it a bit further. Ink filled the hole. If he was lucky, he was getting ink around his cornea, causing permanent color but no major damage. If it was through his retina, he\u2019d be blind for life.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d the man screamed and then started hyperventilating. \u201cTh-they, he, Javier, he took her to Mexico.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged a glance with Gus. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s in Mexico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravis,\u201d the man sobbed. \u201cOh please just take it out of my eye.\u201d</p><p>I felt like my lungs were filled with sand. \u201cI will,\u201d I told him, trying to breathe. \u201cWhere in Mexico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Veracruz, maybe. The Gulf Coast. Travis has places all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he taking her to see him?\u201d</p><p>He started shaking, convulsing, succumbing to the pain and panic. \u201cI don\u2019t know! It wasn\u2019t part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the plan?\u201d Gus asked quickly. The urgency was spreading.</p><p>\u201cHer parents. He wanted her to kill her parents. He thought they\u2019d come back here.\u201d</p><p>Those words sank over the room.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhy would they come back here? Aren\u2019t they working for Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Please, please just let me go.\u201d</p><p>I looked to Gus for his opinion. He only nodded. It was over. We had the info and now we had to get out of there.</p><p>\u201cHold still, Felipe,\u201d I told him and while pressing down around his eyelid, I pulled the needle out. He let out another cry of pain and I stuck the machine in my backpack. \u201cNow open your eye. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just checking to see if there\u2019s damage.\u201d</p><p>Felipe shook, afraid.</p><p>\u201cCamden, we have to go now.\u201d In the distance sirens could be heard, wailing on the breeze.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I said, getting up and leaning over him.</p><p>Felipe tried to open his eye but couldn\u2019t. I placed my fingers on either side and forced it open. It was total fucking mess. Blue ink bleeding out from the white. But his iris and pupil were uncolored. \u201cYou won\u2019t be blind. You\u2019ll just look like an idiot for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>I turned around, wiping my hands on my jeans. \u201cI guess we should leave him tied up, right?\u201d I said to Gus. \u201cIf he\u2019s lucky, someone will set him loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said in an odd voice. I turned around to look at him. Gus had a gun pointed at Felipe\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cGus, no!\u201d I yelled, but it was too late.</p><p>He pulled the trigger. He shot Felipe right in the temple, causing his head to slump to the side. Alive one minute, dead in the next.</p><p>I had trouble speaking, the gun shot still ringing through my ears. \u201cHe would have been okay,\u201d I finally said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really hurt him.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an odd look. \u201cNo, but you could have. You wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t want him dead.\u201d It felt like a lie on my lips.</p><p>Gus came over to me and placed his meaty hand on my shoulder, looking me in the eye. \u201cHe would have talked. We still have the element of surprise. We can\u2019t afford to take any chances, not after tonight.\u201d</p><p>He walked toward the hall and paused in the doorway. \u201cThis is a different world now. You\u2019re not Camden McQueen. You\u2019re Connor Malloy. In this world, you will have to do things you never thought you\u2019d do, things you wish you never did. I think you already got a taste of that today. That flavor will stay on your tongue. Now come on. We have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I followed him out the door, fighting the instinct to turn around and look at the mess we\u2019d made. Felipe\u2019s death now was as much on my hands as it was on Gus\u2019s.</p><p>Ink and blood.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>After the incident in the cockpit, Javier went back to ignoring me for a few days. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t ignoring me so much as he was keeping quiet and oddly professional. Whatever intimacy we shared, those secrets dredged up from the past, were gone, like it never happened and we were back to the strained relationship of blackmailer and hostage.</p><p>The next few days crawled by, time going slower out on the Gulf of Mexico. We saw very few boats, I suppose because it was still considered hurricane season. And yet, the weather was absolutely beautiful, clear skies that mimicked the expanse of water, stretching forever and ever. We were sailing through nothingness. This was the place you\u2019d come when you wanted to feel each and every minute pass through your skin.</p><p>I became more comfortable on the ship yet at the same time, my nerves were frying in my chest like eggs in a pan. I didn\u2019t know what was expected of me when we finally got to Mexico and I was too afraid to talk to Javier about it. Was it as I thought? Was I bait or was Raul right and I was the executioner?</p><p>Those words of his echoed in my mind, that I was no good at heart, that I was born to be bad. It was almost cheesy and laughable the way he said it, but there was no mistaking his conviction. I knew deep down that I spared Camden because it was the right thing to do, because I wanted to make up for every bad thing I had ever done to him, for everything in my life. I knew that was the reason I went with Javier. But Javier believed otherwise and I knew he wasn\u2019t going to stop until his point was proven. He held the shackles to my past and was threatening me with them.</p><p>On our last evening out at sea, we spotted land. Actually, I spotted it. I was at the front of the boat, sitting on a beach towel I\u2019d spread out on the deck. Massive Attack\u2019s \u201cAngel\u201d was playing from a set of iPod speakers I\u2019d brought out from one of the lounges, the bass building up to that first glimpse of hazy landmass, just appearing on the smooth curve of the horizon. It was so jarring, so strangely terrifying and different.</p><p>\u201cLand-ho!\u201d I yelled, then laughed despite myself. I\u2019d always wanted to say that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could hear some commotion on the back of the ship, maybe the crew or Raul taking it in. It was funny how something as normal such as land could be thrilling but out at sea, in this dream state of deepwater blue and flying fish, it meant something for us all.</p><p>I hugged my knees to my chest, unable to take my eyes away from the land as it came closer and closer. Suddenly there was a shadow over me and the air burned. Javier sat down on the deck beside me, matching my pose. He was all in cream today.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, his eyes fastened on the horizon along with mine.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hypnotic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re free out here. Don\u2019t you feel that?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a quick, curious glance. \u201cYou sound like a true sailor.\u201d</p><p>He nodded subtly. \u201cIt\u2019s why men everywhere head for the sea, all these years. Here, you can be you. And that is it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are you out here?\u201d</p><p>He squinted. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I think I\u2019m happier.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my lips together, spreading the last remnants of lip balm. \u201cThen why are we going there? Why don\u2019t we sail forever?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to me sharply, brows raised. \u201cYou would like that? To be sailing with me?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t exactly what I had said. \u201cI\u2019d be happier if we turned the boat around and went back the way we came.\u201d</p><p>He looked disappointed at the answer and brought his attention to the horizon again. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p> <p>Now was as good a time as any to bite the bullet. Even though the boat was turning slightly to run parallel to the coast, the land was still in sight, within reach, just beyond the haze.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I began slowly, \u201cdo you want me to kill Travis? Do you want me to pull the trigger?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath through his teeth and tapped his fingers against his leg a few times. \u201cEllie, I don\u2019t want you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you do. I don\u2019t want to do any of this. I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have a home. You don\u2019t have a family. You have nothing. You don\u2019t even have Camden.\u201d</p><p>I tried not to wince. \u201cI don\u2019t need any of those things.\u201d That was a lie of course, because I did need Camden. I needed him to be good. But the further we sailed, the more I knew I couldn\u2019t have him. The more he\u2019d be enveloped by his own past, just as I was slowly getting sucked into mine.</p><p>\u201cYou need to let it go.\u201d He placed his hand on the deck and leaned on it, his watch gleaming enough for me to look away. \u201cLet go of what you thought was going to happen. Things changed. You chose this path and this is the one you are on. We\u2019ll be anchoring off a beach north of Los Tuxtlas. We\u2019ll take a car to a place near Veracruz. You will find Travis and you will ... get to know him. This is where your path is going, Ellie, and this is the only way now.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cAnd what then? I get to know him, which I still think is ridiculous since he\u2019ll know who I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you, he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019d set you up to fail?\u201d he asked so sharply that I had to look at him. The sun had browned his face even more over the last few days and by contrast his eyes seemed lighter than ever. I wished he was wearing sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I think,\u201d I finally responded.</p><p>\u201cYou will get to know him. You will lead him to me. I will kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you wanted to. Only if you think you\u2019re strong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling people has nothing to do with being strong.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his chin, locking me in his gaze which was becoming harder by the second. \u201cIt does when it\u2019s someone who deserves it. Who needs it. Do you not remember what he\u2019s done to us?\u201d</p><p>My head jerked. \u201cTo us?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and he quickly got to his feet. He walked down the length of the boat toward the twin anchors, his loose pants billowing in the breeze like a flag.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why but I got up, placing the speakers on top of the towel so it wouldn\u2019t blow away into the ocean, and followed him. We were motoring today, the jib and mainsail furled tightly, the ship easy to walk on.</p><p>He stopped at the front and leaned one arm against the jib mast. I stood a foot back, feeling the weird energy that was rolling off of him. I waited for him to speak which seemed like hours.</p><p>\u201cOnce I found out that Travis wanted to cozy up to them, to Los Zetas, I knew in my heart of all hearts that things would end badly. Travis switched sides, even knowing what had happened to my father and my mother. He knew I would never make nice with them, that I would always fight them, that I would always try to bury them. Travis did it anyway, I think, to get away from me. Because I was threatening to him, you see? He knew everyone liked me better, that I was younger, smarter, faster. I was better than him in every way and he wanted me out of the picture. What better way to ... hurt me ... than to join them. Almost brilliant, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded even though he couldn\u2019t see me. He sighed and went on. \u201cWe split. It got ugly. Then it got uglier. We were alike so he wanted to make the same points that I tended to make. But he is a brutal man. You may think the same of me too, but you don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of know what he\u2019s capable of,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>At that he turned around and his eyes drifted down to my leg before turning around and facing the horizon. \u201cYes, yes you do. And so Travis, Mr. Raines, he went and took something very dear to me.\u201d</p><p>It all clicked together. The ship rolling beneath my feet. \u201cBeatriz.\u201d I breathed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, my oldest sister. The one who was in charge of the younger ones. My closest friend, really. He found her. He raped her, forcing her husband to watch. Then he killed her. Killed him. Killed their children. Cut off their heads and put them in front of a busy hotel, just outside the lobby. Burned the bodies nearby. Took a lot of pictures.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. I\u2019d actually seen this on the news.</p><p>He acknowledged my expression. \u201cSo you know. You\u2019ve seen it. He made his point and was sure the whole world saw it, made sure I\u2019d see it no matter where I was. My sister and her family were an example of what Mexican drug violence was becoming. No one would ever forget what happened. And of course, he made sure I knew what was coming next. That no one I loved would ever be safe.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my palms on my pants. \u201cAre your other sisters safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he said, before turning to face me. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I am going to Mexico. Even when Travis is dead, I can\u2019t count on someone else not coming after them. We are like those zombies you see on TV, you know. We never really die. Someone else pops up in our place that looks like us and talks like us. We\u2019re all interchangeable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not like\u2014\u201d I began and then cut myself off because I was going to say he was not like Travis when I knew he was. He wasn\u2019t as depraved as Travis but he was still something else. Something bad and deadly and deplorable.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said with a small smile. \u201cAnd because I know I am, I know when we\u2019re safe and we aren\u2019t safe. Not while he\u2019s still alive. We have to kill him. Do you see now?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, finding it crazy that I was understanding his logic. Once upon a time I\u2019d wanted to throw acid in the man\u2019s face and watch as his skin melted away, as I took his freedom away. I never did it \u2013 Javier got in the way. And now he was in my way again, this time to end it once and for all.</p><p>I did want Travis dead. I knew it now. But whether that made me strong or not wasn\u2019t part of the equation. I would do this for myself, for Javier\u2019s sister, for her children, for the countless others who died or were tortured at his hands. For everyone that ever suffered because of drugs and money and guns and crime and everything I had once cloaked myself with.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, feeling the landmass change in front of my eyes, turning from fear to something I wanted to embrace, \u201ctell me everything I need to know.\u201d</p><p>A grin slowly spread across his face.</p><p>The next morning I awoke to a deep rumbling and excited cries. I got up quickly, feeling the excitement and slid on a dress that reached down to the floor. It was one I\u2019d picked up during an outing to Miami with Javier back in the day, a bright green and yellow floral thing that managed to look both fashionable and hide my scars at the same time.</p><p>Of course, my scars were beautiful now that Camden transformed them. But I guess old habits still died hard.</p><p>I ran up to the first deck and peered off the side. To our left was the huge expanse of a sandy beach flanked by rich green cliffs and lush forest further inland. The land was so massive that it literally took my breath away.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Javier\u2019s voice came soaring from the bridge. I shielded my eyes to look up at him. At the front of the ship, the anchors dropped in, the mechanics whirring until they made contact with the soft sea floor.</p><p>I looked back at the land. We were here. Mexico.</p><p>I stood at the railing for some time as everyone strutted purposefully around me, getting prepared. The beach seemed to go on forever and looked deserted at first, with no sign of civilization. But when my eyes adjusted to the glitter of the water and the haze of the morning sun, I could see a couple of bright tents set up on the beach, nestled into some palm trees and a fishing boat dragged onto shore. It wasn\u2019t the white sand beach I expected to see but something more earthy and wild.</p><p>A hand was at my elbow. I knew who it was without looking.</p><p>\u201cAre you all packed?\u201d Javier asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWhat beach is this again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaya Escondida. Hidden beach.\u201d His hand dropped away and I could feel his eyes slicing down my back. \u201cI loved you in this dress.\u201d</p><p>Then he walked away, barking orders in Spanish at the crew as they prepared the zodiac to be lowered into the water. I chewed on my lip for a few seconds, my mind quieted, my insides tumbling.</p><p>Soon me, Javier, Raul, Peter and one of the crew boys, Oscar, were taking careful steps down the ladder and into the zodiac. A wave flowed past and pitched the boat away from me as I climbed in. I lost my footing momentarily, but Javier was there, both hands wrapped around my arms, holding me in place.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, holding me too close to him.</p><p>I nodded anxiously, wanting him to step away. But he held on, leading me over to my seat. Oscar followed after me and lowered the rest of the bags onto the boat. Then one of the crew boys threw the rope back in the boat and we were puttering backward. It felt like we were all moving as slow as the waves, rolling up and down, the ship, his beautiful Beatriz, growing smaller and smaller as we headed toward the shore.</p><p>Javier told us that landing on the beach might be a bit tricky since we\u2019d have to surf the zodiac in. It wasn\u2019t exactly the most graceful or classy way of getting to shore, but a ship like Javier\u2019s would have to be as inconspicuous as possible. There was no way we could dock it at the marina without drawing attention to ourselves. Here, at Escondida, we really were hidden. There were no resorts, no restaurants, no roads. Just surf, sand and jungle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luckily, Javier was just as skilled at maneuvering the zodiac as he was at killing people. We crashed onto the shore only getting mildly wet and soon the men had jumped out of the boat and were quickly hauling it further inland.</p><p>Javier came over to help me but I climbed out of the boat before he had a chance to touch me again. For someone who said he\u2019d never touch me, he\u2019d been doing a lot more of it lately. Once all of our gear was on the beach, my duffel bag plus a few leather satchels for the rest, Javier nodded at Oscar to return to the vessel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d he told him. \u201cYou keep her out there, she\u2019ll be good even in the biggest storm. If I call you and tell you to leave, you do it. Take her to the resort near Campeche, to the marina. I have a space reserved there just in case. Wait there until I get in touch with you. That ship, she is your biggest priority.\u201d</p><p>Oscar nodded eagerly, happy to have this responsibility on his hands. I wondered how trustworthy he was then thought trust would never be an issue with Javier in charge. The consequences would always be too vile.</p> <p>The four of us stood on the beach, our ankles soaked from the sea, and watched as Oscar fought the zodiac back through the waves. There were a few times when it looked like it was going to flip over but he managed to power through and soon he was tendered to Beatriz, the ship gleaming in the distance.</p><p>We all looked at each other, and for the first time since landing, I felt the real gravity of land beneath my feet. The way it held me there. What it meant to be ashore.</p><p>Javier read my face and waved his arm. \u201cCome on, we have to get moving.\u201d</p><p>He turned and headed off toward a stream that snaked out of the jungle, a tributary that almost made it to the sea. We walked along the sand, my eyes drawn to the campers down the beach. They looked like a Mexican family, lighting a campfire, kids running around. I wonder what they thought of the yacht perched off shore, of our arrival, or if they thought anything about it at all.</p><p>Once we were in the forest, the temperature spiked. We were all sweating in seconds as the overhanging trees and dense vegetation seemed to hold the heat in. We came across a narrow dirt path and took that for a few minutes, all of us silent, thinking and wary.</p> <p>The smell of horse shit assaulted my nose, as did a beam of sun that suddenly broke through the trees and illuminated the spot in front of us. There was a clearing with a small paddock and a shanty. Six bony looking horses stood there listlessly swatting flies with their tails.</p><p>\u201cHola?\u201d Javier called out. We waited, hearing a commotion in the shanty and the door flew open. An old Mexican man with long grey hair half tucked up under a baseball cap came out, a book in his hands. He looked as bony as the horses in his care.</p><p>Javier spoke rapid fire Spanish to him, too fast for me to pick up. From what I gathered this was to be our transportation for a while. I eyed the horses nervously. I personally loved horses and had always been comfortable on one, but heading through the Mexican jungle in who the fuck knows where with a cartel was something different.</p><p>Finally the man nodded and clapped his hands together enthusiastically before heading back to his shanty.</p><p>Javier jerked a thumb in his direction. \u201cThat\u2019s Burt Reynolds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurt Reynolds?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged gracefully. \u201cThat\u2019s what he calls himself. Doesn\u2019t speak English, so don\u2019t bother trying. He\u2019s taking us to Montepio. Only way in or out of here is by horseback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr boat,\u201d I mused and watched as Burt Reynolds came back out of the shanty with a bunch of bridles and packs. He moved spritely for an old, withered-looking man and in no time the horses were ready. He gestured for us to come over and started yammering in Spanish to me about a small buckskin mare.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Churro,\u201d Javier leaned in to me. \u201cTry not to eat her.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced at his bad joke and introduced myself to the horse by letting her smell my hand. She was entirely disinterested.</p><p>There was no saddle, just straps and packs wrapped around the withers and chest, where my duffel bag was now secured.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known I\u2019d be getting on a horse today, I would have worn jeans,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>Burt Reynolds came over to me, giving me the signal for a leg up, complete with a toothy grin. I shook my head, having no interest in giving the man a peep show, no matter how badly he looked like he needed it.</p><p>Suddenly Javier\u2019s hands were around my waist, his long fingers nearly meeting in the middle. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Before I could protest he was lifting me up somehow, my legs akimbo. I pulled up the hem of my dress just in time, grateful that it was wide and flowing and stretched across the back of the horse.</p> <p>Burt was on the other side of the horse, trying to help me settle in and he started squawking about something. The word \u201ctattoo.\u201d Javier\u2019s head looked up sharply, his eyes flaring, mine going straight to the leg on Burt\u2019s side. The skirt was hiked up to my knee exposing my cherry blossoms, so bright and daring in the tropical sunlight.</p><p>Javier zipped over and looked at my leg. It seemed that Burt was quite pleased with the tattoo, but Javier wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He ran his finger down one of my scars, following a twisting stem. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tattoo, obviously. Even Burt knew what it was.\u201d I wish I could say I felt some kind of relief in Javier finally seeing it but I didn\u2019t. I felt nervous and I didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you do this? It\u2019s still raised!\u201d His voice was hoarse. He kept looking at the tattoo, feeling it.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in Vegas. Camden did it,\u201d I told him. My eyes shot to Burt to see what he was making of all of this. He was watching the both of us, smile locked, until he met my eyes. Then he went off to busy himself with Raul and Peter who were bringing their horses over to the fence post in order to mount them.</p><p>Javier didn\u2019t seem to be able to take in that information. He looked confused, lost, off-guard. This was so rare to see and yet I felt no pride in making him that way. I just wanted to forget about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d he asked, swallowing hard. \u201cYour leg was fine before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t,\u201d I said, feeling irritated now. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve seen it. Why aren\u2019t you wearing shorts now, instead of jeans when it\u2019s a hundred degrees outside?\u201d</p><p>I hated that question \u2013 I\u2019d dealt with it my whole life. I gathered the reins in my hands and lightly clucked to Churro, Javier being pushed out of the way by the horse\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI think we have more important things to discuss than a damn tattoo.\u201d</p><p>Javier reached up and grabbed the reins, yanking the horse\u2019s head back.</p><p>Burt Reynolds cried out, admonishing him but Javier didn\u2019t care. He glared at me until I could feel the heat, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the leather.</p><p>\u201cYou let that boy mark you?\u201d he sneered.</p><p>Oh, of course this was a jealousy thing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said deliberately, leaning forward on the horse\u2019s neck, \u201cI did. I felt like I needed more. One tattoo just wasn\u2019t doing it for me.\u201d</p><p>I hoped that made him angry. Really angry. In a sick way I wanted him to hit me. Just so I could forever throw it in his face and make him feel like less of a man. Another part of me was afraid that it might actually happen. Because the way he was looking at me was like a snake about to strike, a face that was both ice and fire, someone that wanted blood and vengeance and to prove just how fucking powerful he was.</p><p>We were locked like that in a showdown of pin-prick pupils and venomous hearts until Raul got our attention.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break up ... whatever this is, but we have to make it to Montepio by noon, is that right?\u201d</p><p>Finally Javier broke the staring contest, letting go of the reins with a sharp inhale. \u201cYes, thank you. We do. Let\u2019s get a move on.\u201d</p><p>He mounted his horse with ease, springing up like a gymnast and Burt led us out of the corral. I straightened up off the horse\u2019s neck, feeling dazed, like I had been caught in some dream and looked down at my fingers, only now noticing that I had them balled up into fists. I opened my palm and saw blood where my own nails had dug in.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>\u201cSo, Camden,\u201d Gus said, his hands squeezing the wheel like a stress ball. \u201cWhen did Ellie first break your heart?\u201d</p><p>We were right outside of San Antonio and heading toward the border crossing at Nuevo Laredo. Apparently the border there was pretty lax and Gus didn\u2019t expect us to get questioned much, if at all. The Mexicans didn\u2019t really care who came into the country, even though the border line-up on the other side promised to be a nightmare.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t take chances, though. I was all poised to cross over as Connor Malloy, a regular Joe and not at all a wanted fugitive.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she broke my heart?\u201d I asked, looking at the flat, dry scenery skirt past us. Ranches, ranches, ranches.</p><p>I saw him shrug out of the corner of my eye. \u201cOnly a hunch. Not many men turn into the tattoo artist version of Lawrence Olivier in Marathon Man. Just swap torture with a dentist drill for a tattoo needle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the movie,\u201d I muttered. I looked down at his watch on my wrist, feeling heavy and foreign. It was four in the afternoon and we\u2019d been driving non-stop since we left Ocean Springs. We were lucky enough to get out of Javier\u2019s house without anyone seeing us, taking the beach around to the car, but we didn\u2019t want to push our luck anymore. The Mexican border seemed extremely inviting for both of us, now that Gus had killed two people.</p><p>I shook my head, trying to make sense out of what happened and as before, no sense came. I completely lost every sense of right and wrong and good and bad. I became this black, suffocating thing, everything I feared in others. I became Javier. I became my father.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t me. I didn\u2019t want to see that person again. He was getting locked in my head along with everything else I didn\u2019t want to think about.</p><p>Or maybe that person was what happened when all the things I hid deep inside finally came out to play.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Gus pondered. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>It was true, I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. But Gus talking and asking me shit was the first time in days he\u2019d shown any interest in me at all. He was treating me with a bit more respect now. Maybe he was impressed. Or scared that I\u2019d tattoo his balls in his sleep.</p><p>I sighed and sat back in my seat, hands in my lap, fidgeting. \u201cI fell in love with Ellie in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweethearts, huh?\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cNo. Just friends. And only for a short while. We were the resident freaks of the school. Ellie with her limp and scars. Me and my penchant for wearing makeup and a lot of vinyl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakeup?\u201d</p><p>The way Gus said it, I knew what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I explained. \u201cI\u2019m not gay. At least, that\u2019s what everyone jumps to as a conclusion. Even my father. I was a goth, an artist. The Art Fag, as they called me. Whatever, I had a lot of names. And I was beat on often as you can imagine. Ellie was my only friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see. A friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Isn\u2019t that the plight of every geeky teenager out there? Always doomed to be the friend? So anyway, I was in love with her and every day I\u2019d try to work up the nerve and the guts to tell her how I felt and to kiss her. One day, I just did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was that?\u201d</p><p>I chewed on my lip, trying to figure out how best to explain it. \u201cIt took something away from me.\u201d After I first felt Ellie\u2019s lips on mine, the warmth, sweetness, I was never the same. She took a piece of me that I was unable to get back until I was inside her, feeling her heart and her sins in my hands.</p> <p>I was so afraid I\u2019d never get to experience that again. All those years of longing, of looking for that part of me and she was the only one who could supply it. She really was the only one I truly, drowning in my passion, loved.</p><p>Even at her very worst, she made me want to be better man. To be good enough for the both of us.</p><p>\u201cShe must have cared about you a lot to walk away with that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is no man,\u201d I spat out. \u201cHe\u2019s a monster.\u201d</p><p>I could tell Gus wanted to say something about that but he didn\u2019t. He just gave a grunt.</p> <p>I took the subject around the corner. \u201cDo you think Ellie knows he wants her to kill her parents? I can\u2019t figure it out. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much reason to any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong,\u201d I argued, jabbing my finger on the dusty dashboard. \u201cYou know how calculated he is. He\u2019s had six years to come after her. There\u2019s a reason behind everything now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing there\u2019s a reason isn\u2019t helping us get an answer.\u201d</p><p>I studied Gus, his jowly face helped only by his beard, small eyes, grey bushy brows. He looked like your friendly neighbor on a TV show, a real Mr. Friendly. But this was a man who had shot and killed two people and didn\u2019t seem to care much about it. I wondered if I\u2019d ever surround myself with normal people again or if this was the life I\u2019d have to lead forever. I wondered if this is what it felt like to be Ellie, to never know who to trust or where you\u2019ll next lay your head.</p><p>I chewed on my lip again, feeling some of that pain come back, when I first caught her robbing me. If only she\u2019d really decided to go straight and get a job in Palm Valley and settle down. I would have somehow got out of the money laundering business ... I at least would have tried. I never would have had to catch her. We\u2019d never have to run or worry about getting caught. We could have settled down in my tiny house above the shop and lived a good life.</p> <p>But I guess Javier would have shown up anyway. Wanting her in exchange for fifty thousand dollars. What on earth was worth fifty thousand dollars? Was it just to kill her parents? To kill Travis? Was Javier seriously going around and killing everyone who had ever hurt her, even without her say?</p><p>Or was it more?</p><p>A flash of him and her flooded my head, bare legs tangled together, my art on her limb, his hands tracing her scars, the flowers, everything. My throat closed up. It couldn\u2019t be that. It couldn\u2019t be that. Because if it was, it meant one of two things: he would either rape her or take full advantage of her and if that was the case, I\u2019d take that tattoo machine and draw him a new asshole before I rammed it straight into the motherfucker\u2019s skull. And if it wasn\u2019t that, Ellie must have wanted him.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright, boy?\u201d Gus asked, taking his foot off the gas. \u201cYour lip is bleeding.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hand where a drop had fallen, ruby red and glossy. Like the finest ink. I wiped my hand across my mouth, smearing it. Art.</p><p>\u201cCamden!\u201d Gus barked.</p><p>I jumped in my seat and looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou looked all sorts of wrong there.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and leaned my head back. \u201cJust thinking of things I shouldn\u2019t. So once we get across the border, then what. \u2018They went to Mexico\u2019 is kind of a vague route to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. We\u2019ll ask around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs asking around about one of the largest and deadliest drug cartels in Mexico, while being two gringos in Mexico, really the wisest decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my sources,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they haven\u2019t turned?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>He shot me a quick grin. \u201cEveryone has their price these days.\u201d</p><p>I was getting to know that a little too well.</p><p>Despite me fumbling with my passport like a god damn fool, the border crossing was easy. Gus was right, they didn\u2019t really care who was going in. We kept driving until nightfall, when we reached a small settlement just before Monterrey. That\u2019s when we were pulled over by a state police officer wearing a ski mask while holding an automatic assault rifle.</p><p>\u201cBuenos noches. Where are you going?\u201d he asked us, switching to English once he noticed how white we were.</p><p>\u201cTo see a friend of ours,\u201d Gus answered amicably.</p><p>The officer peered into the back of the GTO. We might have been able to go through the border with no inspection but I didn\u2019t know if it would be the same case here. I tried not to tense up but fuck, what kind of a cop wears a ski mask?</p><p>Then he rapped on the roof of the car and told us to drive on.</p><p>Gus gave him a small wave and we roared off. We were a ways down the highway before he let out a large puff of air.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked him, not used to seeing him anxious. It made me worry.</p><p>\u201cThe police here are all controlled by the Los Zetas.\u201d</p><p>I watched the buildings grow larger and more affluent as we headed toward the city. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. But we\u2019re good. We don\u2019t belong to any cartel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat who casts doubt on himself is often as good as dead,\u201d he said.</p><p>I looked at him askew. \u201cDid you just make that up?\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. \u201cYes. No good?\u201d</p><p>I grinned and shook my head, letting out some of my frayed nerves. \u201cNo Gus, it\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><p>We drove around the city of Monterrey, a huge, sprawling mess that grew darker and quieter as we went on. Gus told me the entire city had a sort of unofficial curfew, which made our car with its fake Cali plates stand out. Even though the city was still one of the largest cosmopolises in all of Mexico, it was very much under a different sort of law and whether we were looking for the Los Zetas or not didn\u2019t matter when we were two white dudes in a cool car. Prime kidnapping material.</p><p>Soon, we were pulling up to a small house in a nearby town that seemed to consist of a gas station and a post office. It didn\u2019t look like much of anything but it seemed to be an unofficial hotel and the plump woman who answered the door with two children at her heels, up way past their bedtime, was more than happy to let us stay.</p><p>She led us through to the back of the house where we had our own room and a tiny bathroom. American magazines sat on a bedside table.</p><p>\u201cI stayed here once, a long time ago,\u201d he said as he stretched out on one of the tiny twin beds. \u201cShe was thin back then, if you can believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo jokes in one day,\u201d I said. \u201cA record.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, then covered it up by turning off the light. There was a chance he was finally warming up to me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother getting under the sheets, the oppressive heat filled up our tiny room in minutes and the rickety fan overhead did nothing disperse it. I closed my eyes and thought of Ellie.</p><p>There was a moment back in high school that Ellie never knew about. I never wanted to tell her, what would be the point? We were both sixteen and hadn\u2019t talked properly for years. It was after I\u2019d done the photography project on her and frankly I knew she hated my guts. She considered me a freak, thinking I was creepy and obsessive and a bit of a stalker. Sadly, I was all of those things. That was just me and it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>There had been a school dance, the \u201cSpring Fling\u201d or something lame like that. Ellie didn\u2019t go. I never expected her to. But I did. Just to be a pain in the ass, really. I wanted to show up and have people whisper to each other, \u201coh The Queen is here.\u201d The attention, no matter how fucked up, was better than staying at home listening to my dad scream at my stepmother. He always would scream at me after.</p><p>I went, dressed in a tux, like a normal person, except my tux was pastel blue. Yeah, I was trying to do an homage to Dumb and Dumber and it was lost on most of the school. So, of course I was already shoved by a few dickheads by the time I\u2019d arrived.</p><p>But there was this one dick, Curran Simpson, a real fucking jackass with big fists and a bigger mouth, who came barrelling up to me and spilled all of his punch down the front of my tux.</p><p>The anger was already threatening to come out. I did what I could to keep it inside, to do what I had always done, which was to take it, take it, take it.</p><p>Then he says to me, his voice low, as if he didn\u2019t want to be heard, \u201cWhere\u2019s your retarded girlfriend? The one you\u2019re stalking all the time. Have you ever stolen her fake leg yet? Do you jack off to it?\u201d</p><p>None of what he was saying really made any sense. He was a fucking idiot through and through. But it didn\u2019t matter. This was the first time I\u2019d lost it, when I let the blackness out and I was high above my body, pummeling the shit out of the guy. I don\u2019t know how I did it. Suddenly he was knocked to the ground and I was on top of him, punching him like a man possessed. I got maybe three good hits before one of his friends pulled me off and held me there while he retaliated. And of course he retaliated worse.</p><p>I had a broken nose from it and Curran was suspended for a week. Even though I threw the first punch, even though I actually knocked the big fucker down, no one ever mentioned it. The teachers were so used to me getting beat up, that they were more than happy to put him out of school for a while. I wasn\u2019t his only victim. As for me, it got twisted into an urban legend, that Camden finally went crazy and we better make sure he doesn\u2019t bring homemade bombs to school. The kids definitely stayed away from me if they hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>That was probably my first shining moment, that feeling of actually winning for once. The adrenaline coupled with the fear of myself and what I could do, what I might do, was addicting. But I never acted out like that again. I wouldn\u2019t do it for just anyone.</p><p>Only for her. Only for Ellie.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep soon after those thoughts because before I knew it, the morning sun was streaming in through the window and I thought I was going to choke on the humidity. I sat up, feeling disgusting. The bed was soaked from my sweat and when I put my glasses on, they fogged up in seconds.</p><p>I got up and pulled off my sticky shirt just as Gus came out from the bathroom, completely dressed and looking ready to go.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said as he eyed my chest and abs.</p><p>I looked down. Sometimes I\u2019d forget about my tattoos. Or rather I\u2019d forget that not everyone had them. \u201cNot a fan of tattoos, Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after seeing you wield a needle,\u201d he said and motioned for me to turn around. I did so, not feeling shy in the slightest. If there was anything I loved to talk about it, it was my tattoos. And, well, I\u2019d been working out pretty much every day for the last seven years. My body was hard and ripped as shit and it felt good to make Gus take notice, to let him know that I wasn\u2019t some pushover, that I could do more than hold my own in a fight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I guess I already proved that the other day.</p><p>\u201cThese are something else, you do them yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the ones I can reach but I\u2019ve drawn them all. I have a few artists in Palm Springs that I trust to carry them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they everywhere?\u201d He was wincing as he said it.</p> <p>I winked at him. \u201cI think that\u2019s between Ellie and I.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an unimpressed look then went over to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll go get us some breakfast for the road. Can you be ready in five? We\u2019re meeting someone.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and ten minutes later we were back in the GTO, munching on a doughy pastry, the smell of hot dirt blowing in through the open windows.</p><p>\u201cWho is this someone?\u201d I asked, crumbs scattering in my lap.</p><p>He said, \u201cAn old friend.\u201d Wasn\u2019t that always the case? The old friend. That was the case between us right now. Me and Ellie\u2019s old friend.</p> <p>We drove for some time, flipping through an assortment of Spanish radio stations, before the air began to lift a bit and the sharp bite of salt hit us. The Gulf of Mexico sparkled amid refinery plants as we hit Tampico. We went through the city sprawl, the startling amount of Starbucks and Burger Kings and Walmarts, before we entered the real Mexico again and were hurtling down a pale dirt road, dust flying behind us like flour, dodging giant potholes and overhanging branches.</p><p>We eventually arrived to a little piece of paradise. A cream sand beach was lapped by azure water while a beach shack stood nestled in a crop of palm trees. Gus pulled the car up beside a mud-splattered Jeep just as a man with an even bigger mustache than his came out of the house, arms wide.</p><p>\u201cGus!\u201d the man cried out. Gus gave me a sheepish look.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dan,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe\u2019s very ... affectionate.\u201d</p><p>We got out of the car and Dan immediately embraced him. I held back a chuckle as Gus awkwardly hugged him back. Gus then waved me over.</p><p>I shuffled through the sand, absently enjoying the breeze that washed over me while keeping my senses on high alert. As nice \u2013 or huggy \u2013 as Dan seemed, I wasn\u2019t one to trust the old friends. Sometimes I wondered if I even trusted Gus.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Camden,\u201d Dan said, taking my hand in a two-handed shake. He was about a foot shorter than me, in his early fifties, with a huge handlebar mustache and fake Ray-Ban sunglasses. His hair was cropped short and unusually dark and he had pock marks on both cheeks left over from bad acne. His teeth were yellowed. Overall the vibe was genuine and I was glad for the lack of hostility so far, even though I knew things could always turn.</p><p>If they haven\u2019t turned already. Gus\u2019s phrase repeated in my head.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dan,\u201d I told him, trying to make my smile look easy. \u201cBeautiful little spot you got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d he said, eyes gleaming. \u201cOh you must come inside. I\u2019ll get you Americans some beer. Real beer, you know?\u201d</p><p>We went inside and sat down on his small screened porch that faced the incoming surf and chugged back three Bohemias. The small talk came first, Gus and Dan catching up on old times while Gus would occasionally fill me in as Dan smoked like a chimney, one cigarette after another. They knew each other when Dan used to live in San Diego, illegally, and Gus\u2019s ex-girlfriend and his wife were friends. Dan eventually got deported, even though Gus tried to pull a few favors for him with the LAPD, and settled here to open his own business renting kayaks to tourists. I didn\u2019t know what happened to the business since I didn\u2019t see any kayaks and the Tampico area wasn\u2019t a big tourist attraction. But fronts were fronts and I knew how to spot one.</p><p>Dan\u2019s wife was now dead, something he glossed over very quickly and I knew from the way his eyes burned at the mention of her that it wasn\u2019t accidental. The drug cartels had their fingers in absolutely everything here.</p><p>\u201cNow, Gus,\u201d Dan said, his face growing serious after he finished off the remainder of his beer. \u201cYou know I love to see old friends. When I heard what happened to you ...\u201d</p><p>A strange hush came over them and both their eyes darted to me and back again. This thing, this mysterious health problem that had afflicted Gus had come up again and again but I had yet to figure it out. I didn\u2019t want to ask. Maybe I was going to have to. I didn\u2019t want the man having a stroke on me if that\u2019s what it came down to.</p> <p>\u201cI miss you, you know?\u201d Dan continued. \u201cBut please tell me what brought you here all of the sudden.\u201d</p><p>Gus sucked in his upper lip until the bristles of his mustache stood out. \u201cWe need to find Travis Raines. He\u2019s somewhere in Mexico, maybe Veracruz.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes nearly bulged out of his head. \u201cYou want to find Travis Raines? The Hombre Blanco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, seriously, that\u2019s his nickname?\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>Dan ignored me, getting out of his wicker chair and walking over to the kitchen. \u201cMy God, my God. We need some coffee. Yes, we do.\u201d</p><p>Gus and I exchanged a glance as Dan put on the kettle and began carrying things over to the table for us, cups, saucers, a sugar bowl, non-dairy creamer. Then he sat back down and lit another cigarette. His hand shaking.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you need to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much him that we need to find but a man who is after Travis. He has a woman with him. We think he\u2019s planning on using her to assassinate the Hombre Blanco.\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few times, puffing back rapidly. \u201cI see. And this is a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will get the woman killed. Getting to Travis Raines isn\u2019t easy. If it was, he\u2019d already be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Gus, I know this. What do you think I do all day here? Think of fairy tales?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Dan imploring. \u201cThe woman, Ellie, is very important to me. The man she\u2019s with will hurt her. She\u2019s not a gun for hire. She\u2019ll have to do it against her will and it will end very badly, for everyone, if we don\u2019t get to her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier Bernal,\u201d Gus supplied.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes widened and he quickly put out his cigarette. \u201cJavier is here in Mexico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dan gave me a petulant look and got up to the kettle which was just starting to steam. \u201cYes, I know him. We all know him. We are all part of the same family when you trace us back. Sinoala.\u201d</p><p>The other extremely dangerous and fanatical cartel.</p><p>Dan poured the water into a French press and brought it over to the table.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds like something Javi would do.\u201d</p><p>And now he knew him on a first name basis. This wasn\u2019t right. This couldn\u2019t be good. I shot Gus a look but he was focused on the coffee. I wanted to keep staring at him, get him to look up, but Dan was already observing me, eyes narrowed.</p><p>I cleared my throat and nodded at the press. \u201cLocal coffee?\u201d</p><p>Dan watched me for a few painful beats before he said, \u201cYes, of course. None of that American shit.\u201d</p><p>Gus smiled. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure half of the American shit comes from Mexico at any rate.\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged lightly. \u201cThis is true. But we don\u2019t put chemicals in our coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like what you\u2019re putting in your lungs,\u201d Gus joked.</p><p>And suddenly they seemed like old pals ribbing each other again. Maybe I was creating these situations in my head. Maybe my gut was wrong.</p><p>But my gut was never wrong.</p><p>Dan poured us both a cup of the fragrant, dark liquid and said, \u201cDo you know where Javi is?\u201d</p><p>We shook our heads. \u201cNo,\u201d Gus spoke, \u201cwe figured you could tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be a friend, I guess.\u201d Gus was still smiling but his posture changed ever so subtly. He was aware now, more alert. Maybe because Dan was being stubborn. Or maybe because Dan and Javier were friends, something Gus couldn\u2019t have seen coming, and friends sometimes go to great lengths to protect each other. If my devotion to Ellie had brought me here, perhaps Dan\u2019s loyalty to Javier was just as strong.</p><p>The bad feeling in my gut multiplied when Dan put the coffee press down and one of his hands, so easily, so slowly, went to his side and under the table. I didn\u2019t look, I didn\u2019t acknowledge it. I only sipped my coffee all the while knowing he had a gun under that table, maybe affixed to the underside, and it was pointing at us.</p><p>We wouldn\u2019t be walking out of here alive. Not if we could do something about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know where Javi is. But Travis is in Veracruz. Fucking Zetas have taken over the whole city, such a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere in Veracruz?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dan smiled wryly and took a sip of his coffee, bringing his hand back on the table. \u201cI do not have his address, if that is what you\u2019re asking. It\u2019s a large compound in the hills. Where the rich bastards live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think Ellie will get close to him?\u201d It was a longshot, but one I felt I needed to ask. If I was right and there was a gun under the table, he\u2019d be telling us the truth because the dead don\u2019t talk. The dead wouldn\u2019t spoil this attempt on Travis\u2019s life, someone both Javier, Dan, and maybe Ellie, would want killed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said carefully. He put his coffee cup back down. One hand went under the table while the other was going for a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cCan I have one?\u201d I said quickly, putting my hand out. \u201cI always wanted to try the Mexican kind.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cOkay, fine.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a cigarette, his other hand never straying. I held mine out for the Zippo lighter and he gave me that too.</p><p>I really hoped Gus was right about Coffee Mate being extremely flammable, and that the theory extended to all non-dairy creamers, not just the name brands. If he was wrong, we\u2019d be dead. But if I sat there and did anything else, we\u2019d be dead too. The minute either of us would reach for our guns, he\u2019d know and pull the trigger. He had the upper hand. I had the lower cut.</p><p>I started playing with the flame, running my thumb over the wheel again and again. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know what Javi\u2019s plan could be? I thought you were good friends.\u201d</p><p>Dan stiffened. \u201cWe are not good friends. I admire him. He\u2019s done a lot for us and he\u2019s stayed loyal, unlike Travis.\u201d So much animosity seethed off of his words. I knew what had happened to Dan\u2019s wife now. \u201cTravis knows how hated he is. I think he\u2019s even a threat to the Zetas. No one just switches sides like that for no reason. He has people following him everywhere he goes and, as you would think, he doesn\u2019t leave his house all that often. Just to the market on Saturdays where he walks around like he\u2019s Marlon Brando.\u201d</p><p>I made the flame dance back and forth. Dan\u2019s one hand stayed under the table. With his other he put a cigarette to his mouth.</p><p>I tilted my head to look at Gus. His face was drawn together, looking incredibly sad. It must have hurt, what he was realizing about his friend.</p><p>\u201cHey Gus, would you mind passing me that non-dairy creamer over there.\u201d I nodded at the container.</p><p>He swallowed hard and handed it to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur coffee too strong for you?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, quite.\u201d I poured some of the powder in my coffee and then screwed the lid off of it. I held the container in my hand. Dan was watching me, puzzled.</p><p>Finally he said, \u201cChecking for poison?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWant your lighter back?\u201d</p> <p>He frowned but nodded and put his cigarette between his lips. I reached across to give him back the lighter and said, \u201cPerhaps Gus and I should be going. We seem to be taking up a lot of your time.\u201d I wanted to get this show rolling.</p><p>His eyes flicked to Gus and back to me. His hands grasped the lighter but I didn\u2019t let go. I stared deep at him and gave him a little smile. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a gun under the table would you?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth hitched up. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty observant for an American. What gang are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a tattoo artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Gus said in a long breath. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I didn\u2019t come here to cause trouble, you know this. I only want to know where Travis is.\u201d</p> <p>Dan avoided his friend\u2019s eyes and kept them on me and the lighter I was refusing to give up. Not now, not yet. \u201cYou want to stop something that should happen. I can\u2019t let you do that. You are my friend but my loyalty to my family comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge over love,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes, though not that poetic.\u201d</p><p>He adjusted the gun under the table. I chose that moment to let go of the lighter. He leaned back in his chair and brought it under his cigarette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, flicking the Zippo.</p><p>Here went nothing and everything at the same time. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>I flung the contents of the non-dairy creamer out into his face just as the flame produced. The particles hung suspended in air for one moment, a cloud of white that enveloped his face, before the flame interacted with them.</p><p>It went up in an orange blaze, the heat and flames making me fall backward out of my seat. Dan was screaming, his face, hair, everything, ignited in a horrible fireball that had momentarily stretched to the roof before simmering back down into a puff of curdling black smoke.</p><p>There was no time to take it all in. I scrambled to my feet and ran out of Dan\u2019s house, Gus right behind me.</p><p>I got behind the wheel this time and the moment Gus was in the car, I started peeling backward through the dense sand. Once the GTO hit the solid dirt, I spun it around with a hit to the E-break and bolted forward. We bounced and pitched and crunched down that pale dirt road, the car feeling alive beneath my hands, willing to take us anywhere we wanted, as fast as it wanted.</p><p>Gus wasn\u2019t driving anymore.</p><p>We didn\u2019t say a word to each other until we finally whipped out onto the main paved street that would take us back to the highway, overtaking a cart pulled by donkeys as we did so, chickens squawking in our wake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gus,\u201d I told him, my eyes darting to the rear-view mirror to make sure we weren\u2019t being followed. I don\u2019t know how badly Dan was burned, if he was still alive with only minor redness, or if he was rolling on the floor suffering as his skin melted away. I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHe would have killed us,\u201d he said gruffly, his attention turned to the window. I noticed he was wringing his hands together.</p> <p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m sorry for that too.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed before he said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>That was the most we talked about it. Another incident swept away. Not because there wasn\u2019t more to say, because there was, I mean the god damn coffee creamer actually worked. I had opened my mouth to say something about that, then closed it, thinking it in poor taste considering what had happened.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter because in the next instance I looked at the rear-view mirror again and saw flashing lights far behind us. It almost looked like a mirage in the sun-soaked haze of the road.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d I swore.</p><p>Gus twisted in his seat and looked behind him. \u201cDouble shit. They\u2019ll be with the Zetas.\u201d He eyed me nervously. \u201cDo you want me to drive?\u201d</p><p>I gripped the wheel tighter and gunned it.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>The chase was on.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>The trek through the jungle didn\u2019t take as long as I imagined it would but it felt a hell of a lot longer with the tension between Javier and I. Burt Reynolds led the way, a chatty Kathy to Peter behind him, while I was sandwiched behind Raul in front, Javier in back. I could feel his damn eyes on me the whole time, burning holes at my back, at the tattoo on my leg. As childish as it was for me to enjoy rubbing it in, that Camden left his mark, it also made me worry for him. Javier was nothing if not jealous and unpredictable. I was doing all of this to protect Camden but I had to wonder if I was putting him in danger all the same.</p><p>Aside from being awkward, the ride was unbearably sweaty and uncomfortable, horsehair sticking to my legs, mosquitos feasting on every bare inch of me. Howler monkeys added to the hostility, hurling animal obscenities from hidden spots in the trees above. The tiny seaside hamlet of Montepio seemed like a godsend after that.</p><p>Javier handed over a wad of US bills to Burt Reynolds who eagerly took it from him, stuffing it away in various pockets like a squirrel. Raul helped me off Churro much to my dismay, especially since his hands seemed to linger a bit around my ass.</p><p>I swatted him away under the guise of wiping off horsehair and glared at him. Javier was watching us over Burt\u2019s shoulder, cold and calculating, but I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to be someplace air-conditioned, a cold drink in hand. To be honest, I think I wanted to be back on the boat. Captive or not, it was the only place I\u2019d been able to get a routine going since I\u2019d left Palm Valley for the first time.</p><p>We handed the horses to Burt who attached them all together in a long line and led them back into the jungle.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I asked Javier, hands on my hips. The four of us were standing on a cobblestoned street corner and getting some pretty curious looks from bare-footed children who were walking past.</p><p>Javier looked to Raul and Peter, completely ignoring me. \u201cThere\u2019s a car waiting for us around the corner from here. It will take us to Alvarado. We have a house there, disguised as a fish shop. I\u2019m afraid it might smell a bit but that\u2019s as far as we can get to Veracruz without causing trouble. At least, not right away.\u201d</p><p>I could have sworn that last bit was directed at me.</p><p>We followed Javier down the street, past the faded signs of small shops and businesses, past the group of kids who were hiding behind a phone booth and peering at us with gap-toothed grins, past a produce stand where an owner and a customer were in a showdown over the price of bananas. It was such a scene of old Mexico but as I followed Javier and his men, all in their sharp suits, striding confidently, easily, through this tiny town, I had to wonder how far reaching the cartels were. Was there nowhere in the country left untouched? Would the children on the street have to come home to a murdered father or mother, as Javier did? The place he described growing up didn\u2019t seem too much different from this place.</p><p>Sympathy for the devil, I thought. It crept up on me more and more.</p><p>The car was a Range Rover, at least ten years old with a dented fender. It was tough and fast enough to get us around but it didn\u2019t look like the vehicle that a drug cartel rode around in. Just your everyday quasi-Mexican family going out for a drive, nothing to see here.</p><p>Javier checked something on his phone and then pulled a key out of his breast pocket. He opened the door and unlocked the rest of them.</p><p>Then he turned and looked at me for the first time in hours. \u201cYou\u2019re riding in the front. With me.\u201d</p><p>My heart clanged in my chest. I forced a smile to hide my nervousness. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I climbed in and was surprised at how high tech it looked inside. GPS, mp3, the works. \u201cNice,\u201d I commented, feeling like I had to say something.</p><p>Javier started the car and knocked on his window. \u201cBullet-proof glass. I made sure this was totally outfitted. Piece of shit from the outside, a fortress inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the Popemobile.\u201d</p><p>A smug smile spread across his lips and I knew I had appealed to his god-complex. \u201cYes, just like that.\u201d</p><p>We headed out of the town and crawled our way through narrow, twisting mountainous passages, the sea temporarily disappearing as the Range Rover plunged deep into the heart of the Los Tuxtlas reserve. The green seemed to enclose around us as lizards ran across the ragged road just in time and the sun poked through the canopies. Waterfalls tumbled out of volcanic remnants, close enough to splash mist on the car. It was nice to see it from an air-conditioned vehicle, especially one that was outfitted in bullet-proof glass. I felt safe for the first time in a while, which was so ridiculous considering who I was in the car with.</p><p>Suddenly, the switchbacks seemed to be too much and we nearly went off the road when a bus came careening around the corner, the lush mountains leveling out. Soon, we were pulling the Range Rover onto the Minititlan-Veracruz highway, speeding along the plains and rows of fruit crops.</p><p>\u201cI bet when you thought of Mexico before,\u201d Javier began, relaxing at the wheel, \u201cyou thought of Cancun and Puerto Vallarta and all the resort towns.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and nodded, watching the immense land, the countless farms and houses flying past. \u201cI did. I never really thought of it having so much space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big country, you know. It can be surprising and beautiful too. The people. The little pockets of life.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him, feeling like we were the only two people in the car. \u201cAre you happy to be back? Did you miss this?\u201d</p><p>He scratched at his sideburn, eyes darkening momentarily. \u201cI miss it sometimes. It seems peaceful and simple in my memories. But I know it\u2019s not true. Behind every house you see, there are secrets. And death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s everywhere,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d He adjusted his grip at the wheel. \u201cStill, you forget here. You think there are so many people, so many lives, how can there be that many secrets? When I was young, really young, and my mother would drive me and my sisters to Mascota where my aunt lived, I\u2019d watch all the houses go past and I\u2019d play a game with myself. I\u2019d say, \u2018What would it be like to be that person? To live there? Or there, or there? What life would I have?\u2019\u201d He trailed off and looked in the rear-view mirror. It was like he just remembered where he was. He suddenly shrugged. \u201cI was young and stupid and I thought the world was good and other lives were better and well, all of us know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He became silent after that, flicking through the radio until he gave up and put a Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album on. \u201cDo You Love Me?\u201d came out in full bass and creepy organ and I had to wonder how orchestrated this was. It added an ominous quality to our journey and a flurry inside my gut, something that pulled me in all directions.</p><p>I did not think about Javier. I did not listen to the lyrics, those terribly fitting lyrics. I did not fall for his guise of music. This was not \u201cOn Every Street.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tattoo on my arm itched.</p><p>We drove on. By the time the album was over, I felt dirty and squirmy and we were in Alvarado, driving down another narrow street that coasted along the shore. The fish shop that would be our headquarters was two stories, set at the start of a concrete pier that jutted out to sea, a few aging fishing boats moored along it.</p><p>Javier and his men exited the vehicle with ease and headed right for the shop. They didn\u2019t look around them to see if they were being watched or if anyone was eyeing them suspiciously. They were a bunch of men wanting fish. I sat in the car a few moments longer, enjoying the safety of the glass, before I spotted Javier waving me to come over.</p><p>The bell jangled loudly above my head as I entered the shop. He wasn\u2019t kidding about the smell. It was an actual working business, with rows of different colored fish all lying flat on ice. Raul was talking to a small, deeply tanned elderly man behind the counter, the fishmonger.</p> <p>Javier came over to me and placed his hand at my back, leading me forward. I could feel his warmth through the flimsy fabric of my dress.</p><p>\u201cEllie, this is Pedro,\u201d he said, politely introducing me.</p><p>Pedro showed me his hands, full of fish guts, and shot me an apologetic look. \u201cSorry, I no speak much English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEso no es problema,\u201d I told him with a smile and hoped he wouldn\u2019t assume I was fluent. \u201cHablo un poco de espa\u00f1ol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Javier whispered into my ear. \u201cWhat else have you picked up?\u201d</p> <p>I hid the shiver that rolled down my neck by telling Pedro he had a very lovely shop. That seemed to please him and it got me out of Javier\u2019s grasp as Pedro began to show me the scales on one of the red snappers.</p><p>Pedro was one of Javier\u2019s father\u2019s friends from way back in the day and had no problems with letting us stay there. In fact, it was common as the upstairs of the shop was constantly used as a hotel of sorts for the Sinoloa cartel members who were trying to gain the upper hand in Veracruz. Javier told me Pedro often stayed down the street with his daughter when they took over his shop, working during the day and minding his own business.</p><p>He led us upstairs which was a lot more substantial than it looked on the outside. There was a small living area/dining room and a large balcony overlooking the beach and harbor, complete with another table, chairs and a grill. The kitchen was tiny but functional. There was one small bathroom and two bedrooms.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll take the couch,\u201d I said, eyeing the tiny loveseat adorned with a white fringe shawl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Javier said, gesturing to the bigger bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019re staying with me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened and a flash of heat went up my legs. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a wry look. \u201cWould you rather sleep with Raul or Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Peter,\u201d I said automatically. Peter blushed and quickly went into the other room.</p><p>Javier grabbed my hand. \u201cI won\u2019t touch you unless you want me to.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the couch. Perhaps you should sleep there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m not that much of a gentleman,\u201d he said with a cock of his head.</p><p>Understatement of the century, I thought. Then I realized he was still holding my hand. He noticed my eyes and let go.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get your things later tonight. It looks a bit too strange if someone were to see us moving our shit in here. When it gets dark, we\u2019ll get the bags. Until then,\u201d he gestured to the rest of the house. \u201cGet a beer and relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might,\u201d I said, wanting to get away from Javier and any talk about a bedroom. I went to the kitchen and got a beer, settling on the balcony. The sea breeze was wonderful, even if it was bringing up the occasional waft of fish. I sat back and waited for something to happen. Something more than just me sitting on the balcony of a cartel\u2019s hideout, sipping a beer and watching the pelicans fly.</p> <p>I went back inside the house when I was done with my drink and noticed Raul sitting silently on the loveseat, staring into space. I grabbed another beer from the tiny fridge and when I turned around, he was right behind me.</p><p>I let out a small gasp of surprise and nearly dropped the bottle. How the hell did he move so fast?</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he said, as if my name felt good to say. \u201cHave you given anymore thought to your predicament?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Javier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lover has left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my lover,\u201d I said nastily. \u201cYou should know this.\u201d Then a thread of fear ran through me. I swallowed it down. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went into town with Peter. They had business to conduct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay then,\u201d I said and tried to walk around him. He blocked me. I gripped the bottle tighter, more than prepared to waste a beer on his head.</p><p>He leaned in close. \u201cYou say he\u2019s not your lover. I believe you. He doesn\u2019t speak very favorably about you, you know.\u201d</p><p>I refused to look away, his beady little eyes spearing me. \u201cI don\u2019t speak very favorably about him. So it\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this is fair,\u201d he sneered. \u201cThink about it, Ellie. He\u2019s getting you do to his dirty work. Don\u2019t you think there are other people who can better handle this for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t as invested.\u201d</p><p>He took another step closer, his pelvis almost pressed against mine. I raised my drink in the air. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only trying to help you,\u201d he said with false humility. \u201cI don\u2019t want you getting hurt. There\u2019s far more to this than he will let you know. It\u2019s sad how fucking blind you are.\u201d</p><p>My face fell. I couldn\u2019t help it. Raul obviously had an agenda, perhaps to overthrow Javier, I couldn\u2019t be sure. At the same time, I felt like I had to agree with Raul, that I was probably blind and kept in the dark. I also didn\u2019t trust him. In fact, if Pedro wasn\u2019t downstairs working and it wasn\u2019t bright daylight outside, I would have thought I was in big, big trouble. I made a mental note to never be left with Raul alone again.</p><p>\u201cPiss off,\u201d I said, pushing him out of the way with my shoulder. \u201cAnd if you ever come that close to me again, I\u2019m telling him everything you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t believe you.\u201d But he looked worried when he said it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to find that out for myself.\u201d I went over to the balcony and closed the sliding door behind me. I wished I could have locked the door from the outside, so I could keep him out.</p><p>I drank my beer and every so often I\u2019d turn my attention away from the sea and look at the sliding glass door. I could see my reflection, looking positively languid in the sun, and beyond that, inside, Raul on the couch. Constantly watching me.</p><p>Once darkness fell, Peter brought up everyone\u2019s bags and I got settled in our room. Javier had returned just before dinner, fresh fish from Pedro, but wouldn\u2019t tell me where they went, other than it was some stuff he had to work out. It was naturally vague but now I couldn\u2019t help but think about what Raul said. How many things was I kept in the dark about?</p><p>When I put a few long dresses, light jackets and a nice tunic on the spindly hangers and shoved my duffel bag under the bed, I caught Javier walking past the room, heading downstairs to the shop.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I called out.</p><p>He poked his head back around the door, brows raised. For a very quick moment he looked like the boy I used to know. Or the boy that I never really knew.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a moment?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I was being so polite but I was.</p><p>He came in, nodding, eyes curious and concerned. \u201cOf course you can. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I guess he was being polite too.</p><p>I eyed the door, jerking my chin for him to close it, to give us privacy. He tilted his head, then shook it, his attention going to the wall. Raul and Peter were in their room and perhaps the walls were far too thin for whatever he thought I was going to talk to him about.</p><p>\u201cI was actually going to go up the street to get more beer,\u201d he said somewhat loudly. \u201cSomeone\u2019s drank most of the supply. Want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, grabbing a jean jacket from the closet and followed him down the stairs and through the triple locks of the shop door. We hopped in the Range Rover and sped off down the road. The Let Love In album started playing again. I reached over and turned down the volume.</p><p>After we\u2019d passed a couple of convenience stores and supermarkets, I said, \u201cI thought you needed beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it on the way back. We\u2019re going to Veracruz.\u201d</p><p>I felt jarred. \u201cRight now? It\u2019s night.\u201d I wasn\u2019t ready for this.</p><p>\u201cBest time to go. I won\u2019t be easily spotted. It\u2019s a large city you know. Half a million people and a lot of them look like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d I said despite myself.</p><p>He let out a low laugh. \u201cYou still think me handsome, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have looked over at him, like I was actually considering the question, but I did. And then I started considering the question. He was handsome, maybe even more so than he once was. He was almost thirty now and the age gave him power, his features more defined, his confidence off the charts. It was a dangerous combination and a dangerous question.</p><p>\u201cI can see how a lot of women would find you very attractive,\u201d I said as detachedly as possible.</p><p>\u201cOh, very attractive. I like that, I like that.\u201d He smiled at me, eyes puppy dog. \u201cYou know if you\u2019re not careful with me, we could fall back into old tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together. \u201cI told you before, this is an evolution. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my hand on the length of my dress. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know much about evolving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Now, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t want to discuss my looks with me, so what is it that you wanted to talk about?\u201d His voice was clipped now, all business.</p><p>\u201cRaul told me some things ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did,\u201d he said easily but I could see his knuckles becoming more defined as he gripped the wheel. \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was blind and kept in the dark and that I was going to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust him. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s what has kept me alive. I\u2019d say you follow the same creed as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted Camden,\u201d I said, bracing for the impact.</p><p>It came slowly, the frustration seething off of him like smoke. His teeth clanked together as he bit down, jaw grinding. He waited one long agonizing minute before speaking, more to gather his anger than keep me in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cCamden is your past,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice steady. \u201cI am your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my past. Camden is my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d he said, voice rising, \u201cis gone. He is gone, Ellie. He has his family, the family I gave back to him. He has moved on. You need to move on too. Weak people hang on to the \u2018what could have beens.\u2019 Strong people build a new future. Whatever ... thing ... you two shared, it\u2019s over. He may have his tattoo on you but so do I.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s moved on?\u201d I asked in a hush. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s not out there looking for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I know where he is and what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t coming looking for you. Don\u2019t you think he would have found you by now?\u201d</p><p>He took a pickaxe to my heart.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll take six years,\u201d I whispered, feeling the hope drain out of the wound. Javier was right and I hated it. Camden wasn\u2019t coming. He wouldn\u2019t get his family back and then leave them for me. He wouldn\u2019t give up on them. I wouldn\u2019t even want him to do that. I knew then that I had to let him go, it just hurt too much to even consider it.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come for you until I was ready,\u201d Javier spoke up after a thick pause. \u201cThat\u2019s evolution.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right not to trust me or not to trust anyone. But I am not keeping you in the dark. We\u2019re just trying to figure out the best way to get you in Travis\u2019s path.\u201d</p><p>That idea made me shudder. \u201cEasiest way possible, please.\u201d</p><p>I felt Javier\u2019s eyes on me. \u201cA dress like that will be a start. Travis doesn\u2019t go out all that often from what our friends say but he\u2019s not a total, how you say, hermit. He goes to the market every Saturday, so three days from now. I would like to see if we could find him before that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what, you\u2019re going to keep driving me into town and dropping me off and hoping I\u2019ll bump into him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. We\u2019ll get you a hotel room in the city. You\u2019ll be a female traveler there alone. I have a man who works there. He\u2019ll be our day-to-day contact. You won\u2019t see me much.\u201d</p> <p>That worried me for some reason.</p><p>He went on, \u201cIt\u2019s better that way. We can\u2019t take chances. Once you are in Travis\u2019s sights, I\u2019ll have to disappear. He would probably have you followed for a bit, so you must keep up the mask of American traveler for some time. If he caught you and I talking, things would be over for you pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me? Why not someone else? Why do you think he\u2019ll take any interest in me at all?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips and turned his attention back to the dark highway. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are, Ellie. You act strong but everyone can see how vulnerable you are. Men, like me, like Travis, we want to protect that. We want to break you, mold you and keep you as ours. He\u2019ll see you and he\u2019ll see that in you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to react to whatever the hell he just said. It was honest and disheartening. I was pretty sure Camden never saw me that way. Pretty sure ...</p><p>\u201cBesides, you\u2019re very beautiful, from head to toe. Any man would be crazy not to have you as his queen.\u201d</p> <p>I kept my mouth shut to that. I was sure a woman with scars, tattoos and a nipple ring wasn\u2019t the height of all beauty.</p><p>Javier\u2019s original plan that night was to visit the small hotel where I was to be staying. It was just as well that I had decided to come along.</p><p>Veracruz was only 40 miles from Pedro\u2019s place so before we knew it we were entering the lights of the city, the plazas and malec\u00f3n all aglow for the evening. The hotel was right in the city but backed out onto a small preserve that ran along a stream. There was one two-story building that held the office, gift shop, lobby and rooms, then a courtyard and a pool, with two large haciendas at the back with their own private everything. Javier had splurged on the private cabin starting Saturday night, especially liking that it had a hidden entrance at the back that led to a small landscaped patio and the reserve beyond.</p><p>The only person on staff that night was Javier\u2019s contact, Enrico. Enrico was no older than twenty, with a smooth face and bright eyes. He was sharp as a tack too and respected Javier without being all fan boy about it. At least I\u2019d feel safe with Enrico there acting as Javier\u2019s eyes. I had to wonder how many of Javier\u2019s men were scattered around town, protecting him from afar.</p><p>Before we left, Enrico slipped Javier a piece of paper. I didn\u2019t ask about it until we were back in the Range Rover and heading to the fish shop.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that paper he gave you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe name of someone who can help us.\u201d Another person that could help? Javier caught the look on my face and smiled sympathetically. \u201cEllie, for this, we are going to need all the help we can get.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p> <p>CAMDEN</p><p>Swerve, swerve, swerve.</p><p>The GTO responded to my touch like I did to lips on my dick. I jetted the car down the road while Gus frantically flipped on the GPS to try and get us a better route away from the cop car that was still on our trail. We didn\u2019t know if it was in relation to what had just happened with Dan or the cop just happened to see us speeding, either way it was bad news. If the cops caught us, we\u2019d be found out pretty fast with my somewhat \u201cWanted\u201d face and a trunk full of crazy ass weapons that the cartels wouldn\u2019t want anywhere near them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a small road up to your left,\u201d Gus said, jabbing at the device. \u201cTake it then take the next road to your right, that hooks around to the highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighway with more cops,\u201d I muttered but did as he said and swung the car down a narrow cobblestone road, flying past tiny dwellings and stray dogs that ran out of the way.</p><p>\u201cMore cops but they\u2019ll be easier to lose at this time of day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have traffic choppers over here?\u201d I asked, imagining the view from up above as broadcasted on television.</p><p>Gus grinned at me uneasily. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out, won\u2019t we.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so will Javier.\u201d At the moment all we had was the moment of surprise. Shit, I hated to even think it but I really hoped Dan was knocked out. Looking back we should have tied him up or, well, if it had been anyone else, we should have shot him and put him out of his misery. Now there was a chance he could alert Javier that we were on our way.</p><p>Who the fuck are you? I asked myself, feeling the chills spread all over me. Suddenly I was talking about offing someone like it was no big deal.</p><p>I shook my head and concentrated on the task at hand. The car was still behind us, having taken the same corner. I brought the GTO onto the other street Gus told me about. Sadly, it was nothing bigger than a bike path, lined with low stone walls.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I yelled as we squeezed through, both of the side mirrors of the car smashing off and flying behind us. The car bounced and rocked back and forth, her sides scratched as we sped through the narrow passageway without more than an inch to spare on either side. I couldn\u2019t help my wince at the damage the car was taking on, the paint job it was going to need when this was over. Ellie was going to have a hissy fit. Her poor J\u00f3se.</p><p>That thought alone, that I\u2019d see Ellie again, kept me focused. I gunned the car harder, even when I heard the cop car coming to a screech far behind me, probably a few inches too wide to come after us.</p><p>We almost made it out of the passage when a little girl with her skipping rope suddenly appeared around the corner, coming toward us, her form small between the stone walls.</p><p>Gus and I both screamed in unison as I slammed down on the brakes, burning brake pads and rubber filling our ears and noses. The car fought and weaved with what little space it had as it plowed toward the little girl.</p><p>I took in her purple summer dress, the braids in pigtails, the pink rope in her hands, her bare feet, her eyes as they stared me down in horror.</p><p>The GTO came to a jerky halt, a feet away from her, the cloud of dust from our wake billowing forward.</p><p>My hands were frozen on the wheel, my foot on the brake, my eyes on the girl. My chest heaved, remembering to breathe while Gus clutched at his chest. For a minute I thought he was going to have a heart attack, that this was his mysterious health condition, when he waved me off and spat out, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Should we check on her?\u201d</p><p>I looked back to the girl. She was giving us a pouty look but turned around and skipped back out of the passage, finding another way to wherever she was going.</p><p>I slowly eased the car forward once she was out of our path, inching the nose out until the coast was clear. Then I stepped on the gas and took her down another road that led us onto the highway.</p><p>Once we got there, it was smooth sailing.</p><p>For about five minutes. Then we heard more sirens behind us. Someone had called the cavalry.</p><p>Gus and I looked at each other as if to say, \u201ctime to do this again\u201d and I gunned the car, the engine slightly less responsive now. I swerved it around the commuters on the highway, getting angry glares, horns and curious glances. I guess with the mirrors off and the side banged up, we were going to attract a lot of attention. Perfect.</p><p>Gus was back to reading the GPS \u201cWe\u2019re approaching Tihuatlan, the highway is going to start branching off in different directions. We won\u2019t be able to stay on this one, even though it\u2019s leading us to Veracruz. We\u2019ll have to take the side roads and the smaller highways. We can still get there but, sorry boy, it\u2019s going to take longer now. The cops are going to be looking for this car.\u201d</p><p>I kneaded the steering wheel and swerved around a car just before we almost collided with the back of a semi-truck</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see if we can get out of this one first.\u201d</p><p>And we almost did, until a cruiser pulled up beside us, the cop wasn\u2019t wearing a ski mask which meant he was probably doing radar on the side of the road. He did have a gun pointed at us though.</p><p>He pulled the trigger, the bullet puncturing the back door.</p><p>I yelped and slammed on the brakes again, trying to get out of his way. The car behind me screeched and swerved off to the side trying to avoid being rear ended. Unfortunately the cop car did the same maneuver as me and the car ended up flying off the road trying to avoid it, crashing somewhere behind us. More and more cars crunched and squealed and I knew I\u2019d left a massive pile-up in my wake.</p><p>Not that it was exactly my fault. The cop was aiming for me again and I jerked the GTO into the other lane as he shot again. The bullet missed, striking the rear window of the car next to us. Screams filled the air. The cop didn\u2019t give a shit if everyone on the highway ended up dead.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get the fuck out of here,\u201d I said as Gus reached into the glove compartment and pulled out his gun. \u201cOh please, let\u2019s not add to the carnage.\u201d</p><p>He cocked the gun dramatically. \u201cOur lives are carnage now. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>There was truth to his words. We\u2019d gone from two guys watching Arsenic and Old Lace in his living room, to torture-tattooing drug lords and igniting ex-best friends. Now we were on the run from the law, in Mexico, nearly taking everyone down with us.</p><p>All for a girl. But she wasn\u2019t just any girl.</p><p>She was mine.</p><p>And I was hers.</p><p>Until the bitter end.</p><p>\u201cCamden, watch it!\u201d Gus yelled.</p><p>The cop was right beside us again. I only got a quick glimpse of him as I turned my head to see, cursing the side mirrors that were gone.</p><p>I saw the gun pointed at me.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>Then my window exploded, glass fragments flying everywhere, lacing the air like confetti. Immediately a searing hot pain erupted in my shoulder, like a molten knife had stabbed me there, twisting it through. I didn\u2019t have time to worry about it though. I had to act fast. I grabbed the wheel and did what the psycho cop wasn\u2019t expecting me to do. I rammed the GTO into his car, hit it at enough of an angle so we\u2019d both spun out. Only I was still in control, with one good arm, and was able to get the car straightened out before Gus had to take control of the wheel and I handled the gearshift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were a few close calls, another semi changing lanes to get out of the way, a family-filled sedan staring at our car in horror as we nearly rammed them. But we managed to escape from crashing and navigated the moving maze by the skin of our teeth. I felt like I was in a deadly, real-life version of Frogger. My hands started to get cold and clammy, the gearshift slipping under my palm.</p><p>Once we were back at optimal speed, I took the wheel back and started booting up the shoulder, overtaking everyone and leaving them in a storm cloud of loose roadwork. It was then that I chose to look down at my arm. I saw nothing but blood, starting from the shoulder where it met my collarbone and soaking its way down, a red ink blot that started taking on new shapes before my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d I said, grinding my teeth together as the pain began to manifest itself. \u201cI\u2019ve been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Gus said alarmed and peering over at me.</p> <p>\u201cMy shoulder,\u201d I grunted, then screamed. \u201cThis fucking hurts!\u201d</p><p>He seemed to consider that for a moment before he said, full-on smart ass, \u201cYes, being shot hurts.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, my glasses fogging up. \u201cIf I die on you, you\u2019re going to feel really bad about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will,\u201d he said. \u201cJust keep driving. I think we\u2019ve lost them for now. Get us to Ixtapa road, the next exit\u2019s coming up on your right, then take the road until it intersects with 132. Take 132 ...\u201d And Gus droned on. I was having a hard time hearing him, my vision was beginning to blur and my ears felt like they had cotton balls in them. I guess I subconsciously took it all in because together, with him steering the wheel sometimes, we followed his directions and ended up at an abandoned gas station on the outskirts of a small town. The cops hadn\u2019t followed us.</p><p>But I\u2019d been shot. And before I could do anything about it, the world around me started getting fuzzy.</p> <p>Then nothing.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>As to be expected, sleeping with Javier was awkward. After we returned from our mini-trip to Veracruz, case of beer in hand, we all had a few and then retired to our rooms. I could sense Raul\u2019s eyes on me the whole time, but Javier didn\u2019t act any different around him. I was glad for that because I didn\u2019t want Raul to think I\u2019d snitched \u2013 he wasn\u2019t someone I wanted to further antagonize.</p><p>Javier shut the door behind me and flicked on the tall standing lamp in the corner, kitschy Mexican d\u00e9cor. \u201cWhat side of the bed do you want?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Then he proceeded to take off his suit. He flung the jacket onto an armchair across the room and began unbuttoning his shirt. I didn\u2019t know where to look, my cheeks growing hot like I was a na\u00efve teenager. I\u2019d seen him shirtless before. Hell, I\u2019d seen and felt every single part of that man. Still, it didn\u2019t make the feeling go away.</p> <p>\u201cFeeling bashful?\u201d Now his tone was smug.</p><p>I looked up and his shirt was off. His body was pretty much the same as I remembered, but wider, in a more athletic and lean kind of way. He\u2019d grown into it and taken great care of his body over the years. His abs and arms looked like he\u2019d do chin-ups in his spare time, yet it was still very elegant and subtle. His skin was a dark bronze, shadowed by the lamp.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d And then his pants dropped.</p><p>And I\u2019d totally forgotten he liked to go commando.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d I cried out, shielding my eyes and facing the wall. \u201cPlease, put some pants on. Or underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay \u2018oh my god\u2019 again, I liked the sound of it,\u201d he said and I could hear him coming closer. \u201cIt reminds me of old times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen are you not serious, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes clamped shut until he started shuffling through the drawers. \u201cOkay, okay, calm down. There, I have pants on now.\u201d</p><p>I bent down and snapped up my pajama bottoms and a t-shirt then walked past him to the door, not wanting to risk a look in his direction. When I came out of the bathroom, after a long, hot and much-needed shower, he was already in bed with the lights off. This was exactly what I was counting on. I wanted to go to sleep on my side of the bed and be done with it. No thinking about the situation, no chit chat.</p><p>I carefully closed the door and eased my way across the room, my bare feet padding on the woven rugs, the moonlight outside the open window illuminating my passage. With the sea breeze coming in and the sound of the fishing boats rising and falling in their berths, the whole thing was soothing. Even romantic.</p><p>I crawled in, pulling only the sheet over my body and faced the wall. The moon was bright on my face.</p><p>After a few moments, when my heart rate had started to calm and I was beginning to forget where I was, Javier called out softly. \u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to pretend to be asleep. I wanted to ignore him. But he\u2019d used a name I hated and I was sick of hearing it.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that,\u201d I whispered back, pulling sheet closer around my shoulders.</p><p>He turned over in the bed and suddenly he was right behind me, causing the hairs on my neck to rise. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I tried to steady my breath. \u201cI\u2019m not your angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re someone\u2019s angel. God\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s? How can you call me an angel when you think I\u2019m no good?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. Waves crashed outside.</p><p>\u201cThere are fallen angels, too. Angels with dirty wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucifer was a fallen angel,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. But Lucifer had no moral code. You and I, angel, I think we fell somewhere in between all of that. We made our place. Our own home.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes at his words, my soul and heart and everything getting sucked back into a vortex of memories, all bright, shiny, and good. Memories of him and I together, memories I thought I\u2019d erased.</p><p>His lips were at my ear, his warm hand on my shoulder, holding me in place rather than giving comfort. Instead of stiffening, my whole body relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWe evolved, Ellie,\u201d he whispered, sending shivers down my back. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll keep evolving.\u201d Then he moved away, back to his side of the bed, cozying up under the covers.</p><p>I didn\u2019t fall asleep for hours.</p><p>The next day Peter and Raul went off somewhere in Pedro\u2019s tiny Toyota and Javier and I took the Rover into Veracruz to meet this new contact of his, a woman called Amandine.</p><p>We had dressed appropriately for the occasion. I was wearing a long peasant skirt and gladiator sandals that wrapped up to my knee, covering my cherry blossoms even if anyone could see them. On top though I was showing a lot of skin. No bra under a low-cut and tight low-back white lace tank. I spent extra effort on my hair, styling it until it lay straight and smooth, just past my chin, and put on more makeup than usual. Nothing trashy but I knew I had the ability to stand out when I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d Javier said when he saw me, his eyes savoring my body. \u201cOf course, if you were still mine, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d let you out in public like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m not yours,\u201d I\u2019d told him.</p><p>The way I looked like an attractive American tourist, Javier looked the complete opposite of a drug lord. Jeans, a black and orange San Francisco Giants jersey, aviators and a plain black baseball cap.</p><p>Actually it was kind of weird being with him looking like that. Javier had always been a very smooth and elegant dresser and now here he was looking like any twenty-nine-year-old baseball fan, albeit one with high cheekbones. Even dressed down he still looked extraordinarily ... pretty.</p><p>We cruised through the busy streets of the city, both of us taking comfort in the bulletproof glass, until we found the address. It was a caf\u00e9 across from one of the various small lakes and lagoons that were sprinkled throughout Veracruz.</p><p>We parked across the lagoon and took the long way around, following a small boardwalk. He took my hand and squeezed it before I could take it back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just an American girl and I\u2019m your Mexican boyfriend,\u201d he said with a cheery smile that made him look terribly young. \u201cWe\u2019re the modern day Romeo and Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomeo and Juliet was a tragedy, not a romance,\u201d I answered.</p><p>He held onto my hand the whole way, keeping me close to him, occasionally pointing to one of the flamingos on the lagoon and I pretended to take interest, putting on a show for the folks who probably weren\u2019t watching us. People were spread about the park, workers on their lunch break, college students having make-out sessions and picnics at the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>When we approached the caf\u00e9, he whispered, \u201cThere she is,\u201d with all the skill of a ventriloquist. A woman was sitting at a small table at the very corner of the caf\u00e9, where the patio petered out into the grass. There was no one by her except an old couple reading the newspaper together.</p><p>\u201cAmandine?\u201d Javier asked as we stopped at the end of the table.</p><p>The woman looked up, surprised. She was pretty hot, right off the bat. About our age, maybe early thirties, long wavy hair done up in honey browns, sunkissed skin and blue eyes that matched her top.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she exclaimed brightly with incredibly white teeth. \u201cYou must be Enrico\u2019s friends.\u201d</p><p>We nodded. Javier gestured to the empty seats across from her. \u201cMay we sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes of course, please do.\u201d</p><p>Once seated, I offered my hand. \u201cI\u2019m Ellie.\u201d</p><p>She shook it, nice and firm. \u201cNice to meet you. And you too, Javier.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and folded his hands in front of him for a second before I guess he realized it was a bit too formal for his new persona and instead leaned back in his chair, legs splayed.</p><p>I almost rolled my eyes at his quasi-gangster pose.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, getting down to business. \u201cI\u2019m sure Enrico told you what this was all about. So how can you help us, Amandine?\u201d</p><p>Her face grew a little serious. \u201cI\u2019m sure Enrico also told you about my student loan ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney is not going to be a problem,\u201d he said with a quick wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well,\u201d she went on, \u201cI was with Travis for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Javier and exchanged a look. He straightened up in his seat and looked around at the caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Amandine said, taking a sip of her latte. \u201cThis place is pretty safe. Mainly tourists come here. No one knows to listen. Do they?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his jaw tense. \u201cNo. They don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t expect to hear this. What do you mean you were with him? As his lover?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and covered up her mouth. \u201cNo, not like that. I took a job cleaning his house. I needed the extra money for tuition. It was only for the summer. I didn\u2019t know of course who he was but I figured it out pretty fast. At first I thought he liked to hire really attractive women to be his help, if I can be so modest, and I thought maybe he was a financial banker or something like that. I don\u2019t know, I was na\u00efve. I\u2019m a good girl and I study hard and I didn\u2019t grow up with that. I knew there were drugs all over the city and that the cartels were closing in, but at the time it wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago, two and a bit,\u201d she said, thinking it over. \u201cIt was nothing like it is now. This is my city, my home. My family\u2019s home. Now we have Los Zetas and The Los Zetas Killers and who else knows who, all wanting a piece of this pie and it\u2019s rotten through and through. Bodies are left in the streets. People, good people, journalists, teachers, are murdered and no one is doing a thing about it. Not the police. Not the military. Not the government. Organized crime has taken over this city. As soon as I am done school, I am gone. And when I make money one day, I will take my family with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Amandine,\u201d Javier said calmly. \u201cIf you are of great help to us, I will make sure you have the money before you even start your next class. And it will be enough to get your family out of here in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>She looked flabbergasted. I couldn\u2019t blame her. How much money was Javier giving this young woman and why? Just to be nice? That didn\u2019t sound like him. Not when he was no better than The Los Zetas Killers.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t accept that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can and you will. Because your information will be worth it. The lives of my own sisters depend on it.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell. \u201cOh. I see. Travis ... Los Zetas. Did they do something to them?\u201d</p><p>Javier didn\u2019t say anything. I couldn\u2019t see his eyes save for the amber reflection of his aviators and he was probably glad for that. You couldn\u2019t read his face at all.</p><p>\u201cIf you help me, it will stop Travis from hurting them and hurting everyone else in this city.\u201d</p> <p>I ignored what Javier had told me on the boat that day, that the drug Lords were all like zombies and another one would pop up to take their place. Did Javier really want the drug cartels, the violence, to stop? Or did he just want to protect his sisters and come out on top?</p><p>She swallowed hard and took another sip of her latte. Her hands were shaking now. I placed my own on the table as a show of solidarity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told her. \u201cWe\u2019ll protect you. We just need to know what you can tell us about Travis, that\u2019s all. Places he goes, who lives in the house with him, how well-protected you think he is \u2013 how many bodyguards. That sort of thing. It won\u2019t take up much of your time, we promise, and then you can have your money.\u201d</p><p>She slowly lowered her drink and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Javier shot me an impressed look, lips teasing upward.</p><p>Amandine told us everything she knew about Travis over the last two years. He liked to go to the Mercado Hidalgo Market on Saturdays where the local police force would practically salute him. Friday nights he\u2019d frequent a night club or a bar, mainly The Zoo, a touristy joint with high security where he\u2019d drink in his private room. He usually brought women home from these places and his driver would take them home right after their session in the sack. I wanted to ask Amandine if I was Travis\u2019s type, if he\u2019d find me attractive but I knew how degrading and embarrassing that question was, to admit to what I was going to do.</p> <p>And, honestly, as she explained his mansion in the hills, all five of his bodyguards, some I could tell Javier recognized, past brothers, I started to worry. I started to freak out a bit, my pulse quickening, waves of nausea sweeping through me. I was sure I couldn\u2019t do it, that I\u2019d fail, he\u2019d catch me, kill me and everything would be for nothing. I didn\u2019t want to have my body dumped behind a garbage can or my head on the steps of a hotel. I didn\u2019t want to die by that man\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d It was Javier, his hand over mine. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded quickly, trying to come back to reality. \u201cYes. Sorry. What ... what were we talking about?\u201d</p><p>Amandine was looking at me with a quizzical expression. \u201cI asked if there was anything else you wanted to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. Sorry. I think I\u2019ve had too much sun,\u201d I said, shielding it with my hand.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Javier said, getting out of his chair and pulling me up to my feet. \u201cThank you, Amandine, you have been a great help. I will be in touch with you if I need anymore help. Oh.\u201d He reached into his back jean pocket and pulled out a Bank of America check book and started scribbling on it with one of Amandine\u2019s pens.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in US funds and from an American bank so it might take a while for your bank to clear it, but I can guarantee it will clear.\u201d He ripped the check out of the book and handed it to her.</p><p>Her eyes bugged. \u201cI can\u2019t take this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take it, you earned it. Just make sure you share it with your family,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me over to him and led me away from Amandine, still staring at the check in shock. We were halfway across the park when I asked, \u201cHow much did you give her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout thirty thousand dollars, US,\u201d he stated matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I said. \u201cYou made her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she has a life for much longer,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAfter we do what we have to do, I have no doubt it will all get back to her. That\u2019s the way things work here. Those who talk, die. My only hope is that she gets her family out of here first, to at least give them a chance somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, wishing that pretty Amandine would somehow get out of this alive. Wishing I would get out of this alive. \u201cIs this place really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the wild wild east, my dear, and the sheriff is nowhere to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you? The lone ranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon Diego de la Vega,\u201d he answered. \u201cZorro.\u201d</p><p>We got back in the car and drove out of the city and onto the highway that would take us to Alvarado.</p><p>We were about halfway there when I started to have a nervous breakdown.</p><p>All I could think about was Travis getting a hold of Amandine and cutting her head off, leaving it for her parents to find. What would happen to me if he did the same? Who would mourn me? Camden would probably never know about it. Neither would my parents, wherever the hell they were. The only one I had at that moment was right beside me: Javier.</p><p>And that in itself was what set me off.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had a panic attack in weeks so it snuck up on me, like a hand reached around from behind me and began squeezing my lungs until there was no breath left. I started gasping for air, my hand at my throat, taking in nothing. Tears filled my eyes and spilled down my cheeks in dirty rivulets and my body began to shake.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Javier swore, nearly taking the car off the road. \u201cEllie, Ellie. What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>I gulped and gasped unable to stop from crying, panic seizing me all over from my shoulders to my feet and I thrashed back and forth in order to get free.</p><p>Next thing I knew, he\u2019d pulled the car down a private dirt road that ran between two orchards and he was undoing my seatbelt. He came around to my side and took me in his arms and away from the car. We disappeared into the orchards, the smell of orange blossoms in the air.</p><p>He put me down, propped up against a tree and smoothed the hair off of my face. His sunglasses and baseball cap were gone, his hair mussed, his worried eyes searching me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ellie,\u201d he said gently, running his hand down the side of my face and feeling the pulse under my jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s all going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, feeling disgusting and messy and lost. I sobbed. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be okay. I can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face in his hands and forced me to look at him. \u201cYou can. And you will. You are strong. You are very strong. Right here.\u201d He lay his hand in the middle of my chest. \u201cYou will do this and you will succeed.\u201d</p><p>I finally found my breath again, the fresh air flowing down the sun-streaked orchard coming into my lungs. \u201cI will fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t even want this,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>He cocked his head and let go of my face. \u201cThen why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re making me!\u201d I cried out. \u201cYou\u2019re forcing me to!\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back. \u201cI am doing no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are! You\u2019ll kill my Camden if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t see the outburst coming. Suddenly Javier was in my face, his skin turning red, his eyes narrowing into viper-like slits, all yellow and full of hate.</p><p>\u201cHe is not your Camden!\u201d he screamed. I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t here with you now,\u201d he went on, words harsh and short, like bullets. \u201cI am here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I screamed back. \u201cAnd I hate it! I hate it! I hate you!\u201d</p><p>Then before I knew what was happening, I had wound up my hand and slapped him hard across his face. The sound ricocheted down the groves.</p><p>I waited, surprised at myself, breathing hard. I watched as his face contorted in the same type of shock. And then something odd flashed across his brow. Something like betrayal. I knew betrayal all too well. I knew it had been on my own face when I found out what Uncle Jim was planning to do.</p><p>My dead uncle.</p><p>I slapped him again, harder this time, my palm stinging like I was being stabbed with a million tiny knives. \u201cThat was for my uncle!\u201d I cried. \u201cYou killed him.\u201d</p><p>Now I wound up for a punch and decked Javier right in the side of the head. \u201cYou killed him,\u201d I repeated, tears streaming down my cheeks again. \u201cYou keep taking everyone I love away!\u201d</p><p>The whole time, Javier just stayed there. Not ducking my hits, not getting out of the way. He just let me, watching me with that impassive look upon his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on!\u201d I screamed. \u201cHit me back. You know you want to!\u201d</p><p>I decked him in the head again, my knuckles exploding in pain. \u201cCome on!\u201d I pushed my hands into his shoulders and tried to throw him to the ground. He fell easily, and I threw myself on top of him, throwing punch after punch after punch until he finally reached up and grabbed my wrists with both his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hit you,\u201d he said, gazing deeply at me with wild eyes, his lip bleeding. \u201cYou can hit me all you want but if you\u2019re doing it so I can hit you back, it won\u2019t work. You\u2019ll just break every part of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to break every part of you!\u201d I exclaimed but gave up and collapsed on him. \u201cI want you to break,\u201d I whispered, my head on his chest, my eyes focused absently on an orange tree.</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d he said softly, his hand stroking the back of my head. \u201cI told you that you broke me when you left. And you did. I\u2019m not lying to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not now.\u201d His voice dropped a register.</p><p>I raised my head to look at him. He brought his hands on both sides of my cheeks and held me there, his eyes searching me for something.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he said through a breath.</p><p>He pulled my face to his, my lips meeting his, slowly. Just a taste of blood and tears. Lips and tongue. The sensation pulled me under, the heat that spread from him and through me, the memories mixing with the smell of orange blossoms. All the pain disappeared as our kiss deepened, all the worry, all the danger melted like my lips and his did together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was wrong. So wrong. And I didn\u2019t care. Like I had so many times before, I was willingly bad.</p><p>He let out a whimper, his hands disappearing in my hair, his kiss becoming feverish, it in turn spurring me on. Urgency rippled through us. I started ripping off his jersey, pulling it over his head, suddenly eager to feel his smooth, dark skin underneath my hands, the sun warming us. It felt like heaven and hell and danger to the touch.</p><p>His hands frantically found my breasts and grabbed a hold of the V-neck, ripping the shirt clear down the middle, the lace tearing easily. Then he sat up, overpowering me and bringing me to the ground. He buried his face in my breasts, letting out a happy grunt when he discovered my nipple ring for the first time, giving it a sharp tug with his teeth and a soothing lick after to calm my cries.</p><p>I ran my nails down his back, digging them in when the passion ran over, then took my hands to his jeans and groped hard at his erection. The moan I elicited out of him made me wet as water and I started grinding myself into him in pure impatience. I fumbled for the fly of his jeans and pulled them down to his knees, wrapping my legs around his bare ass, holding his length against me.</p> <p>He pulled up my skirt until it was around my waist and tore my cheap thong off with one smooth motion. His lips and teeth went to my neck, biting hard and sucking slow, making my back arch with each touch. His fingers found their way inside me, stroking and rubbing in all the right places until I moaned.</p><p>\u201cI need you inside me,\u201d I cried out as he swirled his hot finger around my clit, my hips bucking for more.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re mine,\u201d he grunted, mouth at my ear, tongue flicking my lobe. \u201cTell me that you\u2019re mine then I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>His other hand went to my breast and pulled at the nipple ring again. God damn it, I was going to lose it before it even started.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d I said, my voice shaking. I closed my eyes and threw my head back. \u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always were,\u201d he said and he reached down and inserted himself in me with one hard thrust. I felt the small of my back meet with the earth, a sharp pain that melted away to pleasure as he continued thrusting hard, his ass powering through and flexing hotly under my fingers.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go hard enough, fast enough, deep enough. I wanted him, all of him, I wanted everything to explode, I wanted stars and heat and waves that would carry me onto another day. I wanted to go back in time before this mess ever started, when it was just him and I and I didn\u2019t know any better and we had a home and a place where we could be us.</p><p>Javier let out a small cry as I ran my nails down his chest, his eyes blazing into mine, a yellow-gold dream as his face furrowed with the need to release. I needed it too.</p><p>He gave it his all, his taut muscles straining, sweat streaming off of him and pooling on mine, the sun bearing down on him from behind the orange trees, making his back glow. He pounded himself deeper, his fingers coming down bringing me to the brink again. I closed my eyes and felt myself fill up with the waves, the energy he was creating, the pressure between my legs that built up and up and up until I had to let go.</p><p>I cried out, swearing, my nails digging into his ass and lower back as he let out what could only be described as a roar, his body stiffening. He came hard inside of me, his eyes rolling back in his head.</p><p>He held that position, one frozen in the pain of pure pleasure, before exhaling and crumbling on top of me, his elbows propping up most of his body weight, his head now on my chest. I caught the smell of his shampoo and closed my eyes, my breath struggling to catch up, our chests rising and falling against each other in unison.</p> <p>We lay like that for some time, breathing, being. And when the passion, the dream-like state of our fucking wore off, I was left with thoughts I didn\u2019t want to think. Guilt for what I had done. Disgust for who I had done it with.</p><p>And yet, a sick part of me didn\u2019t regret a thing. It felt destined, bound to happen, something that had never come full circle until now. There was a sense of closure and peace that settled over us, like the tiny white petals that were flying through the air, swept in by the afternoon breeze.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Javier said. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten wilder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to handle you anymore.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself but it quickly faded.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how I was going to handle myself either.</p> <p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>I dreamed of Ellie again.</p><p>We were back in the large cavernous room, no walls, no ceiling, just a darkness that went on forever. The ground was black satin sheets disappearing into infinity.</p><p>Ellie was on the sheets, in cheesy white lingerie she\u2019d never wear in real life but it made me happy to see her in such a frivolous thing. She looked amazing, curvy and soft, crawling toward me on all fours, her breasts pushed up to her throat. Every part of me itched to touch her, hold her, possess her. I felt like if I didn\u2019t, she\u2019d be taken away, becoming someone else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d a voice called out from the distance. Deep, dark, ominous. \u201cEden, Eleanor, Ellen, Emily, Elaine,\u201d</p><p>Ellie turned her head to look, freezing on the spot.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d I tried to call to her, to get her to notice me, to keep crawling. But the words were lost in the room, sucked away.</p><p>Suddenly a cold wind blasted me, ice crystals forming on my glasses. I cleared them off in time to see Ellie slowly getting to her feet and walking the other way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d I yelled though my voice came out in a whisper.</p><p>She stopped and turned her head to the side, barely looking at me before averting her eyes down.</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019ll make me his queen. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>I made a move for her but only got about a foot before I wasn\u2019t able to move anymore. I was frozen in place, crystalizing from the bottom up.</p><p>A black shape formed behind her, growing in the moment, something so large and dense and malevolent that it seemed to take up all the space in the room, in the world, the universe. A flash of white teeth, coming for her.</p><p>Run, I screamed in my head. Ellie did not. She smiled in awe and stuck her hand out to touch the beast, it disappearing into the blackness.</p><p>Then she screamed and yanked her hand out. It was covered in blood.</p><p>Run, Run, Run.</p><p>And she did.</p><p>She tried.</p><p>She turned and tried to run but fell to the sheets.</p><p>The black beast descended on her. It grabbed her by the legs, swallowing them whole with that inky darkness.</p><p>Ellie screamed for me, fear taking over her eyes, her fingers desperately grasping the satin sheets, trying not to be taken.</p><p>The beast dragged her back and devoured her until there was nothing left but the abyss.</p><p>And there wasn\u2019t a single thing I could do about it.</p><p>When I came to, for one split second, I thought I was back in Sins &amp; Needles, lying on the floor of my tattoo parlor. I thought maybe everything had been a dream and I hadn\u2019t tortured anyone for information or ignited someone\u2019s face on fire or was on the run from the law. I thought maybe none of it happened and I was Camden McQueen again, a good boy. Weak, but good. There was a sense of relief in that.</p><p>Then my eyes started to focus on the ceiling and I realized that I wasn\u2019t in a tattoo parlor, I was in a veterinary clinic. I could smell the urine and chemicals and fur, hear the twitterings of various animals. Some woman was leaning over me with a stethoscope in her ears.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake. Hello, Camden, I\u2019m Carlotta Valdez.\u201d</p><p>I blinked hard and tried to sit up but she pushed me back down with a firm yet delicate hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be alright, just take it easy. You\u2019re heavily sedated. Gus didn\u2019t know what to do with you, poor man was a little crazy. You\u2019re really lucky, that bullet didn\u2019t hit any arteries. The wound was pretty clean. You\u2019ll heal up nice.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, feeling the wooziness sweeping over me. \u201cWhere is he? Where am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my clinic. Normally I treat dogs and cats but business is a little slow on Fridays, so I made an exception.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes again and looked at her closely. She was in her mid-thirties, pretty good looking actually. Large nose though it suited her face, good bones, nice, gentle eyes. Her hair was dark and gathered in a tight bun. She seemed trustworthy but I guess it didn\u2019t really matter if she was or not because I was lying on a cold table used to treat ailing pets and felt like I had enough drugs in me to bring down a horse.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I heard Gus\u2019s low voice from beside me. I turned my head to the side and gave him a small smile. He looked like he\u2019d aged ten years, the lines around his eyes deeper. \u201cHow does it feel knowing you were shot by the Mexican police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m on drugs.\u201d</p><p>Gus smiled and looked over me at Carlotta. \u201cSo am I his nurse now?\u201d</p><p>She grinned and tapped her clipboard with her pen. \u201cYes, you certainly are. Camden will be a good patient I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s much more agreeable than some of the cats I treat. You\u2019ll have to keep him hydrated and his arm needs to stay in the sling for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I swore. Being disabled wasn\u2019t going to help me in the long run. I needed to get to Ellie and for that every part of me had to work. The blackness that took her still haunted me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, not sounding very sorry. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been shot. So that\u2019s what happens. Be glad that cop wasn\u2019t trying to take your head off, because he could of.\u201d She sighed and looked at Gus, her eyes soft. \u201cI really wish you weren\u2019t doing this, especially with him banged up. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>Her lips twisted wryly. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been all that careful thus far.\u201d</p><p>Gus patted my good arm. \u201cCamden is a lot stronger and smarter than he looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is. The glasses help.\u201d She reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a business card. \u201cI know you have my number already, but here\u2019s my email. Keep me updated. Let me know how he is and if I can do anything to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough already, Carlotta, thank you.\u201d Gus put his hand behind my shoulder and began to push me up. \u201cSlowly now, Camden.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move any slower. I felt like I was pushing through quicksand. Once I was up straight, the room spun around until it slowed. Hell, these were some drugs. I was sure my eyes were rolling around in my sockets.</p><p>Carlotta appeared by my side with a glass of water and held it to my mouth. \u201cJust a little bit.\u201d</p><p>The moment the water hit my lips, I wanted more, all of it, but I held back and eyed her over the rim. \u201cI guess you know why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Gus was very forthcoming. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be much help. I treat animals and worried pet owners, I don\u2019t know all that much about Travis Raines and the cartels, just what everyone else knows about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll manage. Thank you for fixing me.\u201d</p><p>With great effort, I got to my feet and outside the vet clinic. We came out the back door to where the car was parked. Night had fallen and the GTO looked like a ghostly wreck under the lights of the parking lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gus waved at Carlotta then put me in the backseat, lying me down.</p><p>\u201cI thought this was suspicious,\u201d I reminded him, slurring my words a bit.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the car?\u201d he pointed out, getting behind the wheel. \u201cWe\u2019re a moving target for the police now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s time to ditch the old girl,\u201d I said sadly.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this car called J\u00f3se? Funny name for a girl. And I\u2019m not ditching it, there\u2019s far too much stuff in here, this was Ellie\u2019s life. We\u2019ll ditch it when we find her. I\u2019m not stopping until we hit Veracruz.\u201d</p><p>I was too dazed to argue. Gus revved the engine and peeled us out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we anyway? What happened?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Cordoba. A little off course, but Carlotta was the only person that I knew could help us.\u201d</p><p>And not turn out to be a traitor, I thought to myself.</p> <p>He continued, \u201cShe owed me a big favor anyway. I caught her father without papers in LA. I turned a blind eye and allowed him to stay. Carlotta grew up in California, then moved back home after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone move back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe missed it, I guess. It\u2019s not all bad. Hell, they might have the drug wars but their economy is a lot stronger than ours at the moment. She seems happy. She\u2019s married. We had a long chat while you were out.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my head rolling to the side. \u201cHow far are we from Veracruz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a hundred miles give or take. We\u2019ll be there in time for the nightlife to get good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNightlife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarlotta told me that Travis goes to this club every Friday night. It\u2019s pretty much public knowledge. It\u2019s very cheesy, touristy, frat boy jackasses, that sort of thing. He has his own room, a lot of guards obviously. I\u2019m guessing he probably owns the club by now. Anyway, security is extremely tight. Metal detectors, passport scanning and the works. But if she\u2019s right, he\u2019s there tonight. And maybe Ellie is too.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes, trying to fight through the cloud. \u201cHow will we get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we won\u2019t have to. We\u2019ll find her and follow her. Either way, we\u2019re tourists and we\u2019re white. We\u2019ll sail under their radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my arm in a sling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. You\u2019ll stay in the car. I\u2019ll go investigate.\u201d</p><p>I hated that idea. I wanted to go with him. I wanted to see her with my own eyes. I needed to. It wouldn\u2019t be real otherwise.</p><p>The monotony of the engine and smooth highway began to lull me to sleep. When I woke up, I\u2019d be in Veracruz.</p><p>\u201cGus?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Fragments of my dream were choking me. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll get Ellie back?\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>Things got very messy, very fast.</p><p>After the incident in the orange grove, we made our way back to Alvarado. Since my shirt was ruined, I had to hike my skirt up to my chest and wear it as a strapless dress. That, of course, exposed Camden\u2019s tattoo on my leg which both made Javier sullen and moody and me feel like a piece of shit. Camden. I succumbed to the past and my hormones and years of pent-up feelings. That\u2019s all it was. That\u2019s all it had to be. I couldn\u2019t fall for Javier again. I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>That\u2019s what I kept telling myself. So what if I told him that I was \u201chis?\u201d I didn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t the only one who arrived back at the fish shop looking different. Javier had a shiner forming on his right eye and his lip and nose were swollen from my punches. The minute we climbed the stairs and Raul and Peter saw what happened, I knew their tongues were wagging.</p><p>Javier and I went to our room, closing the door on their questions. I walked over to the window and stared out at the ocean, the low, dark clouds on the horizon that never seemed to come any closer. They just hovered there, ominous and waiting.</p><p>I felt his energy at my back, his presence, his gaze. Then he came closer to me and placed his hand on my bare shoulder. I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he said seductively. I didn\u2019t have to give into it again.</p><p>\u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>His breath hitched. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the horizon. The clouds were still not moving.</p><p>\u201cI have to get ... I know what I have to do. Now is not the time to start dredging up the past, to get involved in this.\u201d I couldn\u2019t let him fool me into thinking he\u2019s all I\u2019d ever have.</p><p>He placed his lips on my neck. I didn\u2019t flinch. I pretended it didn\u2019t feel good, electric.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is this?\u201d he asked, when he pulled away. I could feel he didn\u2019t go far, his mouth was close, tickling my skin.</p><p>\u201cJavier, this is a distraction. You know it. I have to get to Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admire your sudden dedication,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut we both know there is no stopping this. You are my queen, Ellie. And when Travis is gone, you will rule with me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to be his queen. I didn\u2019t want to rule over a terrible kingdom, a land of violence and strife. I was good, somewhere, I knew it.</p><p>Yet, I was going to help murder Travis Raines.</p><p>He let go of me and walked over to the closet, rifling through his clothes. \u201cTomorrow night, I will take you to The Zoo,\u201d he said, his voice back to business. \u201cThe club Travis will be at. Should be at. You\u2019ll go to the bar and order a drink and look for him. When you see him, you will not react. You will continue to scan the club. I just want him to see you. Then the next day, at the market, perhaps he\u2019ll have something to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>I gulped air. Panic fluttered through me, tiny winged insects.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if he wants to talk to me at the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you talk. We\u2019ll have you in something like you wore today. If he\u2019s anything like me, he\u2019ll want to rip your shirt right off you, just to get a taste of your tits.\u201d</p><p>I spun around in shock. \u201cYou want him to do that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, back to me. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t particularly want him to. I don\u2019t want any man even looking at you. But in the name of revenge, yes, it will have to do.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him as I came over, stopping at his back. \u201cSo I\u2019m a sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re good at making those now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said sarcastically.</p><p>He faced me, a twisted smile on his bruised lips. I felt like making them worse all over again.</p><p>\u201cThere are things we have to do in order to get what we want. You shouldn\u2019t let your conscience, or your feelings, ever stop you. We are both stronger than that.\u201d</p><p>The image of him in bed with the redhead. Patricia.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sacrifice,\u201d he went on smoothly, \u201cI\u2019m sacrificing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the greater good,\u201d I said snidely.</p><p>\u201cExcept there is no good here. This is for us. The greater us.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I knew I\u2019d have to get Travis\u2019s attention, I just didn\u2019t really think it would have to go to that, that Javier would let me, but apparently that wasn\u2019t the case here. He probably would care if I slept with Travis\u2014I mean, I know he would, judging by the anger in his eyes every time he looked at my cherry blossoms, but he didn\u2019t care enough to not have me do it.</p><p>\u201cOkay fine. I go get his attention. Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we play it by ear. Maybe go on a date with him.\u201d</p><p>My lip curled. \u201cWith that ... that man, Javier, I have to go out with that man.\u201d</p><p>He put both his hands on my arms and brought me into him, his eyes staring deeply into mine. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have you do this if I thought you couldn\u2019t. I know you can. You will be all the better for it. Can\u2019t you see what you\u2019ll become?\u201d</p><p>I looked down. \u201cI\u2019ll become like you.\u201d</p><p>He brushed my hair off my face. \u201cMy dear, you already are like me. You always have been.\u201d He placed his lips on my forehead. \u201cWhy do you think we work so well together? A soul needs its other half to truly live. I said that to you once, do you remember? That was a long time ago.\u201d His lips trailed down to my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t have a soul,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou make me feel like I do.\u201d</p><p>He led me over to the bed and gently pressed me down onto it. He kissed along my collarbone, nibbling as he went. \u201cI have no interest in redemption anymore. If I did, I know I\u2019d find it in you. Deep inside.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his erection against my leg. Hunger flared up inside me, hunger that made me feel disappointed in myself. For letting him do this. For liking it. For wanting it when I should know better.</p><p>He came up off my chest, his fingers already finding me wet for him.</p><p>\u201cSo drenched,\u201d he whispered, taking his fingers up and sliding them across his lips. \u201cThis taste. You\u2019re ready to be fucked again.\u201d</p><p>With one swift and powerful motion, he flipped me over on my stomach and pulled my skirt up around my waist. He grabbed the back of my hair and yanked my head back, painful pleasure radiating out from my head. The sex in the orange grove was child\u2019s play; I\u2019d forgotten how rough he could be.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give me much time to prepare for him before he thrust himself inside, my body expanding from his fullness. \u201cYou\u2019re wet but tight,\u201d he growled in my ear. \u201cPerfect.\u201d He slipped his hand over my throat and closed it there like he used to do. Instead of applying gentle pressure, just enough to feel taboo, to make me light-headed, he full on clamped his hand like a vice.</p><p>I had no air. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I started to squirm and he pulled me back harder with his hand, yanking my hair with the other, still thrusting into me in a frenzied rhythm.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know how to handle you?\u201d he groaned into my ear. \u201cWell I\u2019m handling you now.\u201d</p><p>I brought my hands up to my throat, trying to pry his fingers off.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I managed to eke out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell me when to stop,\u201d he grunted.</p><p>I decided elbowing him in the chest was better.</p><p>He let go of my neck and I collapsed onto the bed, trying to breathe, my throat tender and sore. He pressed down on me, keeping me flattened. \u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>I coughed, not able to speak yet. What the fuck just happened?</p><p>\u201cAngel, I thought you were tougher than that,\u201d he said, his voice a tad apologetic. He put his hand underneath my stomach, rubbing my clit. But the moment was gone and for once my body was responding to my head.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d I said, trying to turn over. He hesitated, as if deciding whether or not to let me move, then he backed off, pulling out of me. His eyes flashed in a mix of lust and concern, an odd combination for anyone but not for him.</p><p>He leaned back, sitting upright and pulled me on top of him, my legs going around his middle. He cupped my face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have been more ... considerate.\u201d</p><p>You scared me, I wanted to say. Instead I nodded, wanting to forget the whole thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, my beautiful Ellie,\u201d he whispered once he noted the expression on my face. He kissed me gently. \u201cThere I am talking about how you give me a soul and then I go and do a thing like that. I\u2019ll need to take it slow with you, won\u2019t I? Build up your tolerance, until you are strong enough for me.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. One minute I was strong, the next minute I wasn\u2019t. \u201cI am strong enough for you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled delicately. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. For now, I\u2019ll fuck you gently.\u201d</p><p>Then he lifted me up around my waist and lowered me onto his shaft. Javier was nothing but precise.</p> <p>We fucked sitting up, me riding him in waves, long enough for me to forget, for my thoughts to disappear, for the confusion to lift. We were only our bodies, only our lust, and, maybe, just maybe, only two tortured souls.</p><p>The next morning, he and I had breakfast on the balcony. Raul and Peter totally knew what was up after we\u2019d spent most of the evening locked in our bedroom. I was never good about being quiet in bed. Now that it was out in the open, Javier was being very affectionate and physical with me.</p><p>Especially around Raul. The moment the slime-ball stepped out on the balcony to join us, Javier\u2019s arm went right around my shoulder. I was glad for it, looking straight at Raul, daring him to do or say something. I wanted him to. I wanted him gone. And, I figured I\u2019d have that happen one day.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it was my upbringing or a sick sense of romance, but I had to admit, that despite everything, there was something incredibly ... thrilling ... about having Javier\u2019s affections so publicly. Here was a man with an empire, one of the most dangerous drug lords, someone with immense power and sway, and there I was, the apple of his eye. I felt a little like Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface ... although that movie didn\u2019t really end well for anyone.</p><p>So what was going through my head then? Did I really think that we could off Travis and I\u2019d be with Javier? Was that what I even wanted, to be his queen, his consort at his side?</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what I wanted anymore. I didn\u2019t have anything and the longer I was in Mexico with Javier, the more hazy my future became. I\u2019d wanted to be good, to be better than I once was and even though I was trying, even though I\u2019d been blackmailed into this whole mess, I felt like I was kidding myself. The future I had with Camden was gone, a daydream that was ripped away when I stepped inside Javier\u2019s SUV. That me, that Ellie Watt with her new hopes and fresh starts must have died that day.</p><p>Maybe I never really was trying. Maybe I\u2019d been kidding myself this whole time. Maybe a con artist from a family of con artists can\u2019t really change.</p><p>Maybe I had to accept that I really wasn\u2019t good and I deserved someone as bad as me.</p><p>I\u2019d start at the nightclub. Javier had gone out in the afternoon to get me clothes, coming back with a lovely, albeit skanky, dress. It reminded me a little bit of Camden dressing me in Vegas, the way his strong hands had put me in that scrap of material that hugged my every curve and made me feel invincible with his fresh ink on my leg.</p><p>No, I told myself sharply. I had to stop thinking that way. The past had to be buried. There was no Camden anymore.</p><p>Javier suggested I curl my hair into ringlets, producing a curling iron he picked up along the way. Dark smoky green eye shadow. Pale pink lips. He\u2019d gotten everything for me.</p> <p>By the time I was ready, I had to admit that even I thought I\u2019d get a few looks at the club. The dress was floor-length, bright tomato red, slit to my navel. It showed off the tan I\u2019d gotten while on the boat.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d he said as I stood in front of the mirror, hugging me from behind. Our reflection together startled me. I didn\u2019t recognize myself staring back. I looked sleek and powerful, like I should have maybe had that crown on my head. Javier\u2019s eyes in the mirror were bright like laser beams and he was staring at himself, not me.</p><p>It was a bit unnerving.</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He broke his stare with his reflection and smiled at me, kissing my neck.</p><p>\u201cYes. I want nothing more than to come on every single inch of that dress. Let you wear it out to the club like that, so everyone will know you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would scare Travis away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019d want the challenge.\u201d Suddenly he gripped my hand and spun me around to face him. \u201cAngel, please don\u2019t sleep with him tonight. I\u2019d like to keep you as my possession for just a bit longer. I want to be the only one inside you.\u201d</p> <p>I was taken aback. \u201cBelieve me, if I can get the job done without doing that, I will. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ll survive looking at him.\u201d My lungs were caving in at the thought. \u201cJavier, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m really, really scared.\u201d</p><p>He studied my face for a moment, a sort of amused glint in his eyes. \u201cI know you are. But take your fear and own it. This is your choice. Make your fear work for you. Make it, how you would say, your bitch.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me, soft and sweet, then smacked my ass hard enough to sting.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019re distracting me. I have to get ready.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his clothes from the closet and started stripping. His erection was pretty obvious. I raised my brow at it.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you looked amazing,\u201d he explained with a shrug. He put on his pale jeans and dark, wrinkled t-shirt with a nondescript logo. On his head was another baseball cap, this one blue and white, the Toronto Blue Jays. We couldn\u2019t have looked more different but it\u2019s what he had to wear while driving me. He wasn\u2019t going to come out of the car since we couldn\u2019t take any chances, especially around Travis\u2019s club. He had a full on purple and yellow eye now and his lip was still swollen. But it seemed that no one batted an eye at that anyway, not in this town.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked me. I shook my head vehemently. No, I was not.</p><p>He dipped his chin and then took my hand, leading me out of the bedroom to the living area where Raul and Peter were.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Peter said through his thick accent.</p><p>I gave him an appreciative smile, ignoring Raul entirely. I knew he was looking though, because of the way Javier\u2019s hand tightened at my waist.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you a stiff drink before we go, okay.\u201d He led me to the kitchen and poured a very large amount of tequila in a glass.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my lime and salt?\u201d I asked, eyeing it down.</p><p>\u201cLime and salt are for children and women.\u201d</p><p>I raised the glass. \u201cI\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Ellie Watt,\u201d he said. \u201cDrink up.\u201d</p><p>I shot it back in several attempts, coughing between each one. I felt a lot better, really fast.</p><p>\u201cNormally, I\u2019d suggest you drink the whole bottle,\u201d Javier said once we were in the car, pulling his cap further down on his head, the wisps of his shaggy hair sticking out the sides. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to need your wits about you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Yet, I was already scared witless.</p><p>It was around ten PM when we pulled into Veracruz, and despite the daily bloodshed, the city seemed vibrant with lots of young people milling about. Maybe living in such a dangerous city made the citizens party harder, enjoy the best of life, while they could.</p><p>Javier took the Range Rover down the busy streets while I stared at couples in white dancing gracefully across tiled plazas and brightly-colored restaurants with tables and music spilling out onto the sidewalks. The port and marina shimmered, flanked by tall hotels. The air was heavy with heat but the occasional breeze from the gulf came in and lightened the atmosphere while the thick smell of flowers would come in through the window. It was all very romantic, except that I was afraid to lower the window more than in inch, feeling protected by the bulletproof glass.</p><p>By the time Javier found parking on one of the side streets near the Zocalo, a popular square where the nightclub was supposed to be located, my hands were sweating and I was buzzing with nerves again. The tequila had worn off and left me nauseous instead.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, darling,\u201d he said, slipping a tiny adhesive chip to the fabric that covered my nipple ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can listen to you on my iPhone,\u201d he said waving his phone at me. \u201cIt acts as a little wireless microphone. There\u2019s a chance that the metal could set off the metal detectors they have in the club, so I figured your nipple ring was a good place to put it. It\u2019s going to set them off anyway and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have a few good laughs when you explain what it is.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cOh shit. Why don\u2019t I just take it out?\u201d</p><p>He wagged his brows. \u201cWhat\u2019s the fun in that? You\u2019ll be fine. Just flash them your tit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha.\u201d I seriously hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, growing serious and running his thumb over my lips. I held back the urge to nibble on it. \u201cYou\u2019re a con artist. You built a whole career on lying, on pretending to be different people. This is nothing. You walk around the corner to the square and you\u2019ll see the club, it\u2019s a small building. There will be a line-up already. Get in line. Wait your turn. Show them your passport, they\u2019ll scan it, they\u2019ll run the detector over you. You\u2019ll show your tit. You\u2019ll go through and head to the large circular bar in the middle of the room, near the dance floor. Travis\u2019s room is up the stairs but you won\u2019t even look there. You\u2019ll get your drink, watch the dancers, and, I am assuming, fend off porte\u00f1os looking to take you home. Sit there for at least three drinks. When you\u2019re done, if nothing has happened, tell the bartender \u2018thanks for the service, have a good night.\u2019 I\u2019ll hear that and come back for you. I\u2019ll pull up to here, the same spot. You get in. I take you home and fuck you senseless. That\u2019s how the evening will go.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. He was right. I was a con artist. Travis had made me one. I was born to do this.</p><p>I kissed him quickly on the lips as my skin fuzzed and shimmied with all the energy in the car. What we were doing. Who he was. Who I was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you,\u201d I told him, stepping out of the car. I stared at Javier for a good long moment, taking in his elegantly dangerous face, wondering how much trust there really was between us. Then I shut the door and walked off toward the nightclub.</p><p>I got more than my fair share of catcalls and whistles as I rounded the corner and came across the colorful plaza. It was alive with mariachi bands in the middle, tourists standing around and watching, with open-air restaurants filled to the brim with chatting patrons. I spotted the low mission-style house across the square with its cheesy zebra-striped sign that said The Zoo. Javier was right, there was already a line about twenty people deep.</p><p>I took in a deep breath and sashayed my way over to it, getting behind a young white couple with New Jersey accents. That calmed me down a bit, knowing that I could blend in with the other tourists. Despite the New Jersey couple in their jeans, everyone else in line was dressed up. I both blended in and stood out, which was exactly what we were hoping.</p><p>I did everything I could to stay calm and focused while I stood there, waiting for at least a half hour before I finally got to the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cID,\u201d the bouncer said. I handed him my passport and tried to take in his features without looking at him too deeply. I wondered if he worked for the club, for Travis, or both. I wondered if I\u2019d be seeing this man, with his big fat head and coal-black eyes again, in other circumstances.</p><p>He scanned my passport and handed it back to me. He nodded his fat head at the door. \u201cYou pay cover there, 250 pesos.\u201d</p><p>Ouch, that was steep. I didn\u2019t say anything, just nodded politely while he looked over my head at the people next in line.</p><p>I paid the girl at the door and when I stepped into the club, I was met with a wall of smoke and a blast from the past. The club was blaring a bumping remix of the Nine Inch Nails song \u201cWish.\u201d The very song tattooed on Javier\u2019s wrist. The song I picked out for him, the one, Trent Reznor sings, without a soul.</p> <p>\u201cMiss?\u201d one of the security guards was waving me over to him. I shook myself out of my daydream.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI guess I need to be screened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will only take a second,\u201d the man said and started waving the metal detector over my arms and legs while another man went through my purse. As predicted, the detector beeped when he scanned my chest.</p><p>The guard looked a bit embarrassed. \u201cUh, are you wearing a metal bra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it look like I\u2019m wearing a bra?\u201d I said, pushing my chest out, making him notice that the dress was cut down to my navel. \u201cIt\u2019s my nipple ring.\u201d</p> <p>The guards exchanged a look while the other gave me back my purse.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to show you?\u201d I asked. Even in the dark blue lights of the club, I could tell his face was darkening. \u201cI mean, if you look close enough, you can see through the fabric.\u201d I stretched it across my breast so he could see the shape of the ring poking through. That was enough for him.</p><p>He waved me away. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, you\u2019re clear.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and thanked them, making my way over to the large bar by the dance floor. It was still a bit early so there was a stool available at the end. Besides, it looked like most of the people there were in groups, filling up booths or yelling \u201cFist fuck!\u201d out on the dance floor. I ordered a rum and coke from the bartender and watched everyone, the sweaty moves, the flying hair, the lust for each other, for Mexico. I was being speared by small bouts of jealousy, that these people could be having fun and finding love and living life and I was about to offer myself, a lamb to the biggest baddest wolf of all.</p><p>I stared down at my drink, lost in my thoughts, in my shame. I was only interrupted to be hit on by a few Mexican guys, the \u201cporte\u00f1os\u201d that Javier \u201cwarned\u201d me about. They were local but harmless, not drug lords, just young guys having fun and looking for American tail.</p><p>It was when I finished my second drink and had to break the seal that it happened. I was leaving the bathroom, heading back to my spot at the bar when I saw him.</p> <p>Travis.</p><p>Oh my god, Travis.</p><p>He was walking down the stairs leading from his private area at the top.</p><p>He was looking right at me.</p><p>I only had a second to recognize him, to take him in. That\u2019s all I allowed myself or I would have frozen there on the spot and given myself away. I would have lost it all.</p><p>He was as I remembered him, but almost taller in a way. I know that was impossible but that\u2019s what it was like. Thin, straight up and down, in a black suit that made him look slightly sideways. He looked about sixty years old, grey hair slicked back with gel that accentuated his widow\u2019s peak; a handsome man who carried the same kind of feral elegance that Javier did. I could see people underestimating him, not seeing the danger.</p><p>But here, in this city, everyone knew who he was. Everyone knew the danger. He could order anyone in the club to be shot and there would be absolutely nothing anyone could do about it. It wouldn\u2019t even get reported to the police and if it did, the police would turn a blind eye. This man held the power of a small universe in his thin, tanned hands.</p><p>And he saw me. Or, at least he saw my dress. While his dark, cold eyes were distracted by my breasts, I looked at the bar and kept walking. I didn\u2019t dare look at him again or anywhere else. I kept my sweating hands as loose to my sides as possible, trying desperately not to clench them in case he was watching my every move.</p> <p>When I got back to my seat, the bartender asked if I was alright. I smiled quickly and told him I\u2019d better slow down my drinking. He gave me a bottle of water and a glass of orange juice.</p><p>A million feelings worked their way through me as I felt my heart lower itself into my chest, my lungs widening enough for air. I\u2019d seen him and survived. But this was only the beginning. There was no telling what I\u2019d have to do.</p><p>It was funny, when I heard Javier tell me what happened to his sister and her family, I felt anger and sorrow for them. When I heard Amandine explain the decline of her beloved city, I felt the need to straighten out the injustice. Yet I did not feel the anger and the horror of my own wounds, my own place in all of this. It was like what he did to young Ellie Watt had happened to someone else, some poor eleven-year-old girl whom I felt bad for but had no connection to.</p><p>Now, now it was all different. Now I felt the rage pulsing through me. I felt the urge to grab the nearest sharp object and spear it into his jugular. I wanted to cut his balls off and feed it to him. I wanted to make him pay for everything he did to me, that one act of violence to a helpless child, an act that ruined her life, her character, her very soul. I wanted revenge for that, for the pain I still felt in my leg when it was raining, for the scars I had to endure, that showed the world just how ugly I was inside, how ugly he made me.</p><p>I had to get out of there before I did something stupid.</p><p>I leaned over to the bartender and slipped him a twenty dollar bill as a tip.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your service, have a good night.\u201d</p><p>And then I left. My eyes were cast on the ground but I still felt Travis looking at me, from somewhere.</p><p>The feeling followed me down the street until I turned the corner and got in Javier\u2019s car.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>There was something different. The car had stopped. In the distance, I could hear people hooting and hollering.</p><p>Gus was getting out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I cried out, my voice groggy. \u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>He paused and looked at me. \u201cYou look like shit, Camden. You have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and sat up. My shoulder ached, my head hurt, everything was moving out of the corner of my vision. I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI am going with you. I will not let the chance to see Ellie go by. What if ...\u201d What if it\u2019s my last chance to see her again?, I finished in my head.</p><p>Gus waited a few beats, chewing on his lip, his bushy mustache moving in and out. Finally he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop you even if I tried. I don\u2019t think anything will ever stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d I said. He helped pull me out of the car and I let out a small yelp of pain as my shoulder got caught on the seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cEasy now,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cGot any of those painkillers?\u201d</p><p>He brought out a packet from his pocket and shook it. \u201cOxymorphone. You can\u2019t drink on it. That\u2019s what Carlotta told me. Of course it doesn\u2019t say that on the label because not many dogs drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me the drugs,\u201d I grunted.</p><p>He thrust them in my hands and I chewed two, grimacing through the bitterness.</p><p>\u201cAlso, you\u2019re only supposed to take one,\u201d he added.</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cUnless you\u2019re the guy who got shot, shut up.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSuit yourself. But if you collapse in the middle of Veracruz because of an opiate high, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>I had a feeling he meant it.</p><p>It took no time at all for the high to kick in and the pain to go away. We had a long walk ahead of us into the city though, having parked in a small suburb close by. I felt like I was bouncing on air instead of dirty streets, the garbage blowing in the light breeze looking beautiful. Everything was beautiful, from the perfume of hot asphalt and night-blooming flowers to the ornate streetlamps that lit up the colonial-style buildings as we got closer to the city. Really fucking pretty.</p><p>It was about that time that the euphoric effects of the drug started to wear off and the dirt and grit of the city became a reality. The pain was gone but the picture became real. We were here. We were going to a drug lord\u2019s nightclub to find my woman and bring her home.</p><p>We got a few curious glances from people as we walked through the city but not enough to arouse suspicion. Gus looked like your average grumpy fat man in his ridiculous Hawaiian shirt, a different print than the other, pink and orange. He must have had a closet full of them. I had my black cargo shorts and a long-sleeved plaid shirt that Gus must have pulled from deep inside my bag when they cut off my old shirt to operate. I still had my arm in a sling, but at least it was black. I looked like a hipster that broke his arm at a Vampire Weekend concert or some shit like that.</p><p>The Zoo was at the Z\u00f3calo, a square on Independencia Street near the harbor. It was pretty, black and white tiles in the middle, lined with busy caf\u00e9s, palm trees and beautifully arched buildings that glowed white and yellow in a slew of lights. A stoic cathedral looked over the whole scene. People were dancing, music was playing. It was Friday night in Veracruz and we were two of the few tourists not looking for a good time.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d Gus asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no longer high but I\u2019m not in any pain.\u201d</p><p>We were approaching The Zoo, a small building at one end of the square. The line-up outside looked ridiculously long. I hadn\u2019t been to many clubs in my life time, but back in LA I knew a line-up like that meant at least an hour wait. There was a chance we would miss her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts?\u201d I asked, looking around as we walked together. I didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary but then again, I didn\u2019t know who else I was looking for aside from Ellie. I didn\u2019t know what Travis looked like, though I sure as hell remembered Javier.</p><p>I choked back a rush of anger. A busy square in Mexico wasn\u2019t the place to lose it. I needed to keep my head clear and sharp. I could daydream about a million ways to torture Javier Bernal after I saw Ellie.</p><p>\u201cGoing into the club might not be a good idea,\u201d Gus said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their plan is but us strolling in there might put Ellie in jeopardy. It would probably be almost midnight before we got inside anyway.\u201d</p><p>I nodded at a caf\u00e9 nearby. \u201cHow about we sit there and have a few beers, just two guys kicking back. Keep our eyes open.\u201d</p><p>Considering how packed and popular the area was, we had to wait ten minutes before one of the outdoor tables finally cleared, but when it did, it was worth it. The table was right along the edge, giving us a great view of the club\u2019s line-up. We were far enough away that we would blur into the caf\u00e9 crowd if anyone was looking at us, but close enough that I could spot Ellie or Javier if I had to.</p><p>As much as I wanted us to look like two guys kicking back, tourists having a nice night out in Veracruz, I was a nervous, anxious wreck. I couldn\u2019t even drink because of the drugs so I had copious cups of strong coffee which really didn\u2019t help. I sat there, my leg bouncing up and down, trying to converse with Gus, unable to tear my eyes away from the building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hadn\u2019t seen her but every woman who reminded me of her made me jump out of my seat until Gus had to tell me to stop being such a heat score.</p><p>I switched the subject onto something else. Gus\u2019s health problems.</p><p>\u201cSo what was wrong with you, Gus?\u201d I asked him, the fingers on my good arm now tapping on the table as I scanned the crowds.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything but I knew he heard me.</p> <p>\u201cFirst Lydia, then Dan. Both mentioned you had health problems or something for a while. Just curious as to what it was.\u201d</p><p>When he still didn\u2019t say anything, I tore my eyes away from the building and looked at him. He was staring off into the distance, looking utterly lost.</p><p>He sighed and looked down at his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s personal, Camden. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offended,\u201d I told him, turning my gaze back to the crowd. \u201cBut since we\u2019ve been through a lot this past week, I figured I\u2019d be privy to some personal things. You know everything about me. What happened with you? Why are you not matching up with the man that Ellie described to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome people do. They usually have their reasons.\u201d</p><p>He chugged his entire beer then slammed it down before motioning for the waiter to bring him another. \u201cAh hell.\u201d</p><p>Once the waiter disappeared, he leaned back in his chair and said, \u201cI had mental health problems, Camden. I sort of lost my mind for a while.\u201d</p><p>He said this so casually that it took me a bit to realize the gravity of it all.</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cYes. For real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl broke my heart. Isn\u2019t that always the way?\u201d</p><p>I leaned in closer. \u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>His face twisted as he grappled with something inside. \u201cIt ... it wasn\u2019t meant to be. She was married to a good friend of mine. Once upon a time, she should have been married to me. I guess I got stupid, fell back in love with her. It didn\u2019t go anywhere. She made it seem like it would, like it wouldn\u2019t be just an affair but ... anyway I believed her. She made a living out of lying and I should have known the difference. Played me for a fool, like she played everyone else.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cGus, don\u2019t tell me this is a cautionary tale meant for me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot sideways to mine. \u201cNo, Camden. You asked. I\u2019m telling you the truth what happened. But if you want to learn anything out of this it\u2019s ... don\u2019t lose your head. Lose your heart but don\u2019t fucking lose your head. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll get that back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat would you do if you saw her again? The woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now it\u2019s a cautionary tale.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, my eyes back to the line-up. Still no Ellie and it was getting late. \u201cI\u2019m just curious. I know what it was like for me when Ellie came back into my life. I suppose I kind of lost my head too. Fuck, I know I did. How else did I fucking end up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Gus said raising his beer. I clinked my coffee cup against his. \u201cWhat a couple of fucking headless chumps we are.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled at that and drained the last bit of coffee into my mouth.</p><p>Then everything around me whirled to a halt.</p><p>Slow-motion.</p><p>Ellie, Ellie, Ellie.</p><p>There she was.</p><p>She was leaving the club and walking down the center of the plaza. She was alone. She was devastatingly beautiful, so much so that it was surreal to even be admiring her beauty in such a moment of complete shock.</p><p>There she was.</p><p>Her head was down, looking at the ground a few feet in front of her. She was walking fast, in a hurry, in a bright red dress that glowed on a night like tonight. It was cut all the way down to her stomach, showing off a new tan, attracting the blatant stares of every single man she walked past. Her black hair was done up in ringlets, like a film star, her makeup was seductive and smoky. I\u2019d seen her dressed up to the nines in Las Vegas, but it was nothing like this. This was different \u2013 she looked different, walked different, was different. My heart clenched painfully as I was assaulted with things I had no time to think about.</p><p>\u201cGus,\u201d I managed to say. I couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cI see her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t see us\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Gus was getting up, pushing his chair back with a loud scrape and Ellie disappeared around a crowd of people. \u201cWe need to follow her. Now.\u201d</p><p>He threw a handful of pesos down on the table and we quickly got onto the plaza. She was far in front of us, a quick red slash in the crowds of people. We tried to walk as fast as we could without looking like we were chasing someone, but after Gus had collided with the third gawking tourist, we knew it wouldn\u2019t matter. Everyone was chasing someone in Mexico.</p><p>We started trotting as she disappeared around the corner. Where was she going? Why was she dressed like that and why was she alone?</p><p>Then I remembered what Felipe had said back in Ocean Springs. That they took her to see Travis. That they wanted her at first to kill her parents. Were the two connected?</p><p>Or ...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s using her as an assassin,\u201d I said as we were about to round the corner.</p><p>Gus pulled back on my good shoulder when we reached the edge of the plaza. \u201cWait. We have to be careful.\u201d</p><p>He poked his head around and then waved me over. I did the same. Ellie was walking down the street but cutting across it to an idling SUV. We walked quickly in the shadows, ducking between cars, trying to get close enough to see who was driving the beat-up looking Range Rover. We couldn\u2019t see inside.</p><p>\u201cVeracruz license plate, YBA something,\u201d Gus said from beside me just as Ellie got inside.</p><p>I looked down. He had night vision goggles in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you get that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMy pants,\u201d he answered.</p><p>The car began to drive off with Ellie inside. I leaped out onto the street, contemplating running after the car, waving my arms, doing something.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose her,\u201d Gus said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, you want to run after the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather drive,\u201d he said. He took out a screwdriver-looking thing from his pocket and jabbed it into the lock of the hatchback next to us. He busted open the lock with ease and motioned for me to get in the other side while he unlocked the door and got started on the wires beneath the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTo know how to catch car thieves, you have to know how to steal a car,\u201d he grunted. The car started with a roar as if to punctuate his sentence and we were bounding down the street, trying to catch up with the Range Rover that was now turning left onto a busy street.</p><p>We plowed through the lights as they went amber, under the early Christmas decoration wreaths hung above the intersections. The Range Rover was now two cars in front of us. Perfect stalking distance.</p><p>Gus navigated the stolen car through the Friday night traffic with ease. \u201cWe\u2019ll return the car tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Energy and twisted excitement was flowing through me. \u201cGus, I don\u2019t really care. I\u2019ll do anything not to lose her, a car is nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>We followed the Range Rover as it headed out of the city and onto the highway leading south to Alvarado.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said about Ellie ... I think Javier\u2019s using her as an assassin. Or at least some sort of attempt to get Travis, to kill him.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI figured that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I pulled my eyes away from the Rover long enough to give him a betrayed look.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d lose your nut, Camden. I know how much she means to you. Boy, do I ever.\u201d He shook his head to himself.</p><p>\u201cJavier is putting her in Travis\u2019s lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone shows it like you. Just because I\u2019m not setting people\u2019s faces on fire, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not upset.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell if that was a dig at what I did to his best friend or not, so I decided to let it go. We had bigger things to do than argue.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Ellie doing this? She was there. She was in his club, looking like ... a goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is Travis. And Ellie has never forgotten what he did to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer parents had a part in it too.\u201d</p><p>His face grew grim. In the flash of headlights from oncoming traffic, his skin was completely white. \u201cThey did. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why Javier thought he could get Ellie to ... well, whatever that cartel kid back in Mississippi told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I sat back in the seat, shaking my head. \u201cI just don\u2019t. Why doesn\u2019t Javier kill these people himself? Why get her to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he has his own agenda. Or maybe he thinks he\u2019s doing her a favor. Maybe that\u2019s why she was out there tonight. She agrees with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she agree to anything that man says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you really understand the history those two share.\u201d</p><p>I felt like punching my fist through the window with my bad arm. Just to feel the pain.</p><p>\u201cI need another pill,\u201d I said, grinding my teeth instead.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cWe need you to be thinking straight right now. We need our Ellie back, you got it?\u201d</p><p>Our Ellie. I liked the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>We ended up following Ellie all the way into Alvarado. The town was quiet and our presence this late at night would be known so we had to take our time, hanging way back and occasionally turning off the headlights.</p><p>The Range Rover parked outside of a fish shop on the malec\u00f3n, right on the edge of the sea. We parked up the street, watching Ellie\u2019s and Javier\u2019s silhouettes leave the car and go into the building. I didn\u2019t need features to recognize the man. Sometimes a featureless black shape was all it took.</p><p>We decided to head to the beach and get a better look at the place from there. We edged silently along the malec\u00f3n wall, the walkway between the sea and the beach, until we came across a concrete pier with a few fishing boats tied up. We jumped into one and crouched down low, hiding behind smelly crab traps.</p><p>Gus had out the night vision goggles and was playing with them when a light went on in the upstairs of the fish market.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I breathed out. A sliding glass door opened and Ellie stepped out onto the balcony, still in her dress. She closed the door halfway behind her and walked to the railing, leaning against it, staring out at the sea.</p><p>I snatched the goggles out of Gus\u2019s hands to get a better look. She looked stunning even in greeny haze of the night vision. She still took my breath away, so much so I didn\u2019t have space in my brain to ponder the big picture\u2014where she was and who else she was with.</p><p>\u201cShe must be blackmailed somehow,\u201d I whispered to Gus. \u201cOtherwise she could jump down onto the sand and leave. She could run away. She\u2019s good at that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me those,\u201d Gus said, taking the goggles out of my hands. He peered through them, twisting the knobs and we both crouched there among the crab traps, watching our dear Ellie staring off into the distance. I looked behind me to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing something. The moon was obscured by heavy clouds in the distance, settling over the water like giant spaceships. She was staring at nothing or perhaps at everything. I wondered if she thought about me.</p><p>\u201cShe looks okay, though,\u201d he said, in a bright tone that came across fake. \u201cI mean, she doesn\u2019t look traumatized. Or beaten. Just pensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do people with Stockholm Syndrome look?\u201d</p><p>He sucked his lip before saying, \u201cThey look a lot like her. Not usually as well dressed though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell I still think there has to be a reason why she\u2019s there, why she\u2019s doing this. It can\u2019t be black and white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve known Ellie, she\u2019s always been grey. No black, no white.\u201d</p><p>We watched her for a few moments more. She hadn\u2019t moved. I started thinking whether we should come back in the morning or just act now, waving underneath the balcony like a tattooed Romeo, when Javier\u2019s silhouette appeared at the door.</p><p>I sucked in my breath, blackness poking at my insides.</p><p>The door slid open and Javier stepped out. He closed the door behind him and the two of them were lit only by the pale light from inside.</p> <p>I tried to take the goggles from Gus but he held onto him. \u201cCamden, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d I asked, even though I could see their black forms melding together, becoming one. Either he was standing in front of her talking to her or ...</p><p>I ripped the goggles out of his grasp. He turned around, slumping to the floor, not wanting to look at whatever it was that lay ahead for me.</p><p>I put the goggles to my eyes and looked through the viewfinder.</p><p>At first she looked like she was talking to Javier. Then his head disappeared. He went low, as if he was picking something up off the ground. That\u2019s what I thought he was doing, that he dropped something, until I realized he wasn\u2019t coming back up. And then Ellie\u2019s back arched over the railing, her throat exposed, her hair hanging and her mouth open in passion.</p><p>I could hear it, traveling across the water to us. Her moans. I\u2019d brought out those same moans myself, perhaps using similar methods. But I still couldn\u2019t quite grasp what was going on until I saw Javier appear in the night vision, like a green snake. His hands were all over her, his mouth at her neck, kissing down to her collarbones and chest. And Ellie, Ellie, my Ellie, my woman, she was succumbing to it. Even worse, she was enjoying it. After a while her hands went to his hair and she tugged on it shoving him back downward.</p> <p>That was about as much as I could take before it sunk in. Before I realized what I was seeing before my very own fucking eyes. Javier and Ellie. Together.</p><p>I hoped vomiting wouldn\u2019t make that much of a sound because that\u2019s the only thing I could think of doing to deal with all of this. I wanted to throw up, the bile filling my mouth, as if emptying my stomach would empty all the hurt and pain and hate that was filling up inside of me. I didn\u2019t know what else to do except wish for death and darkness and anything that would take this torture away. I felt like my heart was being ripped out of my mouth and twisted around my throat, choking me.</p><p>I must have fallen to my side, because the next thing I knew my head was resting against damp crab trap netting and Gus was shoving two painkiller tablets into my mouth and moving my jaw up and down, trying to get me to chew them.</p><p>That was the last thing I remembered before things got fuzzy and I stopped feeling.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>With the morning sun streaming through the bedroom window as it ascended over the sea, it was hard to imagine anything in life being that bad. For a split second, with Javier\u2019s arm wrapped around my waist, his chest rising and falling behind me, I could pretend that this was my life now: this room, him and I, the shimmering waves at our doorstep.</p><p>It was tempting, too, to ask for this to be my future. To forget about revenge, loss and lies, and just forge through, making a new path. Why couldn\u2019t life be about us rolling in the sheets, enjoying each other\u2019s bodies, drinking beer and eating fresh fruit, running on the sand, eating at quaint little caf\u00e9s and buying fish every night from Pedro?</p> <p>I knew the answer to that \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be enough. Oh, it would be enough for me, to just live and not lie. But Javier would always want more. That was the tragedy of our relationship. That, despite the years that passed, the passion that we shared, I would never be enough for him. He needed his revenge more than I needed mine. Perhaps when this was all over and his sisters were safe and Travis was dead, it could work. Maybe he\u2019d give up all his power and live the simple life. Maybe he\u2019d keep it and convince me to join forces, to embrace the bad side. I didn\u2019t know and it was the kind of thing I could never ask for, because the two of us together were as much about deceit as we were about love. How could you ever have both of those and still call it even?</p><p>But, maybe, when you had nothing, you had to take what you could get, even if you knew it would hurt you in the end. A love that starts out under a lie is bound to kill you and sometimes you lived to tell the tale.</p><p>A tear rolled down my cheek, cold against my warmed skin. I sniffed and felt Javier\u2019s arm around me, tightening. I wished I could say it made me feel safe. It didn\u2019t. Because I knew what I did last night and what I had to do today. I was going into the lion\u2019s den, under my own power, my own need for vengeance. I was going without protection. Without a safety net. Without a shield.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d I heard a groggy but concerned Javier mumble into my ear.</p><p>I swiped away the tear and rolled onto my back, willing the rest of the tears to stay inside, where they belonged. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Just emotional I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he said, holding me closer to him. \u201cYou did so well last night. Travis saw you and you played it just right. You\u2019re going to do fine today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I lied. I felt like I\u2019d do anything but fine. Today there was a chance that I\u2019d have to do more than see his face in a nightclub. I might have to talk to the monster, the very one I\u2019d wanted to scar and burn all those years ago, the man whose death I used to dream about. How could I be fine?</p><p>Javier had his way of quieting my thoughts though. We had just enough time for a quick roll in the hay before we had to get up and get ready for the day. As much as I was sure that fucking him was fucking with my head, it was the only time I\u2019d really get peace from what was going on around me. I liked to pretend that everything was going to be alright.</p><p>This was going to be the last time I\u2019d see the fish shop for a while. Before the market, I was going to check into the hotel in Veracruz and spend the next few days alone, with only Enrico the hotel staff to relay messages, though Javier did say he would try and meet up with me at some point if the coast was clear.</p><p>I had just finished packing my bag for my role as American tourist when I heard shouting from the kitchen, Javier laying into someone.</p><p>Curious I came out and saw him spearing Raul with a most heated gaze \u2013 the kind of you never wanted to see Javier give anyone. Raul was leaning on the counter as if he didn\u2019t give a shit, a line of coke on a colorful plate and rolled up pesos beside him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, eyeing the drugs. Raul looked normal but wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. It was then that I noticed Raul\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d was definitely always high, his beady, red eyes were a dead giveaway. I\u2019m not sure why I never put two and two together \u2013 Raul was a coke addict.</p><p>Javier reached over and violently tipped up Raul\u2019s chin. \u201cThis motherfucker is doing shit right in the open now, where anyone can see it. No respect.\u201d</p><p>Raul ripped his face away from him and crossed his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s just us here, Javi. You never used to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always cared!\u201d Javier roared. \u201cYou don\u2019t do this anymore, you got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not around her, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, wondering if there was some drug lord mantra like you could never get high on your own supply. I was pretty sure there wasn\u2019t considering cartels didn\u2019t exactly have a code of ethics. Then again, Javier wasn\u2019t like everyone else. He had his own moral code, as warped and twisted as it was.</p><p>Raul bent over and quickly snorted up the rest of the cocaine. Then he threw the pesos in Javier\u2019s face and walked down the hall, bumping me out of the way with his shoulder. He disappeared down the stairs and I looked back to Javier, certain he was about to lose it.</p><p>He was close. Temples red, fists opening and closing, head back and staring at the ceiling. These moments with Javier were dangerous \u2013 you never knew which way he was going to go and I couldn\u2019t blame him at all if he went apeshit on Raul.</p><p>I stood there watching him for a few moments then thought better of it, thinking he needed privacy, and turned to head back to the room.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Javier called out, his voice hoarse. \u201cCome here, please.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be lying if I said that a few panicky butterflies didn\u2019t start fluttering in my stomach at that moment. I did as he asked, approaching him as you would a stray dog, unsure whether it would bite or lick you.</p><p>\u201cCome closer,\u201d he said softly, eyes still on the ceiling.</p><p>I did, taking a very cautious step.</p><p>He raised his arms out to the side, pulling me into a hard embrace.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get rid of him,\u201d Javier mumbled into the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cRaul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s breaking the rules. He\u2019s disobeying orders. I know the signs when I see them. He\u2019s going to switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the coke? You run drugs into America, Javier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t use them, you know this. Drugs clutter the mind and the soul.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip from pointing out his hypocrisy. Now wasn\u2019t the time. The truth was, I wanted Raul gone, too. The drug use was just his way of sticking to Javier. At least he was giving us a warning.</p><p>He kissed the top of my head. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you checked in.\u201d</p><p>The butterflies reappeared. I was going to have to get used to them from here on in.</p><p>The hotel room was very nice, a bit overly \u201cfiesta\u201d for tourists really looking for that true Mexican feeling. The closets were shuttered teak, colorful striped rugs lined the terracotta tile floors and the back patio was lined with glazed blue pots overflowing with bougainvillea and hibiscus. It was private and peaceful and, as Enrico closed the door behind him, leaving me sitting on the white-lace bedspread, very lonely. I wouldn\u2019t say I missed Javier, but it was the first time I\u2019d been without him in a long time.</p><p>The upside of that was that I was finally free. I could walk out the back door and disappear and maybe no one would find me again. I\u2019d drift out there in the world, perhaps finding myself in the process.</p><p>Yet, I didn\u2019t do any of that. Because of the very reason I turned myself over to Javier in the first place. Yes, I did it to save Camden. But it was my fate, my punishment for my past sins. And I had a feeling if I ran again, they\u2019d continue to catch up to me until I put a stop to them, once and for all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had to get to Travis.</p><p>Then the real freedom would come.</p><p>I sighed and looked over myself in the antique mirror. My hair was done up in ringlets again, my makeup still heavy handed but appropriate for daytime. My razor blade necklace hung around my neck, a reminder of who I was and why I was doing this. My outfit wasn\u2019t risqu\u00e9 like last night\u2019s but still pretty. Floor-length black peasant skirt, black and hot pink Mexican print off-the-shoulder top. I\u2019d cut a flower from the patio and pinned it in my hair.</p><p>Before Javier dropped me off, we went over the plan one last time. I was to take a taxi to the market and spend a few hours acting like a tourist, stopping at every booth, smelling fruits, tasting samples and haggling with vendors over leather belts. Travis would be making his rounds. Somehow I\u2019d have to get myself noticed in the crowd. Now was the time to make the move, to flirt, or \u201cwhatever it was that you did to me\u201d as Javier put it.</p> <p>I had no idea what that was. I was taken with Javier the moment I first laid eyes on him. It was hard not to be, his magnetism came shining through. But Travis ... I couldn\u2019t imagine flirting with him. I knew once I saw him, it would take all I had again to keep myself from hurting him. But I had to be strong. I had to be the con artist that I was meant to be: cool, collected and in control. Or, in other words, I had to become like Javier.</p><p>I gave myself one last look in the mirror and swiped on bright pink blush to liven up my face before I headed out to the lobby. The day was sweltering and vacationers were already lying by the azure pool, getting the sun\u2019s rays before it became too unbearable. Half of them looked like tomatoes already.</p><p>Enrico called for my cab at the front desk and wished me good luck, adding that he\u2019d check on my room later tonight to see if I needed anything. I knew what that meant \u2013 he\u2019d relay my messages back to Javier. I didn\u2019t see why I couldn\u2019t just call him, why this had to be such a secretive operation. Perhaps the cartel had control over the phone lines too.</p><p>They certainly had control over the market. I had wondered what the point in all of this was, why did I have to set everything up so delicately and convoluted when someone could just bring a sniper rifle to the market and blow Travis\u2019s head off. Once I got out of the cab, I understood how powerful the man was. He practically owned Veracruz, or at least its army and police force.</p><p>Everywhere you looked there were armed guards and army-fatigued police officers, automatic rifles at their sides. They were stationed at all corners of the market, as well as inside the market, patrolling the aisles, hands behind their backs. I did a quick sweep of the surrounding buildings as the cab driver counted the pesos I\u2019d handed him. When you looked for it, you could find them everywhere \u2013 a face at a broken window, a couple of guards on the roofs. The entire market was being watched and patrolled from every single angle. Whoever was stupid enough to try and kill Travis here would probably not only fail but certainly die in the process.</p> <p>All of this protection for one horrible man. A horrible man with far too much power and money.</p><p>A man that I was supposed to stop.</p><p>It seemed laughable now.</p><p>The cabbie gave me back a few pesos \u2013 he\u2019d short changed me but I didn\u2019t care. I shoved it in my macram\u00e9 purse, threw my shoulders back and prepared to enter the chaos of Veracruz\u2019s Saturday open-air market.</p><p>Vibrant was definitely one way to describe it. I bet there was nothing you couldn\u2019t buy here. From hanging chickens and chilies to hand-tooled leather bags and expertly woven shawls, it had everything you could want. There was a tiny part of me who thrilled in this, pretending, just for a second, that I was a tourist looking for souvenirs from her trip to Mexico. I smiled politely at merchants, waved my hands dismissively at those who were shoving pig\u2019s ears in my face. I fumbled through my first lines of Spanish, drawing confused looks from a guy I was trying to buy silver earrings from, until I finally hit my stride and was able to communicate the basics. I walked away with the earrings, a white silk shawl, bags of miniature limes (they were cute and I figured in another life I could make margaritas out of them) and brightly-colored chili peppers, a leather belt with a silver buckle that had \u201cbad girl\u201d engraved on it and a greasy paper bag full of churros.</p><p>I\u2019d munched through one of the churros and made my way around the market for the second time, the sun beating down mercilessly. I stepped into the shade of an awning, part of a butcher shop where cow hocks were being hung on hooks and flies buzzed around greedily and wiped the sweat off my forehead. I didn\u2019t want to look like I was searching for anything in particular, but I hadn\u2019t seen Travis yet. I figured that was strange considering he\u2019d be easy to spot, no doubt flanked by a whole phalanx of bodyguards, as if all the stationary guards weren\u2019t enough. He really would want to be seen as the city\u2019s Don Vito Corleone.</p> <p>I stayed in the shade until the sweat cooled and I set off again, this time walking down the middle aisles where the crowd was the thickest. A tiny little shopkeeper in a ruffled dress jumped out from behind her stall and started waving around sarongs, pointing to my skirt and yammering on about how I must buy them.</p><p>I did my shake of the head, hands waving no, combined with the polite and sympathetic smile but the woman wasn\u2019t having any of it.</p><p>\u201cYou American, you buy,\u201d she said in broken English. She was pushy but her gap-toothed smile was so genuine that I felt bad for refusing her. She placed the sarong in my hands, getting me to pet the fabric, as if it were made out of precious gold instead of scratchy cotton.</p><p>I was still shaking my head, trying to be gentle about it, when my eyes went over her tiny head and focused on something in the crowd of shoppers.</p><p>There was a man, a white man about a foot taller than everyone else, who had stopped down the aisle in front of one of the stalls. I couldn\u2019t see his face, just his profile from behind. Strong tanned neck, short black hair that glinted blue in the sunlight, and ears that stuck out slightly.</p><p>My heart hammered in my chest, demanding I acknowledge its presence.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Then he turned around and looked my way.</p> <p>Looked right at me.</p><p>Blue, beautifully blue and soulful eyes behind Clark Kent glasses. Strong, wide jaw, full lips, straight nose. Model looks on a model body, dense muscular shoulders, biceps I couldn\u2019t fit my hands around. I knew because I\u2019d tried. Tight black t-shirt that showed it all off, including a sling that went around one shoulder, propping up his heavily-inked arm.</p><p>Camden McQueen.</p><p>I dropped the sarong, my bags, everything, caught up in his stare. It couldn\u2019t be him. Why was he here?</p><p>Had he really come for me after all?</p><p>An enormous wash of peace and heart and warmth came over me, giving me strength and resolve that seemed to resonate in my bones. I broke out into a smile so wide I thought my face would split in two. My chest was about to burst.</p><p>But he did not return the smile. He kept staring at me, over the heads of everyone bustling past him, the chaotic noise and movements. His eyes were hard, almost cold. Hurt. Something inside me was bleeding, just a trickle.</p><p>Then he turned around, started walking away. It wiped the smile clear off my face.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I yelled, trying to be heard above the noise of the market. I left my bags at my feet and started running down the aisle to get to him. I could see his head disappearing slowly, the further he got away from me, the more the patrons, couples, families, tourists, got between us. \u201cCamden!\u201d</p><p>Why was he trying to get away from me? Did he not see me? Did he not recognize me?</p><p>I kept pushing my way through, knocking over people\u2019s bags, shoving them into each other, knocking over crates of fruit, yelling, \u201cLo siento,\u201d the whole time. I squeezed past everything and everyone, ducking, dodging, trying my hardest to catch Camden.</p><p>And just when the aisle intersected with another aisle, just when I saw the space in front of me open up, someone stepped out in front of me. Not just someone.</p><p>Someone and his many bodyguards.</p><p>I nearly ran straight into Travis Raines.</p><p>My feet stopped in time and I wavered inches away from him.</p><p>He was staring down at me, a predatory smile on his face. I shot him a quick glance, forgetting all about the part I was supposed to be playing, and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I made a move to get around him \u2013 I had to get to Camden \u2013 but he reached out and grabbed my arm, softly. His fingers met with my skin and I felt revulsion swarm all over me.</p><p>\u201cYoung lady, you look familiar to me,\u201d he said. His accent was strange, Southern but he\u2019d subconsciously picked up on the cadence of Spanish.</p><p>My brain was caught, bogged up, stuck. I had to act the part. I had to find Camden. I had to destroy Travis. I had to get out of here. I had to stop running from my past. I had to run after my future.</p><p>My future was getting away.</p><p>I swallowed hard, realizing that Travis was staring at me, waiting for an answer and if I didn\u2019t play my cards right, I wouldn\u2019t have a future to run away to.</p><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met before,\u201d I said and smiled sweetly, amazed that my voice sounded steady. \u201cI\u2019m not from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d he said, tone light and eyes ... well, I tried not to look at his eyes, at their cold dark depths. I looked at his bodyguards instead, all four of them, big guys with faces made of stone. Each second I stood there was a second away from getting Camden. My Camden. Who came for me, to rescue me, to make sure I was safe. My Camden who looked at me with all the hurt in the world.</p><p>Oh god, what have I done?</p><p>My eyes drifted over to the stalls, hoping I\u2019d spot him somewhere. Wishful thinking. Travis leaned in closer.</p><p>\u201cLooking for someone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw someone I knew.\u201d Shit. I needed to hold it together.</p><p>\u201cThen you see how it can happen. I saw you last night. You were at my club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour club?\u201d I asked, taking in his bodyguards again because that\u2019s exactly what a young woman would do if this man was talking to her like this, surrounded by these thugs.</p><p>He grinned and clacked his teeth together, like he was taking bites out of something. It made my blood run cold. \u201cYes, my club. I own The Zoo. I take it you don\u2019t know who I am?\u201d</p><p>You are the monster who ruined my life, I thought to myself, keeping my face as neutral as possible. You are the reason I\u2019m here and not running after the person who came after me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201can American I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, appraising me, something that Javier would sometimes do. The comparison made me feel sick.</p><p>How the fuck did my mother get involved with this man?</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re an American too,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia accent perhaps?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, trying to remember what my fake ID had said. My fake name. My god, I\u2019d forgotten everything already.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d I told him. \u201cI grew up in California. Pismo Beach.\u201d</p><p>He clacked his teeth together again. Psycho.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is your name, California girl?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cEleanor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely name. Do people call you Ellie for short?\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped for a moment. \u201cNo. Nora.\u201d</p><p>I had to get the fuck out of here before I really screwed things up. This was a bad idea. I wasn\u2019t going to pull it off. Javier had all kinds of wrong faith in me.</p><p>Travis touched my arm lightly. I forced a smile.</p> <p>\u201cNora, would you like to have a drink with me?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say no but something told me that \u201cno\u201d was out of the question with him. I don\u2019t think anyone said no to Travis Raines and lived to tell about it.</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He gave a slow nod. \u201cYes. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, forcing another motherfucking smile on my face. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not a psycho axe murderer.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a guffaw. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not an axe murderer. I\u2019m just an expat, a businessman, a capitalist. And I can show you a good time in Veracruz, Miss ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely. Miss Nora Willis. Come have a drink with me, Miss Nora Willis.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm for me, like any self-respecting woman in her right mind would take it. I eyed it. \u201cYou never told me your name,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t? It\u2019s Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Travis.\u201d</p> <p>He led me around, back the way I came, where I picked up my bags, and I fought every single urge in my body to turn around and look for Camden. He\u2019d come all this way for me and yet somehow I knew he was gone.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>\u201cI am going to fucking kill Javier Bernal.\u201d</p><p>The sentence hung in the car like a layer of fine dust. Gus put the bag of dried pork rinds that he was eating out of down and gave me a steady look.</p><p>\u201cI believe it,\u201d he said, crumbs in his mustache. \u201cBut do you really expect to go into that shop with guns blazing and get out of it alive? No one just kills Javier Bernal.\u201d He resumed munching. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think you really need to kill him. He\u2019s obviously not keeping Ellie there against her will.\u201d</p><p>My eyes seared into him, enough that his mouth jerked in surprise. \u201cSorry. I know this is tough for you.\u201d</p><p>Tough didn\u2019t even begin to describe it. Tough was easy. This was insurmountable. After we followed Ellie and Javier back to the fish shop, after I saw them ... together ... his hands and lips all over her, her head back, succumbing to him, I passed right out from the pain. Anyone else would say it was my shoulder, my gunshot wound sneaking up on me. It wasn\u2019t that. It was my heart being ripped in tiny, inconsequential pieces, bloody and cold. It was my pride falling down to its knees. It was everything I thought we\u2019d shared turning out to be a lie and the woman I was chasing was nothing more than a ghost.</p> <p>Gus let me pass out on the fishing boat until just before dawn, when the fishermen were coming to start their day. We went up the street, back to the stolen car and hunkered down there for most of the morning, watching the fish shop, trying to decide what to do next.</p><p>I wanted to barge in there and shoot Javier right between the eyes. Part of me didn\u2019t even care if it was a suicide mission. But he was right. It wouldn\u2019t matter \u2013 it would feel good for a second, but the damage was already done.</p><p>Gus cleared his throat. \u201cTo be fair, Camden, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s been going on here. Ellie might be playing a part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Ellie doesn\u2019t love easily. There\u2019s something else at work here, more than memories. We don\u2019t know what Javier has held over her head or what he\u2019s promised her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re taking her side,\u201d I grunted, glaring through the dirty windscreen at the fish shop in the distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always going to take her side,\u201d Gus stated. I looked over at him and he gave me an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I like you, Camden, but my allegiance is to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why are you doing all of this for her? What has she ever done for you?\u201d</p><p>He blinked fast a few times, as if keeping back tears, and then turned his attention to his bag of pork rinds. \u201cLove isn\u2019t just about keeping score, or what one does for another person and what another person has to do in return.\u201d</p><p>His words struck me. \u201cYou love her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI do. I\u2019m not in love with her. It\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m not like you. I care for her a great deal, more than she\u2019ll ever really know. It\u2019s ... complicated.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, watching him for a few moments, trying to figure him out. \u201cEverything that has to do with Ellie is complicated,\u201d I finally said, checking Gus\u2019s watch on my wrist. I was able to take another pill in about an hour. At this point it wasn\u2019t for the pain anymore \u2013 the pain in my heart had overtaken the wound on my shoulder and no pill would make that go away. But it gave me a sense of happiness, of oblivion, that I so desperately wanted to hold on to.</p><p>I know what Gus had been saying. I\u2019d been a damn, damn fool. Always the fool, Camden McQueen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll work this out,\u201d Gus said. \u201cYou can get the chance I never had. Ellie has a good heart in her, hidden but it\u2019s there, and you bring that out. You\u2019re good for her and you\u2019re good for each other. Don\u2019t you forget that.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to. I wanted nothing more than to forget.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s leaving,\u201d Gus announced and I sat up in the car, ducking down a bit. We were a block up the street, no one could really see us in the car. Still, it didn\u2019t hurt to be careful.</p><p>A man left the shop, walking down the street toward us. He was thinner than Javier and as he came close, I recognized him. Raul.</p><p>Now I really had to duck. I put my head down as if I were looking for something in the glove compartment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Gus said. \u201cDidn\u2019t even look this way. Who was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaul,\u201d I said, cautiously poking my head back up. \u201cOne of Javier\u2019s assholes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s got at least one.\u201d</p><p>We waited a few more moments, then Javier and Ellie stepped out of the fish shop and into the Range Rover. I wished we were in the GTO, not this piece of shit car. It would only have taken a few seconds for me to grab one of Gus\u2019s rifles from the back and blow his head off. I\u2019m sure Ellie would have a bit of a shock if her Mexican lover\u2019s head exploded beside her, but I figured she deserved it.</p><p>I patted the dashboard anxiously. \u201cOkay, there they go.\u201d</p><p>Gus brought the hatchback out onto the street, keeping far back from the Range Rover. We didn\u2019t have the cover of night anymore and while Javier wouldn\u2019t be looking for me \u2013 at least I didn\u2019t think he would \u2013 he would be looking for anyone following them. He had very precious cargo with him \u2013 himself.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s taking her to the market to see Travis?\u201d I asked even though I already knew the answer. Something must have gone wrong last night when she was at the club and now they were trying again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, unless they\u2019re only going on an outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d I spat out bitterly.</p><p>Gus gave me a look I didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge. I sat back in my seat, drumming my fingers on my knee, trying to keep whatever I had left in me together. I felt like I was coming apart at the seams with each second that passed, the images of what I saw in that sick, grainy, green light kept flashing in my head, settling over me like a gaseous cloud; toxic and deadly, a breeding ground for parasites. I was being eaten alive, consumed by broken love and betrayal and so much fucking hatred for myself. Because I was the one who let this happen. I fell for the wrong girl over and over and over again.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d I heard Gus say. I looked down at my leg. I\u2019d dug my fingernails into my knee, the skin beneath my shorts raised with drops of blood. It looked like the panther I\u2019d tatted there was bitten by a bigger cat. I stretched out my hand trying to relax.</p><p>We were in Veracruz when my watch went off and I popped another two pills, chewing them with bitter delight.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll recognize the stolen car?\u201d I asked woozily as we entered the city.</p><p>\u201cPeople steal cars here all the time. No one\u2019s looking for it. Still, one of us should go back to the GTO and put it somewhere else. The neighborhood seemed fairly safe but I wouldn\u2019t trust a soul in this city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy someone, I\u2019m guessing you mean you.\u201d I tried to raise my wounded arm to show him I couldn\u2019t drive but drooled on myself instead. These were the good moments, the ones where I was reduced to nothing more than a buzzing invalid.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any guns on us. I\u2019ve got a knife in my sock, that\u2019s it. We won\u2019t be able to do anything about Ellie until we\u2019re armed.\u201d</p><p>Even through my brief opiate haze, I had to admire Gus\u2019s dedication to this. I wanted to tell him that maybe there was no point in even going through with anything anymore \u2013 the Ellie we saw last night did not look like one who\u2019d be willing to go with us. I\u2019d remembered his Stockholm Syndrome on steroids remark. This might be what we\u2019re dealing with. In fact I hoped it was because the alternative had already torn me apart.</p><p>We followed the Range Rover to a small hotel in the city, set amidst lush rainforest and watched as Ellie got out with her bag. She waved goodbye to Javier like it was nothing and the car sped off.</p><p>\u201cWell, now fucking what?\u201d I asked, the good part of the drug phase starting to wear off. \u201cDo we follow Javier or her?\u201d</p><p>Gus sucked on his lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t leave Ellie here alone.\u201d</p><p>I watched as Ellie entered the hotel, then I pushed my door open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cCamden wait,\u201d Gus cried out in a hush, trying to keep his voice down. He grabbed my bad arm for a second, long enough for pain to shoot through me. \u201cSorry, but just wait. Okay. Okay, you stay here. I\u2019ll go follow Javier and see where he goes, then I\u2019ll go back to the GTO and get our gear, okay? Stay with her and watch. Don\u2019t do anything until I get back.\u201d</p><p>I got out of the car and looked in through the open window. \u201cHow do I know where to find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether she\u2019s going to the market or not, meet me there at 2PM.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find me.\u201d Then Gus hit the gas and the shitty little car took off down the road, trying to catch up with the Range Rover that was long gone.</p><p>I watched him disappear, standing on the side of the road a lot longer than I should have. Because I was afraid. ... afraid to walk into that hotel and see Ellie. I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do now. I wasn\u2019t about to say anything but even seeing her up close would be a sword in my gut.</p><p>I took in a deep breath through my nose, walked up the street to the entrance and went inside. The lobby was cool, with high arched doorways that let the breeze in from the courtyard I could see in the back. A slim, eager looking fellow was behind the front desk. My eyes darted across the tiled floor to see if Ellie was lounging in any of the wicker rocker chairs or obscured by the illustrious house plants. She wasn\u2019t \u2013 she must have gone to her room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I went up to the front desk clerk with the nametag Enrico and enquired about a room for the night.</p><p>\u201cWe have one,\u201d he said, flipping through the book. It had been a long time since I\u2019d seen someone log their details in an actual notebook, not a computer. \u201cShared bathroom, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSure that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m curious, how much is your most expensive room here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the garden haciendas in the back. They run about 300 US dollars a night but as you can see they are full.\u201d</p> <p>He tapped the notebook, enough for me to glance down and catch the name Eleanor Willis. One of Ellie\u2019s fake names.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, maybe next time,\u201d I said. \u201cHow much for the shared bath?\u201d</p><p>He told me it was sixty dollars a night and I fished a wad of bills out of my wallet, using my Connor Malloy driver\u2019s license. I\u2019d forgotten I was him for a while there. I was forgetting a lot of things about myself lately.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any bags?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ah, right. I shook my head and shrugged. \u201cFirst I mess up my arm mountain biking in the Baja, then Air Mexico loses all my bags.\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a sympathetic smile and handed me the key. I went up to my room, a tiny sliver of Mexico, sat on the narrow, squeaky bed for a minute, trying to gather up my thoughts and coming up empty. Then I decided to head back down to the lobby. I wanted to go into the courtyard, to the pool area where all the tourists were, but there was too much a chance for Ellie to see me and I still didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if she did.</p><p>I ended up going into the tiny gift shop and found a shirt to wear. The plaid one was starting to smell. I bought a black one that said Veracruz on the back in a nice script. The perfect tourist shirt, even though it was a bit tight. I decided to wear it out and was coming out of the changing room when I saw Ellie through the gift shop window, walking across the lobby.</p><p>I had to do something. I had to say something to her. Gus wanted to wait until we knew what the situation was, but I couldn\u2019t just let her walk by. Now that she was alone and we were in the same building that made everything different. I quickly paid for the shirt and rushed out of the store. But it was too late, she\u2019d hopped in a cab and off they went.</p><p>I went back into the hotel and asked Enrico to call me a cab too. I was tempted to ask him a few questions about Ellie but something told me to keep my mouth shut for now.</p><p>Of course, my god damn cab took forever to arrive and when it did I got the slowest fucking driver in the world who kept going on in Spanish, ignoring every attempt I made to tell him I didn\u2019t speak the language. By the time he dropped me off at the Veracruz market, it was packed with people and absolutely bustling. How the hell was I going to find Ellie here, let alone Gus?</p><p>I walked down the aisles, looking past the merchants, at every person who was squeezing through the crowd. I didn\u2019t notice anything unusual except for all the armed guards everywhere I turned. I didn\u2019t know if it was protected like this because it was the Veracruz way, or if it had something to do with Travis frequenting the market. Maybe it was one and the same.</p> <p>I had finally stopped at a taco stand, needing something in my stomach, and was waiting in line with families carrying overflowing shopping bags when I felt the skin on the back of my neck prickle. It felt like lightning was kissing me.</p><p>I slowly turned around, and through the sea of people, I saw her face. Her beautiful, cruel face, looking right at me.</p><p>Only she didn\u2019t look cruel just then. She looked soft, her eyes dark pools, filled with things I wanted to read into, to dive into. She looked like an animal in a very large cage, an illusion of freedom around her but she could only run so far before she\u2019d run back into herself.</p><p>Oh Christ, this hurt more than anything in the world. How easily she had forgotten about me. How my memory must have been tossed to the wind, like she\u2019d done to me before.</p><p>Then she smiled, recognizing me, like it really hit her, and I never thought she could look so much like an angel. She was glowing. And her radiance was breaking my heart.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do this. I couldn\u2019t do this. I couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>I turned around and walked away. I could hear her calling me, her voice thin above the chatter of the marketplace, but I kept walking. I\u2019d come so far to find her and now I was running from the person I\u2019d been looking for.</p><p>I pushed through the crowd, going as fast as I could without fucking up my arm, trying to keep my damaged heart still in my chest, trying to breathe through that inner pain when I suddenly spotted a familiar beer gut in a Hawaiian shirt, speaking in Spanish to a pretty Mexican lady in front of a stand of socks and underwear.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d I said to Gus as I stopped in front of them.</p><p>Gus gave me a disappointed look. \u201cCamden, this is Esmerelda.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a curt nod. Now wasn\u2019t the time for pleasantries. I looked back to Gus. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well then let\u2019s go talk to her, this place is as good as any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do it?\u201d I asked him, feeling ashamed the moment I did so. I went on, \u201cYou\u2019re not as emotionally involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should keep my eyes open to see if Javier or Travis pops up.\u201d</p><p>Gus raised his eyebrow. \u201cJavier wouldn\u2019t dare show his face here. Now how about you man the fuck up, put your big girl panties on and go get your fucking ex-girlfriend back?\u201d</p><p>I felt like I\u2019d been slapped in the face. It went red immediately and I hoped Esmerelda didn\u2019t understand a lick of English. But it worked. I shoved my pride aside for a moment and decided to do what we came here to do, what we fought so hard for.</p><p>I only hoped it was all for a reason.</p><p>Gus shook Esmerelda\u2019s hand goodbye and I led him back the way I came, hoping Ellie was still about somewhere.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Gus said under his breath. He\u2019d stopped on the spot, causing a woman with a bag of fruit to collide into his back and let loose a string of Spanish obscenities. I followed his eyes. Beyond the crowd of people, where this aisle intersected with another, was a wall of men in black. Bodyguards protecting someone.</p><p>I knew who it was, even before Gus muttered, \u201cTravis. We have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, we\u2019re just tourists?\u201d I whispered back, ignoring the frustrated shoppers trying to go around us.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that quote I said about casting doubt ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about shadows,\u201d I filled in. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><p>He turned around, pulling on my good arm. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go down the next aisle and look over that way, see what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>We went around and all the pain and heartache I was feeling was being replaced by a more familiar feeling: dread. With Travis in the picture, an actual living breathing real life threat, someone more dangerous than Javier could ever be, the reality began to settle in. I started to feel like a real fucking chump, turning away from Ellie in the market like that. We stopped beside a shopkeeper selling poorly made pottery. No one was stopping there and we were able to get a clear view into the next aisle over.</p><p>There was Travis. Not at all like I expected. He was tall, reed-thin with a shock of slicked back grey hair. He was much older than I thought, well, at least in his sixties like I assumed Gus was. However, Gus put out this air of being crotchety but harmless and people probably underestimated him. There was no underestimating Travis. He oozed power, like it sustained him more than oxygen. Everyone, from the stoic bodyguards to the scared people walking past, giving him quick but furtive glances, were aware of this power, this energy this ... evil. That was dramatic but true.</p><p>Then there was Ellie Watt, or Eleanor Willis as she now was. Standing in front of him, trying to look like any other girl. Of course I could see that she was more than any other girl. She was a heartbreaker. She was a temptress. She was lost. And now she was found, at least by me. I hoped Travis didn\u2019t pick up on any of those things. I hoped he saw her as a beautiful, average American tourist. I hoped she knew exactly what she was doing and that the confidence she was portraying was more than an act.</p><p>We watched them like a pair of creepers until Travis stuck his arm out for her and she accepted it, having him lead her away, the wall of bodyguards flanking her.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck. Where are they going?\u2019 I said. \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper with the shitty pottery picked this time to get annoyed with us and shooed us away once he realized we weren\u2019t going to buy anything. I began to go after Ellie but Gus reached out and grabbed me by the shirt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t follow him. We can\u2019t get away with that, not here.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed painfully. \u201cHow can we just let her go off with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can. We have to. We don\u2019t know what her plan is. At any rate, we don\u2019t have the option. To follow her is to put her in danger and that\u2019s the last thing either of us wants, you got that? Look, we\u2019ll go back to your hotel room. I\u2019ve got all the stuff now. Unpack and wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait where? What if Javier or Travis follow her back?\u201d</p><p>His mustache twitched. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you in her bedroom. You\u2019ll already be on the inside when she comes back.\u201d</p><p>If she comes back, I thought. Gus looked at me like he was thinking the same thing.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>I remembered being about eleven years old when my parents first started talking about leaving Mississippi. It was a hot spring day, hot like hell, and I was sitting on the front step of our trailer, watching the kids run down the street, laughing, having a good time. They were all wearing their bathing suits as kids tended to do when it got in the 80s with one hundred percent humidity.</p><p>Not me. I sat there in the hot sun, in my own sweat, wearing jeans. They were baggy, really lightweight and I had a hole in one knee, but it didn\u2019t make up for the fact that I could never be like one of those kids. I used to be then that all changed in one night. After that, I fell asleep in tears because it hurt so bad, my teeth being ground into nothing because my mother refused to give me anything stronger than Children\u2019s Tylenol. During the day, when the pain was a bit better, I\u2019d cry anyway because I could never be normal again. All I wanted to do was strip down to my bathing suit and join the kids in their search to find the nearest hose or sprinkler. But I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t dare. Fear of being different, of being made inferior, had consumed me at a young age.</p><p>So I sat there on the steps and watched the world go on without me. Behind me there was a screen door to let in the filthy breeze and behind that my parents sat at the table and started discussing my future. I don\u2019t know if they realized I was listening and could hear them or if they didn\u2019t care, but they talked about me as if I wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>My father was scared because Child Services had visited him at work, wanting to check in. I suppose they had come by when I was at school too. I hadn\u2019t really seen any of them, least not that I knew of. No one was asking me questions yet, but that\u2019s what they were afraid of. I wanted to tell my parents that I knew my lie so well I wouldn\u2019t do anything to get them in trouble. Funny thing is, I don\u2019t think they ever believed me. I bet they sat around in fear like I sat around in fear, thinking that one day I would turn on them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead, they\u2019re the ones who turned on me. They\u2019re the ones who got up and left me one day, leaving me with my uncle.</p><p>Anyway, before that even happened, my parents were planning their escape. I remember it was my mom\u2019s idea for us to go to California. My dad was totally against it, and as I sat there on the porch and started thinking about how magical California sounded, how my uncle Jim seemed like a real cool guy, I wondered why. My dad kept saying if we went to California, we were only going so we could see \u201chim,\u201d but not her brother, someone else, and the last time my mother pulled a stunt like that, it had nearly gotten me killed.</p><p>At the time all I could fixate on was California and movie stars and the wild Pacific Ocean. Everything else went over my head.</p><p>Now all I could wonder about was how on earth my mother was able to have an affair with Travis. Not that she wasn\u2019t a gorgeous woman back in her day, that real Eastern European look, but why? How did it get started? What made my mother look at him and want him for herself? I didn\u2019t care how charming he was or sweet he must have been to her \u2013 wouldn\u2019t she have looked at him and seen the monster underneath? Did she seriously think she could fix him? Redeem him? Was she ever in love with him, or had she just been a fool, foolish and reckless enough to use her own flesh and blood to get back at him?</p> <p>The longer I sat across from Travis at a small, smoky bar that blotted out all the light and heat from outside, the more I couldn\u2019t understand her. How she could be with him and not be afraid for her life. Because I was her daughter through and through. And I was extremely afraid for my own life.</p><p>I eyed the bodyguards who flanked us on all sides. They never once looked my way. We had the whole bar to ourselves. Travis had gotten the owner to order everyone out. Not that there were that many people drinking in a jazz joint like that during the day, but still. He basically snapped his fingers and it happened. People did it as if their lives depended on \u2013 I guess they did. The amount of power he had was sickening, to the point where people must have thought he\u2019d have them executed on the spot if they didn\u2019t do what they were asked. And there would be nothing that anyone could do about it. No police, no government, no army, no justice. Travis Raines and his new cartel owned them all.</p><p>At the moment, while I sat there in the booth across from him, he owned me. It went against every sniveling thread of pride I\u2019d ever felt to admit that, but that was the truth and the truth was what it was. He helped make me what I was, the con artist who never believed anyone was coming to save her, the girl who struggled to find the good deep inside. He had his hand in it. And now he had my life in his hands. Because if Travis Raines found out that Ellie Watt was sitting across from him, the damaged daughter of Amelie Watt, I would be dead in a second. Even if he didn\u2019t figure it out, there was still a chance he could kill me for no reason. Just because he could.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another drink?\u201d he asked me. \u201cPerhaps some water, you\u2019re looking a bit flushed.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced and put a hand to my forehead. Obviously the strain of the situation was showing up on my face more than I thought. I needed to play it off. \u201cWater would be great, thank you. I think I got too much sun today. I\u2019m a bit dizzy.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned subtly, just a darkening of the eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I was hoping to take you out for dinner tonight. I own one of the best restaurants in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure own a lot of things here.\u201d</p><p>He clacked his teeth together a few times and I resisted the urge to grip the edge of the table. \u201cI own all of Veracruz. You will soon find this out. You speak the name Travis Raines and you\u2019ll see it in people\u2019s faces. The respect. The awe. For me.\u201d</p><p>Oh god, I wanted nothing more than to take my glass and figure out a million ways to break it on his head.</p><p>\u201cMust be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem easily impressed.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged because that\u2019s what Eleanor Willis would have done.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get a chance to impress me tomorrow then.\u201d</p><p>I thought maybe I was pressing my luck, playing that hard-to-get kind of girl. Maybe he offed girls like that. But his eyes glinted hard with the challenge. The sick fuck liked it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I shall rise to the occasion. Would you like a ride back to your hotel? Where are you staying?\u201d</p><p>Now was the time to figure shit out. If I refused, would he follow me anyway? Would it better to be upfront so he can follow me and I can still see him do it?</p><p>\u201cYes, that would be great. I was going to take a cab, but if it would be no bother ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bother at all,\u201d he smiled, face like an eel.</p><p>We left the bar and walked to the street where a massive SUV pulled up, seemingly out of nowhere, and he ushered me inside the backseat. It was pretty similar to the one Javier had back in Ocean Springs, except the glass was exceptionally thick \u2013 bulletproof.</p> <p>I was a mound of springy nerves the entire drive back to the hotel. I kept thinking how easy it would be for him to keep driving, take me away somewhere and shoot me. Rape me. Torture me.</p><p>To make matters worse, he picked up on this, shooting inquisitive glances over his shoulder as he sat in the passenger seat. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the heatstroke. I should have mentioned I get car sick too,\u201d I said, hoping that would explain my sweaty palms that I unintentionally kept wiping on my skirt.</p><p>He shook his head as if I was just a giant mess. And I was. I was the biggest fucking mess and I didn\u2019t realize how big until after he dropped me off at the hotel and told me that he\u2019d come by for me tomorrow at 6PM and to wear something stunning.</p><p>It was then, and only then, had I realized the gravity of the situation I was in. When I walked into the hotel and saw Enrico watching my every move, it made me realize how trapped I was, how alone. I had no one to hold my hand and tell me I was doing the right thing, that everything was going to be alright.</p><p>Camden.</p><p>I know I\u2019d seen Camden, it hadn\u2019t been a dream. It couldn\u2019t have been. I saw him there in the market. He looked right at me. But the face I saw staring back at me wasn\u2019t the one I imagined ever seeing again. It was the face of a broken man and guilt was starting to poke at me, telling me I was the one who broke him. This Camden who somehow found me in another country, only to turn and walk away.</p><p>I staggered past Enrico, telling him I\u2019d had too much sun and wanted to nap for a little bit. I hoped that would be enough to keep him away for the time being. I had something I needed to do, something I\u2019d started but never got to finish.</p><p>I went through the courtyard bathed in twilight, walking faster as I went, until I got to the room. I wrestled with the old key for a few moments before the door opened and I went flying into the dark coolness. I locked the door behind me and flung myself on the bed. And I began to cry. Bawl. Sob. I cried because at the base of it all, I was scared, mostly of myself. And if I couldn\u2019t trust myself, I had no one left at all.</p><p>I cried it all out of me and even when I was done, when it felt like I had nothing left inside, I rolled over onto my back and the feeling was still there. Disappointment in myself. For letting things go so far. If things went sour in the next twenty-four hours, I\u2019d only have myself to blame.</p><p>I lay there for a few moments, praying for sleep to come and take me away, so I wouldn\u2019t have to face anything or do anything or be anyone anymore. I was drifting off when I heard it. The sound of metal, delicate; a hanger on a closet rail.</p><p>Someone was in my room.</p><p>To be more specific, someone was in my closet.</p><p>I sat up slowly, looking around for a weapon. I had been left here with nothing, not even my gun. What the hell had Javier been thinking? No, what had I been thinking.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I asked, my voice breaking. \u201cI know you\u2019re in the closet.\u201d</p><p>The hangers moved again. I held my breath and started calculating the distance from my bed to the front door. Could I make it out before the person caught me?</p><p>I had to chance it.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet and started running across the floor, my sandals sliding on the tiles almost bringing me to the ground. The closet door burst open at the same time and a large dark figure flew out of it, coming for me.</p><p>I was almost at the door, my hand reaching for the knob, when the person tackled me from behind with one arm going around my shoulder. Instead of pitching me forward onto the stone cold tiles, the person started to twist as we fell, his body taking the brunt of the impact. He landed on his back, and I landed on top of him.</p><p>The man let out a cry of pain, familiar and sharp, but my body was still on an adrenaline high and I tried to get off of him, to get away, to scream for help.</p><p>He was quick and before I could move, his hand went over my mouth and he held me, the back of my head against his hard chest and grunted in my ear, \u201cEllie it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice immediately made me relax. I nodded against his hand and he let go. I flipped around and found myself face to face with Camden.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t a dream,\u201d I said, finding my breath again. I trailed my fingers down the side of his face, feeling the stubble, the strength of his features. \u201cYou actually came for me.\u201d</p><p>He flinched a little under my touch then his face became all steel. He swallowed. \u201cOf course I came for you. I told you I would.\u201d</p><p>I was lost in his eyes, the sincerity beneath the blue. How honest he was. I never considered that he would have kept his word. I never thought I was worth that.</p><p>Oh god, the guilt. Javier. He couldn\u2019t know about that, could he?</p><p>\u201cHow ... how did you find me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He closed his eyes, resting his head back on the floor, wiggling his jaw back and forth. It was only then that I noticed the sling around his shoulder, his t-shirt soaked in one spot.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Camden. What happened to you?\u201d I got off of him quickly and tried to help him up. He\u2019d taken the fall for me so I wouldn\u2019t get hurt, though that couldn\u2019t have been good for his arm.</p><p>I hope he doesn\u2019t know. I hope he doesn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI got shot,\u201d he said, letting me get him to his feet. I\u2019d forgotten how big he was.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten everything.</p><p>\u201cYou got shot?\u201d I said when everything finally registered. \u201cWhen? What?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and tried to move over to the bed. \u201cI need to sit down. Do you have anything to drink? Something really stiff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I told him, running over to the mini bar to check. It was stocked with small bottles of alcohol. I grabbed four of the tequilas and two glasses and placed it on the bedside table then made a move for my purse where I put the bag of limes from earlier.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need lime,\u201d he said trying to unscrew the cap off the bottle with one hand, finishing the job with his teeth.</p><p>I had an unpleasant flashback to the tequila shot I\u2019d taken with Javier the night before.</p><p>Did he know? Did he know?</p><p>He spat the cap out then emptied the contents of the bottle straight into his mouth. He did the same to another bottle.</p><p>I watched in silence, hovering nervously like a bird, wiping my hands up and down my sides, unsure what to do with myself or what I was to him anymore. He\u2019d come so far, all this way, just to make sure I was okay. I didn\u2019t want to tell him what a mistake it was, that he\u2019d wasted it all on a terrible, terrible girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d gotten shot. For me. And I was sleeping with the enemy, believing this man would never come save me.</p><p>Now Camden was watching me, his breath slowing. The look in his eyes was dark and calculating, reminding me a lot of the time he discovered me trying to rob him. Only he didn\u2019t have the gun to my head.</p><p>I wished he did.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, before the guilt could eat me alive in silence. \u201cHow did you get shot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMexican police,\u201d he said unscrewing the next bottle. His eyelids were drooping, his gaze lazy and if I looked closer, full of something like contempt. \u201cWe were driving on the highway outside of Tampico. They took a shot. Lucky shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cMe and Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhere is he, is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not shot, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about,\u201d he said rather coldly. \u201cHe\u2019s up in the hotel room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame all the way down to Veracruz to get you, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, tried to say something intelligible, but nothing came out. I took a seat on the corner of the bed and put my hand on his knee. He eyed it until I took it away. Something had changed so terribly much and I was so afraid to find out what it was. He was looking at me with the eyes of a stranger.</p><p>I gave him a weak smile. \u201cWell, thank you for coming to get me. I don\u2019t even know how you found me.\u201d</p><p>A shadow seemed to fall across his face. He looked like a shell-shocked soldier, older, wiser, harder.</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is Sophia and Ben?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sharp, cold laugh. \u201cOh, Sophia and Ben? Oh, they\u2019re just fine. Especially since they got rid of their chump Camden.\u201d</p><p>His voice was twisting, slicing, going to a bad place.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sat up straighter, sneering through the pain in his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely fucking fantastic. Maybe a bit mad that their little set-up didn\u2019t work. Oh yeah, Sophia, her brothers, probably your little boyfriend Javier, they were all in on it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened at the term \u201cboyfriend.\u201d I felt like my lungs dropped through to the floor. No ...</p><p>He went on, louder, his eyes watering, blazing angrily into mine, \u201cNothing like finding yourself on the front cover of the LA Times, wanted for assault and homicide. Nothing like having to run for your fucking life while trying to track you down!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe at the memory of Javier reading the LA Times ...</p> <p>\u201cNothing like going to fucking Mississippi to find you and end up in your old fucking house that you shared with him and then learning what he had planned to do with you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, the tears springing to my eyes, unable to make sense of what he was saying, where this was going. Though he was set up, he still went all the way to Ocean Springs to try and save me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the plan?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He leaned forward as if he was going to tell me a secret, eyes glinting. Darkness was falling fast outside of the window but I was too frozen to try to turn on the lamp.</p><p>\u201cJavier brought you there to kill your parents.\u201d</p><p>Ice. Pure ice.</p><p>\u201cWhat, why?\u201d It didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>Camden shrugged with his good shoulder. \u201c\u2019Cause he\u2019s fucking Javier and he\u2019s fucking insane, that\u2019s why. Just how brainwashed are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not brainwashed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, this one more brutal. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good one. So, tell me, what did he say or do to you to get you to come down here and kill Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me he\u2019d kill you,\u201d I cried out in indignation.</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I fucking believed him! I wouldn\u2019t have done it otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believed him,\u201d he said softly, rolling the bottles of tequila back and forth over the bedspread covers. He smiled once, to himself. \u201cIf you believed him, that he would do such a terrible thing to me, that he had that power ...\u201d his eyes flicked up to meet mine, \u201cwhy would you go ahead and fuck him?\u201d</p><p>The world was pulled out from under me. One fell swoop, and everything I had to stand on, everything I thought was solid was gone. I was falling, straight into my guilt. The tears rolled down my cheeks, I struggled to keep the sobs inside.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at him anymore. I couldn\u2019t look at myself ever again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Camden.\u201d</p><p>He waited a few moments, rolling the bottles back and forth, before saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does matter. I didn\u2019t do it to hurt you. I don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re weak,\u201d he shot in. Another half shrug. \u201cAnd you never really gave a shit about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamden, please!\u201d I sniveled, reaching for his hand. He let me hold it, cold, no life in it for me. \u201cPlease, listen to me. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever come for me. I thought you would go on in your new life with Sophia and Ben. I thought I was alone and I\u2019d stay alone as I\u2019ve always been and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice sob story, Ellie Watt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a sob story! It\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ye of little faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... I don\u2019t have faith in people. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing!\u201d he screamed. \u201cI came all this way for you because I thought you were in trouble and you aren\u2019t! You\u2019re in the kind of trouble you want to be in. I. Know. Nothing. About you.\u201d He seemed to have overexerted himself and lay back against the headboard, eyes rolling into the back of his head which he gently shook back and forth. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking tired of being shit on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said quietly. I looked down at my hands like they were foreign objects. \u201cYou are the last person I\u2019d ever want to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did. Who else have you hurt today? Javier? Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who I\u2019m hurting anymore. Camden, please, you have to believe me. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you again. I slept with Javier because ... because I loved him once. And he\u2019s made me believe that I belong with him, with this kind of life, that this is the best that I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him in shock. He was looking at me, our past written all over his face. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a knife stuck in me so deep. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever deserved it as much as I did then.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>I knew I hurt her.</p><p>Her face crumpled like a demolished building, pretty and strong in one moment, a ruin in the next. I knew she was hurting, feeling it, feeling everything. I knew she felt like absolutely nothing. Worthless. Rotten.</p><p>I knew she felt like I did. That\u2019s what I wanted.</p><p>She looked away from me, the tears frozen in her wide eyes, always threatening to spill over but never quite doing it. No release.</p><p>As angry as I still was, as bitter as the air tasted, there was a pang of sorrow somewhere in my chest. For fighting so dirty and hitting so low. No matter what Ellie deserved, how broken and utterly messed up she was, I still loved her. Deciding to not love her anymore wasn\u2019t going to be that simple.</p><p>Besides, I had to think about the big picture, about Gus, about Ellie. My feelings for her, what we had shared, didn\u2019t even have to come into the equation. I came there to rescue her, to save her from all of this, and until the bitter end, that\u2019s just what I was going to do.</p><p>I only wished it hadn\u2019t hurt so much. I wished I had the strength inside me not to care.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d I said quietly. I reached for the last tequila bottle tossing it at her.</p><p>She caught it and stared at it numbly. She was in shock, dazed, lost in her thoughts and a million waves of remorse. I knew that look too.</p><p>I nodded at the bottle. \u201cDrink up, baby.\u201d</p><p>She quickly screwed off the cap and drained the contents into her throat. She coughed a bit but got it down then chucked the bottle across the room where it landed on the tiles with a clatter.</p><p>My back twitched in response. That was going to fucking kill me in the morning. I couldn\u2019t tackle her in this place without hurting her. What was a little bit of extra pain for me in the long run? My shoulder was already killing me, my heart doubly so.</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d she started, looking down, shoulders slumped as she sat on the edge of the bed. For the first time since I\u2019d known her, she looked frail, easy to break. It didn\u2019t suit her. Another face of Ellie Watt, another person I\u2019d have to get to know. \u201cWere you ... are you sure that Javier wanted me to kill my parents?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me, all brown eyes. \u201cYes. I do. I\u2019ll never doubt you again.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t particularly trust that. Ellie doubted everyone and everything that ever crossed her path. It was hard for me to blame her when I saw it everywhere she went. Even now, she was discovering it with Javier, though she surely should have seen that coming. Oh, I couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands around that man\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d do that, why not just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus and I have been trying to figure it out too. You did say he had a twisted code of ethics and that he kept his promises. Look what happened to Uncle Jim.\u201d Yes, look what happened to Uncle Jim, I wanted to repeat for her benefit. He killed your uncle then you still slept with him. You fucked a murderer.</p><p>The rage was dying to sweep in again. This was going to eat me alive until the end of my life.</p><p>Only if I let it.</p><p>I took in a deep breath. \u201cEllie, I know for whatever reason you must trust Javier or have some sort of connection to him. I know you believe that what you\u2019re doing is right. I understand the vengeance you want with this man and I know what you\u2019d do to get it. I only want you to realize that you don\u2019t have to do any of this if you don\u2019t want to. You can leave here with me and Gus, tonight. We can put this behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould killing him be so wrong?\u201d she said quietly. I had to fight the urge to wrap my arm around her and bring her into me, to hold her close, tell her that I loved her, that I wouldn\u2019t let another thing happen to her. I\u2019d take another bullet for her. I\u2019d be here no matter what she chose, even if she wanted another lover, another life. I would still be there when she fell. When she wanted to run. When she wanted to come home.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that killing him would change anything?\u201d I asked. \u201cWould it make a difference in your life, for the better?\u201d</p><p>She mulled it over, her eyes searching aimlessly while the wheels in her beautiful brain turned. Whatever she\u2019d say, I would understand. Because I knew what it was to have that anger so deep inside you, you think the only way you\u2019ll ever be rid of it is to be rid of the person who put it there. But then you only realize later on what the truth is \u2013 that no one put that anger there. No one except you. And you have to live with yourself while someone else is dead or suffering or destroyed. Another body to add to the funeral pyre. Another weight on your already laden soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve wanted this for so long, this retribution for myself. That if I kill him, I\u2019ll be free of everything that\u2019s held me down and told me where to fit in this world. Told me what I am. That if I kill him, the man who made me bad, I\u2019ll be good. Sometimes ...\u201d a tear rolled down her cheek, the dam breaking, the release. She sniffed, \u201cSometimes I\u2019d do anything to be good.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. God damn it. My heart was breaking all over again, just when I thought I didn\u2019t have anything inside me to break.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said, leaning forward and bringing her down onto me. She lay with her head on my chest, sobbing quietly. \u201cHey, remember when we were kids and we\u2019d lie like this on my trampoline?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled. \u201cI don\u2019t remember crying back then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. No we never cried in front of each other. We were too cool for that. It didn\u2019t mean we weren\u2019t crying inside. Or for each other.\u201d I cupped my good hand behind her head and held it there, took in a deep breath. \u201cEllie, I will help you with whatever you need to do. You won\u2019t have to go through this alone. If you want to kill Travis, for whatever reasons you have, I will be there for you. And when you\u2019re done, if you let me, I will take you back home. And if you want to back out of it now, if you want to disappear tonight and never look back, Gus and I will help you with that too. Whatever you\u2019ve done or thought or planned or given up on, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we came here for you. We came here to help you, Ellie, in whatever way you choose.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened on top of me, her limbs going rigid.</p><p>\u201cYou can start by hiding back in the closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She sprang up, eyes flying to the window. \u201cGo now, to the closet, under the bed, hide. Somewhere! Go!\u201d</p> <p>There was no way I would fit under the bed quick enough, especially with my arm, so I quickly ducked myself back in the closet, sticking my good fingers through the slats and pulling it closed just as there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cMiss Eleanor Willis?\u201d came a muffled voice.</p><p>I held my body as still as possible, my breath quiet and tried to look through the slits without bumping into the hangers again.</p><p>From the angle of my view, I could see Ellie getting up and going over to the door answering it.</p><p>\u201cHi, Enrico,\u201d she sounded drunk, a little too drunk. An act.</p><p>\u201cMiss Willis,\u201d Enrico said. A large pause. I could tell he was looking at her oddly. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I allowed to say no?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cNo, miss. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, come in.\u201d She walked away lazily and plopped down on the bed.</p><p>The door shut and he stopped in the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls just want to have fun.\u201d She punctuated that with a giggle. She was going on a bit too strong and I had to wince, hoping Enrico bought it.</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d He started to walk to the patio entrance, the one I came in through. He tried the door and I was glad I remembered to lock it.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m alone,\u201d she said. \u201cLeast I was until you showed up. Can\u2019t a girl have a few drinks in peace?\u201d</p> <p>He turned around and came back, stopping at the foot of the bed. Through the serrated slivers of my view, I could see his shoes and pants were both immaculately white. Enrico seemed like a nice enough boy when checking in, but he was obviously a friend of Javier\u2019s which vetoed all innocent appearances.</p><p>\u201cMiss Willis, your neighbors reported people yelling in here.\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cSo? Was I keeping them awake? It\u2019s not even nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one yelling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so what? Free country, isn\u2019t Mexico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you yelling at?\u201d he said, pleasant customer service patience being tested.</p><p>\u201cWell obviously myself. What, you never had a good yell, a good cry, a good fucking mental breakdown when you\u2019ve been pawned and screwed over by various drug cartels?\u201d Her voice was rising sharply near the end and I could tell this wasn\u2019t an act at all. Despite always being shit on, I was starting to feel a bit sorry for her.</p><p>The truth was, I knew Ellie didn\u2019t do any of it to hurt me. Call me a fool, and I was, but I knew that deep down she\u2019d do what she could to spare my pain. She cared enough about me for that. It still hurt, knowing that she believed I\u2019d never come. I knew she never trusted anyone and I was just another lover to her who would one day break her heart and forget her name, but she should have known I wasn\u2019t like that. I wasn\u2019t like them. I wasn\u2019t like everyone else. She should have known what she was to me, that the only reason we were ever separated was because we didn\u2019t have a choice. I guess she did have a choice, though both of them were shitty ones. Her sacrifice didn\u2019t help us much in the end. It was all for nothing.</p><p>\u201cMiss Willis, Javier wants you to know that you\u2019re completely safe here.\u201d</p><p>Javier. I almost put my fucking fist through the closet door but composed myself in time. That nasty, terrible blackness wanted company. I couldn\u2019t think about him, or her and him together, or how she could still do that to me, even if she never did it on purpose. I hated, hated, how easily he was able to win her back over, to make her doubt herself, to coerce her into doing such things. Sex was sex and I understood that. What I couldn\u2019t understand was his power over her. Or maybe I didn\u2019t want to. She was better than that. I believed it. I knew it.</p><p>\u201cHow am I safe?\u201d she asked snidely, adjusting herself on the bed. \u201cBecause I just had drinks with Travis Raines and I didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are safe here,\u201d he said, gesturing to the room. \u201cHe has people stationed all over now. There are two men just beyond the courtyard, on the other side of the river. If anyone comes in through there, they will find them. There are people at the front of the hotel too and of course I am here. You can call me at all hours of the night. You are protected, wherever you are.\u201d</p><p>What Enrico, what Javier, was really trying to tell her was that she was stuck, held prisoner in her hotel. There was no way she could run off with me and Gus tonight or any other night. She was protected from one man and a captive to the next.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that should make me feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Travis wants to take me out for dinner. 6PM.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. I will let Javier know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell Javier that I don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p><p>Pause. He walked over to the other side of the room. \u201cI will tell him that. I do not know what his answer will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis order you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, his order. I\u2019m sorry if I come across a bit unfriendly, but I have to follow them and that may mean making you go out for the dinner tomorrow. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>The girl couldn\u2019t seem to go anywhere without someone threatening her.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said with a dejected sigh. \u201cListen, Enrico, can you do me a favor and get me another drink?\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the mini bar and opened the door. \u201cTequila is all gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take the bourbon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Americans like to mix it up.\u201d He tossed the bottle to her and she caught it.</p><p>\u201cI like to keep my liver on its toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good night, Miss Willis.\u201d Enrico walked over to the door. My breathing started to slow in relief. \u201cI hope you can sleep well knowing how safe you are.\u201d</p><p>She cracked open the bottle of JD and drank it back before she said, \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>The door closed. She waited a few tense moments before she went up and locked it. Then she went around to check the patio door again and closed the curtain to that. She came back to the bed and lay down, her legs dangling off the edge. I could see the start of the cherry blossom tattoo snaking its way up her calf. It looked a bit rough and for one crazy second I became concerned that she wasn\u2019t moisturizing it enough.</p><p>She went into the bathroom, apparently forgetting that I was there. I wouldn\u2019t have put it past her. Then she came out, undressed, her top and skirt sliding to the floor and pooling around her ankles, reminding me of the obsidian shape of my dreams, then pulled on a t-shirt, turned off the main light, then the lamp and climbed into bed. Darkness.</p><p>I waited for ten more minutes, wondering if I should take a chance and say anything or if I should just hunker down in the closet and prepare for the night in there. I wasn\u2019t going to chance leaving her room now, not when she was being guarded and heavily watched.</p><p>I pulled out Gus\u2019s cell from my pocket, checking it. He said he was going to see about getting a cell phone from a store in town, but so far I only had the line to his room. I\u2019d have to call him in the morning and fill him in. I hoped he wasn\u2019t sitting up worrying about us too much.</p><p>Finally I decided to risk it and I slowly pushed open the closet door. The room was dark except for the faded orange light of the illuminated walkway outside that came in through the flimsy curtains. I made my way over to the other side of the bed and got in, on top of the covers.</p><p>She rolled over to face me, her legs curled up in the fetal position, her hands clasped under chin. We looked at each other for a few seconds and in that time I wondered how I was ever going to get past this. I wondered how I was even going to try. She could give me her excuses but it wouldn\u2019t make much difference. It didn\u2019t take back what was done and what was done didn\u2019t take the love away. It only made me want to try and compartmentalize it, to tuck it away somewhere deep inside, a hint of hope shining among all the wicked and soulless things. That was the only way I was going to be able to get through this \u2013 locking it up and hoping it stayed in there.</p><p>Normally I would have kissed her, felt her body beneath my hands, do all those things to her that I had been dreaming of. I had wanted it, needed it, craved it. But I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t touch her now, not now. I don\u2019t even think she knew who her body belonged to at the moment. It certainly wasn\u2019t me. And the sooner I got over that bit, the better we would both be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d I whispered softly. \u201cThey may be out there, but you\u2019ll be safe right here.\u201d</p><p>I could see in the gleam of her eyes that she needed me to come close, to put my arms around her and make everything alright. She was as vulnerable as I\u2019d ever seen her. But I just turned over onto my back and let the tequila and heartbreak take me away.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>I woke up right before sunrise, when the room was a purple grey haze, the air was decidedly heavy. It was a weird atmosphere and it took me a few seconds to figure out where I was and who the man was next to me.</p><p>Camden. He was sleeping on his back, his glasses still on, lips parted. He was like a fragment from my dream, a faded portrait of masculinity, heart and ink. My heart, that beating organ that had been so elusive to me as of late, thumped loudly in my chest as I gazed at him, stirring me awake. How could I have been so careless with him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the end, he was here. Just like he said he\u2019d be.</p><p>My mind fluttered over to Javier and the day ahead of me. I believed that Javier would never put me in any danger that I couldn\u2019t get myself out of but now I was starting to second guess things. How bad was his need for revenge this time around?</p><p>And he knew ... he knew this whole time what had happened to Camden, that he was on the run, and he\u2019d never told me. I guess he knew if he had, I would\u2019ve run away, I would\u2019ve found some way to escape. With Camden on the run, Javier had no way of getting to him, of hurting him. I wouldn\u2019t have been coerced into this whole fucking mess.</p><p>He had wanted me to kill my parents. It was a ridiculous notion and I could only figure that it was his way of trying to settle things with the people who hurt me. Maybe that\u2019s why he was doing it to Travis too. Though romantics would argue that was a sign of true love, it sat wrong inside of me, like food that wouldn\u2019t digest. Because as nearly noble as it seemed, why get me to do it?</p> <p>I sighed and rubbed my hands on my face. I didn\u2019t know what the fuck I was going to do. Last night, seeing Camden in my room, I was ready to run to him, leave with him and Gus and try to make a break for it. I\u2019m glad that we didn\u2019t. Javier\u2019s men would have shot them on sight. I don\u2019t know what his plans for me would have been. Perhaps, knowing Camden was really gone this time, I would have broken completely.</p><p>I was being yanked in different directions and it was tearing me up inside. I never fell back in love with Javier, my body spoke a different language than that, but he still tricked me. He still made me believe in the lies. How deep did his feelings for me go? I knew they never went all the way to the roots, I\u2019d told myself that, but some tiny part of me hoped for his redemption, that I somehow held the key to his soul.</p><p>Perhaps that was exactly what my ego wanted to hear. Like it wanted to hear Camden tell me I was good. I didn\u2019t think I was going to get that either.</p><p>He was different, too. His body shot, his heart blown out by what I had done. Last night I was so sure he was going to hold me close to him and make me feel the safety he was promising, I thought he was going to give me the protection I\u2019d associated with him. Instead, he stared at me like I was a burden to him. A lost little girl he\u2019d come after to bail out and now was stuck with the task. Camden was also a man of his word, and for better or worse, I knew he\u2019d be there for me till the end \u2013 even if he didn\u2019t want to be. That\u2019s the thought that really stung, that dug deep, that he\u2019d be there for me out of deep-seated devotion, a sense of obligation, not because he really wanted to be. I was afraid he\u2019d start to resent me.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and tried to move. He stopped, groaning pitifully, face scrunched up in anguish.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want some Tylenol?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He grunted and shook his head slightly. \u201cNo, I have some better shit than that. I just hate how happy it makes me feel.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cMaybe I should take some then.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, eyes on me. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to deal with the pain than mask it. It always comes back.\u201d</p><p>His lips were begging me to meet them with mine. Another spear of shame and regret rocked through me. I got up, went to the sink, and got him a glass of water.</p><p>When I came back he was sitting up looking like he was in incredible pain.</p> <p>\u201cIs it your back?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, took the glass of water from me. He fished two pills out of his pocket and finished the water. He wiped his mouth and exhaled. \u201cUnfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to deal with this pain. Not today. Not when we have to figure out what to do.\u201d</p><p>I went over to the window and peeked through it. No wonder the air felt so heavy today. The sun was gone. Those dark clouds I had seen hovering over the sea for so long had finally rolled in and smothered us with a low, claustrophobic ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d I asked, my eyes now searching the courtyard for anyone patrolling it. It was quiet, dead as anything, all the guests still asleep in their rooms or having their morning coffees and shaking their heads at the one day the weather decided to be a bitch. Well, it was still hurricane season. They should have known better. We all should have known better.</p><p>\u201cI know I have to lay low here until you go,\u201d he said. He laughed and I turned to look at him. His eyes looked glazed, a lazy smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cGood shit?\u201d I asked, taking a seat beside him on the bed.</p><p>He nodded, still smiling. Oh god, his dimples. I wanted him to keep taking these drugs, over and over again, so I could see them, so he could be happy and not hate me. I wanted him oblivious and loving me. I wanted my image in his eyes to be pure and good and untainted.</p><p>He sighed, leaning back against the headboard. \u201cEllie, I have something for you.\u201d</p> <p>I waited while he went into his pocket and pulled out a small box that looked like a tin for tiny mints. He put it in my hand and told me to open it, his words slurring slowly.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we do this when you\u2019re not high?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty self-explanatory.\u201d He waved at it.</p><p>I shrugged and opened the tin. It was a tiny red dot of plastic, no bigger than the end of a pencil.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Wireless mic?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOne more guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tracking device?\u201d</p><p>He smiled again and my heart jumped. \u201cBingo. Put that on the underside of your necklace.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the razor blade and lifted it up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you in a few,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d I said, taking the dot out of the tin, sticking it to the back of the necklace. From Javier\u2019s mic the other day, to the tracking device, I\u2019d turned into a walking instrument. I guess it was better than being a walking weapon.</p><p>Camden fished out his cell from his pocket and waved it at me. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure how but as soon as I bring it to him, Gus has you in the system so we can start tracking your every move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the original plan?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his one shoulder, head rolling to the side. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know. We weren\u2019t sure if you\u2019d come with us, if you\u2019d want to leave. If you\u2019d even come back from Travis. We could only hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you hope?\u201d</p><p>He straightened his head and gave me a steady gaze. \u201cI hope we can all be here together.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my hands, wringing them together. \u201cI have to go with Travis tonight.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cSo you\u2019ll go with Travis. And then you\u2019ll escape.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brow. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you said you\u2019ll be going out for dinner. We\u2019ll be tracking you. We\u2019ll know where you are. You go to the bathroom window or through the kitchen or however you can figure it and we\u2019ll be there waiting for you. We\u2019ll find you. And we\u2019ll all leave together.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head roughly. \u201cNo. He\u2019s got people everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We saw them. But he\u2019s got his people looking out for him. They won\u2019t be watching you. Once you\u2019re there with him, they won\u2019t have a reason to. You\u2019re just an American tourist to him, one hot piece of ass. He\u2019s going to work on impressing you and you\u2019re going to be impressed then he\u2019ll have no reason to worry why you\u2019re taking so long in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>The way he was telling me what I had to do was familiar. But this time, it was comforting because I knew he had my best interests in mind. I knew I could trust him one hundred percent, because I\u2019d left him in the dust in Palm Valley and he was here with me now. This could work. I could get out of all of this.</p><p>\u201cI just ...\u201d he began and trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope that once we leave, that you can leave it for good.\u201d</p><p>I gulped. \u201cYou think I\u2019d return to this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this place. Not this city. The place inside you. The place where killing Travis still sounds like a good idea. I know you want him dead, Ellie, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But once we leave, we have to let it go. Everything and everyone.\u201d</p><p>I know he meant Javier by that. I nodded. \u201cI will do that. I will leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, but does that mean you can?\u201d</p><p>Outside thunder rumbled ominously.</p><p>He exhaled loudly. \u201cLooks like a storm is coming. You better get ready for your day. You never know when Enrico will stop by with a new message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better get back in the closet then,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf only my father could hear that,\u201d he said, attempting a joke. His brow furrowed in pain and I had to wonder how he was dealing with everything. Not only me or his gunshot wound but Sophia turning on him and being wanted by the police. His father had to know too, the man Camden could never be good enough for. My poor, poor Camden. He\u2019d taken enough.</p><p>He got up and used the washroom quickly, had a banana and went back in the closet. I got ready and waited, waited long enough so that when there finally was a knock at my door, I was ready for it.</p><p>It was Enrico. I opened the door and a gust of electric air came in.</p><p>\u201cJust checking in on you,\u201d Enrico said. \u201cAny problems last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I went to bed. Looks like a storm is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a category one hurricane off the coast. Nothing to worry about, just no sun tanning today.\u201d</p><p>I smiled politely and stared at him until he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cThe other reason I am here is that Javier has a message for you.\u201d</p><p>My gut twisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to meet here at this caf\u00e9 at 11AM today.\u201d He handed me a business card.</p><p>\u201cIs this a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not for me to say. Have a good day, Miss Willis. I will have the cab waiting for you out front a half hour prior.\u201d</p><p>Enrico turned and walked away. I knew Camden was in the closet, catching all of that. At least then he could finally come out after I left, assuming that Javier\u2019s men would be trailing after me. Then he could activate the tracking device and I would have his protection.</p><p>I got ready for the day, feeling slightly self-conscious with Camden there, hiding out of sight. I put on a simple strapless maxi dress and fluffed out my hair with my fingers, doing a quick sweep of makeup.</p><p>At twenty after ten, I grabbed my purse and left the room, whispering, \u201cSee you later,\u201d to Camden, hoping he had heard me. Hoping that I would see him later. I had no idea what Javier had planned for me now. Everything was turned on its head.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 wasn\u2019t a long cab ride from the market, and I got there early. I didn\u2019t see Javier anywhere. I sat down at one of the tables inside, the threatening clouds producing wind that whipped scattered loose napkins around on the streets like white tumbleweeds.</p><p>I waited there for an hour at my table, finally indulging in a cr\u00eape and some fruit, when the waiter slipped me a note. It said \u201cmujeres ba\u00f1o andale\u201d in unknown cursive handwriting, perhaps the waiter\u2019s.</p><p>I looked up at the waiter but he was already walking past and delivering food to someone else. I got up and made my way through the caf\u00e9 to the woman\u2019s bathroom, trying to stay cool. Suddenly I was very afraid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I opened the door and stepped in. There were only two stalls. Both looked empty but both stall doors were closed.</p><p>\u201cJavier?\u201d I whispered tentatively.</p><p>A pair of shiny shoes stepped down from one of the seats. I held my breath as the stall door opened and Javier stepped out. Everything felt so fucking different now. I had to keep it cool.</p><p>He nodded at the door behind me. \u201cLock it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said and turned around to do so.</p><p>When I turned toward him, he was right there behind me, grabbing my head and kissing me hard. His tongue snaked around in my mouth, his hands going down my sides, cupping underneath my ass until he pressed me up against the door.</p><p>It was different now. It had been wrong before and I knew that but now it was another shade of wrong that was about more than just me. It was about Camden. I couldn\u2019t do this to him knowing what I knew now, what I should have always, always known. Even if Camden didn\u2019t want anything to do with me after this was all over, it couldn\u2019t even be an option. This had to stop.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Javier whispered as he pulled his lips away and started biting down my neck. I felt powerless, frightened and cold. \u201cEllie, I need you. I missed you.\u201d</p><p>Lies, lies. Too many lies. His fingers went down to my thighs, gathering up the length of my dress. His other hand went to his pants, started undoing his fly.</p> <p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always time for this,\u201d he said, nipping at my collarbone, near the edge of the razor blade. I held my breath, dying inside.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I ducked under his arm and went to the opposite side of the bathroom, hands at the wall.</p><p>He had his cock in his hand, stroking it, the look on his face one of lust and madness.</p><p>His smile was lopsided, wickedly amused. \u201cNo? You don\u2019t get to say no, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him, pulled down my dress. \u201cI\u2019m saying no now. Don\u2019t you want to know how my fucking date with Travis went last night? Don\u2019t you want to know if he touched me, threatened me, hurt me?\u201d</p> <p>He looked taken aback, enough so that he put his dick away and zipped up his fly. He walked over to me, smoothing back his hair. \u201cOkay. If it\u2019s so important for you to tell me, but I already heard it from Enrico.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed down the anger that was building up. That he could send me off to be with such a monster, the monster who did those things to Javier\u2019s own family, and not even care to hear about it.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I spat out. \u201cI guess you know about the plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes, I do. And it\u2019s perfect, Ellie, just perfect. This couldn\u2019t work out better. Dinner. Food. Tonight is when you\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>A wave of horror flashed through me like the lightning strikes outside. \u201cWhen I do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you kill Travis.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open and my hand automatically went to my necklace. \u201cI am not doing it. I\u2019m not killing him. I\u2019m leading you to him. I\u2019m working as a mole. I am not your assassin. I am not your weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been a weapon,\u201d he said, coming closer and pulling something out of his pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes you and I so good. This time you\u2019re the weapon and I\u2019m the one holding the trigger.\u201d</p> <p>He brought out a necklace with silver angel wings as the pendant. He flicked the edge of it and the angel wings opened up, a locket. Inside was a tiny, tiny vial of powder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I said, barely breathing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s poison,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cTonight, you\u2019ll put it in his food. He will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I can\u2019t ... I won\u2019t. They\u2019ll know I did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t. I\u2019ll be waiting for you outside, Ellie. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shook my head. I wouldn\u2019t do it. And though I could have pretended for the sake of pretending, to make things go easier, to get him out of here, I wanted to let him know that I wouldn\u2019t. That he couldn\u2019t make me do everything he asked. That I was stronger than he thought I was.</p><p>\u201cThis whole time,\u201d I said sadly, \u201cthis was your plan, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He furrowed his brow. \u201cIt\u2019s better this way, Ellie. You have to be the one to do it. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll get your revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need your revenge too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours is more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe my life is more expendable than yours,\u201d I said bitterly.</p><p>His face contorted like I had slapped him in the face. \u201cHow could you say that?\u201d</p><p>I chewed my lip and held out my hand. \u201cJust give me the damn necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d rather put it on you,\u201d he said reaching for the one around my neck.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled, ripping out of his grasp. But it was too late. His hand closed around it and he ripped it off. He stared at the razor blade in his hand. The tracking device staring up at him.</p><p>Fear took a hard, sharp hold of every part of me.</p><p>His eyes burned, blazed, unable to accept what he was seeing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he seethed, his face reddening.</p><p>I could have come up with a lie, if I really tried. But there were no lies left in me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he screamed. He grabbed my face in his hands, squeezing my chin and my lips, the pressure burning against my bones. \u201cWho gave you this? Tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d I tried to say. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, all whites around the yellow-gold, his pupils black as night and mean as sin. His grip on my face became tighter and I started to squirm from the pain.</p><p>Finally he screamed, \u201cFuck!\u201d and turned around kicking in the bathroom stall door. He spun around. \u201cWhere is he? Huh? Where is that tattooed motherfucker?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at my jaw, cowering away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fucking know!\u201d he marched over to me and placed his hands at my throat, pressed me up against the wall. \u201cHow can you not know?!\u201d</p><p>I took my hand and dug my nails into his palms, driving them down, making him bleed, staring right back at him, trying to fight through the air I was losing again. I would not lose again.</p><p>His eyes twitched as they searched my face, searching for the truth. When he realized he was already getting it, he released my neck and let me breathe again.</p><p>I took a moment to recover, swallowing painfully, and then said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is. And that\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, shaking out his shoulders, going in a circle around the room. The bathroom door jingled and he lifted his head and yelled, \u201cFuck right off!\u201d He then turned to face me and instead of anger, his face was slack with something else ... bitterness. Heartache, if he had a heart that could ache.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with him?\u201d he asked, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is it with you men and sex?\u201d I said. \u201cLike who gets to fuck who really means anything. No, I didn\u2019t sleep with him. Are you happy?\u201d</p><p>He laughed caustically. \u201cAm I happy? Oh, angel, my dirty, rotten, lying angel! No I am not happy. I won\u2019t be happy until you do as I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>He came over to me and quickly put his hands around my neck. I thought he was going to try and strangle me again but he just put the angel locket around me then delicately straightened the pendant so it was resting on my collarbone.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said, soft and hard all at once, eyes focused on the angel wings, \u201chow badly I want you to hurt right now. Because I didn\u2019t think you could ever hurt me again, not like you once did. But you have.\u201d He lifted his eyes up to me. \u201cYou betrayed me when all I\u2019ve done is give you my heart and promise you a new life.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say anything to that bout of crazy. He pressed the pendant into me and walked away, shaking his head, holding up the razor blade necklace in one hand.</p><p>\u201cYour Camden will be tracking me now instead of you \u2013 he\u2019s going to get quite the surprise. And you\u2019re going to do as I\u2019ve told you. You\u2019re going to go for dinner with Travis. You\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d He put his hand on the lock, then turned his head to the side, eyeing me. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill your Camden, for real this time. I\u2019ll deliver his head to your doorstep.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the door and stepped out into the caf\u00e9, leaving me alone in the bathroom, wondering how the hell I was going to get us all out of this alive.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>CAMDEN</p><p>After Ellie had gotten ready for her meeting with Javier, and I\u2019d spent a few minutes grappling with the urge to scream, I got out of the closet and very slowly, very carefully made my way back into the main part of the hotel.</p><p>Gus was in the room looking like utter shit. For once I got to tell him that. He hadn\u2019t slept at all, waiting up all night for me. I think he thought for a moment that perhaps Ellie and I were making up for lost time but he figured out pretty quickly from my expression that it wasn\u2019t the case. I had to say, he looked a bit disappointed, as if the crotchety old man had been rooting for us as a couple that whole time. I guess I had been rooting for us too.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t dwell on that, I couldn\u2019t think about it. I just had to keep going and stick to the new plan. We activated the tracking device on Gus\u2019s phone and were able to see where she was on Google Maps. It was actually pretty relieving to follow that flashing blue dot as it made its way through the streets of Veracruz to the caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s just meeting Javier?\u201d he asked, after the blue dot had been immobile for quite a while.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAs far as I know. She should be coming back here after to get ready for her dinner with Travis. I guess we should get going just before six. That way we can be out and ready to follow her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d he said, his eyes on the flashing light. He frowned. \u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I leaned over and he showed me the screen. The blue dot was moving away from the caf\u00e9, in the opposite direction of the way she came. She was heading north and fairly fast, in a car, not on foot.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think that means?\u201d I asked. \u201cDo you think Javier is taking her somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t Javier that asked her to meet him.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him sharply. \u201cWho, like Travis?\u201d</p><p>Gus shrugged quickly. \u201cI have no idea. I don\u2019t think we can afford to sit here and speculate.\u201d</p><p>He was right about that. We ran out of the hotel and into the car. Gus had taken back the GTO. No one had touched the thing and I couldn\u2019t blame them \u2013 with her scratched sides and smashed side mirrors, she looked like she was destined for the trash heap. But I knew better \u2013 I knew what she was capable of and I knew that today we\u2019d need her speed and handling more than anything.</p><p>\u201cYou think the cops are still looking for this?\u201d I asked as we cruised along the streets, trying to get the car and the blue dot to match up. I wished I was the one behind the wheel but Gus had proven himself with the car so far. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico is a big country and we could be anywhere. People disappear easily in a few days. We\u2019ll still be careful.\u201d</p><p>We followed the blue dot as it went north along the Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez Highway, getting further away from the city. I started to get a bad feeling about all of this, as the buildings became more and more industrial.</p><p>My shoulder started to ache, I was all tensed up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Gus.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know. This isn\u2019t right. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s in danger.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a grim look. \u201cThat kid is always in danger.\u201d</p><p>The blue dot finally came to a stop at the end of a long road that ended into what looked like nothing. Ten minutes later, we were approaching the blue light. Gus took the GTO down a street with a few empty warehouses flanking the sides. At the end of the road was an office building with broken windows and a handful of cars parked outside. That was where she had to be. Unfortunately the software didn\u2019t allow us to get more details and triangulate her position any closer.</p><p>\u201cEither Javier has her,\u201d I said, watching the area carefully as Gus pulled to the side of the road, a few yards away. \u201cOr shit has hit the fan with Travis. How many guns do we need?\u201d</p><p>Gus exhaled. \u201cWhatever it is, I hope it\u2019s enough.\u201d He turned in his seat and started pulling them out of the bag in the backseat.</p> <p>\u201cThis might hurt for a second,\u201d he said and suddenly jammed my gun into the sling. Pain shot up my arm like rocket ships. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good place for it.\u201d</p><p>I winced, tears in my eyes, and looked down. He had placed it underneath my arm. No one could see it. \u201cFine. Give me two more as decoys.\u201d</p><p>He handed me too small revolvers, I stuck one in my waistband and held the other one in my hand. That morning I\u2019d put a knife in my sock.</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the distance as I eyed the Coffee Mate. \u201cThink it\u2019ll work a second time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about,\u201d he told me. He shoved a gun in his waistband and took another one to his lips kissing it. \u201cMaybe this baby will get to see some action.\u201d He smiled and then the smile went out of his eyes. I knew how he felt. There would be blood. I couldn\u2019t let myself hesitate even once when it came to pulling the trigger, when it came to saving Ellie.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d I said, giving him a heavy nod. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what trouble we\u2019ll get ourselves into.\u201d</p> <p>We got out of the car and started hurrying down the sidewalk, guns to our sides, trying to be fast and inconspicuous all at once. It wasn\u2019t easy, though there was no one on this dead end street. Heavy drops of rain began to fall from the sky. I was grateful for something to distract me from my nerves that were buzzing through me.</p><p>We were almost at the building, heading toward the side to see if we could see in the windows when I heard a gun being cocked. I knew that sound wasn\u2019t necessary \u2013 it was there to make a point. To let us know we\u2019d been caught.</p><p>Gus and I froze at the sound, making split second decisions in our heads. We had no choice but to turn around and see.</p><p>We did.</p><p>Javier was a few feet behind us, on the road, gun pointed at my head. Beside him was Raul, his gun aimed at Gus.</p><p>\u201cBuenos dias, gringos,\u201d Javier said with a smile. \u201cKindly drop your fucking guns and put your hands up or I\u2019ll blow your heads right the fuck off.\u201d</p><p>Gus and I exchanged a look. Defeat.</p><p>We did as we were told.</p> <p>Javier waved his gun at us. \u201cAnd kick it over, you know how this goes.\u201d</p><p>I kicked mine angrily, as did Gus, guns clattering across the cracked pavement.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Javier said, walking toward me, moving like a snake. I half expected his tongue to come shooting out, forked at the end. \u201cI am going to frisk you for the rest of your weapons.\u201d He stopped right in front of me, lips pressed together in a tight smile. \u201cTry not to enjoy it too much.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, breathing in deeply through my nose, trying to dispel the anger that was punching me in the gut, in my lungs, in my chest. That rage would come in handy right about now, but rage acted without thought and I needed to play this next part so damn well or Ellie would be lost to me forever.</p><p>I almost controlled it but when Javier\u2019s hands got to my family jewels and he groped around them and said, \u201cI can see why Ellie chose me. My balls are bigger,\u201d I let that rage out for just one second.</p><p>I spat right in his face. Well, since I was a lot taller, it kind of went on his forehead and trickled down into his eyes. I grinned at him, enjoying the look of revulsion and fury that flashed through him.</p><p>\u201cFucking pansy,\u201d he sniped and then took his gun and jabbed the butt of it right into the bullet hole on my shoulder.</p><p>Everything went fuzzy and black and I could barely keep my lunch down. I collapsed to my knees and spat out bile, the pain overtaking me, ruling me.</p><p>Then Javier kicked me in the shoulder, same spot, and I rolled over onto my back, the waves of pain being comforted by swells of unconsciousness. Then I remembered Gus standing beside me, and Ellie and I knew I had to do what I could to stay awake and stay alive, pain or no pain.</p><p>I remained on my back breathing hard until he reached down and ripped me back up until I was on my feet, swaying unsteadily.</p><p>\u201cHey now,\u201d he said, lightly slapping my face until my eyes were open. \u201cHey Camden, hey Camden, you better stay awake. I am just getting started here with you both.\u201d</p><p>Javier glared at Gus while Raul started scooping up the guns they found on us. They hadn\u2019t found the one in my sling. I wanted to look at Gus to see if he had noticed but I wasn\u2019t about to give anything away.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you ever again,\u201d Javier said to him, frowning and seeming a bit uneasy. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the few good ones left in her life.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows and swallowed away the residue of pain. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d I tried to hide the surprise in my voice but I couldn\u2019t hide much of anything, except my gun.</p><p>Gus was watching Javier, not me. The old man never looked so angry.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Javier said slowly, carefully. \u201cI\u2019d only heard about him. You\u2019re a famous man in the Watt circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you,\u201d Gus grunted.</p><p>Javier tapped his gun against his leg, seeming to think. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s better they think something of me than nothing at all. They are here, you know. Her parents.\u201d</p><p>That was news to me but it wasn\u2019t the news I wanted. \u201cWhere is Ellie?\u201d</p><p>Just then another man came around the corner, someone I didn\u2019t recognize, holding a gun to his side.</p><p>Javier glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. \u201cWhat is it, Peter?\u201d he asked testily.</p><p>Peter glanced at Gus and I, then said to Javier, \u201cTravis Raines is having a dinner party tonight.\u201d</p><p>Javier\u2019s brow scrunched up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt his house,\u201d Peter added for effect. \u201cEllie isn\u2019t going out for dinner, she\u2019s going there. To his house. To the compound.\u201d</p><p>Whatever this meant to Javier, this was bad news. And if it was bad news for Javier, it was probably bad news for Ellie too. I looked at Gus who had an enlightened yet miserable expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Gus grumbled.</p><p>Javier\u2019s eyes were wild, thoughts spinning, and he nodded ever so slightly at Gus, as if he understood what Gus was realizing.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going?\u201d I said, wanting an explanation.</p><p>Javier shot me a look and swallowed hard, worry furrowing his face. A look I\u2019d never seen on him. The look was gone quickly.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he said slowly, looking back to Gus, \u201cwill be at Travis\u2019s tonight. Unfortunately, we won\u2019t be able to get in there without a fight. The place will have heightened security who, I\u2019m sure, could possibly find the cyanide capsule on her necklace.\u201d</p><p>Her necklace. Of course. Javier had given her one and taken the razor blade with the tracking device. Cyanide. He was getting her to kill him tonight.</p><p>\u201cHer parents are there. They work for Travis now.\u201d Javier looked up at the sky and rubbed the side of his face. \u201cThey\u2019ll see Ellie. And her cover will be blown.\u201d He brought his head back down to face me. \u201cShe\u2019s as good as dead.\u201d</p><p>And you put her in her grave, was all I could think. You set her up to fail from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cSo what the fuck are you going to do now?\u201d I asked, spitting out the words. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave her there?\u201d</p><p>Javier narrowed his eyes into reptilian slits. \u201cI don\u2019t know what choice I have. We can hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think, you thought you were good enough for her,\u201d Gus said, shaking his head at Javier with disappointment.</p><p>Javier whipped his head around and shoved his gun in Gus\u2019s face, right up under his chin. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, old man,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a chance to interfere in her life, you gave that up. I don\u2019t want to kill you because I know what you are and how much you mean to her, so don\u2019t you fucking piss me off!\u201d</p><p>My eyes were drawn to Javier and Gus, wondering what the fuck Javier was talking about, so I barely had time to realize what was going on. Raul now had his gun raised at Javier\u2019s head and Peter was reaching for his own gun, perhaps to protect him. But the movement from Peter was enough to bring Raul\u2019s gun to him. Raul pulled the trigger, blasting Peter in the head. The sound brought out the well-honed reflexes in Javier. He spun around, his arm suddenly around Gus, using him as a shield, his gun drawn.</p><p>Raul fired and ended up shooting Gus right in the gut.</p><p>I was screaming. Running for them. Javier pulled the trigger and shot Raul before he could fire again, and a bloody Gus slipped through Javier\u2019s arms.</p><p>Javier pulled the gun around to me but I was too fast. I was already there. I was already the black beast.</p><p>I tackled Javier, my bad shoulder down, not caring about the pain. I dove right into his chest, throwing him back into the concrete wall of the building, his head smashing against it, leaving a bloody smear that was diluted by the rain.</p><p>Even with one arm in a sling, I was able to beat the fuck out of him. I punched him over and over again, relishing the feeling of my bleeding knuckles, the blood from his face, the feeling of breaking cartilage.</p><p>He tried, several times, to get up, to fight back. He put up a good, dirty fight, my shoulder being his number one target. But I was beyond the pain now. I was something else. I was rage and I was wrath and I was twenty-six years of hell.</p><p>I brought out my gun from the sling and held it right against Javier\u2019s temple, spitting in his face one more time, watching the spit mix with blood and rain. \u201cYou can\u2019t give me a single fucking reason why I shouldn\u2019t pull the trigger.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, eyes golden against the mask of blood on his face. He licked his broken and bleeding lips, slowly, sickly, and said, \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. So kill me. And let this all be over with.\u201d</p><p>I pressed the gun further into his head, the anger shaking me from my bones. \u201cNo. This won\u2019t be over because Ellie is still out there. She\u2019s going to Travis\u2019s and there\u2019s a chance she\u2019s not coming back. You better fucking hope that she poisons him and does it well because that\u2019s the only way she\u2019ll get out of there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCamden,\u201d I heard Gus groan from behind me. I kept the gun at Javier\u2019s head and looked at him. He was lying back and holding onto his stomach, blood running from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cStay cool, Gus, I\u2019ll get an ambulance,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou go get Ellie,\u201d he said, barely getting out the words. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I turned and looked at Javier, hoping I could burn him alive with my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to go after Ellie. I\u2019m only letting you live so you can get Gus to the hospital. If he dies, it\u2019s on you. And I\u2019m going to be sure that Ellie knows about it.\u201d</p> <p>He swallowed hard and for a second I worried that Javier might die before Gus. A strange thing to worry about. I decided to call the ambulance on my way to Travis\u2019s, just to be sure. I couldn\u2019t trust this man for anything, not even to stay alive when I needed him to.</p><p>I got to my feet. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, breathing hard, his nostrils flaring.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought.\u201d I pointed the gun at him and for once he looked like I might pull the trigger. He was actually afraid of me. \u201cI could just kill you now and be done with you and call an ambulance myself.\u201d</p><p>I held it there for a few moments, pointed at him with all the fire inside me, before I lowered the gun and walked over to Gus, kneeling down beside him. His face was white, his eyes dull but he was alert and looking at me. I patted him on the arm and gave it a good squeeze.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, Gus.\u201d I pulled the cell phone out of his pocket and eyed Javier who was still lying there, propped up against the wall like a rag doll. I nodded at him. \u201cTell me where Travis lives, Javier.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to grapple with the information, as if he wasn\u2019t going to give it to me and for a second I thought maybe he really would let Ellie go on this suicide mission. But he motioned for me to bring the cell over.</p><p>I handed it to him and with a bloody hand he began to enter an address into the GPS. He handed it back to me as the new coordinates began triangulating. A flashing red dot.</p><p>\u201cYou go in there like this, you\u2019re going to get yourself killed before you even step foot on the property,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me worry about me,\u201d I said. I got up, loomed over him. \u201cAnd if I ever see your face again, I will kill you. You won\u2019t know when it will happen, but it will happen.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other for a few tense seconds, his yellow, poisonous eyes hating every inch of me. I was sure my look was no different.</p> <p>I tore my eyes away and glanced over at Gus. I swallowed hard, praying this wasn\u2019t the last time I\u2019d see him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a bit, Gus,\u201d I told him. Then I turned on my heel and started running for the GTO. Running for Ellie.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>ELLIE</p><p>Once I went back to the hotel and saw that Enrico wasn\u2019t at the desk, I went upstairs and started going down the hallway, calling out for Gus and Camden, hoping they were in one of the hotel rooms. I needed to warn them, to get to them before Javier did. But they weren\u2019t anywhere and when I went back downstairs and asked the front desk lady if she could call them for me, there was no answer on their end.</p><p>They would have seen the device going off with Javier and thought it was me, deviating from the plan. Now there was a whole new plan, one that Gus and Camden were walking straight into. I hoped to god that Javier would keep his word and only kill Camden if I didn\u2019t go through with the assassination. I should have made him promise it.</p><p>That was the only thing that kept me going, kept me putting one foot in front of the other, the fact that if I did everything I was told, they could be saved. And Gus, dear sweet old Gus, he wasn\u2019t an idiot \u2013 he was a trained cop and a hell of a lot of other things. He was the wildcard, someone that Javier wouldn\u2019t be expecting when Camden turned up.</p><p>I got out of the shower, trying to calm my breath and keep my limbs from shaking, trying to go ahead and do the things I needed to do to survive and get out of this. I picked out a dress from the closet, the place where Camden had hidden, watching out for me, never obvious but always there. The dress was long, green and glittery like mermaid scales which would have made me feel absolutely beautiful if I was wearing it at any other time but now it was just a cloak for my murder, a means to an end.</p> <p>I pinned my hair up and made my makeup look sweet and sexy. I\u2019d definitely act the part tonight. I was no longer afraid. I was determined to carry this out. I would get rid of him and then figure out a way to get myself out of there and back to Camden and Gus somehow. Through hell and high water, they found me. I could find them. I\u2019d been through worse.</p><p>I eyed the necklace hoping it would hold together and keep my secrets hidden. Those dirty angel wings. So Javier thought I was rotten too. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, he\u2019d been telling me how bad I was all this time.</p><p>At five thirty I went out to the lobby where Enrico was still nowhere to be found. Funny how he disappeared all of a sudden. I wondered if that was because Travis was coming here or perhaps Javier had called all of his troops to deal with Camden and Gus.</p><p>I swallowed hard and started sliding the pendant up and down the chain. No fear. I could do this. This would be done.</p><p>A white limousine pulled up outside and the driver came into the lobby, elegantly dressed with a jaunty cap and dark glasses. He called out, \u201cEleanor Willis.\u201d</p><p>I paused, waiting a moment, letting the fake name sink on me, before I stood up and gathered my black shawl around me. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The driver showed the way to the limo. It had been raining on and off all day and it was just starting to sputter again, the wind driving it into my face. I had put on waterproof mascara, insurance against the weather and against any tears I knew I\u2019d be shedding for whatever reason. I wouldn\u2019t get out of this day without tears or blood.</p><p>The driver pointed to the heavy, dark sky and said, \u201cIt will be sunny tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sad smile. I doubted tomorrow would be anything but sunny. I got in the back of the spacious limo, somewhat surprised that Travis wasn\u2019t in the back.</p><p>\u201cAre we meeting Mr. Raines at the restaurant?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMr. Raines is having dinner at his house. He is there already tending to his guests. He is having a dinner party.\u201d</p><p>I sat back, stunned. A dinner party? How the fuck was I going to escape from a dinner party? How was Javier going to get me, let alone anyone else?</p><p>And just like that, I\u2019d let the fear back in. Maybe this really was a suicide mission. Maybe it was always planned this way. Ellie Watt, the sacrifice that everyone loved to make.</p><p>My heart cried out for Camden, the only one who never saw me that way. I held my head back, staring at the lights on the roof of the limo, trying to keep the tears back. I stayed like that the entire drive until the limo pulled off the main streets of Veracruz and started to head inland toward a group of low hills, lush with greenery and the heavily gated mansions sprinkled throughout like hard candy.</p><p>Travis\u2019s place was at the end of a very long and narrow cobblestone street lined with flowers that seemed too bright for nature and palm trees that stretched as tall as the eyes could see. It was like entering a tunnel but there was no light at the end of it.</p><p>The limo paused at the extremely large gates where the driver waved something at the man at the booth. The man came out and the rear window went down. He looked in the back, at me, and then nodded. He returned to the booth and the gates opened for us.</p><p>Travis\u2019s house took my breath away. I didn\u2019t want it to, but it did. It was so much more impressive than the one I had to sneak into as a child. It was beyond sprawling, with many wings and beautiful balconies, shinning white and gold under the lights. The dark clouds billowed above it. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if the skies opened above it and Satan came fluttering down on black wings.</p><p>The limo climbed up the long, sweeping driveway and stopped in front of the door, where the carpeted steps led up into the hall made of granite and marble. It was like a Hollywood movie premiere and there were beautifully dressed people everywhere. The driver held the door open for me.</p><p>I smiled in thanks and got out, saying, \u201cThis is pretty big for a dinner party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh this is only the cocktail pre-party. The dinner party is for very special guests. It comes later. You should feel privileged that Mr. Raines has invited you, Miss Willis.\u201d</p><p>I studied the man, someone\u2019s father or grandfather, who seemed to have no problem working for one the most vile men in the country. Maybe that\u2019s what you had to do here to survive. Maybe these people were no different from me. Trying to turn a blind eye to what they knew was wrong, shielding their hearts, trying to live another day.</p><p>I walked up to the door, getting curious but pleasant glances from Veracruz\u2019s elite. The men admired my breasts, the women envied my dress. A bodyguard, the man I recognized as the bouncer from The Zoo, had a list and was checking names.</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEleanor Willis,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring my passport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I am just checking.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cOh good. My friend Connor Malloy might be coming here later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he on the list?\u201d</p><p>I peered over at the list. \u201cHe should be.\u201d</p><p>The man scanned it. \u201cDoesn\u2019t have his name here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll speak to Travis about it. He\u2019ll be an American, tall, black hair, tattoos, glasses. Like a hot muscly nerd.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded absently not really caring. \u201cCheck with Travis please.\u201d</p><p>Then he looked at the next person coming up the stairs. I moved past him, chewing on my lip. I had no idea if Camden would show up here, how he\u2019d get away from Javier, how he\u2019d even figure out where I was. But if it did happen, I hoped I would give him just a little bit of help, maybe a few seconds bought.</p><p>Suddenly a woman all in black appeared in front of me, waving a metal detector. \u201cMiss, we need to check you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my thoughts racing to my necklace. My nipple ring beeped first, prompting another somewhat embarrassing explanation considering this woman was in her late fifties and seemed disgusted by the whole idea. Then the necklace beeped. The woman rang the detector over it again and then lifted it off my collar bone, feeling it underneath.</p><p>I held my breath, trying to seem normal, trying to act like everything wasn\u2019t resting in her hands. It didn\u2019t say poison on the capsule but I still had a feeling it would get bad for me. At the very least she\u2019d confiscate it thinking it some sort of drug and then what did I have. My only hope was that drugs weren\u2019t so taboo at a party in a drug lord\u2019s house.</p><p>But the woman pressed the necklace back into my neck and smiled at it. \u201cPrecioso,\u201d she said and let me go.</p><p>I got far enough away from her before I exhaled loudly, letting it all out. That was close. I was in and I was okay but I didn\u2019t know for how much longer. I needed to hold it together.</p><p>Too late for that.</p><p>The crowd parted and Travis Raines appeared in front of me in a tuxedo, his bodyguards on all sides of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled at me and raised his arms to showcase the house. \u201cYou came, Miss Eleanor Willis. What do you think of my house? Isn\u2019t it the loveliest house you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d</p><p>I pasted a smile on my lips and the next thing I said wasn\u2019t a lie, \u201cYes, it\u2019s the nicest house I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d he said and clapped his hands together. \u201cSince you are new here, let me show you around and introduce you to the guests.\u201d</p><p>It was the most terrifying and boring hour of my life. He introduced me to literally everyone, saying my name \u201cMiss Eleanor Willis\u201d to every single person there. And there were a lot of people. I estimated at least eighty, milling about and looking pretty.</p> <p>The whole time I kept thinking about the necklace, I kept thinking about how I was going to do it and when. How would I get his food, what if I slipped up and he caught me? How long did the poison take to work? Would I have time to give it to him and then excuse myself to the bathroom? Would anyone suspect me? Did I have to sit there and watch him eat it and die? Because for all the terrible things he\u2019d done, for the devil that he was, I didn\u2019t know if I could do that. My heart would take no pleasure in murdering him, in seeing him die before my eyes. I always thought I might, that I would swim in it, but now that I was here and it was a reality, poison at my neck, I knew it would haunt me. Just because someone deserved to die didn\u2019t mean I was the person to do it.</p><p>But for tonight, for here, I had to. I was the angel of death, walking arm in arm with Lucifer.</p><p>We paused by the open doors to the veranda where many people were sitting about on brightly colored deckchairs, watching the thunder and lightning storm off in the distance. From here you had the vantage point of looking down the large grassy sweep of finely cut lawn and garden that was illuminated by various lights. In flashes of lightning I could see the lawn went beyond the lights and disappeared into jungle. It looked like acres and acres and it was all his.</p><p>Travis was beside me, talking to someone that he introduced as the senator of something. But I wasn\u2019t listening to a word they were saying. My eyes were caught on someone across the room, a striking man in an ill-fitting suit and an arm in a sling.</p><p>Camden. He was here, somehow. Just standing by the wall, his eyes on me, sending me signals. Trying to say something. But what? He was here, he was alive. He was alive. I looked around, trying not to be too obvious about it, to see if Javier was too, if it was a trap. Or maybe a dream, maybe a nightmare. But I didn\u2019t see him, not Gus, not anyone. Only Camden. He jerked his head toward the hallway, motioning for me to go out that way, to meet him there.</p> <p>I told him I would with my eyes, and was about to tell Travis I needed to use the bathroom when a woman stepped in front of me with a tray of champagne.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some champagne,\u201d she asked me and I nearly burst into tears at the sound of her voice. This woman. She was looking at the men, a phony smile pasted on her lips, one that lingered on Travis a little too long. Then she looked at me and for one second I could have been another pretty girl on the arm of the man she had once loved.</p><p>Then there was a flash of recognition, recognition that messed with her features, making her look less like a thin, middle-aged woman with highlighted brown hair and tall Estonian cheekbones, and more like a woman having the fright of her life. Because this, this was absolutely as frightening as it was fucked up.</p><p>She dropped the tray, it falling in slow motion, the champagne flutes tipping and the fizzing liquid spilling everywhere.</p><p>\u201cEllie!\u201d she exclaimed. And that\u2019s when I knew it wasn\u2019t a daydream of mine. It wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d imagined over and over again because what I\u2019d imagined didn\u2019t have my mother working for Travis Raines.</p><p>My mother.</p> <p>This was my mother.</p><p>Mom.</p><p>She was here, standing in front of me. After all these years, she was here with me.</p><p>And in that moment, that cry that escaped from her red lips, she and I both knew what was happening. That Travis was looking between the two of us and putting two and two and eleven and twenty-six together.</p><p>I had, maybe, a few seconds. My eyes flitted over my mother\u2019s shoulder to Camden in one second. He was already running toward me, a plastic bottle in his hand. He knew, he\u2019d seen this was coming.</p><p>In the next second, I spun around and ran like hell. I ran as fast as I could, grateful, for once, that I was never able to wear high heels, and shoved people out the way, leaping onto the veranda. I don\u2019t know what happened behind me, I could only focus on the lawn in front, the lights, the darkness behind it all. Suddenly there was a small explosion, a burst of something going off, though there was no heat and no light, but there was screaming and coughing and there was gunfire and suddenly Camden was at my side, running alongside me.</p><p>There was no time, no space in my lungs to talk, no way to figure out what had just happened and how that could have been my mother, my mom, who had left me in California all those years ago. The one who made me a freak, who left me as one. How could she be here? How could she be with that man, the one who ruined me before everyone else did? How could she do this to me?</p><p>My vision was getting blurry and the rainclouds burst open again, in time to hide my tears. I kept running, Camden at my side, limbs pumping up and down, bullets whizzing past us and I had no idea how we were going to get out of this alive.</p> <p>I should have killed Travis the first chance I got. Now the necklace was still around my neck and it was useless.</p><p>A machine gun went off in the distance, the rattle of bullets. We were heading for the jungle, for the darkness and depth that promised shelter and shade. We moved just inside the first trees, where a wide but overgrown path had cut through, when we were suddenly illuminated with light. A row of them went on a few yards in front of us, lights that belonged to a Jeep or a utility vehicle. Someone appeared at the top of the vehicle, standing on the seat, gun propped up over the windshield and aimed right at us.</p><p>Camden made the move to go in front of me, to block me from the gun. The gun went off, the single shot ringing throughout the forest. I screamed and gripped Camden as he became a shield, feeling for where the bullet would have gone into him. I felt like my heart had been shot too.</p><p>Camden gripped my arm right back and said, \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d as the man with the gun fell from the Jeep and landed on the hood. The fuck?</p><p>The bushes rustled to the left of the Jeep and another man stepped out into the lights. I couldn\u2019t see his face, only his silhouette but I\u2019d always recognize him.</p><p>\u201cIf I were you two, I\u2019d get the fuck in this car, or this would have been a big waste of my time,\u201d Javier said.</p><p>I exchanged a glance with Camden, not understanding any of this. He didn\u2019t look at ease but he glanced behind us at the Jeeps that were rolling over the lawn and coming for us, the gunfire in the distance that wouldn\u2019t stop until we were hunted down. It was either go with Javier or die here. It wasn\u2019t an easy choice but I\u2019d gotten pretty good at making hard decisions.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Camden said, squeezing my arm and running me over to the Jeep. Javier had already hopped into the driver\u2019s seat and I climbed in right beside him. Camden was barely inside before the Jeep started speeding backward along the rough path, our bodies knocking against each other from the bumps and dips. When the clearing opened a bit, Javier brought the Jeep around in a quick spin and we went off following it through, the way lit by the headlights.</p><p>I had so many questions but why Javier was here wasn\u2019t one. I didn\u2019t want to dwell on that, not now, not when we had to focus on getting out of there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He glared at me and I realized how fucked up his face had gotten. From the cutting look that he briefly shot Camden, I could tell he was the source of all the blood and bruises.</p><p>\u201cBefore I kill your Clark Kent over there, my plan is to get us the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me show you how Mexicans drive.\u201d</p><p>Once bullets started flying at the Jeep and we were lit up from behind, Travis\u2019s men entering the path, Javier turned the lights off on the Jeep and quickly turned to the right. Against the flashes of lightning, we could see the bushes and trees lighting up in front of us. Another flash of lightning and we were seconds from colliding with a tree. Javier yanked the wheel just in time and we went bounding out of the jungle and back to the smoothness of Travis\u2019s groomed lawn. The house glowed in the distance, people running in all directions, guns going off but who knows where or at what because at the moment they weren\u2019t after us.</p><p>That moment lasted about a minute, until people could hear the roar of the Jeep and we drove onto the area that was lit. Then guns were going off at us. People taking aim from all directions. There wasn\u2019t enough time to shoot, we were swerving radically and bounced down around to the front yard where people were fleeing the mansion in a convoy of fancy cars and limos. The gates were open, trying to let them out.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Javier yelled and he sounded like he was smiling when he said it, like this was all a fucking game. A gun shot came from the side and hit the door of the Jeep as Javier aimed the vehicle at a red sports car that was trying to leave through the gates. I held onto Camden for dear life, he held onto the roll bar and Javier held onto the wheel as we all braced for impact when we rear ended the red car, sending it flying off, crashing into the guard\u2019s booth. We were stalled for just a second, enough time for the guard to get out his gun and aim it at us but Javier was faster and shot him in the head first. Then he violently thrust the car into gear and slammed his foot on the gas. We rocketed forward and raced down the street. There seemed to be a light at the end of this tunnel when you were facing the other way.</p><p>We sped through the streets, not slowing, not stopping, weaving in and out of the Sunday evening drivers until Javier thought we were far enough away. He pulled the Jeep down a lonely road and parked it with a lurch.</p><p>A heavy minute passed as the rain started falling again. With no roof above our heads, all three of us were soaked thoroughly. We sat there breathing, me between them, trying to find some sense in this ever growing mess.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. \u201cMy mother ... why was my mother there?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Camden who was looking at Javier. I turned to look at Javier.</p><p>\u201cWhy was she there? You wanted me to kill my parents? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He stared right back at me and I realized how many secrets the man had been keeping from me. \u201cYour parents were never any good.\u201d</p><p>I felt the sting even though I knew the truth. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents used to work for Javier. And then they switched and went to Travis,\u201d Camden filled in over my head.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, you pansy,\u201d Javier sneered. \u201cWhat the fuck do you know about anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this pansy beat your fucking ass, American style,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>Shit, there was going to be more bloodshed if I didn\u2019t stop this.</p><p>\u201cYou guys!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhere is Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left him with Javier,\u201d Camden said, his face falling. \u201cHe was shot. He was alive when I left him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d I screeched, looking at Camden wildly. \u201cWhy the fuck did you leave him, he was shot!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to come get you,\u201d Camden said angrily. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that you were going to be having dinner at his house. If we\u2019d known that, I would have never let you leave today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where the fuck is Gus, Javier?\u201d I asked, my eyes slicing into him.</p><p>He rubbed nervously at the dried blood that was smeared all over his forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDead?!\u201d</p><p>He smoothed his hair behind his ears. \u201cNo. They have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is they?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me like I was an idiot. \u201cWho do you think? Los Zetas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did they get him?\u201d I looked between the both of them and slammed my hands down on the dashboard. \u201cThe fuck!\u201d I screamed.</p> <p>Javier sighed and looked away. I was so close to clocking him upside the head and reopening a few wounds, I didn\u2019t give a shit if he came and got me and Camden out of there. I knew him rescuing us couldn\u2019t have been because he had a change of heart. He licked his lips and gave me an apologetic glance. \u201cAfter Camden left, I waited until I could hear the ambulance. I left Gus there and went into the building. I knew the cops would show up soon after, Zetas cops, once the medics discovered Peter and Raul\u2019s bodies and that I\u2019d be as good as dead. I went upstairs to hide. I watched the ambulance come. He was alive. They put an oxygen mask on him. They took him away. They got to the end of the street. Then a black car came out of nowhere, stopped the ambulance. Shot the driver. Opened up the back. Took Gus out, shot everyone else. They put Gus in the car. And then they drove off.\u201d</p><p>My mouth was open. It took effort to close it. \u201cAnd that was Travis? He was at the party ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess Raul orchestrated this. We won\u2019t know because I shot him. And he, by the way, is the one who shot Gus, not me.\u201d Javier cast a furtive glance over at Camden and continued, \u201cI\u2019m guessing they mean to take you, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Camden cleared his throat. \u201cThey would have taken Ellie at the party. I was watching Travis\u2019s face, he was truly shocked when he found out about Ellie and her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was probably planning on taking Ellie later, for vengeance, without knowing who Ellie really was. Now, he probably has Gus. And this whole fucking thing is far from over. Now, Travis knows everything.\u201d He scratched at his chin thoughtfully, \u201cYour parents won\u2019t be around for much longer either.\u201d</p><p>That was enough. I took my elbow and smashed Javier right in his already broken nose. Then I crawled over Camden and jumped from the Jeep, running down the road until I tripped over a pothole and went flying to the ground.</p> <p>Camden was soon at my side, helping me back up. I waved him away, just wanted to lie there, let the rain wash me away.</p><p>\u201cEllie, come on,\u201d he said softly, bringing me up to me feet. My dress was all dirty from the mud, as dirty as I felt.</p><p>I blinked back the tears and stared up at him, the side of his face illuminated by the headlights. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head at me and smiled, just a bit. \u201cWe do what we\u2019ve always done. The right thing. We go get him back.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I was so damn afraid. \u201cI can\u2019t do this again. Javier\u2019s right, Travis knows me now. Everything has been blown wide open ... my parents ... it\u2019s what that asshole wanted.\u201d I glared at the Jeep but was only blinded.</p><p>\u201cThat asshole isn\u2019t going to get what he wants much longer, Ellie. We don\u2019t need him. You and I, we will get Gus back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last a day.\u201d Javier was suddenly behind us. My God he could be sneaky.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck off,\u201d Camden said, \u201cyou should be grateful your brains aren\u2019t spilled all over the wall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have the guts,\u201d he answered, stepping right up to him. As much as this spelled disaster, as sticky as this all was, Javier kind of had a point. We wouldn\u2019t get that far. Camden got to me with the help of Gus and his contacts. Together, we had nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou still want your sisters safe, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked Javier.</p><p>He nodded, and I saw the first flash of pain come across his brow. \u201cI have to get to Mexico City. That\u2019s where Violetta is. She\u2019s the closest to him now, the easiest one for him to go after. I have people here who can help me, who will help me. I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s enough. Now that Travis knows I am here ...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to finish the sentence. We all knew far too well what he would do.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, looking between them, \u201cJavier we\u2019ll help protect your sister if you help us get Gus back. And my parents, if we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck can you protect my sister?\u201d he asked angrily.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I said. \u201cWho else do you have right now? Who else is here with you? Peter? Raul? You can\u2019t do this alone just as we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose same people turned on you. What makes you think they\u2019ll stay loyal now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaul, I knew ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet look what happened. Who knows who else Travis has won over? At least you know where you stand with us.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I was pressing so hard for Javier\u2019s help, especially when he\u2019d just threatened to deliver Camden\u2019s head at my doorstep, but there it was.</p><p>He shook his head back and forth but walked back to the car. \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us like this!\u201d I yelled at him. I looked up at Camden, pleading a bit with my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>His eyes cut into Javier as he got back into the Jeep. \u201cYou always have a choice, Ellie. Always. This will have to be ours.\u201d We turned and headed back toward the Jeep. Camden leaned into me and whispered, \u201cAt the first legitimate excuse, Javier is gone. I\u2019ll kill him if I have to.\u201d</p><p>I would have chalked that up to Camden being overprotective. But I recognized the dark gleam in his eyes, the absence of guilt, and I realized he would.</p><p>Camden had changed. We all had changed. The past was behind us. And I had no idea what our future was. </p> </body></html>"]
