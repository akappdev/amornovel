The plane starts to descend, and I have this sudden panic because I just know that I\u2019m on the wrong plane, am traveling to the wrong place. It\u2019s never clear where I\u2019m landing\u2014in a war zone, in the midst of an epidemic, in the wrong century\u2014only that it\u2019s somewhere I shouldn\u2019t be. Sometimes I try to ask the person next to me where we are going, but I can never quite see a face, can never quite hear an answer. I wake in a disoriented sweat to the sound of the landing gear dropping, to the echo of my heart beating. It usually takes me a few moments to find my bearings, to locate where it is I am\u2014an apartment in Prague, a hostel in Cairo\u2014but even once that\u2019s been established, the sense of being lost lingers.</p><p>I think I\u2019m having the dream now. Just as always, I lift the shade to peer at the clouds. I feel the hydraulic lurch of the engines, the thrust downward, the pressure in my ears, the ignition of panic. I turn to the faceless person next to me\u2014only this time I get the feeling it\u2019s not a stranger. It\u2019s someone I know. Someone I\u2019m traveling with. And that fills me with such intense relief. We can\u2019t both have gotten on the wrong plane.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where we\u2019re going?\u201d I ask. I lean closer. I\u2019m just about there, just about to see a face, just about to get an answer, just about to find out where it is I\u2019m going\u2014</p><p>And then I hear sirens.</p> <p>I first noticed the sirens in Dubrovnik. I was traveling with a guy I\u2019d met in Albania, when we heard a siren go by. It sounded like the kind they have in American action movies, and the guy I was traveling with commented on how each country had its own siren sound. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful because if you forget where you are, you can always close your eyes, let the sirens tell you,\u201d he told me. I\u2019d been gone a year by then, and it had taken me a few minutes to summon the sound of the sirens at home. They were musical almost, a down-up-down-up la, la, la, la, like someone absentmindedly, but cheerfully, humming.</p><p>That\u2019s not what this siren is. It is monotonous, a nyeah-nyeah, nyeah-nyeah, like the bleating of electric sheep. It doesn\u2019t become louder or fainter as it comes closer or gets farther away; it\u2019s just a wall of wailing. Much as I try, I cannot locate this siren, have no idea where I am.</p><p>I only know that I am not home.</p><p>I open my eyes. There is bright light everywhere, from overhead, but also from my own eyes: tiny pinprick explosions that hurt like hell. I close my eyes.</p><p>Kai. The guy I traveled with from Tirana to Dubrovnik was called Kai. We drank weak Croatian pilsner on the ramparts of the city and then laughed as we pissed into the Adriatic. His name was Kai. He was from Finland.</p><p>The sirens blare. I still don\u2019t know where I am.</p> <p>The sirens stop. I hear a door opening, I feel water on my skin. A shifting of my body. I sense it is better to keep my eyes closed. None of this is anything I want to witness.</p><p>But then my eyes are forced open, and there\u2019s another light, harsh and painful, like the time I spent too long looking at a solar eclipse. Saba warned me not to, but some things are impossible to tear yourself away from. After, I had a headache for hours. Eclipse migraine. That\u2019s what they called it on the news. Lots of people got them from staring at the sun. I know that, too. But I still don\u2019t know where I am.</p><p>There are voices now, as if echoing out from a tunnel. I can hear them, but I cannot make out what they\u2019re saying.</p><p>\u201cComment vous appelez-vous?\u201d someone asks in a language I know is not mine but that I somehow understand. What is your name?</p><p>\u201cCan you tell us your name?\u201d The question again in another language, also not my own.</p><p>\u201cWillem de Ruiter.\u201d This time it\u2019s my voice. My name.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d It is a man\u2019s voice. It switches back to the other language. French. It says that I got my own name right, and I wonder how it is he knows this. For a second I think it is Bram speaking, but even as muddled as I am, I realize this is not possible. Bram never did learn French.</p><p>\u201cWillem, we are going to sit you up now.\u201d</p> <p>The back of my bed\u2014I think I\u2019m on a bed\u2014tilts forward. I try to open my eyes again. Everything is blurry, but I can make out bright lights overhead, scuffed walls, a metal table.</p><p>\u201cWillem, you are in the hospital,\u201d the man says.</p><p>Yes, I was just sussing that part out. It would also explain my shirt being covered in blood, if not the shirt itself, which is not mine. It is gray and says SOS in red lettering. What does SOS mean? Whose shirt is this? And whose blood is on it?</p><p>I look around. I see the man\u2014a doctor?\u2014in the lab coat, the nurse next to him, holding out an ice compress for me to take. I touch my cheek. The skin is hot and swollen. My finger comes away with more blood. That answers one question.</p><p>\u201cYou are in Paris,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cDo you know where Paris is?\u201d</p><p>I am eating tagine at a Moroccan restaurant in Montorgueil with Yael and Bram. I am passing the hat after a performance with the German acrobats in Montmartre. I am thrashing, sweaty, at a Mollier Than Molly show at Divan du Monde with C\u00e9line. And I\u2019m running, running through the Barb\u00e8s market, a girl\u2019s hand in mine.</p><p>Which girl?</p><p>\u201cIn France,\u201d I manage to answer. My tongue feels thick as a wool sock.</p><p>\u201cCan you remember what happened?\u201d the doctor asks.</p><p>I hear boots and taste blood. There is a pool of it in my mouth. I don\u2019t know what to do with it, so I swallow.</p><p>\u201cIt appears you were in a fight,\u201d the doctor continues. \u201cYou will need to make a report to the police. But first you will need sutures for your face, and we must take a scan of your head to make sure there is no subdural hematoma. Are you on holiday here?\u201d</p><p>Black hair. Soft breath. A gnawing feeling that I\u2019ve misplaced something valuable. I pat my pocket.</p><p>\u201cMy things?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThey found your bag and its contents scattered at the scene. Your passport was still inside. So was your wallet.\u201d</p><p>He hands it to me. I look at the billfold. There are more than a hundred euros inside, though I seem to recall having a lot more. My identity card is missing.</p><p>\u201cWe also found this.\u201d He shows me a small black book. \u201cThere is still quite a bit of money in your wallet, no? It doesn\u2019t suggest a robbery, unless you fought off your attackers.\u201d He frowns, I assume at the apparent foolishness of this maneuver.</p><p>Did I do that? A low fog sits overhead, like the mist coming off the canals in the morning that I used to watch and will to burn off. I was always cold. Yael said it was because though I looked Dutch, her Mediterranean blood was swimming in me. I remember that, remember the scratchy wool blanket I would wrap myself in to stay warm. And though I now know where I am, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not supposed to be in Paris. I\u2019m supposed to be in Holland. Maybe that explains that niggling feeling.</p><p>Burn off. Burn off, I will the fog. But it is as stubborn as the Dutch fog. Or maybe my will is as weak as the winter sun. Either way, it doesn\u2019t burn off.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the date?\u201d the doctor asks.</p><p>I try to think, but dates float by like leaves in a gutter. But this is nothing new. I know that I never know the date. I don\u2019t need to. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what month it is?\u201d</p><p>Augustus. Ao\u00fbt. No, English. \u201cAugust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay of the week?\u201d</p><p>Donderdag, something in my head says. Thursday. \u201cThursday?\u201d I try.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d the doctor corrects, and the gnawing feeling grows stronger. Perhaps I am supposed to be somewhere on Friday.</p><p>The intercom buzzes. The doctor picks it up, talks for a minute, hangs up, turns to me. \u201cRadiology will be here in thirty minutes.\u201d Then he begins talking to me about commotions c\u00e9r\u00e9brales or concussions and temporary short-term memory loss and cats and scans and none of it is making a lot of sense.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone we can call?\u201d he asks. And I feel like there is, but for the life of me, I can\u2019t think who. Bram is gone and Saba is gone and Yael might as well be. Who else is there?</p><p>The nausea hits, fast, like a wave I had my back to. And then there\u2019s puke all over my bloodied shirt. The nurse is quick with the basin, but not quick enough. She gives me a towel to clean myself with. The doctor is saying something about nausea and concussions. There are tears in my eyes. I never did learn to throw up without crying.</p><p>The nurse mops my face with another towel. \u201cOh, I missed a spot,\u201d she says with a tender smile. \u201cThere, on your watch.\u201d</p><p>On my wrist is a watch, bright and gold. It\u2019s not mine. For the quickest moment, I see it on a girl\u2019s wrist. I travel up the hand to a slender arm, a strong shoulder, a swan\u2019s neck. When I get to the face, I expect it to be blank, like the faces in the dream. But it\u2019s not.</p><p>Black hair. Pale skin. Warm eyes.</p><p>I look at the watch again. The crystal is cracked but it\u2019s still ticking. It reads nine. I begin to suspect what it is I\u2019ve forgotten.</p><p>I try to sit up. The world turns to soup.</p><p>The doctor pushes me back onto the bed, a hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou are agitated because you are confused. This is all temporary, but we will need to take the CT scan to make sure there is no bleeding on the brain. While we wait, we can attend to your facial lacerations. First I will give you something to make the area numb.\u201d</p><p>The nurse swabs off my cheek with something orange. \u201cDo not worry. This won\u2019t stain.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t stain; it just stings.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go now,\u201d I say when the sutures are done.</p><p>The doctor laughs. And for a second I see white skin covered in white dust, but warmer underneath. A white room. A throbbing in my cheek.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is waiting for me.\u201d I don\u2019t know who, but I know it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cWho is waiting for you?\u201d the doctor asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cMr. de Ruiter. You must have a CT scan. And, after, I would like to keep you for observation until your mental clarity returns. Until you know who it is who waits for you.\u201d</p><p>Neck. Skin. Lips. Her fragile-strong hand over my heart. I touch my hand to my chest, over the green scrub shirt the nurse gave me after they cut off my bloody shirt to check for broken ribs. And the name, it\u2019s almost right there.</p><p>Orderlies come to wheel me to a different floor. I\u2019m loaded into a metal tube that clatters around my head. Maybe it\u2019s the noise, but inside the tube, the fog begins to burn off. But there is no sunshine behind it, only a dull, leaden sky as the fragments click together. \u201cI need to go. Now!\u201d I shout from the tube.</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Then the click of the intercom. \u201cPlease hold still,\u201d a disembodied voice orders in French.</p><p>I am wheeled back downstairs to wait. It is past twelve o\u2019clock.</p><p>I wait more. I remember hospitals, remember exactly why I hate them.</p><p>I wait more. I am adrenaline slammed into inertia: a fast car stuck in traffic. I take a coin out of my pocket and do the trick Saba taught me as a little boy. It works. I calm down, and when I do, more of the missing pieces slot into place. We came together to Paris. We are together in Paris. I feel her hand gentle on my side, as she rode on the back of the bicycle. I feel her not-so-gentle hand on my side, as we held each other tight. Last night. In a white room.</p><p>The white room. She is in the white room, waiting for me.</p><p>I look around. Hospital rooms are never white like people believe. They are beige, taupe, mauve: neutral tones meant to soothe heartbreak. What I wouldn\u2019t give to be in an actual white room right now.</p><p>Later, the doctor comes back in. He is smiling. \u201cGood news! There is no subdural bleeding. Only a concussion. How is your memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We will wait for the police. They will take your statement and then I can release you to your friend. But you must take it very easy. I will give you an instruction sheet for care, but it is in French. Perhaps someone can translate it, or we can find you one in English or Dutch online.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCe ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAhh, you speak French?\u201d he asks in French.</p><p>I nod. \u201cIt came back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Everything else will, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I can go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must come for you! And you have to make a report to the police.\u201d</p><p>Police. It will be hours. And I have nothing to tell them, really. I take the coin back out and play it across my knuckle. \u201cNo police!\u201d</p><p>The doctor follows the coin as it flips across my hand. \u201cDo you have problems with the police?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that. I have to find someone,\u201d I say. The coin clatters to the floor.</p> <p>The doctor picks it up and hands it to me. \u201cFind who?\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it\u2019s the casual way he asked; my bruised brain doesn\u2019t have time to scramble it before spitting it out. Or perhaps the fog is lifting now, and leaving a terrific headache behind. But there it is, a name, on my lips, like I say it all the time.</p><p>\u201cLulu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, Lulu. Tr\u00e8s bien!\u201d The doctor claps his hands together. \u201cLet us call this Lulu. She can come get you. Or we can bring her to you.\u201d</p><p>It is too much to explain that I don\u2019t know where Lulu is. Only that she\u2019s in the white room and she\u2019s waiting for me and she\u2019s been waiting for a long time. And I have this terrible feeling, and it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m in a hospital where things are routinely lost, but because of something else.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I insist. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go now, it could be too late.\u201d</p> <p>The doctor looks at the clock on the wall. \u201cIt is not yet two o\u2019clock. Not late at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be too late for me.\u201d Might be. As if whatever is going to happen hasn\u2019t already happened.</p><p>The doctor looks at me for a long minute. Then he shakes his head. \u201cIt is better to wait. A few more hours, your memory will return, and you will find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a few hours!\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he can keep me here against my will. I wonder if at this moment I even have a will. But something pulls me forward, through the mist and the pain. \u201cI have to go,\u201d I insist. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The doctor looks at me and sighs. \u201cD\u2019accord.\u201d He hands me a sheaf of papers, tells me I am to rest for the next two days, clean my wound every day, the sutures will dissolve. Then he hands me a small card. \u201cThis is the police inspector. I will tell him to expect your call tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou have somewhere to go?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>C\u00e9line\u2019s club. I recite the address. The M\u00e9tro stop. These I remember easily. These I can find.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cGo to the billing office to check out, and then you may go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He touches me on the shoulder, reminds me to take it easy. \u201cI am sorry Paris brought you such misfortune.\u201d</p><p>I turn to face him. He\u2019s wearing a name tag and the blurriness in my vision has subsided so I can focus on it. docteur robinet, it reads. And while my vision is okay, the day is still muddy, but I get this feeling about it. A hazy feeling of something\u2014not quite happiness, but solidness, stepping on earth after being at sea for too long\u2014fills me up. It tells me that whoever this Lulu is, something happened between us in Paris, something that was the opposite of misfortune.</p><p>Two</p><p>At the billing office, I fill out a few thousand forms. There are problems when they ask for an address. I don\u2019t have one. I haven\u2019t for such a long time. But they won\u2019t let me leave until I supply one. At first, I think to give them Marjolein, my family\u2019s attorney. She\u2019s who Yael has deal with all her important mail, and whom, I realize too late, I was supposed to meet with today\u2014or was it tomorrow? Or yesterday now?\u2014in Amsterdam. But if a hospital bill goes to Marjolein, then all of this goes straight back to Yael, and I don\u2019t want to explain it to her. I don\u2019t want to not explain it, either, in the more likely event she never asks about it.</p><p>\u201cCan I give you a friend\u2019s address?\u201d I ask the clerk.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you give me the Queen of England\u2019s address so long as we have somewhere to mail the bill,\u201d she says.</p><p>I can give them Broodje\u2019s address in Utrecht. \u201cOne moment,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, mon ch\u00e9ri.\u201d</p><p>I lean on the counter and rifle through my address book, flipping through the last year of accumulated acquaintances. There are countless names of people I don\u2019t remember, names I didn\u2019t remember even before I got this nasty bump on my head. There\u2019s a message to Remember the caves in Matala. I do remember the caves, and the girl who wrote the message, but not why I\u2019m supposed to remember them.</p><p>I find Robert-Jan\u2019s address right at the front. I read it to the clerk, and as I close the book it falls open to one of the last pages. There\u2019s all this unfamiliar writing, and at first I think my eyesight must really be messed up, but then I realize it\u2019s just that the words are not English or Dutch but Chinese.</p><p>And for a second, I\u2019m not here in this hospital, but I\u2019m on a boat, with her, and she\u2019s writing in my notebook. I remember. She spoke Chinese. She showed it to me. I turn the page, and there\u2019s this.</p><p>There\u2019s no translation next to it, but I somehow know what that character means.</p><p>Double happiness.</p><p>I see the character here in the book. And I see it larger, on a sign. Double happiness. Is that where she is?</p><p>\u201cIs there maybe a Chinese restaurant or store nearby?\u201d I ask the clerk.</p><p>She scratches her hair with a pencil and consults a colleague. They start to argue about the best place to eat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I explain. \u201cNot to eat. I\u2019m looking for this.\u201d I show them the character in my book.</p><p>They look at each other and shrug.</p><p>\u201cA Chinatown?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIn the thirteenth arrondissement,\u201d one replies.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft Bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould an ambulance have brought me here from there?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a smaller one in Belleville,\u201d the other clerk offers.</p><p>\u201cIt is a few kilometers from here, not far,\u201d the first clerk explains and tells me how to get to the M\u00e9tro.</p><p>I put on my rucksack, and leave.</p><p>I don\u2019t get far. My rucksack feels like it\u2019s full of wet cement. When I left Holland two years ago, I carried a big pack with many more things. But then it got stolen and I never replaced it, instead making do with a smaller bag. Over time, the rucksacks kept getting smaller and smaller, because there\u2019s so little a person actually needs. These days, all I keep is a few changes of clothes, some books, some toiletries, but now even that feels like too much. When I go down the stairs into the M\u00e9tro, the bag bounces with each step, and pain knifes deep into me.</p><p>\u201cBruised, not broken,\u201d Dr. Robinet told me before I left. I thought he was talking about my spirit, but he\u2019d been referring to my ribs.</p><p>On the M\u00e9tro platform, I pull everything out of the rucksack except for my passport, wallet, address book, and toothbrush. When the train comes, I leave the rest on the platform. I\u2019m lighter now, but it\u2019s not any easier.</p><p>The Belleville Chinatown begins right after the M\u00e9tro stop. I try to match the signs from her character in my book, but there are so many signs and the neon lettering looks nothing like those soft ink lines she wrote. I ask around for double happiness. I have no idea if I\u2019m asking for a place, a person, a food, a state of mind. The Chinese people look frightened of me and no one answers, and I begin to wonder if maybe I\u2019m not really speaking French, only imagining I do. Finally one of them, an old man with grizzled hands clutching an ornate cane, stares at me and then says, \u201cYou are a long way from double happiness.\u201d</p><p>I am about to ask what he means, where it is, but then I catch a glimpse of my reflection in a shop window, my eye swelling purple, the bandage on my face seeping blood. I understand he isn\u2019t talking about a place.</p><p>But then I do glimpse familiar letters. Not the double happiness character, but the SOS letters from the mysterious T-shirt I was wearing earlier at the hospital. I see it now on another T-shirt, worn by a guy my age with jagged hair and an armful of metal cuffs. Maybe he\u2019s connected to double happiness somehow.</p><p>It winds me to catch up with him, a half block away. When I tap him on the shoulder, he turns around and steps back. I point to his shirt. I\u2019m about to ask him what it means when he asks me in French, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkinheads,\u201d I reply in English. It\u2019s the same word all over. I explain in French that I was wearing a T-shirt like his before.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cThe racists hate Sous ou Sur. They are very anti-fascist.\u201d</p><p>I nod, though I remember now why they beat me up, and I\u2019m pretty certain it had little to do with my T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI think you need a doctor, my friend.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. That\u2019s not what I need.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d the guy asks me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a place around here with a sign like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a store. Restaurant. Club. I don\u2019t know, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that I don\u2019t know shit. That counts for something.\u201d I point to the egg on my head. \u201cThings got scrambled.\u201d</p><p>He peers at my head. \u201cYou should have that looked at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did.\u201d I point to the bandage covering the stitches on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be resting or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. After I find it. The double happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so important about this double happiness?\u201d</p><p>I see her then, not just see her, but feel her, soft breath against my cheek as she whispered something to me just as I was falling asleep last night. I didn\u2019t hear what she said. I only remember I was happy. To be in that white room. \u201cLulu,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh. A girl. I\u2019m on my way to see my girl.\u201d He pulls out his phone and texts something. \u201cBut she can wait; they always do!\u201d He grins at me, showing off a set of defiantly crooked teeth.</p><p>He\u2019s right. They do. Even when I didn\u2019t know they would, even when I\u2019d been gone a long time, the girls, they waited. I never cared one way or another.</p><p>We take off, walking up and down the narrow blocks, the air thick with the smell of stewed organs. I feel like I\u2019m running to keep up with him, and the exertion sets my stomach churning again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so pretty, friend,\u201d he tells me right as I retch bile into the gutter. He looks vaguely alarmed. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a doctor?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, wipe my mouth, my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I think maybe I should take you to meet my girl, Toshi. She works in this area, so she might know this double happiness place.\u201d</p><p>I follow him a few blocks. I\u2019m still trying to find the double happiness sign, but it\u2019s even harder now because I got some sick on my address book and the ink\u2019s smeared. Also, there are black spots dancing before my eyes making it hard to see where the pavement really is.</p><p>When we finally stop, I almost cry in relief. Because we\u2019ve found it, the double happiness place. Everything is familiar. The steel door, the red scaffolding, the distorted portraits, even the faded name on the facade, Ganterie, after the glove factory it must have once been. This is the place.</p><p>Toshi comes to the door, a tiny black girl with tight dreadlocks, and I want to hug her for delivering me to the white room. I want to march straight to the white room and lie down next to Lulu, to have everything feel right again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I try to say this, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t even really get my legs to move because the ground beneath me has turned liquid and wavy. Toshi and my samaritan, whose name is Pierre, are arguing in French. She wants to call the police and Pierre says they have to help me find double happiness.</p><p>It\u2019s okay, I want to tell him. I\u2019ve found it. This is the place. But I can\u2019t quite make the words come out straight. \u201cLulu,\u201d I manage to say. \u201cIs she here?\u201d</p><p>A few more people crowd around the door. \u201cLulu,\u201d I say again. \u201cI left Lulu here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Pierre asks. He turns to Toshi and points to his head and then to my head.</p> <p>I keep repeating her name: Lulu, Lulu. And then I stop but her name continues, like in an echo chamber, like my pleas are traveling deep into the building and will bring her back from wherever it is she\u2019s gone.</p><p>When the crowd parts, I think it really has worked. That my words dredged her up, returned her to me. That the one time I wanted one to wait, one did.</p><p>A girl steps out from the crowd. \u201cOui, Lulu, c\u2019est moi,\u201d she says delicately.</p><p>But that\u2019s not Lulu. Lulu was willowy with black hair and eyes as dark. This girl is a petite china doll, and blonde. She is not Lulu. Only then do I remember that Lulu is not Lulu either. Lulu was the name I gave her. I don\u2019t know her real name.</p><p>The crowd stares at me. I hear myself babbling about needing to find Lulu. The other Lulu. I left her in the white room.</p> <p>They look at me with odd expressions on their faces and then Toshi pulls out her mobile phone. I hear her talking; she is requesting an ambulance. It takes me a minute to realize it\u2019s for me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI already have been to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hate to see you before,\u201d Wrong Lulu says. \u201cWere you in an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got beaten up by skinheads,\u201d Pierre tells her.</p><p>But Wrong Lulu is right. Accident\u2014how I found her. Accident\u2014how I lost her. You have to give the universe credit, the way it evens things out like that.</p><p>Three</p> <p>I take a taxi to C\u00e9line\u2019s club. The fare eats into the last of my money but it doesn\u2019t matter. I just need enough to get back to Amsterdam, and I already have a train ticket. On the short ride over, I nod off in the backseat and it\u2019s only when we pull up outside La Ruelle that I remember we left Lulu\u2019s suitcase here.</p><p>The bar is dark and empty, but the door is unlocked. I hobble down to C\u00e9line\u2019s office. It\u2019s dark inside there, too, only the grayish glow of her computer monitor lighting her face. At first, when she looks up and sees me, she smiles that smile of hers, like a lion waking from a nap, refreshed but hungry. Then I click on the light.</p><p>\u201cMon dieu!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cWhat did she do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she here? Lulu?\u201d</p><p>C\u00e9line rolls her eyes. \u201cYes. Yesterday. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the suitcase?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the storage room, where we left it. What happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the keys.\u201d</p><p>C\u00e9line narrows her eyes with one of her looks, but she opens a desk drawer and tosses me the keys. I unlock the door, and there\u2019s the suitcase. She hasn\u2019t come back for it, and for a moment I feel happy because it means she must still be here. Still be in Paris, looking for me.</p><p>But then I think about what the woman from Ganterie said, the one who came downstairs after my vision went all black and Toshi threatened again to call an ambulance and I begged for a taxi instead. This woman said that she saw a girl race out of the doors when she unlocked them this morning. \u201cI called after her to come back, but she just ran away,\u201d she told me, in French.</p><p>Lulu didn\u2019t speak French. And she didn\u2019t know her way around Paris. She didn\u2019t know how to get to the train station last night. She didn\u2019t know how to get to the club, either. She wouldn\u2019t know where her suitcase is. She wouldn\u2019t know where I was\u2014even if she wanted to find me.</p><p>I take the suitcase, search for a luggage tag, and find nothing: not a name tag or an airplane baggage claim. I try to open it, but it\u2019s locked. I pause for all of a second before yanking off the flimsy padlock. As soon as I open the bag, I\u2019m hit with the familiar. Not the contents\u2014clothes and souvenirs I\u2019ve never seen before\u2014but the smell. I pick up a neatly folded T-shirt, put it to my face, and inhale.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d C\u00e9line asks, suddenly appearing in the doorway.</p><p>I slam the door shut in her face and continue going through Lulu\u2019s things. There are souvenirs, including one of those wind-up clocks like one we looked at together at one of the stalls on the Seine, some plug adapters, chargers, toiletries, but nothing that tracks back to her. There is a sheet of paper in a plastic bag, and I pick that up, hopeful, but it only contains an inventory of sorts.</p><p>Tucked underneath a sweater is a travel journal. I finger the cover. I was on a train to Warsaw more than a year ago when my rucksack got nicked. I had my passport, money, and address book on me, so all the thieves got was a half-broken backpack with a bunch of dirty clothes, an old camera, and a diary inside of it. They had probably just thrown everything away once they\u2019d realized there was nothing to sell. Maybe they got twenty euros for the camera, though it was worth a lot more to me. As for the diary, worthless; I prayed they tossed it. I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of anyone reading it. It was the only time in the last two years I\u2019d considered going home. I didn\u2019t. But when I bought new things, I didn\u2019t replace the diary.</p><p>I wonder what Lulu would think of me reading her journal. I try to imagine how I\u2019d have felt had she read all my raw rantings about Bram and Yael from my stolen journal. When I do, it\u2019s not the usual embarrassment or shame or the disgust that washes over me. Instead, it\u2019s something quiet, familiar. Something like relief.</p><p>I open her journal, flipping through the pages, knowing I shouldn\u2019t. But I\u2019m looking for a way to contact to her, though maybe, I\u2019m just looking for more of her. A different way to breathe her in.</p><p>But I find no scent of her. Not a single name or address: not hers, not anyone\u2019s she met. There are only a few vague entries, nothing telling, nothing Lulu.</p><p>I flip to the end of the journal. The spine is stiff and cracks. Behind the back cover is a deck of postcards. I search them for addresses, but they\u2019re blank.</p><p>I reach for a pen on one of the shelves and start writing my name, phone number, email address, and Broodje\u2019s address for good measure, on each of the postcards. I write myself into Rome, Vienna, Prague, Edinburgh. London. All the while, I\u2019m wondering why. Keep in touch. It\u2019s like a mantra on the road. This act you do. But it rarely happens. You meet people, you part ways, sometimes you cross paths again. Mostly, you don\u2019t.</p><p>The last postcard is of William Shakespeare from Stratford-upon-Avon. I\u2019d told her to skip Hamlet and come see us instead. I\u2019d told her the night was too nice for tragedy. I should have known better than to say a thing like that.</p><p>I flip Shakespeare over. \u201cPlease,\u201d I begin. I\u2019m about to write something else: Please get in touch. Please let me explain. Please tell me who you are. But my cheek is throbbing and my vision has gone all soft-focus again and I\u2019m exhausted and weighted with regret. So I bookend the \u201cplease\u201d with that regret. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I write.</p><p>I tuck all the postcards back in the bag and then back in the journal. I zip up the suitcase and put it back in the corner. I shut the door.</p><p>Four</p><p>The last time I was in C\u00e9line\u2019s flat, more than a year ago, she hurled a vase of dead flowers at my head. I\u2019d been staying with her about a month, and I told her it was time for me to move on. It had been unseasonably warm and I\u2019d stayed unusually long. But then the weather had turned cold and I felt the claustrophobia return. C\u00e9line accused me of being a fair-weather boyfriend, and she wasn\u2019t entirely wrong about the weather, but I\u2019d never actually been her boyfriend, never promised to stay. There was screaming, curses, then the vase sailing through the air, missing my head but smashing into the faded blue wall. I tried to help with the mess before I left, but she refused to let me.</p><p>I don\u2019t think either of us expected me ever to set foot in here again. I don\u2019t think we ever thought we\u2019d see each other again. But then I bumped into her at La Ruelle a few months later. She had recently been made booking manager, and she seemed happy enough to see me. She gave me free drinks all night and invited me down to her office to show me the roster of bands she had scheduled in the coming months. I went with her, even though I was pretty certain that the calendar was not what she wanted to show me, and sure enough, as soon as we got to the office, she locked the door, and never turned on her computer.</p><p>There was an unspoken agreement that I\u2019d never go back to her flat. I had a place to stay, anyway, and I was leaving the next morning. After that, I saw her whenever I came through Paris. Always at the club, in the office, with the door locked.</p><p>So I think we are both surprised when I ask if I can stay at her place.</p><p>\u201cReally? You want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind. You can give me the keys and meet me later. I know you have to work. I\u2019ll leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay as long as you like. Let me come with you. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>My fingers absently touch the watch, still on my wrist. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I just need to rest.\u201d</p><p>C\u00e9line sees the watch. \u201cIs that hers?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I run my finger along the cracked crystal.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep it?\u201d she asks, her tone gone sour.</p><p>I nod. C\u00e9line starts to protest, but I hold up my hand to stop her. I barely have the energy to stand. But I am keeping this watch.</p><p>C\u00e9line rolls her eyes, but she also shuts down her computer and helps me up the stairs. She calls out to Modou, who is now digging around behind the bar, that she is taking me home for the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your friend?\u201d Modou asks, popping back up.</p><p>I turn back toward him. The lights are dim and C\u00e9line\u2019s arm is around me for support. I can hardly see him. \u201cTell her I\u2019m sorry. Her suitcase is in the closet. If she comes back. Tell her that.\u201d I want to tell him to make sure she looks at the postcards, but C\u00e9line is yanking me out the door. Outside, I was expecting darkness, but, no, it\u2019s still daytime. Days like these go on for years. It\u2019s the ones you want to last that slip away\u2014one, two, three\u2014in seconds.</p><p>The watermark from where the vase smashed into the wall is still there. So are the piles of books, magazines, CDs, and precarious towers of vinyl records. The picture windows, which she never bothers to cover, even at night, are wide open, letting in the endless, endless daytime.</p><p>C\u00e9line gives me a glass of water, and at last I take the painkillers Dr. Robinet gave me before I left the hospital. He advised me to take them before the pain came on, and to keep taking them until it subsided. But I was afraid taking them earlier would dull whatever wits I had left about me.</p><p>The instructions on the bottle say one pill every six hours. I take three.</p><p>\u201cLift up your hands,\u201d C\u00e9line instructs. And it\u2019s like yesterday, when she was making me change my clothes and Lulu walked in on us, and I\u2019d thought it cute that she tried to hide her jealousy. And then Modou had kissed her and I\u2019d had to hide mine.</p><p>I can\u2019t lift my arms over my head, so C\u00e9line helps me off with the hospital scrubs. She stares at my chest a long time. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She clucks her tongue. \u201cShe should not have left you like this.\u201d</p><p>I start to explain that she didn\u2019t leave me like this, not knowingly. C\u00e9line dismisses me with a wave of her hands. \u201cNo matter. You are here now. Go into the bathroom and clean yourself up. I will cook something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not laugh.

I hear it running and think of rain, which has stopped. I feel the drugs starting to work, the soft tentacles of sleep slowly tugging me under. C\u00e9line\u2019s bed is like a throne and I collapse onto it, thinking of my airplane dream earlier today and how it felt slightly different from the usual nightmare. Right before I fall asleep, one of my lines\u2014Sebastian\u2019s lines\u2014from Twelfth Night pops into my head: \u201cIf it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!\u201d</p><p>At first, I think I\u2019m dreaming again. Not the airplane dream, a different one, a good one. A hand trailing up and down my back, slipping lower, lower. She kept her hand on my heart. All morning as we slept on that hard floor. This hand tickles toward my waist and then goes lower. Bruised, not broken, the doctor said. In my sleep, I feel my strength returning.</p><p>My own hand finds her warm body, so soft, so inviting. I slip my hand between her legs. She groans.</p><p>\u201cJe savais que tu reviendrais.\u201d</p><p>And then it\u2019s the nightmare all over again. Wrong place. Wrong person. Wrong plane. I jolt up in bed, push her away so hard she tumbles to the floor.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I shout at C\u00e9line.</p><p>She stands up, unapologetically naked in glow of the streetlight. \u201cYou are in my bed,\u201d she points out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be taking care of me,\u201d I say. This sounds all the more pathetic because we both know I don\u2019t want her to.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was,\u201d she says, attempting a smile. She sits down on the edge of the bed, pats the sheet next to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything but lie back and relax.\u201d</p><p>I am wearing nothing but my boxers. When did I take off my jeans? I see them folded neatly on the floor, along with the shirt from the hospital. I reach for the shirt. My muscles protest. I stand up. They howl.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d C\u00e9line asks.</p> <p>\u201cLeaving,\u201d I say, panting with the exertion. I\u2019m not entirely sure I can get out of here, but I know I cannot stay.</p><p>\u201cNow? It is late.\u201d She looks incredulous. Until I step in my jeans. It is a painstakingly slow process, and it gives her time to digest the fact that I am, in fact, going. I can see what will happen: the reprise of the last time I was here. A stream of cursing, in French. I am a prick. I have humiliated her.</p><p>\u201cI offered you my bed, me, and you push me out. Literally.\u201d She is laughing, not because it\u2019s funny but because it\u2019s inconceivable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came to me. Yesterday. Again today. You always come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only for a place to leave the suitcase,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt was for Lulu.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face is different from what it was last time, when she threw the vase at me, after I told her it was time for me to go. That was fury. This is fury before it\u2019s had time to set, raw and bloody. How foolish it was to visit C\u00e9line. We could\u2019ve found another place for that suitcase.</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d C\u00e9line yells. \u201cHer? She was just some girl. Nothing special! And look at you now! She left you like this. I am always the one you come running to, Willem. That means something.\u201d</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t taken C\u00e9line for one of the ones who wait. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come here. I won\u2019t do it again,\u201d I promise. I gather the rest of my things and hobble out of her flat, down the stairs to the street.</p><p>A police car flies by, its lights flashing through the finally dark streets, its siren whining: nyeah-nyeah, nyeah-nyeah.</p><p>Paris.</p><p>Not home.</p><p>I need to get home.</p><p>Five</p><p>SEPTEMBER</p><p>Amsterdam</p><p>Marjolein\u2019s office is in a narrow canal house off of the Brouwersgracht, the inside of it all white and modern. Bram designed it, calling it one of his \u201cvanity projects.\u201d But there was nothing vain about Bram; that was just his code for not getting paid.</p><p>Bram\u2019s day job was designing temporary crisis shelters for refugees, something he believed in but that didn\u2019t challenge his creative side. So he was always on the lookout for ways to exercise his modern sensibilities\u2014like transforming a tired transport barge into a three-story glass, wood, and steel floating palace that was once described as \u201cBauhaus on the Gracht\u201d in a design journal.</p><p>Sara, Marjolein\u2019s assistant, sits behind a clear Lucite table, a vase of white roses on the desk. When I come in, she gives me a nervous smile and slowly rises to take my coat. I lean in to kiss her hello. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d I apologize.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re three weeks late, Willem,\u201d she says, as she ushers me in, accepting a kiss but not eye contact.</p><p>I give my best rogue\u2019s grin, even though it pulls at the now-itchy wound on my cheek. \u201cBut worth waiting for?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. It was more than two years ago that Sara and I had our moment. I was spending a lot of time in this office then, and she was there, our family attorney\u2019s assistant. When it had first happened, I\u2019d been besotted, Sara the older woman with the doleful eyes and the blue-painted bed. But it didn\u2019t last. It never does.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I was only a few days late,\u201d I tell her now. \u201cMarjolein\u2019s the one who delayed us by two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she went on holiday,\u201d Sara says, strangely huffy. \u201cWhich she had purposely booked for after the closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem.\u201d Marjolein towers in the doorway, naturally tall, and taller yet in the stiletto heels she always wears. She beckons me into her office where Bram\u2019s modern sensibility is everywhere. The messy papers and folders in precarious piles are Marjolein\u2019s contributions.</p><p>\u201cSo you threw me over for a girl,\u201d Marjolein says, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>I wonder how it is that Marjolein can possibly know this. She stares at me, clearly amused by something. \u201cI called back, you know?\u201d</p><p>On the train from London to Paris, I\u2019d tried to text Marjolein about my delay, but my phone wouldn\u2019t get a signal and was about to die anyway, and for some reason, I didn\u2019t want to tell Lulu about any of it. So when I\u2019d seen one of the Belgian backpacker girls in the caf\u00e9, I\u2019d borrowed her phone. I\u2019d had to fumble in my backpack for Marjolein\u2019s number in my address book and had wound up spilling coffee all over me and the Belgian girl.</p><p>\u201cShe sounded pretty,\u201d Marjolein says, with a grin that is both mischievous and scolding at the same time.</p><p>\u201cShe was,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThey always are,\u201d Marjolein says. \u201cWell, come give us a kiss.\u201d I step forward to be kissed but before I do, she stops me. \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>One upside to our meeting being postponed is that it\u2019s given the bruises time to fade. The sutures have dissolved, too. All that\u2019s left now of that day is a thick raised welt that I\u2019d hoped would go unnoticed.</p><p>When I don\u2019t answer, Marjolein does. \u201cTangled with the wrong girl, eh? One with an angry boyfriend?\u201d She gestures to the reception area. \u201cSpeaking of, Sara has a nice Italian bloke, so lay off. She moped for months after you left last time. I almost had to fire her.\u201d</p><p>I hold up my hands and feign innocence.</p><p>Marjolein rolls her eyes. \u201cWas that really because of a girl?\u201d She points to my cheek.</p><p>Put that way, the story skirts a little close to the truth. \u201cBicycle. Beer. Dangerous combination.\u201d I cheerfully mime falling off a bike.</p><p>\u201cMy God. Have you been gone so long you\u2019ve forgotten how to drink and ride a bike?\u201d she asks. \u201cHow can you even call yourself Dutch anymore? We got you back just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it appears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome. Let me get you a coffee. And I have some excellent chocolate hiding around here somewhere. And then we\u2019ll sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>She calls to Sara, who brings in two demitasses of coffee. Marjolein rifles around in her drawers until she pulls out a box of hard, chewy chocolates. I take one and let it melt on my tongue.</p><p>She starts explaining what I\u2019m signing, though it doesn\u2019t matter because my signature is only required due to some bureaucratic formality. Yael never took Dutch citizenship, and Bram, who used to say, \u201cGod is in the details,\u201d when it came to the meticulousness of his designs, apparently held the opposite view when it came to his personal affairs.</p><p>All of which means my presence is necessary to finalize the sale and set up the various trusts. Marjolein prattles on as I sign and sign and sign again. Apparently Yael\u2019s not being Dutch, and no longer residing here or in Israel either, but floating around like some stateless refugee, is actually a big tax boon for her. She sold the boat for seven hundred and seventeen thousand euros, Marjolein explains. A chunk goes to the government, but a much larger sum goes to us. By the end of business day tomorrow, one hundred thousand euros will be deposited into my bank account.</p><p>As I sign, Marjolein keeps looking at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just I forgot how much you look like him.\u201d</p><p>I pause, the pen poised over another line of legalese. Bram always used to say that though Yael was the strongest woman in the world, somehow his mild mannered genes clobbered her dark Israeli stock.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Marjolein says, back to business. \u201cWhere have you been staying since you got back? With Daniel?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Daniel? I haven\u2019t seen him since the funeral, and before that only a handful of times. He lives overseas and rents out his flat. Why would I stay there?</p><p>No, since I\u2019ve been back it\u2019s almost been like I am still on the traveler circuit. I\u2019ve stuck to the tight radius around the train station, near the budget youth hostels and the disappearing red-light district. Partly this was a matter of necessity. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d have enough money to last the few weeks, but somehow, my bank account hasn\u2019t hit zero. I could\u2019ve gone to stay with old family friends, but I don\u2019t want anyone to know I\u2019m back; I don\u2019t want to revisit any of those places. I certainly haven\u2019t gone anywhere near Nieuwe Prinsengracht.</p><p>\u201cWith a friend,\u201d I say vaguely.</p><p>Marjolein misreads it. \u201cOh, with a friend. I see.\u201d</p><p>I give a half-guilty smile. Leaving people to jumped conclusions is sometimes simpler than explaining a complicated truth.</p><p>\u201cBe sure this friend doesn\u2019t have an angry boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I say.</p><p>I finish signing the papers. \u201cThat\u2019s that then,\u201d she says. She opens her desk and pulls out a manila folder. \u201cHere\u2019s some mail. I\u2019ve arranged for anything that goes to the boat to be forwarded here until you give me a new address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Marjolein opens a cabinet and pulls out a bottle of Scotch and two shot glasses. \u201cYou just became a man of means. This deserves a drink.\u201d</p><p>Bram used to joke that as far as Marjolein was concerned, every time the minute hand of the clock passed twelve, it was cause for a drink. But I accept the shot glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we toast?\u201d she asks. \u201cTo new ventures? A new future.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cLet\u2019s drink to the accidents.\u201d</p><p>I see the shock in her face, and I realize belatedly that this sounds like I\u2019m talking about what happened to Bram, though that wasn\u2019t so much an accident as a freak occurrence.</p><p>But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about our accident. The one that created our family. Surely Marjolein must\u2019ve heard the story. Bram loved to tell it. It was like a family origin myth, fairy tale, and lullaby all wrapped together:</p><p>Bram and Daniel, driving through Israel in a Fiat that broke down constantly. It was broken down one day outside of the seaside town of Netanya and Bram was trying to fix it, when a soldier, rifle slung over the shoulder, cigarette dangling, ambled over. \u201cScariest sight you could ever imagine,\u201d Bram would say, smiling at the memory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yael. Hitching her way back to her army base in Galilee after a weekend\u2019s leave spent in Netanya, at a friend\u2019s house, or maybe a guy\u2019s, anywhere but at the apartment she\u2019d grown up in with Saba. The brothers were driving to Safed, and after she reconnected their radiator hose, they offered her a ride. Bram gallantly offered her the front seat; after all, she\u2019d fixed the car. But Yael, seeing the cramped backseat said, \u201cWhoever\u2019s shortest should sit in back.\u201d She claimed to have meant herself, and to not have known which brother was taller, because Daniel had been in the passenger seat, rolling a joint with the Lebanese hash he\u2019d bought off a surfer in Netanya.</p><p>But Bram had misunderstood, and so after a needless measuring decided Bram was taller by about three centimeters, Daniel took the back.</p><p>They drove the soldier back to her base. Before they parted ways, Bram gave her his address in Amsterdam.</p><p>A year and a half later, Yael finished her military service and, determined to put as much distance as she could between herself and everything she grew up with, took what little money she\u2019d saved and began hitching her way north. She lasted four months and got all the way to Amsterdam before she ran out of money. So she knocked on a door. Bram opened it, and even though he hadn\u2019t seen her in all that time, and even though he didn\u2019t know why she was there, and even though it wasn\u2019t really his way, he surprised himself and he kissed her. \u201cLike I\u2019d been expecting her all that time,\u201d he\u2019d say in a voice full of wonder.</p> <p>\u201cSee how funny life is,\u201d Bram used to say as the epilogue to their epic love story. \u201cIf the car hadn\u2019t broken down just there, or if she\u2019d run out of money in Copenhagen, or if Daniel were the taller one, none of this might ever have happened.\u201d</p><p>But I knew what he was really saying was: Accidents. It\u2019s all about the accidents.</p><p>Six</p><p>Two days later, one hundred thousand euros appears in my bank account, as if by magic. But of course, it\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s been a long time since I was kicked off my economics course, but I\u2019ve since come to understand that the universe operates on the same general equilibrium theory as markets. It never gives you something without making you pay for it somehow.</p><p>I buy a beat-up bike off a junkie and another change of clothes from the flea market. I may have money now, but I\u2019ve grown used to living simply, to owning only what I can carry. And besides, I\u2019m not staying long, so I may as well leave as few fingerprints as possible.</p> <p>I wander up and down the Damrak looking at travel agencies, trying to decide where to go next: Palau. Tonga. Brazil. Once the options increase, settling on one becomes harder. Maybe I\u2019ll track down Uncle Daniel in Bangkok, or is it Bali now?</p><p>At one of the student agencies, a dark-haired girl behind the desk sees me peering at the ads. She catches my eye, smiles, and gestures for me to come inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d she asks in slightly accented Dutch. She sounds Eastern, maybe Romanian.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere that isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you be more specific?\u201d she says, laughing a little.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere warm, cheap, and far away.\u201d Somewhere that with one hundred thousand euros, I can stay lost as long as I want to, I think.</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cThat describes about half the world. Let\u2019s narrow it down. Do you want beaches? There are some fantastic spots in Micronesia. Thailand is still quite cheap. If you\u2019re into a more chaotic cultural affair, India is fascinating.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Zealand? Australia? People are raving about Malawi in Central Africa. I\u2019m hearing great things about Panama and Honduras, though they had that coup there. How long do you want to go for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, then you might look into a round-the-world ticket. We have a few on special.\u201d She types away on her computer. \u201cHere\u2019s one: Amsterdam, Nairobi, Dubai, Delhi, Singapore, Sydney, Los Angeles, Amsterdam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have one that doesn\u2019t stop in Delhi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want India, huh?\u201d</p><p>I just smile.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. So what part of the world do you want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Anywhere will work, really, so long as it\u2019s warm, cheap, and far away. And not India. Why don\u2019t you pick for me?\u201d</p><p>She laughs, like it\u2019s a joke. But I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve been stuck in a kind of sluggish inertia since coming back, spending whole days in sad hostel beds waiting for my meeting with Marjolein. Whole days, lots of empty hours, holding a broken-but-still-ticking watch, wondering useless things about the girl whom it belongs to. It\u2019s all doing a bit of a number on my head. All the more reason for me to get back on the road.</p><p>She taps her fingers against her keyboard. \u201cYou have to help me out. For starters, where have you already been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I push my battered passport across the desk. \u201cThis has my history.\u201d</p><p>She opens it. \u201cOh it does, does it?\u201d she says. Her voice has changed, from friendly to coy. She flips through the pages. \u201cYou get around, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t want to do this dance, not right now. I just want to buy my airplane ticket and go. Once I\u2019m out of here, away from Europe, somewhere warm and far, I\u2019ll get back to my old self.</p><p>She shrugs and returns to leafing through my passport. \u201cUh-oh. You know what? I can\u2019t book you anywhere yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour passport\u2019s about to expire.\u201d She closes the passport and slides it back. \u201cDo you have an identity card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt got stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you file a report?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Never did call the French police.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. You need a passport for most of these places anyhow. You just have to get it renewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will that take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long. A few weeks. Go to City Hall for the forms.\u201d She rattles off some of the other paperwork I\u2019ll need, none of which I have here.</p><p>Suddenly I feel stuck, and I\u2019m not sure how that happened. After managing for two entire years not to set foot in Holland? After going to some absurd lengths to bypass this small-but-central landmass\u2014for instance convincing Tor, Guerrilla Will\u2019s dictatorial director, to forgo performing in Amsterdam and to hit Stockholm instead, with some half-baked story about the Swedes being the most Shakespeare-loving people in Europe outside the UK?</p><p>But then last spring Marjolein had finally cleared up Bram\u2019s messy estate and the deed of the houseboat transferred to Yael. Who celebrated by immediately putting the home he\u2019d built for her up for sale. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, not at that point.</p><p>Still, to ask me to come and sign the papers? That took gall. Chutzpah, Saba would call it. I understood for Yael it was a matter of practicality. I was a train ride, she was a plane ride. It would only be a few days for me, a minor inconvenience.</p><p>Except I delayed for one day. And somehow, that\u2019s changed everything.</p><p>Seven</p><p>OCTOBER</p><p>Utrecht</p><p>It occurs to me, belatedly, that maybe I should\u2019ve called. Maybe last month, when I first got back. Certainly before now, before showing up at his house. But I didn\u2019t. And now it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m just here. Hoping to make this as painless as possible.</p><p>At the house on Bloemstraat, someone has swapped out the old doorbell for one in the shape of an eyeball that stares reproachfully. This feels like a bad omen. Our correspondence, always irregular, has been nonexistent in the last few months. I can\u2019t remember the last time I emailed or texted him. Three months ago? Six months? It occurs to me, also belatedly, that he might not even live here anymore.</p><p>Except, somehow, I know he does. Because Broodje wouldn\u2019t have left without telling me. He wouldn\u2019t have done that.</p><p>Broodje and I met when we were eight. I caught him spying on our boat with a pair of binoculars. When I asked what he was doing, he explained that he wasn\u2019t spying on us. There\u2019d been a rash of break-ins in our neighborhood, and his parents had been talking about leaving Amsterdam for somewhere safer. He preferred to stay put in his family\u2019s flat, so it was up to him to find the culprits. \u201cThat\u2019s very serious,\u201d I\u2019d told him. \u201cYes, it is,\u201d he\u2019d replied. \u201cBut I have this.\u201d Out of his bike basket he\u2019d pulled the rest of his spy kit: decoder scope, noise-enhancing ear buds, night-vision goggles, which he\u2019d let me try on. \u201cIf you need help finding the bad guys, I can be your partner,\u201d I\u2019d offered. There were not many children in our neighborhood on the eastern edge of Amsterdam\u2019s center, no children at all on the adjacent houseboats on the Nieuwe Prinsengracht where our boat was moored, and I had no siblings. I spent much of my time kicking balls off the pier against the hull of the boat, losing most of them to the murky waters of the canals.</p><p>Broodje accepted my help, and we became partners. We spent hours casing the neighborhood, taking pictures of suspicious-looking people and vehicles, cracking the case. Until an old man saw us, and, thinking we were working with the criminals, called the police on us. The police found us crouched next to my neighbor\u2019s pier, looking through the binoculars at a suspicious van that seemed to appear regularly (because, we later found out, it belonged to the bakery around the corner). We were questioned and we both started crying, thinking we were going to jail. We stammered our explanations and crime-fighting strategies. The police listened, trying hard not to laugh, before taking us home and explaining everything to Broodje\u2019s parents. Before they left, one of the detectives gave each of us a card, winked, and said to call with any tips.</p><p>I threw away my card, but Broodje kept his. For years. I spotted it when we were twelve, tacked to the bulletin board in his bedroom in the suburbs where he wound up moving after all. \u201cYou still have this?\u201d I\u2019d asked him. He\u2019d moved two years before and we didn\u2019t see each other frequently. Broodje had looked at the card, and then looked at me. \u201cDon\u2019t you know, Willy?\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cI keep things.\u201d</p><p>A lanky guy in a PSV soccer jersey, his hair stiff with gel, opens the door. I feel my stomach plummet, because Broodje used to live here with two girls, both of whom he was constantly, and unsuccessfully, trying to sleep with, and a skinny guy named Ivo. But then the guy eyes spark open with recognition and I realize it\u2019s Henk, one of Broodje\u2019s friends from the University of Utrecht. \u201cIs that you, Willem?\u201d he asks, and before I can answer he\u2019s calling into the house, \u201cBroodje, Willem\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>I hear scrambling and the creak of the scuffed wood floorboards and then there he is, a head shorter and a shoulder wider than me, a disparity that used to prompt the old man on the houseboat next to ours to call us Spaghetti and Meatball, a moniker Broodje quite liked, because wasn\u2019t a meatball so much tastier than a noodle?</p><p>\u201cWilly?\u201d Broodje pauses for a half second before he launches himself at me. \u201cWilly! I thought you were dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack from the dead,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His eyes are so round and so blue, like shiny coins. \u201cWhen did you get back? How long are you here for? Are you hungry? I wish you\u2019d told me you were coming, I would\u2019ve made something. Well I can pull together a nice borrelhapje. Come in. Henk, look, Willy\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d Henk says, nodding.</p><p>\u201cW,\u201d Broodje calls. \u201cWilly\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>I walk into the lounge. Before, it was relatively neat, with feminine touches around like flower-scented candles that Broodje used to pretend to dislike but would light even when the girls weren\u2019t home. Now, it smells of stale socks, old coffee, and spilled beer, and the only remnant of the girls is an old Picasso poster, askew in its frame above the mantel. \u201cWhat happened to the girls?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Broodje grins. \u201cLeave it to Willy to ask about the girls first.\u201d He laughs. \u201cThey moved into their own flat last year, and Henk and W moved in. Ivo just left to do a course in Estonia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatvia,\u201d Wouter, or W, corrects, coming down the stairs. He\u2019s even taller than me, with short, unintentionally spiky hair and an Adam\u2019s apple as big as a doorknob.</p><p>\u201cLatvia,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d W asks. W never was one for social pleasantries.</p> <p>I touch the scar. \u201cI fell off my bike,\u201d I say. The lie I told Marjolein comes out automatically. I\u2019m not sure why, except for a desire to put as much distance as possible between myself and that day.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d W asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Willy,\u201d Broodje says, panting and pawing like a puppy. \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit ago,\u201d I say, treading water between hurtful truth and balls-out lies. \u201cI had to deal with some things in Amsterdam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering where you were,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cI tried calling you a while back but got a strange recording, and you\u2019re shit about email.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I lost my phone and all my contacts, and some Irish guy gave me his, including his SIM card. I thought I texted you the new number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you did. Anyhow, come in. Let me go see what I have to eat.\u201d He turns right into the galley kitchen. I hear drawers opening and closing.</p><p>Five minutes later Broodje returns with a tray of food and beers for all of us. \u201cSo tell us everything. The glamorous life of a roving actor. Is it a girl every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Broodje, let the guy sit down,\u201d Henk says.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I live vicariously through him; it was like having a movie star in the house having him around. And, it\u2019s been a little dry these past few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by past few years, you mean twenty?\u201d W says drolly.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been in Amsterdam?\u201d Broodje asks. \u201cHow is your ma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cShe\u2019s in India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d Broodje asks. \u201cOr there and back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. This whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I was in the old neighborhood recently and the boat was all lit up and there was furniture inside, so I thought she might be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, they must\u2019ve put furniture in there to make it look lived in, but it\u2019s not. Not by us, anyhow,\u201d I say, rolling up a piece of cervelaat and shoving it in my mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s been sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sold Bram\u2019s boat?\u201d Broodje says incredulously.</p><p>\u201cMy mother sold it,\u201d I clarify.</p> <p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve made a boatload,\u201d Henk jokes.</p><p>I pause for a second, somehow unable to tell them that I did, too. Then W starts talking about a piece he read in De Volkskrant recently about Europeans paying top dollar for the old houseboats in Amsterdam, for the mooring rights, which are as valuable as the boats themselves.</p><p>\u201cNot this boat. You should\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cHis father was an architect, so it was beautiful, three floors, balconies, glass everywhere.\u201d He looks wistful. \u201cWhat did that magazine call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBauhaus on the Gracht.\u201d A photographer had come and taken pictures of the boat, and us on it. When the magazine had come out, most of the shots had been of just the boat, but there had been one of Yael and Bram, framed by the picture window, the trees and canal reflecting like a mirror behind them. I\u2019d been in the original of that shot but had been cropped out. Bram explained that they\u2019d used this one because of the window and the reflection; it was a representation of the design, not our family. But I\u2019d thought it had been a fairly accurate depiction of our family, too.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she sold it,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>Some days I can\u2019t believe it and other days I can absolutely believe it. Yael is the sort to chew off her own hand if she needs to escape. She\u2019d done it before.</p><p>The boys are all looking at me now, their faces blanking out with a kind of concern that I\u2019m unaccustomed to after two years of anonymity.</p><p>\u201cSo, Holland-Turkey tonight,\u201d I begin.</p><p>The guys look at me for a moment. Then nod.</p><p>\u201cI hope things go better for us,\u201d I say. \u201cAfter the sad offerings during Euro Cup, I don\u2019t know if I can take it. Sneijder . . .\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>Henk takes the bait first. \u201cAre you kidding? Sneijder was the only striker who proved his mettle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Broodje interrupts. \u201cVan Persie scored that beautiful goal against Germany.\u201d</p><p>Then W jumps in with math talk, something about regression toward the mean guaranteeing improvement after the last lousy year, and now there\u2019s nowhere to go but up, and I relax. There\u2019s a universal language of small talk. On the road, it\u2019s about travel: some unknown island, or a cheap hostel, a restaurant with a good fixed-price menu. With these guys, it\u2019s soccer.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna watch the game with us, Willy?\u201d Broodje asks. \u201cWe were going to O\u2019Leary\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t come to Utrecht for small talk or for soccer or for friendship. I came for paperwork. A quick visit to University College for some papers to get my passport. Once I get that, I\u2019ll go back to the travel agent, maybe ask her for a drink this time, and figure out where to go. Buy my ticket. Maybe take a trip to The Hague to pick up some visas, a visit to the travel clinic for some shots. A trip to the flea market for new clothes. A train to the airport. A thorough body search by immigration officials, because a lone man with a one-way ticket is always an object of suspicion. A long flight. Jetlag. Immigration. Customs. And then finally, that first step into a new place, that moment of exhilaration and disorientation, each feeding the other. That moment when anything can happen.</p><p>I have only one thing to do in Utrecht, but suddenly the rest of the things I\u2019ll need to accomplish to get myself out of here feels endless. Stranger yet, nothing about it excites me. Not even arriving somewhere new, which used to make all the hassle worthwhile. It all just seems exhausting. I can\u2019t summon the energy for the slog it\u2019ll take me to get out of here.</p><p>But O\u2019Leary\u2019s? O\u2019Leary\u2019s is right around the corner, not even a block away. That I can manage.</p><p>Eight</p><p>October turns cold and wet, as if we used up our quota of clear, hot days during the summer\u2019s heat wave. It\u2019s especially cold in my attic room on Bloemstraat, making me wonder if moving in had been the right call. Not that it had been a call. After I woke up on the downstairs sofa for the third morning in a row, having accomplished little during my days in Utrecht, Broodje had suggested I move into the attic room.</p><p>The offer was wasn\u2019t so much enticing as a fait accompli. I was already living here. Sometimes the wind blows you places you weren\u2019t expecting; sometimes it blows you away from those places, too.</p><p>The attic room is drafty, with windows that rattle in the wind. In the morning, I see my breath. Staying warm becomes my main vocation. On the road, I often spent whole days in libraries. You could always find magazines or books, and respite from the weather or whatever else needed escaping.</p><p>The Central University library offers all the same comforts: big sunny windows, comfortable couches, and a bank of computers I can use to browse the Internet. The last is a mixed blessing. On the road, my fellow travelers were obsessive about keeping up with email. I was the opposite. I hated checking in. I still do.</p><p>Yael\u2019s emails come like clockwork, once every two weeks. I think she must have it on her calendar, along with all the other chores. The notes never say much, which makes answering them next to impossible.</p><p>One came yesterday, a bit of fluff about taking a day off to go to a pilgrim festival in some village. She never tells me what she\u2019s taking a day off from, never elaborates about her actual work there, her day-to-day life, which is a bleary mystery, the contours filled in only by offhanded remarks from Marjolein. No, Yael\u2019s emails to me are all in a sort of postcard language. The perfect small talk, saying little, revealing less.</p><p>\u201cHoi Ma,\u201d I begin my reply. And then I stare at screen and try to think of what to say. I\u2019m so conversant in every kind of small talk, but I find myself at a loss for words when it comes to my mother. When I was traveling, it was simpler because I could just send a sort of postcard. In Romania now at one of the Black Sea resorts, but it\u2019s off season and quiet. Watched the fishermen for hours. Although even those had addendums in my mind. How watching the fishermen one blustery morning reminded me of our family trip to Croatia when I was ten. Or was it eleven? Yael slept late, but Bram and I woke early to go down to the docks to buy the day\u2019s catches from the just-returning fisherman, who all smelled of salt and vodka. But following Yael\u2019s lead, I excise those bits of nostalgia from my missives.</p><p>\u201cHoi Ma.\u201d The cursor blinks like a reprimand and I can\u2019t get past it, can\u2019t think of what to say. I toggle back to my inbox, scrolling backward in time. The last few years and their occasional notes from Broodje, and the notes from people I met on the road\u2014vague promises to meet up in Tangiers, in Belfast, in Barcelona, in Riga\u2014plans that rarely materialized. Before that, there\u2019s the flurry of emails from various professors on the economics faculty, warning me that unless I appealed \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d I was in danger of not being asked back next year. (I didn\u2019t, and I wasn\u2019t.) Before that, condolence emails, some of them still unopened, and before that, notes from Bram, mostly silly things he liked to forward to me, a restaurant review of a place he wanted to try out, a photo of a particularly monstrous piece of architecture, an invitation to help on his latest fix-it project. I scroll back now four years and there are the emails from Saba, who, in the two years between discovering email and getting too sick to use it, had delighted in this instant form of communication, where you could write pages and pages and it didn\u2019t cost any more to send.</p><p>I return to the note to Yael. \u201cHoi Ma, I\u2019m back in Utrecht now, hanging out with Robert-Jan and the boys. Nothing much to report. It\u2019s pissing down rain every day; no sign of the sun for a week now. You\u2019re glad not to be here for it. I know how you hate the gray. Talk soon. Willem.\u201d</p><p>Postcard Language, the smallest of small talk.</p><p>Nine</p><p>The boys and I are going to a movie, along with W\u2019s new girlfriend. Some Jan de Bont thriller at the Louis Hartlooper. I haven\u2019t liked a de Bont film since\u2014I can\u2019t even remember\u2014but I\u2019ve been outvoted because W has a girlfriend, and this is a big thing, and if she wants explosions, we will watch explosions.</p><p>The theater complex is packed, people spilling out the front doors. We fight our way through the crowds to the box office. And that\u2019s when I see her: Lulu.</p><p>Not my Lulu. But the Lulu I named her for. Louise Brooks. The theater has lots of old movie posters in the lobby, but I\u2019ve never seen this one, which isn\u2019t on the wall but is propped up on an easel. It\u2019s a still shot from Pandora\u2019s Box, Lulu, pouring a drink, her eyebrow raised in amusement and challenge.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d I look up. Behind me is Lien, W\u2019s punked-out math major girlfriend. No one can quite get over how he did it, but apparently they fell in love over numbers theory.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree.</p><p>I look closer at the poster. It is advertising a Louise Brooks film retrospective. Pandora\u2019s Box is on tonight.</p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d Lien asks.</p><p>\u201cLouise Brooks,\u201d Saba had said. \u201cLook at those eyes, so much delight, you know there\u2019s sadness to hide.\u201d I was thirteen, and Saba, who hated Amsterdam\u2019s mercurial wet summers, had just discovered the revival cinemas. That summer was particularly dreary, and Saba had introduced me to all the silent film stars: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Rudolph Valentino, Pola Negri, Greta Garbo, and his favorite, Louise Brooks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSilent film star,\u201d I tell Lien. \u201cThere\u2019s a festival on. Unfortunately it\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could see that instead,\u201d she says. I can\u2019t tell if her tone is sarcastic; she\u2019s as dry as W is. But when I get to the front of the line to buy the tickets, I find myself asking for five to Pandora\u2019s Box.</p><p>At first, the boys are amused. They think I\u2019m joking, until I point to the poster and explain about the retrospective. Then they are not so amused.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a live piano player,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cIs that supposed to make us feel better?\u201d Henk asks.</p><p>\u201cNo way I\u2019m seeing this,\u201d W adds.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I wanted to see it?\u201d Lien interjects.</p><p>I offer her a silent thank-you and she gives me a perplexed eyebrow raise in return, showing off her piercing. W acquiesces and the rest follow suit.</p><p>Upstairs, we take our seats. In the quiet, you can hear the explosions from the adjacent theater and I can see Henk\u2019s eyes go wistful.</p> <p>The lights go down and the piano player starts in with the overture and Lulu\u2019s face fills the screen. The movie starts, all scratchy and black and white; you can almost hear it crackle like an old LP. But there is nothing old about Lulu. She\u2019s timeless, flirting gaily in the nightclub, being caught with her lover, shooting her husband on their wedding night.</p><p>It\u2019s strange because I\u2019ve seen this film before, a few times. I know exactly how it ends, but as it goes on, a tension starts to build, a suspense, churning uncomfortably in my gut. It takes a certain kind of naivet\u00e9, or perhaps just stupidity, to know how things will end and still hope otherwise.</p><p>Fidgety, I shove my hands into my pockets. Though I try not to, my mind keeps going to the other Lulu on that hot August night. I tossed her the coin, as I\u2019d done to so many other girls. But unlike the other girls who always came back\u2014lingering by our makeshift stage to return my very valuable worthless coin and to see what it might buy\u2014Lulu didn\u2019t.</p><p>That should\u2019ve been my first sign that the girl could see through my acts. But all I\u2019d thought was: Not to be. It was just as well. I had an early train to catch the next day, and a big, shitty day after that, and I never slept well with strangers.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t slept well anyhow, and I\u2019d been up early, so I\u2019d caught an earlier train down to London. And there she was, on that train. It was the third time in twenty-four hours that I\u2019d seen her and when I walked into that train\u2019s caf\u00e9 car, I remember feeling a jolt. As if the universe was saying: pay attention.</p><p>So I\u2019d paid attention. I\u2019d stopped and we\u2019d chatted, but then we were in London and about to go our separate ways. By that point, the knot of dread that had been building in me since Yael\u2019s request that I return to Holland to sign away my home had solidified into a fist. The banter with Lulu on the way down to London had made it unravel, somehow. But I knew that once I got on that next train to Amsterdam, it would grow, it would take over my insides, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat or do anything except nervously roll a coin along my knuckles and focus on the next next\u2014the next train or plane I\u2019d be boarding. The next departure.</p> <p>But then Lulu started talking about wanting to go to Paris, and I had all this money from the summer\u2019s worth of Guerrilla Will, cash I wouldn\u2019t be needing much longer. And in that train station in London, I\u2019d thought, okay, maybe this was the meant to be: The universe, I knew, loved nothing more than balance, and here was a girl who wanted to go to Paris and here was me who wanted to go anywhere but back to Amsterdam. As soon as I\u2019d suggested we go to Paris together, balance was restored. The dread in my gut disappeared. On the train to Paris, I was as hungry as ever.</p><p>On screen, Lulu is crying. I imagine my Lulu waking up the next day, finding me gone, reading a note that promised a quick return that never materialized. I wonder, as I have so many times, how long it took her to think the worst of me when she already had thought the worst of me. On the train from London to Paris, she\u2019d started laughing uncontrollably, because she\u2019d thought I\u2019d left her there. I\u2019d made a joke of it; and of course, it wasn\u2019t true. I wasn\u2019t planning that. But it had got to me because it was my first warning that somehow, this girl saw me in a way I hadn\u2019t intended to be seen.</p><p>As the movie goes on, desire and longing and regret and second-guessing of everything about that day start building in me. It\u2019s all pointless, but somehow knowing that only makes it worse, and it builds and builds and has nowhere to go. I shove my hands deeper into my pockets and punch a hole right through.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d I say, louder than I mean to.</p><p>Lien looks at me, but I pretend to be absorbed in the movie. The piano player is building to a crescendo as Lulu flirts with Jack the Ripper and, lonely and defeated, invites him up to her room. She thinks she has found someone to love, and he thinks that he has found someone to love, and then he sees the knife, and you know what will happen. He\u2019ll just revert to his old ways. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she thinks of me, and maybe she\u2019s right to think it. The film ends with a frenzied flourish of the piano. And then there\u2019s silence.</p><p>The boys sit there for a minute and then all start talking at once. \u201cThat\u2019s it? So he killed her?\u201d Broodje asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jack the Ripper and he had a knife,\u201d Lien responds. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t carving her a Christmas turkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a way to go. I\u2019ll give you one thing, it wasn\u2019t boring,\u201d Henk says. \u201cWillem? Hey, Willem, are you there?\u201d</p> <p>I startle up. \u201cYeah. What?\u201d</p><p>The four of them all look at me for what feels like a while. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Lien asks at last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m great!\u201d I smile. It feels unnatural I can almost feel the scar on my face tug like a rubber band. \u201cLet\u2019s go get a drink.\u201d</p><p>We all make our way to the crowded caf\u00e9 downstairs. I order a round of beers and then a round of jenever for good measure. The boys give me a look, though if it\u2019s for the booze or for paying for it all, I don\u2019t know. They know about my inheritance now, but they still expect the same frugality from me as always.</p><p>I drain my shot and then my beer.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d W says, passing me his shot. \u201cNo kopstoot for me.\u201d</p><p>I knock his shot back, too.</p><p>They\u2019re quiet as they look at me. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Broodje asks, strangely hesitant.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d The jenever is doing its job, heating me up and burning away the memories that came alive in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYour father died. Your mother left for India,\u201d W says bluntly. \u201cAlso, your grandfather died.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of awkward silence. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten all about that.\u201d I mean it to come out as a joke, but it just comes out as bitter as the booze that\u2019s burning its way back up my throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t mind him,\u201d Lien says, tweaking his ear affectionately. \u201cHe\u2019s working on human emotions like sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s sympathy,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s just you haven\u2019t really seemed yourself since . . .\u201d Broodje trails off.</p><p>\u201cYou spend a lot of time alone,\u201d Henk blurts.</p><p>\u201cAlone? I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>There\u2019s another moment of silence. I\u2019m not quite sure what I\u2019m being accused of. Then Lien illuminates.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, you always had a girl around, and now the guys are worried because you\u2019re always alone,\u201d Lien says. She looks at the boys. \u201cDo I have that right?\u201d</p><p>Kind of sort of yeah, they all mumble.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been discussing this?\u201d This should be funny, except it\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cWe think you\u2019re depressed because you\u2019re not having sex,\u201d W says. Lien smacks him. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s a viable physiological issue. Sexual activity releases serotonin, which increases feelings of well-being. It\u2019s simple science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you like me so much,\u201d Lien teases. \u201cAll that simple science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so I\u2019m depressed now?\u201d I try to sound amused but it\u2019s hard to keep that tinge of something else out of my voice. No one will look at me except for Lien. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d I ask, trying to make a joke of it. \u201cI\u2019m suffering from a clinical case of blue balls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your balls I think are blue,\u201d she says coolly. \u201cIt\u2019s your heart.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a beat of silence, and then the boys erupt into raucous laughter. \u201cSorry, schatje,\u201d W says. \u201cBut that would be anomalous behavior. You just don\u2019t know him yet. It\u2019s much more likely a serotonin issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I know,\u201d Lien says.</p><p>They all argue over this and I find myself wishing for the anonymity of the road, where you had no past and no future either, just that one moment in time. And if that moment happened to get sticky or uncomfortable, there was always a train departing to the next moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he does have a broken heart or blue balls, the cure is the same,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Lien asks.</p><p>\u201cGetting laid,\u201d Broodje and Henk crow together.</p><p>It\u2019s too much. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta piss,\u201d I say, standing up.</p><p>In the bathroom, I splash water on my face. I stare in the mirror. The scar is still red and angry, aggravated, as though I\u2019ve been picking at it.</p><p>Outside, the corridor is crowded, another film having just let out, not the de Bont but one of those treacly British romantic comedies, the kind that promise an everlasting love in two hours.</p><p>\u201cWillem de Ruiter, as I live and breathe.\u201d</p><p>I turn around, and coming out of the cinema, her eyes misty with fabricated emotion, is Ana Lucia Aurelanio.</p><p>I stop, letting her catch up. We kiss hello. She gestures for her friends, people I recognize from University College, to go on ahead. \u201cYou never called me,\u201d she says, adjusting her face into a little girl pout that somehow looks charming on her, though almost anything would.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have your number.\u201d I say. I have no reason to be sheepish, but it\u2019s like a reflex.</p><p>\u201cBut I gave it to you. In Paris.\u201d</p><p>Paris. Lulu. The feelings from the movie start to come back, but I push back against them. Paris was make-believe. No different from the romantic movie Ana Lucia just saw.</p><p>Ana Lucia leans in. She smells good, like cinnamon and smoke and perfume.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me your number again,\u201d I say, pulling out my phone. \u201cSo I can call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d she says.</p><p>I shrug. I\u2019d heard rumors she wasn\u2019t too happy when things ended last time. I put my phone away.</p><p>But then she grabs my hand in hers. Mine is cold. Hers is hot. \u201cI mean why bother calling me later when I\u2019m right here, right now?\u201d</p><p>And she is. Here now. And so am I.</p><p>The cure is the same, I hear Broodje say.</p><p>Maybe it is.</p><p>Ten</p><p>NOVEMBER</p><p>Utrecht</p><p>Ana Lucia\u2019s dorm is like a cocoon, thick feather quilts, radiators hissing full blast, endless cups of custard-like hot chocolate. For the first few days, I am content just to be here, with her.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think we\u2019d get back together?\u201d she coos, snuggling up to me like a warm little kitten.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I say, because there\u2019s no right way to answer that. I never thought we\u2019d get back together because I never considered us together in the first place. Ana Lucia and I had a three, maybe four-week fling in that hazy spring after Bram died, when I was spectacularly floundering in school but also spectacularly succeeding with women. Though succeeding isn\u2019t the right word, exactly. It implies a kind of effort, when really, it was the one thing in my life that was effortless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d she says, nibbling my ear. \u201cI thought about you so much these past few years. And then we bumped into each other in Paris, and it felt like it meant something, like fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d I repeat. I remember bumping into her in Paris and also feeling like it meant something, but not fate. More like the encroachment, a day too soon, of a world I\u2019d left behind.</p><p>\u201cBut then you didn\u2019t call me,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Something came up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure something did.\u201d Her hand drifts between my legs. \u201cI saw you with that girl. In Paris. She was pretty.\u201d</p><p>She says it offhandedly, dismissively even, but something skitters to life in my gut. A kind of warning. Ana Lucia\u2019s hand is still between my legs and it\u2019s having the intended effect, but now Lulu\u2019s somewhere in the room, too. Just like that day in Paris, when I ran into Ana Lucia and her cousins while I was in the Latin Quarter with Lulu, I want nothing but distance between these two girls.</p><p>\u201cShe was pretty, but you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d I say it, trying to steer the conversation away. My words are true, but meaningless. Though Ana Lucia is probably technically prettier than Lulu, such contests are rarely won on technicalities.</p><p>Her grip tightens. \u201cWhat was her name?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to say her name. But Ana Lucia has me firmly in hand and if I don\u2019t say it, I\u2019ll arouse suspicion. \u201cLulu,\u201d I say into the pillow. It\u2019s not even her real name, but it feels like a betrayal.</p> <p>\u201cLulu,\u201d Ana Lucia says. She lets go of me and sits up in the bed. \u201cA French girl. Was she your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Morning light is filtering through the window, pale and gray and tinting everything in here slightly greenish. Somehow, the gray dawn light had made Lulu glow in that white room.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust another one of your flings then?\u201d Ana Lucia\u2019s laughter answers her own question; the knowingness irks me.</p><p>That night in the art squat, after everything, Lulu had smudged her finger against her wrist, and I\u2019d done the same. A kind of code for stain, for something that lasts, even if you might not want it to. It had meant something, in that moment at least. \u201cYou know me,\u201d I say lightly.</p><p>Ana Lucia laughs again, the sound of it throaty and full, rich and indulgent. She climbs on top of me, straddling my hips. \u201cI do know you,\u201d she says, her eyes flashing. She runs a finger down my center line. \u201cI know what you\u2019ve been through now. I didn\u2019t understand before. But I\u2019ve grown up. You\u2019ve grown up. I think we\u2019re both different people, with different needs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy needs haven\u2019t changed,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThey\u2019re the same as they ever were. Very basic.\u201d I yank her toward me. I\u2019m still angry at her, but her invoking of Lulu\u2019s name has riled me up. I finger the lace along the trim of her camisole. I dip a finger under the straps.</p><p>Her eyes flutter closed for a minute and I close mine, too. I feel the give of the bed and the trail of her waxy kisses on my neck. \u201cDime que me quieres,\u201d she whispers. \u201cDime que me necesitas.\u201d Tell me you want me. Tell me you need me.</p><p>I don\u2019t tell her because she\u2019s speaking Spanish, which she doesn\u2019t realize I now understand. I keep my eyes closed, but even in darkness I hear a voice telling me she\u2019ll be my mountain girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d Ana Lucia says, and I jump in the bed at hearing Lulu\u2019s words come out of Ana Lucia\u2019s mouth.</p><p>But as Ana Lucia\u2019s head dips under the covers, I realize it\u2019s a different kind of taking care she\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s not the kind I really need. But I don\u2019t refuse it.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>After two weeks ensconced in Ana Lucia\u2019s dorm, I make my way back to Bloemstraat. It\u2019s quiet, a welcome change from the constant hubbub in and around the University College campus, everyone in everyone\u2019s business.</p><p>In the kitchen, I open the cupboards. Ana Lucia has been bringing me back cafeteria food or ordering takeout, charging it away on her father\u2019s credit cards. I crave something real.</p> <p>There\u2019s not much here, a couple of bags of pasta and some onions and garlic. There\u2019s a can of tomatoes in the pantry. Enough for a sauce. I start to chop the onions and my eyes immediately tear. They always do this. Yael\u2019s too. She never cooked much, but occasionally she\u2019d get homesick for Israel, and she\u2019d play bad Hebrew pop music and make shakshouka. I might be all the way upstairs in my room and I\u2019d feel the burn. I\u2019d gravitate down to the kitchen. Bram would find us sometimes, together and red-eyed, and he\u2019d laugh and ruffle my hair and kiss Yael and joke that chopping onions was the only time you\u2019d ever catch Yael Shiloh crying.</p><p>Around four, I hear the key click in the lock. I call out a hello.</p><p>\u201cWilly, you\u2019re back. And you\u2019re cook\u2014\u201d Broodje says as he turns the corner into the kitchen. Then he stops midsentence. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d And then I realize he means my tears. \u201cJust the onions,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cOnions.\u201d He picks up the wooden spoon and swirls it in the sauce, blows, then tastes. Then he reaches into the pantry for several dried herbs and rubs them between his fingers before sprinkling them in. He gives a few shakes of salt and several turns of the pepper mill. Then he turns the flame down low and puts on the lid. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s not the onions . . .\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat else would it be?\u201d</p><p>He shuffles his foot against the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you since that night,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happened after the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d I say.</p><p>He starts to say something. Then stops. \u201cNothing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, Ana Lucia? Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ana Lucia. Again.\u201d I can think of nothing else to add so I revert to small talk. \u201cShe sends her greetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she does,\u201d Broodje says, not buying it for a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou want to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the sauce isn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>Broodje goes up to his room. I\u2019m perplexed. It\u2019s unlike him to turn down food, no matter how cooked it is. I\u2019ve seen him eat raw hamburger meat. I let the sauce simmer. The aroma fills up the house and he still doesn\u2019t come down. So I go up and tap on his door. \u201cHungry yet?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come down? I can make some pasta.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you on a hunger strike?\u201d I joke. \u201cLike Sarsak.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe I will go on a hunger strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you strike for?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt would have to be very important for you to go without food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Broodje swivels in his desk chair. \u201cDidn\u2019t we used to tell each other things, Willy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we always been good friends? Even when I moved away we stayed close. Even when you were gone and you didn\u2019t ever contact me, I thought we were good friends, and now you\u2019re back, what if we\u2019re not really friends at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been, Willy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have I been? With Ana Lucia. Jesus, you were the one who said I needed to get laid to get over it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flash. \u201cGet over what, Willy?\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the bed. Get over what? That\u2019s the question, right there.</p><p>\u201cIs it your pa?\u201d Broodje asks. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if it still is. It\u2019s only been three years. It took me that long to get over Varken, and he was a dog.\u201d</p><p>Bram\u2019s death gutted me. It did. But that was then and I\u2019ve been okay so I\u2019m not sure why it feels so raw again now. Maybe because I\u2019m back in Holland. Maybe it was a mistake to stay.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d I tell Broodje. It\u2019s a relief to admit this much.</p><p>\u201cBut it is something,\u201d he says.</p><p>I can\u2019t really explain it, because it makes no sense. One girl. One day.</p><p>\u201cIt is something,\u201d I tell Broodje.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, but the silence is like an invitation, and I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m keeping this a secret. So I tell him: About meeting Lulu in Stratford-upon-Avon. About seeing her again on the train. About our flirtation on the train about hagelslag of all things. About calling her Lulu, a name that seemed to fit her so well that I forgot she wasn\u2019t actually called that.</p><p>I tell him some of the highlights of a day that seems so perfect in retrospect, I sometimes think I invented it: Lulu marching up and down the Bassin de la Villette with a hundred-dollar bill, bribing Jacques to take us down the canal. The two of us almost getting arrested by that gendarme for illegally riding two people on a single V\u00e9lib\u2019 bike, but then when the gendarme asked me why I\u2019d done something so stupid, I\u2019d quoted that Shakespeare line about beauty being a witch, and he recognized it, and let us off with a warning. Lulu blindly picking a M\u00e9tro stop to go to and us winding up in Barb\u00e8s Rochechouart, and Lulu, who claimed to be uncomfortable with traveling, seeming to love the randomness of it all. I tell him about the skinheads, too. About how I didn\u2019t really think about it when I intervened and tried to stop them from hassling those two Arab girls about their headscarves. I didn\u2019t really think about what they might do to me, and just as it was starting to dawn on me that I might have really screwed myself, there was Lulu, hurling a book at one of them.</p><p>Even as I explain it, I realize I\u2019m not doing it justice. Not the day. Not Lulu. I\u2019m not telling the whole story, either, because there are things I just don\u2019t know how to explain. Like how when Lulu bribed Jacques to give us that ride on the canal, it wasn\u2019t her generosity that got to me. I never told her I\u2019d grown up on a boat, or that I was one day away from signing it all away. But she seemed to know. How did she know? How do I explain that?</p><p>When I\u2019m done with my story, I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019ve made any sense. But I feel better somehow. \u201cSo,\u201d I say to Broodje. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Broodje sniffs the air. The smell of the sauce has infiltrated the entire house. \u201cSauce is ready. Now we eat.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Ana Lucia says. It\u2019s sleeting outside but it\u2019s toasty in her dorm, with our little feast of Thai food on her bed.</p><p>\u201cAlways dangerous words,\u201d I joke.</p><p>She throws a sachet of duck sauce at me. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about Christmas. I know you don\u2019t really celebrate it, but maybe you should come with me to Switzerland next month. So you\u2019re among family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had relatives in Switzerland,\u201d I tease, popping a spring roll in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI meant my family.\u201d She looks at me, her eyes uncomfortably intense. \u201cThey want to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Ana Lucia belongs to a sprawling Spanish clan, the heirs to a shipping company that was sold to the Chinese before the recession crippled their economy. She has endless relatives, siblings and cousins, living all over Europe and the U.S., Mexico, and Argentina, and she speaks to them in a kind of round-robin on the phone each night. \u201cYou never know what might happen. One day, you might think of them as your family, too.\u201d</p><p>I want to say I already have a family, but it hardly seems true anymore. Who\u2019s left? Yael and me. And Uncle Daniel, but he barely counted in the first place. The roll sticks in my throat. I wash it down with a gulp of beer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful there,\u201d she adds.</p><p>Bram took Yael and me skiing once in Italy. We both stayed huddled in the lodge, freezing. He learned his lesson. The next year we went to Tenerife. \u201cSwitzerland\u2019s too cold,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s so nice here?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Ana Lucia and I have been together for three weeks. Christmas is in six weeks. You don\u2019t need to be W to figure out the math on that one.</p><p>When I don\u2019t answer, Ana Lucia says, \u201cOr maybe you want me to go, so you can have someone else keep you warm?\u201d Just like that, her tone changes, and the suspicion that I now realize has been lurking outside all along comes rushing in.</p><p>The next afternoon, when I head back to Bloemstraat, I find the boys at the table, papers sprawled out all over the place. Broodje looks up wearing the expression of a guilty dog who stole the dinner.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says straightaway.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI may have told them a little bit about our conversation,\u201d he stammers. \u201cAbout what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much of a surprise,\u201d W says. \u201cIt was obvious something has been wrong since you came back. And I knew that scar wasn\u2019t from a bicycle accident. It doesn\u2019t look like something you\u2019d get from a fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy story was I got hit by a tree branch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you got beaten up by skinheads,\u201d Henk tells me. \u201cThe same ones the girl threw the book at the day before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he knows what happened to him,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cCrazy that you saw the same guys,\u201d Henk says.</p><p>\u201cMore like bad luck,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything</p><p>\u201cWe think you have that post-traumatic thing,\u201d Henk says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so depressed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve scrapped the celibacy theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Henk says. \u201cBecause you\u2019re getting laid now and you\u2019re still depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s because of this,\u201d I say, tapping the scar. \u201cNot because of the girl?\u201d I look at W. \u201cYou don\u2019t think maybe Lien was right?\u201d</p><p>The three of them try not to laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I ask, feeling irritated and defensive all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cThis girl didn\u2019t break your heart,\u201d W says. \u201cShe just broke your streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWilly, come on,\u201d Broodje says, waving his arms to calm us all down. \u201cI know you. I know how you are with girls. You fall in love and then it disappears like snow in the sun. If you\u2019d had another few weeks with this girl you\u2019d get tired of her, just like you do all the others. But you didn\u2019t. It was almost like she dumped you. So you\u2019re pining.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re comparing love to a stain? Lulu had asked. She\u2019d been skeptical at first.</p> <p>Something that never comes off, no matter how much you might want it to. Yes, stain had seemed about right.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d W says, clicking his pen. \u201cLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with as much detail as you can muster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beginning of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>W starts explain about the Principle of Connectivity and how police use that to track down criminals, via who they associate with. He is always talking about theories like this. He believes that all of life boils down to mathematics, that there\u2019s a numeric principal or algorithm to describe every event, even the random ones (chaos theory!). It takes me a while to understand that he means to use the Principle of Connectivity to solve the mystery of Lulu.</p><p>\u201cAgain, why? The mystery\u2019s solved,\u201d I snap. \u201cI\u2019m pining over the girl who got away, because she got away.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m irritated because I think this is true or because I think it\u2019s not.</p><p>W rolls his eyes, as if this is beside the point. \u201cBut you want to find her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>By that night, W has spreadsheets and graphs and on the mantel, below the fading Picasso poster, an empty poster board. \u201cPrinciple of Connectivity. Basically, we track down the people we can find and see what connections they have back to your mystery girl,\u201d W says. \u201cOur best bet is to start with C\u00e9line. Lulu may have gone back for the suitcase.\u201d He writes C\u00e9line\u2019s name and draws a circle around it.</p><p>The thought has crossed my mind a number of times, and each time, I\u2019ve been tempted to contact C\u00e9line. But then I think back to that night, the raw, wounded look on her face. In any case, it doesn\u2019t matter. Either the suitcase is at the club, and Lulu hasn\u2019t gone back for it, or it\u2019s not there and she did somehow retrieve it and she found my notes inside and chose not to respond. Knowing does nothing to change the situation.</p><p>\u201cC\u00e9line is off the table,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s the strongest connection,\u201d W protests.</p><p>I don\u2019t tell them about C\u00e9line and what happened at her flat that night, or what I promised her. \u201cShe\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>W makes a rather dramatic X through C\u00e9line\u2019s name. Then he draws a circle. Inside he writes, \u201cbarge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDid she fill out any paperwork?\u201d W says. \u201cPay with a card?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cShe paid with a hundred dollar bill. She basically bribed Jacques.\u201d</p><p>He writes \u201cJacques.\u201d Circles it.</p><p>I shake my head again. \u201cI spent more time with him than she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a typical sailor. Lives on the water all year round. Sails in warm weather, kept the barge anchored in a marina, in Deauville he said, I think.\u201d</p><p>W writes \u201cDeauville\u201d and puts a circle around it. \u201cWhat about other passengers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were older. Danish. One married couple, one divorced couple that seemed married. They were all drunk off their heads.\u201d</p><p>W writes \u201cDrunk Danes\u201d in a circle way off on the side of the poster board.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll consider them last resorts,\u201d W says, moving to the next line. \u201cI think the strongest lead is probably the most time-consuming.\u201d Small grin there. Then on the bottom of the poster he writes \u201cTOUR COMPANY\u201d in large block letters.</p><p>\u201cOnly problem is I don\u2019t know which one it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdds are, it\u2019s one of these seven,\u201d W says, reaching for a computer printout.</p><p>\u201cYou found the tour company? Why didn\u2019t you say so to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find it. But I did narrow down the seven companies that do tours for American students that had a tour operating in Stratford-upon-Avon on the nights in question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNights in question,\u201d Henk jokes. \u201cThis is starting to sound like a detective program.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the printout. \u201cHow did you do that? In one night?\u201d</p><p>I expect some complicated mathematical theorem, but he just shrugs and says: \u201cThe Internet.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThere may be more than seven tours, but these are seven that I\u2019ve confirmed as possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d Broodje says. \u201cSeven already seems like lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a music festival that week,\u201d I explain. It was why Guerrilla Will had gone to Stratford-upon-Avon in the first place. Tor generally avoided it; she had a poisonous grudge against the Royal Shakespeare Company, related to her even more toxic grudge against the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, which had denied her admission twice. It was after that that she\u2019d gone all anarchist and started Guerrilla Will.</p><p>W writes and circles the names of the tours on the poster: \u201cWide Horizons,\u201d \u201cEurope Unlimited,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World,\u201d \u201cAdventure Edge,\u201d \u201cGo Away,\u201d \u201cTeen Tours!\u201d and \u201cCool Europa.\u201d \u201cMy guess is that your mystery girl was on one of these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but there\u2019s seven tours,\u201d Henk says. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call them?\u201d I guess.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d W says.</p><p>\u201cLooking for . . . damn.\u201d Once again, it comes back to me: I don\u2019t even know her name.</p><p>\u201cWhat identifying details do you know?\u201d W asks.</p><p>I know the timbre of her laugh. I know the heat of her breath. I know the cast of moonlight against her skin.</p><p>\u201cShe was traveling with her friend,\u201d I say, \u201cwho was blonde, and Lulu had black hair, cut short, in a bob, like Louise Brooks.\u201d The boys all exchange a look. \u201cShe had a birthmark right here.\u201d I touch my wrist. Since she first showed it to me on the train, I\u2019d wondered what it would taste like. \u201cShe mostly kept it covered with a watch. Oh, right, she had an expensive gold watch. Or did have. I have it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hers?\u201d Broodje asks.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>W scribbles this down. \u201cThis is good,\u201d W says. \u201cThe watch, especially. It identifies her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, it gives you a cover,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cA reason to be tracking her down other than wanting to bone her a few more times to get her out of your system. You can say you want to return the watch.\u201d</p><p>A half hour ago the poster board was empty, but now it\u2019s half filled, all these circles, these tenuous connections, linking me to her. W turns toward it, too.</p><p>\u201cPrinciple of Connectivity,\u201d he says.</p><p>Over the next week, one by one, the circles on W\u2019s connectivity board become Xs, as connections that I understand never actually existed are severed. It\u2019s a Small World is for teens and their parents, so that one\u2019s out. Go Away doesn\u2019t have any record of anyone with a black bob and a watch on that tour. Adventure Edge refuses to divulge information about their clients and Cool Europa appears to have gone out of business. Teen Tours! doesn\u2019t pick up the phone, though I\u2019ve left several messages and emails.</p><p>It\u2019s a dispiriting process, this. And complicated, too because I have to dodge time zones and callbacks and the ever-more-suspicious Ana Lucia. She\u2019s not pleased with my more frequent absences, which I\u2019ve attributed to the soccer league I\u2019ve supposedly joined.</p><p>One night the phone rings past eleven. \u201cYour girlfriend?\u201d Ana Lucia says, her voice flat. Girlfriend is what she calls Broodje these days, because she thinks I spend more time with him than her. It\u2019s a joke, but it gives my stomach a guilty twist every time.</p><p>I pick up the phone and cross to the other side of her room.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m looking for a Willem de Ruiter?\u201d The voice, in English, butchers the pronunciation of my name.</p><p>\u201cYes, hello,\u201d I respond, trying to stay businesslike because Ana Lucia is right there.</p><p>\u201cHi Willem! This is Erica from Teen Tours! I\u2019m responding to your email about trying to return a missing watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d I say, keeping it breezy, though Ana Lucia is now looking at me with narrowed suspicious eyes and I realize it\u2019s because I\u2019m speaking in English, and though I speak English with her, on the phone, with the boys, I always speak Dutch.</p><p>\u201cWe provide loss and theft insurance for all our travelers so if she\u2019d lost something of value, there\u2019d be a claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve checked all the claims for that time period, and all I\u2019ve found is a claim for a stolen iPad from Rome and a bracelet that was recovered. But if you have a name, I can double check.\u201d</p><p>I look at Ana Lucia, who\u2019s decidedly not looking at me now, so I know she\u2019s listening. \u201cI can\u2019t give you that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. Well, maybe you can call me back with that later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really do that either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You sure it was a Teen Tours! tour?\u201d</p><p>I now see how the missing-watch story is as cracked as the watch itself. Even if this was the right tour, there\u2019s no way the tour operators would know Lulu lost the watch because she lost it after the tour. It\u2019s a fiction. This is all a fiction. The truth is, I\u2019m looking for a girl whose name I don\u2019t know, who bears a passing resemblance to Louise Brooks. None of which I can say out loud. Nor do I want to. This is absurd. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Erica goes on, \u201cYou know, one of our veterans led that tour. She\u2019d know if anything went amiss. Do you want her number?\u201d</p><p>I turn to the bed. Ana Lucia is up, throwing off the covers.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Patricia Foley,\u201d Erica continues. \u201cWould you like her number?\u201d</p><p>Ana Lucia walks across the room and stands in front of me, totally naked, like she knows she\u2019s offering a choice. But it\u2019s not really a choice, when the other option doesn\u2019t actually exist.</p> <p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d I say to Erika.</p><p>I wake up the next morning to knocking. I squint at the sliding glass door. There\u2019s Broodje, holding a bag, and putting a finger to his lips.</p><p>I crack open the door. Broodje pops in his head in and hands me the bag.</p><p>From the bed, Ana Lucia rubs her eyes, looking grumpy.</p><p>\u201cSorry to wake you,\u201d he calls to Ana Lucia. \u201cI need to steal him. We have a soccer match. Lapland forfeited so now we\u2019re playing Wiesbaden.\u201d</p> <p>Lapland and Wiesbaden? Ana Lucia is ignorant about all things soccer, but this is pushing it. But her face registers no suspicion about the pairing, only sourness about Broodje\u2019s untimely arrival.</p><p>In the bag is someone\u2019s old soccer kit, jersey, shorts, cleats, and a thin tracksuit to wear on top. I look at Broodje. He gives me a look. \u201cBetter go change now,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d she asks me when I return. The tracksuit is several centimeters too short for me. I can\u2019t tell if she notices.</p><p>\u201cLate,\u201d Broodje answers. \u201cIt\u2019s an away game. In France.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cIn Deauville.\u201d</p><p>Deauville? No. The search is over. But Broodje is halfway out the door and Ana Lucia already has her hands crossed over her chest. I\u2019m already paying the price, so I may as well do the crime.</p><p>I go to give her a kiss good-bye. \u201cWish me luck,\u201d I say, forgetting for a second that there is no game, no soccer game at least, and that she\u2019s the last person who should be wishing me luck.</p> <p>Anyway, she doesn\u2019t. \u201cI hope you lose,\u201d she says.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Deauville</p><p>It\u2019s off season in Deauville, and the seaside resort is buttoned up tight, a cold wind whipping in off the Channel. From a distance, I can see the marina, rows of sailboats in drydock, on their stands, their masts unstepped. As we get closer, the whole marina appears shut down, hibernating for the winter. Which seems about the right idea.</p><p>On the drive down in Lien\u2019s car, which had smelled of lavender when we left and now smells of wet, dirty laundry somehow, the boys had been ebullient. W had located a barge called Viola late last night and had then decided we should take a road trip to France. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to call?\u201d I\u2019d asked after the plan had been explained to me. But no. They seemed to think we should just go. Of course, they were properly dressed for it, and I was in nothing but a thin tracksuit. And they had nothing to lose, except a day\u2019s worth of studies. Me, I had even less, but it felt like more somehow.</p><p>We drive around the labyrinthine marina, finally reaching the main office only to find it closed. Of course. It\u2019s now four o\u2019clock on a dark November day; anyone in their right mind is holed up somewhere warm.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll just have to find it ourselves,\u201d W says.</p><p>I look around. As far as I can see in every directions are masts. \u201cI don\u2019t see how.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre marinas organized by type of vessel?\u201d W asks.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there might be a section for barges?\u201d he prompts.</p><p>I sigh again. \u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said this Jacques lives on his boat year-round so it wouldn\u2019t be drydocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d We had to pull our houseboat out of the water every four years for service overhauls. Drydocking for a vessel that size is a massive undertaking. \u201cProbably anchored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d Henk asks.</p><p>\u201cProbably to a pier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere. We walk around until we find the barges,\u201d W says, as if it\u2019s all that easy.</p><p>But it\u2019s not easy at all. It\u2019s raining hard now, wet below us and above us. And it seems deserted around here, no sound except the steady pounding of rain, the waves against the sides of the hulls, and the clang of the halyards.</p><p>A cat streaks out across one of the piers, and behind it, a barking dog, and behind the dog, a man in a yellow slicker, one dot of color in all the gloom. I watch them go and wonder if I\u2019m like that dog, chasing a cat because it\u2019s what a dog does.</p><p>The boys take shelter under an awning. I\u2019m shivering now, ready to pack it in. I turn around to suggest a warm bistro, a nice meal, and some drinks before the long drive home. But the boys are all pointing behind me. I turn back around.</p><p>The Viola\u2019s blue steel shutters are closed, making her look lonely out here strapped alongside the cement slips and the massive wooden posts. She looks cold, too, like she also wishes she were back in the hot Paris summer.</p><p>I step on the pier, and for a second, I can almost feel the rays of sunlight on my skin, can hear Lulu introducing me to double happiness. It was right there we\u2019d sat, by the railing. Right there we\u2019d disagreed about what double happiness meant. Luck, she\u2019d said. Love, I\u2019d countered.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Striding toward us is the man in the yellow slicker, the runaway mutt now leashed and shivering.</p><p>\u201cMany a thief has underestimated Napoleon and has paid for it in a pound of flesh, haven\u2019t they?\u201d the man says to his dog. He pulls at the leash and Napoleon barks pitifully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a thief,\u201d I say in French.</p><p>The man wrinkles his nose. \u201cWorse! You are a foreigner. I knew you were too tall. German?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter. Get out of there before I call the gendarme or let Napoleon loose on you.\u201d</p><p>I hold up on my hands. \u201cI\u2019m not here to steal anything. I\u2019m looking for Jacques.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the dropping of Jacques\u2019s name or the fact that Napoleon has started licking his balls, but the man backs down. \u201cYou know Jacques?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you know Jacques even a little, you know where to find him when he\u2019s not on the Viola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe less than a little. I met him last summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou meet lots of people. You don\u2019t board a man\u2019s vessel without an invitation. That is the ultimate violation of his kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just want to find him, and this is the only place I can think of.\u201d</p><p>He squints. \u201cDoes he owe you money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? This isn\u2019t about the races? He always backs the wrong horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he sleep with your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Last summer he took four passengers through Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Danes? Bastards! He lost almost his whole charter fee right back to them. He\u2019s a terrible poker player. Did he lose money to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He got money off us. A hundred dollars. Me and this American girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible, those Americans. They never speak French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe spoke Chinese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good does that do you?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cLook, this girl . . .\u201d I start to explain. But he waves me away.</p><p>\u201cIf you want Jacques, go to Bar de la Marine. When he\u2019s not on the water, he\u2019s in the drink.\u201d</p><p>I find Jacques at the long wooden bar, slung over a near-empty glass. As soon as we walk in, he waves at me, though whether it\u2019s because he recognizes me or because this is just his standard greeting, I\u2019m not sure. He is carrying on an in-depth conversation about new slip fees with the bartender. I buy the boys a round of beers, settle them into a corner table, and sit down next to Jacques.</p><p>\u201cTwo of what he\u2019s having,\u201d I tell the bartender, and he pours us each a glass of teeth-achingly sweet brandy on the rocks.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Jacques tells me.</p><p>\u201cSo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember you.\u201d He squints, placing me. \u201cParis.\u201d He belches and then pounds his chest with his fist. \u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised. It was only a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was three months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeks, months. Time is so fluid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember you saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to charter the Viola? She\u2019s dry for the season but we get wet again in May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a charter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what can I do for you?\u201d He downs the rest of his drink and crunches hard on the ice. Then he starts in on the fresh one.</p><p>I don\u2019t really have an answer for him. What can he do for me?</p><p>\u201cI was with that American girl and I\u2019m trying to get in touch with her. She didn\u2019t by any chance get in touch with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe American girl. Oh yes, she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She said to tell that tall bastard I\u2019m done with him \u2019cause I\u2019ve found myself a new man.\u201d He points to himself. Then he laughs.</p><p>\u201cSo she didn\u2019t get in touch with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry, boy. She leave you high and dry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could ask those bastard Danes. One of them keeps texting me. Let me see if I can find it.\u201d He pulls out a smartphone and starts fumbling with it. \u201cMy sister got me this, said it would help with navigation, bookings . . . but I can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d He hands it to me. \u201cYou try.\u201d</p><p>I check his text queue and find a note from Agnethe. I open the text and there are several more before it, including pictures from last summer when they were cruising on the Viola. Most are of Jacques, in front of fields of yellow safflower, or cows, or sunsets, but there\u2019s one shot I recognize: a clarinet player on a bridge over Canal Saint Martin. I\u2019m about to hand the phone back when I see it: in the corner, a sliver of Lulu. It\u2019s not her face, it\u2019s the back of her\u2014shoulders, neck, hair\u2014but it\u2019s her. A reminder that she\u2019s not some fiction of my own making.</p><p>I\u2019ve often wondered how many photos I\u2019ve been accidentally captured in. There was another photo that day, not accidental at all. An intentional shot of Lulu and me that she\u2019d asked Agnethe to take with her phone. Lulu had offered to send it to me. And I\u2019d said no.</p><p>\u201cCan I forward this to myself?\u201d I ask Jacques.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d he says, with a wave of the hand.</p><p>I forward the shot to Broodje\u2019s phone because it was true that mine won\u2019t accept photo texts, though that wasn\u2019t the reason I didn\u2019t want the shot of Lulu and me when she offered it. It was automatic, that denial, a reflex almost. I had almost no pictures from the last year of my traveling. Though I\u2019m sure I am in many people\u2019s photos, I\u2019m in none of my own.</p><p>In my rucksack, the one that got stolen on that train to Warsaw, had been an old digital camera. And on that camera were photographs of me and Yael and Bram from my eighteenth birthday. They were some of the last photos I had of the three of us together, and I hadn\u2019t even discovered them until I was on the road, bored one night and going through all the shots on my memory stick. And there we were.</p><p>I should\u2019ve had those pictures emailed somewhere. Or printed. Done something permanent. I planned to, I did. But I put it off and then my rucksack got nicked and it was too late.</p><p>The devastation caught me off guard. There\u2019s a difference between losing something you knew you had and losing something you discovered you had. One is a disappointment. The other is truly a loss.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize that before. I realize it now.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Utrecht</p><p>On the ride back to Utrecht, I call Agnethe the Dane to see if Lulu sent her any photographs, if there had been any correspondence. But she hardly remembers who I am. It\u2019s depressing. This day, so seared in my memory, is just another day to everyone else. And in any case, it was just one day, and it\u2019s over now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s over now with Ana Lucia, too. I can feel it, even if she can\u2019t. When I come back, defeated, telling her soccer season is over, she is sympathetic, or maybe victorious. She\u2019s full of kisses and cari\u00f1os.</p><p>I accept them. But I know now it\u2019s just a matter of time. In three weeks, she leaves for Switzerland. By the time she gets back, four weeks later, I will be gone. I make a mental note to get on that passport renewal.</p><p>It\u2019s as if Ana Lucia senses all this. Because she starts pushing harder for me to join her in Switzerland. Every day, a new appeal. \u201cLook how nice the weather is,\u201d she says one morning as she gets ready for class. She opens her computer and reads me the weather report from Gstaad. \u201cSunny skies every day. Not even so cold.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. Just force a smile.</p> <p>\u201cAnd here,\u201d she says, clicking over to a travel site she likes and tilting the laptop toward me to show me pictures of snowy alps and painted nutcrackers. \u201cHere it shows you all the things you can do besides skiing. You don\u2019t have to sit at the lodge. We\u2019re close to Lausanne or Bern. Geneva\u2019s not even so far. We can go shopping there. It\u2019s famous for watches. I know! I\u2019ll buy you a watch.\u201d</p><p>My whole body stiffens. \u201cI already have a watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do? I never see you wear it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s back at Bloemstraat, in my rucksack. Still ticking. I can almost hear it from here. And suddenly, three weeks feels too long.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk.\u201d The words trip out before I know what to follow them with. Breaking up is not something I\u2019ve done in a while. So much easier to kiss good-bye and catch a train.</p> <p>\u201cNot now,\u201d she says, rising to apply lipstick in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m already late.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Not now. Later. Good. It will give me time to find the right words. There are always right words.</p><p>After she leaves, I get dressed, make a coffee, and sit down at her computer to check my email before I leave. The travel page she was on is still open, and I\u2019m about to close the window when I see one of the banner ads. MEXICO!!! it screams. Outside, it\u2019s cold and gray, but the pictures promise only warmth and sunshine.</p><p>I click on the link, and it takes me to a page listing several package holiday specials, not the kind of thing I\u2019d ever do, but I feel warmer just looking at the beaches. And then I see some ads for trips to Canc\u00fan.</p><p>Canc\u00fan.</p><p>Where Lulu goes every year.</p> <p>Where she has gone with her family to the same place every year. Her mother\u2019s predictability, so exasperating to her, is now my best hope.</p><p>I pull up the details. Like everything from that day, they\u2019re as fresh as wet paint. A resort fashioned like a Mayan temple. Like America behind walls with Christmas carols mariachi- style. Christmas. They went for the holidays. Christmas. Or was it New Year\u2019s? I can just go for both!</p><p>Channeling W, I start searching for resorts in Canc\u00fan. One crystalline-water beach after the other flashes across the screen. There is no end to them, these megaresorts like Mayan fortresses and temples. She said it had some kind of river. I\u2019d remembered wondering about that, a resort with a river. There aren\u2019t any natural rivers running through Canc\u00fan. There are golf courses and swimming pools and diving cliffs, and waterslides. But rivers? I\u2019m looking at the listing for Palacio Maya when I stumble across it. A lazy river, a kind of fake stream you ride on in an inflatable tube.</p><p>I narrow my search. There don\u2019t seem to be that many resorts that look like Mayan temples and have lazy rivers. Four, that I can see. Four that Lulu might be staying at some time between Christmas and New Year\u2019s.</p><p>Outside it\u2019s pouring, but the sites brag that the weather in Mexico is hot, endless blue skies and sunshine. All this time, I\u2019ve been stuck, trying to figure out where to go next. Why not here? To find her? I click over to an airline consolidator and look up the prices for two tickets to Canc\u00fan. Expensive, but then again, I can afford it.</p><p>I snap the computer shut, a list forming in my head. It seems so simple.</p><p>Get my passport.</p><p>Invite Broodje.</p> <p>Buy the tickets.</p><p>Find Lulu.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>By six o\u2019clock that night, I\u2019ve bought Broodje\u2019s and my plane tickets and reserved us a room at a cheap hotel in Playa del Carmen. I feel flush with satisfaction, having accomplished more in this single day than I have in the last two months. There\u2019s only one thing left to do.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d I text Ana Lucia. She texts me right back, \u201cI know what you want to talk about. Come by at 8.\u201d I am limber with relief. Ana Lucia is smart. She knows, like I know, that whatever this is, it\u2019s not a stain.</p><p>I buy a bottle of wine on my way over. No reason this can\u2019t be civilized.</p><p>She greets me at the door, wearing a red bikini and redder lips. Taking the wine from my hand, she pulls me inside. There are lit votive candles everywhere, like a cathedral on a saint\u2019s day. I get a bad feeling.</p><p>\u201cCari\u00f1o, I understand it now. All that talk about how much you hate the cold. I should\u2019ve guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve guessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you want to go somewhere warm. And you know my aunt and uncle are in Mexico City but what I can\u2019t figure out is how you know about the villa on Isla Mujeres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsla Mujeres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Right on the beach, with a pool and servants. They have invited us to stay there if we want, or we can stay on the mainland, though not at one of those cheap places,\u201d She wrinkles her nose. \u201cI insist to pay for the hotel, no arguments. Because it\u2019s only fair you bought the tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBought the tickets.\u201d All I can do is repeat.</p><p>\u201cOh cari\u00f1o,\u201d she coos. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet my family, after all. They are going to throw us a party. My parents were upset about me canceling Switzerland but they understand the things you do for love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor love,\u201d I repeat although with a sickening feeling I\u2019m starting to piece together what has happened. Her Internet browser. My entire search history. Tickets for two. The hotel. My smile is pulled taut, full of false sweetness. How can I find the words for this? A misunderstanding, I will tell her; the tickets are for a boys\u2019 holiday, for me and Broodje, which is true.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted it to be a surprise,\u201d she continues. \u201cNow I know why you have been sneaking off on the telephone, but amor, we leave in three weeks, when did you plan to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAna Lucia,\u201d I begin. \u201cThere\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she says. And the hope is still there, as if the misunderstanding is about a minor detail, like the hotel.</p><p>\u201cThose tickets. They\u2019re not for you. They\u2019re for\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cuts me off. \u201cIt\u2019s that other girl isn\u2019t it? The one from Paris?\u201d</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m not so good an actor as I think. Because the way her expression has tectonically shifted from adoration to suspicion shows me that she\u2019s probably always known. And I must be a terrible actor now, because even as my mouth starts to form a plausible explanation, my face must be giving it all away. I can tell it is by what\u2019s happening to Ana Lucia\u2019s face\u2014her pretty features puckering into disbelief, and then into belief.</p><p>\u201cHijo de la gran puta! It\u2019s the French girl? You\u2019ve been with her all this time, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Ana Lucia screams. \u201cThat\u2019s why you went to France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d I say holding up my hands.</p><p>She flings open the sliding-glass door leading onto the quad. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I think,\u201d she says, shoving me out the door. I just stand there. She reaches for a candle and hurls it at me. It flies past me and lands on one of the throw pillow she keeps on the cement stoop. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sneaking around all this time with that French whore!\u201d Another candle whizzes by, landing in the shrubbery.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to start a fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! I\u2019ll burn the memory of you, culero!\u201d She flings another candle at me.</p><p>The rain has stopped, and though it\u2019s a chilly night, it seems as if half the college has now gathered around us. I try to bring her back inside, to calm her down. I am unsuccessful at both.</p><p>\u201cI canceled my trip to Switzerland for you! My relatives arranged a party for you. And all along, you were sneaking off to see your French whore. In my land. Where my family lives.\u201d She pounds on her bare chest, as if she\u2019s claiming ownership not just of Spain but of all of Latin America.</p><p>She hurls another candle. I catch this one, and it explodes, spilling glass and hot wax down my hand. My skin bubbles to a blister. I wonder, vaguely, if it\u2019ll scar. I suspect it won\u2019t.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>DECEMBER</p><p>Canc\u00fan</p><p>The height of the Mayan civilization was more than a thousand years ago, but it\u2019s hard to imagine the holiest of temples back then were as well guarded as the Maya del Sol is now.</p><p>\u201cRoom number?\u201d The guards ask Broodje and me as we approach the gate in the imposing carved wall that seems to stretch a kilometer in each direction.</p><p>\u201cFour-oh-seven,\u201d Broodje says before I have a chance to speak.</p><p>\u201cKey card,\u201d the guard says. There are sweat patches all down the side of his sweater vest.</p><p>\u201cUm, I left it in the room,\u201d Broodje replies.</p><p>The guard opens a binder and looks through a sheaf of papers. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Yoshimoto?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Broodje replies, linking arms with me.</p><p>The guard looks annoyed. \u201cGuests only.\u201d He snaps the binder shut and goes to close the little window.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not guests,\u201d I say, smiling conspiratorially. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to find a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d He picks up the binder again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, exactly.\u201d</p><p>A black Mercedes with tinted windows glides up and barely stops before the guards lift the gate and wave it through. The guard turns back to us, weary, and for a second I think we\u2019ve won. But then he says, \u201cGo now, before I have to call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police?\u201d Broodje exclaims. \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. Let\u2019s just all cool down a minute. Take off our sweater vests. Maybe have a drink. We can go to the bar; the hotel must have some nice bars. We\u2019ll bring you back a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a hotel. It\u2019s a vacation club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, exactly?\u201d Broodje asks.</p><p>\u201cIt means you can\u2019t come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a heart. We came from Holland. He\u2019s looking for a girl,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we all?\u201d the guard behind him asks, and they both laugh. But they still don\u2019t let us in.</p><p>I give the moped a good frustrated kick, which at least means it sputters to life. Nothing so far is going quite how I\u2019d expected it to, not even the weather. I\u2019d thought Mexico would be warm, but it\u2019s like being in an oven all day long. Or maybe it only feels that way because instead of spending our first day on a breeze-cooled beach as Broodje had the good sense to do, I spent yesterday at the Tulum ruins. Lulu had mentioned her family went to the same ruins every year and Tulum is the closest one, so I\u2019d thought I might just catch her there. For four hours I watched thousands of people as they belched out of tour buses and minivans and rental cars. Twice, I thought I saw her and ran after a girl. Right hair, wrong girl. And I realized she might not even have that haircut anymore.</p><p>I\u2019d come back to our little hotel with a sunburn and a headache, the optimism I\u2019d had about this trip souring into a sinking feeling. Broodje cheerfully suggested we try the hotels, a more contained environment. And if that didn\u2019t work out, he\u2019d pointed toward the beach. \u201cThere are so many girls here,\u201d he\u2019d said in a hushed, almost reverent tone, gesturing out to the sand, which was covered, every square yard of it, with bikinis. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So many girls, I\u2019d thought. Why am I trying to find just one?</p><p>Palacio Maya, another of the faux-Mayan resorts on my hit list, is a few kilometers north of here. We putter up the highway, breathing in the fumes of the passing tour buses and trucks. This time, we stash the moped in some flowering shrubs along the winding manicured road that leads to the front gates. Palacio Maya looks a lot like the Maya del Sol, only instead of a monolithic wall, it is fronted by a giant pyramid, with a guard gate in the middle. This time, I\u2019m ready. In Spanish, I tell the guard I\u2019m trying to find a friend of mine who\u2019s staying here but I want to surprise her. Then I slip him a twenty-dollar bill. He doesn\u2019t say a word\u2014he just opens the gates.</p><p>\u201cTwenty dollars,\u201d Broodje says, nodding his head. \u201cMuch classier than a couple of beers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably what a couple of beers go for in a place like this.\u201d</p> <p>We walk along the paved roadway, expecting to find a hotel, or some evidence of one, but what we find is another guard gate. The guards smile at us and call buenos d\u00edas, as if they\u2019re expecting us, and by the way they\u2019re appraising us, like they\u2019re cats and we\u2019re mice, I see the other guards have called ahead. Without saying a word, I reach into my wallet and hand over another ten.</p><p>\u201cOh gracias, se\u00f1or,\u201d the guard says. \u201cQue generoso!\u201d But then he looks around. \u201cOnly there are two of us.\u201d</p><p>I reach back into my wallet. The well\u2019s dry. I show my empty wallet. The guard shakes his head. I realize I overplayed it back at the first gate. I should\u2019ve offered up the ten first.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s all I have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much rooms here are?\u201d he asks. \u201cTwelve hundred dollars a night. If you want me to let you in, and your friend, to enjoy the pools, the beaches, the tennis, the buffets, you have to pay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBuffets?\u201d Broodje interrupts.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d I whisper. To the guard I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care about any of that. We\u2019re just trying to find a guest here.\u201d</p><p>The guard raises his eyebrow. \u201cIf you know guests, why you sneak in like a thief? You think just because you have white skin, and a ten-dollar bill, we think you are rich?\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s an old trick, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to sneak anything. I\u2019m trying to find a girl. An American girl. She might be staying here.\u201d</p><p>This makes the guard laugh even harder. \u201cAn American girl? I\u2019d like one of those, too. They cost more than ten dollars.\u201d</p><p>We glare at each other. \u201cGive me my money back,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cWhat money?\u201d the guard asks.</p><p>I\u2019m furious when we get back to the bike. Broodje, too, is muttering about getting ripped off that thirty dollars. But I don\u2019t care about the money, and it\u2019s not the guards I\u2019m mad at.</p><p>I keep replaying a conversation with Lulu in my head. Then one when she\u2019d told me about Mexico. About how frustrating it was to go to the same resort with her family every year. I\u2019d told her maybe she should go off the grid next time she went to Canc\u00fan. \u201cTempt fate,\u201d I\u2019d said. \u201cSee what happens.\u201d Then I\u2019d joked that maybe I\u2019d go to Mexico one day, too, bump into her, and we\u2019d escape into the wilds, having no idea at the time that this silly aside would become a mission of sorts. \u201cYou think that would happen?\u201d she\u2019d asked. \u201cWe\u2019d just randomly bump into each other?\u201d I\u2019d told her it would have to be another big accident and she\u2019d teased back: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying I\u2019m an accident?\u201d</p><p>After I told her that she was, she\u2019d said something strange. She\u2019d said that me calling her an accident might be the most flattering thing anyone has ever said about her. She wasn\u2019t simply fishing for compliments. She was revealing something with that honesty of hers, so completely disarming it was like she was stripping not just herself bare but me, too. When she said that, it had made me feel as if I\u2019d been entrusted with something very important. And it also made me sad, because I sensed it was true. And if it was, it was wrong.</p><p>I\u2019ve flattered lots of girls, many who deserved it, many who didn\u2019t. Lulu deserved it, she deserved so much more flattery than being called an accident. So I opened my mouth to say something nice. What came out, I think, surprised us both. I told her that she was the sort of person who found money and returned it, who cried in movies you weren\u2019t meant to cry in, who did things that scared her. I wasn\u2019t even sure where these things were coming from, only that as I said them, I was certain that they were true. Because improbable as it was, I knew her.</p><p>Only now it strikes me how wrong I was. I didn\u2019t know her at all. And I didn\u2019t ask the simplest of questions, like where she stayed in Mexico or when she visited or what her last name was, or what her first name was. And as a result, here I am, at the mercy of security guards.</p><p>We ride back to our hostel in the dusty part of Playa del Carmen, full of stray dogs and rundown shops. The cantina next door serves cheap beer and fish tacos. We order several of each. A couple of travelers from our hostel roll in. Broodje waves them over, and he starts telling them about our day, embellishing it so that it almost sounds fun. It\u2019s how all good travel stories are born. Nightmares spun into punch lines. But my frustration is too fresh to make anything seem funny.</p><p>Marjorie, a pretty Canadian girl, clucks sympathetically. A British girl named Cassandra, with short spiky brown hair, laments the state of poverty in Mexico and the failures of NAFTA, while T.J., a sunburnt guy from Texas, just laughs. \u201cI seen that place Maya del Sol. It\u2019s like Disneyland on the Riviera.\u201d</p> <p>At the table behind us, I hear someone snicker. \u201cM\u00e1s como Disneyland del infierno.\u201d</p><p>I turn around. \u201cYou know the place?\u201d I ask in Spanish.</p><p>\u201cWe work there,\u201d the taller one answers in Spanish.</p><p>I put out my hand. \u201cWillem,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cEsteban,\u201d he answers.</p><p>\u201cJos\u00e9,\u201d says the shorter. They\u2019re a bit of a spaghetti-and-meatball pair, too.</p><p>\u201cAny chance you can sneak me in?\u201d</p><p>Esteban shakes his head. \u201cNot without risking my job. But there\u2019s an easy way to get in. They\u2019ll pay you to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Esteban asks me if I have a credit card.</p><p>I pull out my wallet and show him my brand new Visa, a gift from the bank after my large deposit.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good,\u201d Esteban says. Then he looks at my outfit, a t-shirt and a beat-up pair of kakis. \u201cYou\u2019ll also need better clothes. Not these surfer things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Then what?\u201d</p><p>Esteban explains how Canc\u00fan is full of sales reps trying to get people into those resorts to buy a timeshare. They hang out at car-rental places, in the airports, even at some of the ruins. \u201cIf they think you have money, they\u2019ll invite you to take a tour. They\u2019ll even pay you for your trouble, money, free tours, massages.\u201d</p><p>I explain this all to Broodje.</p><p>\u201cSounds too good to be true,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no too good, and it is true,\u201d Jos\u00e9 answers in English. \u201cSo many people buy, make such a big decision after just one day.\u201d He shakes his head, in wonderment, or disgust, or both.</p><p>\u201cFools and their money,\u201d T.J. says, laughing. \u201cSo y\u2019all gotta look like you\u2019re loaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is loaded!\u201d Broodje says. \u201cWhat does it matter what he looks like?\u201d</p><p>Jos\u00e9 says, \u201cNo matter what you is; only matter what you seem.\u201d</p><p>I buy Broodje and myself some linen pants and button-up shirts for next to nothing and spend a ridiculous amount on a couple of pairs of Armani sunglasses from one of the stalls in the touristy section of town.</p><p>Broodje is aghast at the cost of the glasses. But I tell him they\u2019re necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s the little details that tell the big story.\u201d That was what Tor always said, to explain why we had such minimal costumes in Guerilla Will.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big story?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re slacker playboys with trust funds, renting a house on Isla Mujeres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, aside from the house, you\u2019re pretending to be you?\u201d</p><p>The next day is Christmas so we wait until the day after to set off. At the first car rental agency, we\u2019ve practically rented a car by the time we realize that there\u2019s no one there offering us a tour. At the second car rental agency, we\u2019re met by a smiling, big-toothed American blonde who asks us how long we\u2019re in town for and where we\u2019re staying.</p><p>\u201cOh, I love the Isla,\u201d she purrs after we tell her about our villa. \u201cHave you eaten at Mango yet?\u201d</p><p>Broodje looks mildly panicked but I just give a little smile. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cDoes your villa come with a cook?\u201d</p><p>I just continue to smile, a little bashfully this time, as if the largesse embarrasses me.</p><p>\u201cWait. Are you renting the white adobe place with the infinity pool?\u201d</p><p>Again, I smile. Little nod.</p><p>\u201cSo Rosa is the cook there?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, I don\u2019t need to. An embarrassed shrug will do.</p><p>\u201cOh, I love that place. And Rosa\u2019s mole is divine. Just thinking about it makes me hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always hungry,\u201d Broodje says, leering. She looks at him quizzically. I give him a discreet kick.</p><p>\u201cThat place is very expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cHave you ever considered buying something down here?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cToo much responsibility,\u201d says Willem, Millionaire Playboy.</p><p>She nods, as if she too understands the burdens of juggling multiple properties. \u201cYes. But there is another way. You can own, and have someone else take care it for you, even rent it out for you.\u201d She pulls out glossy brochures of several different hotels\u2014including the Maya del Sol.</p><p>I glance at the brochures, scratching my chin. \u201cYou know, I heard about such an investment for tax-sheltering purposes,\u201d I say, channeling Marjolein now.</p><p>\u201cOh, fantastic moneymaker and money saver. You really should see one of these properties.\u201d</p><p>I pretend to casually glance at the brochures. \u201cThis one looks nice,\u201d I say, flicking a finger at the Maya del Sol brochure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sinfully decadent.\u201d She starts telling me all the things I know about the place, about the beach and the pools and the restaurants and the movie theater and the golf. I feign disinterest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, at least take a tour!\u201d She\u2019s practically pleading now. \u201cYou could even do one today.\u201d</p><p>I heave a big sigh and allow my eyes to flicker toward her for a brief minute. \u201cWe\u2019d planned to see the ruins. That\u2019s why we\u2019re renting a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can arrange a free tour of the ruins for you.\u201d She reaches for another brochure. \u201cThis one goes to Coba, and you swim in a cenote and go on a zip line. I can throw that in for you two. Gratis.\u201d</p><p>I pause, as if considering it.</p><p>\u201cLook, you can go, spend the day.\u201d She beckons me closer. \u201cDon\u2019t tell them I told you but you could even spend the night. Once you get past the gates, you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>I look at Broodje, as if seeking his permission to do the girl this favor and take her tour. He gamely plays along, giving me a put-upon look that says, well, if you must.</p><p>I crack a smile at the girl and she positively beams in return. \u201cOh, fantastic!\u201d She starts to write us up the paperwork, all the while chatting about the tour we\u2019ll go on. \u201cAnd when you get back on the Isla, you must go to Mango. The brunches are to die for.\u201d She looks up from her paperwork. \u201cMaybe I can take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I allow.</p><p>\u201cWill you still be here for New Year\u2019s?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, open my hands, as if to suggest so many, many options.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this great party on the beach at Puerto Morelos. Las Olas de Molas, this wild reggae band are playing. It\u2019s usually the best thing going in all of the Playa. A lot of us dance all night, and sometimes catch a ferry to the Isla for hangover brunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cI\u2019ll cross my fingers. Here\u2019s everything you need for your tours,\u201d she says, handing me some paperwork, as well as a card with her personal cell phone number on it. \u201cI\u2019m Kayla. Call me if you need anything. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>The same sweating, sweater-vested security guards are manning the gate to Maya del Sol, but they don\u2019t recognize us. Or they don\u2019t care. In the backseat of a taxi, with official paperwork in triplicate in hand, I am transformed.</p><p>We are deposited in the front lobby, an enormous atrium full of bamboo, flowers, and tropical birds tied to perches. We sit down on a wicker loveseat while a burnished Mexican woman takes our IDs and makes copies of my credit card. Then we are delivered to an older Mexican man with a flip of golden hair held back by a pair of tortoiseshell Ray-Bans.</p><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d he says. \u201cMy name is Johnny Maximo, and I\u2019m here to tell you that at Maya del Sol, fantasy becomes reality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what he\u2019s hoping for,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>Johnny grins. He glances at the piece of paper in hand. \u201cSo, William, Robert. Is it Robert or Bob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert-Jan, actually,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cRobert then. Have you ever owned a vacation property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, William?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a see-the-world kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>Johnny laughs. \u201cMe, too. See all the ladies of the world. So I take it you two bachelors have never to been to a vacation club before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that I have, Johnny,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cI am telling you: this is the life. Why rent your vacation when you can own it? Why live half a life when you can live a whole one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr two lives, even,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cHere is one of our pools. We have six of them,\u201d Johnny brags. It\u2019s surrounded by chaise longues and flowering shrubs. Beyond, the Caribbean glitters as if its sole purpose is to be a backdrop. \u201cThe view is nice, no?\u201d Johnny laughs, pointing to a row of sunbathing women.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I say, scanning them, one by one.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you do, William?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReal estate,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAhh, so you already know how lucrative it is. You know . . .\u201d He motions me closer. \u201cI used to be a big movie star in Mexico,\u201d he says in an exaggerated whisper. \u201cBut now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an actor?\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>This catches him off guard. \u201cBefore. But I make more money as an owner here than I ever did in the film business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat films were you in?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing you\u2019d ever hear of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get lots of foreign films in Holland. Try me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d hear of them. I was in a film with Armand Assante. Mostly I was in the telenovelas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoap operas? Like Good Times, Bad Times,\u201d Broodje says, scoffing a little.</p><p>\u201cHere, they are taken very seriously,\u201d Johnny says with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d I say. \u201cThat you made your living like that.\u201d</p><p>For a second, Johnny\u2019s face flattens out. Even his tan seems to fade. And then he snaps to. \u201cThat was then. I make so much more money now.\u201d He claps his hands together and turns toward me. \u201cSo, William, what would you like to see?\u201d He gestures out toward the grounds, and I have this first inkling, tiny but real, that she might be here. It\u2019s a small thing, but somehow it\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve felt in months.</p><p>\u201cEvery single centimeter of the resort,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, we are more than one square kilometer so that might take a while, but I am glad to see you are so motivated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you have no idea how motivated I am.\u201d Which is a funny thing to say because I wasn\u2019t that motivated yesterday. But now it\u2019s like I\u2019ve switched into character.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we start with one of our world-class restaurants. We have eight. Mexican, Italian, burger bar, sushi . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you show us the one that is the most popular for guests having lunch at this time,\u201d I suggest. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the makeup of the crowds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that would be Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, our open-air cantina. It has a lunch buffet.\u201d</p><p>Broodje grins. Lunch buffet. Magic words.</p><p>Lulu is not at the lunch buffet, or any of the seven other restaurants we visit during our five-hour tour. She\u2019s not at any of the six pools or the two beaches or the twelve tennis courts or the two nightclubs or the three lobbies or the Zen day spa or the endless gardens. She\u2019s not at the petting zoo, either.</p><p>As the day lags on, I realize there are just too many variables. Maybe this is the wrong place. Or maybe this is the right place, but it\u2019s the wrong time. Or maybe it\u2019s the right place and the right time but she was watching TV in her room when I was at the pool. Maybe right now she is sitting by one of the pools while I\u2019m looking at one of the model rooms.</p><p>Or maybe I walked right past her and I didn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>The good feeling from earlier begins to collapse in on itself. She could be anywhere. She could be nowhere. And worst of all, she could be right here and I didn\u2019t even recognize her.</p><p>A couple of girls in bikinis sashay past me, laughing. Broodje nudges me but I barely look at them. I\u2019m beginning to think that I\u2019ve talked myself into a lie of my own telling. Because the truth is I don\u2019t know her. All I know is that she\u2019s a girl who bears a passing resemblance to Louise Brooks. But what is that? The contours of a person, but really no more real that a fantasy projected onto a screen.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>\u201cCheer up, hombre, it\u2019s almost a new year.\u201d</p><p>Esteban hands me a bottle. He, Jos\u00e9, Broodje, Cassandra, and I are crammed into a taxi, crawling through holiday traffic as we head north to that party in Puerto Morelos, the one Kayla told me about. Jos\u00e9 and Esteban know about it, too, so apparently it really is the place to be.</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s,\u201d Cassandra says.</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t go home empty-handed if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cUnlike some of us,\u201d he adds, full of exaggerated self-pity.</p><p>\u201cPoor Broodje,\u201d Cassandra says. \u201cAm I saying it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBro-djuh,\u201d Broodje corrects, adding, \u201cit means sandwich.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sandwich Boy. We\u2019ll make sure somebody takes a bite out of you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she wants a bite of my sandwich,\u201d Broodje says in Dutch, grinning at the prospect. I attempt a smile back. But really, I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve been done since Maya del Sol, though I have dutifully checked out a few other resorts, thanks to Jos\u00e9 and Esteban, who told me how to get into Palacio Maya and got me wristbands for Maya Vieja. But it\u2019s felt like going through the motions. I don\u2019t even know who I\u2019m looking for, so how am I going to find her?</p><p>The taxi skids onto a strip of undeveloped beach. We pay the driver and emerge onto a scene. Music throbs from huge speakers, and hundreds of people are scattered up and down the beach. Everyone seems to be barefoot, judging by the enormous piles of shoes right at the entrance to the party.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can find by her shoe,\u201d Cassandra says. \u201cLike Cinderella. What would a glass slipper for the modern girl look like? How about this?\u201d She holds up a pair of shiny orange flip-flops. She tries them on. \u201cToo big,\u201d she says, flinging them back onto the piles.</p><p>\u201cWould beautiful lady like to dance?\u201d Jos\u00e9 asks Cassandra.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she says, grinning. They walk away, Jos\u00e9 already with a hand on her hip.</p><p>Broodje\u2019s face falls. \u201cI guess his taco was more appetizing than my sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you keep reminding me, there are lots of girls. I\u2019m sure one of them will want a bite of your sandwich.\u201d</p><p>And there are so many girls. Hundreds of them, in all shapes and colors, perfumed and primed for partying. On any other New Year\u2019s, it would be a promising start.</p><p>The line for the bar snakes all the way around the palm trees and hammocks. We\u2019re inching our way forward when a girl wearing a sarong, a smile, and not much else stumbles into me.</p><p>\u201cSteady there,\u201d I say, righting her by the elbow. She holds up a half-empty bottle of tequila, curtseys, and takes a long slug.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to pace yourself,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pace me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I take the bottle from her and swig. I hand it to Broodje who does the same. He gives the bottle back to her.</p><p>She holds it up, swishes it around so the larva inside somersaults. \u201cYou can have the worm, if you want to,\u201d she says in a slurry voice. \u201cWorm, worm, can the hottie eat you?\u201d She holds the bottle up to her ear. \u201cThe worm says yes.\u201d She leans in closer, and in a hot whisper adds, \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really a worm,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cIt\u2019s an agave larva.\u201d Jose is a bartender and he explained this all to us.</p><p>Her eyes roll unfocussed in her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s the diff? Worm, larva. You know what they say? The early bird gets the worm.\u201d She hands Broodje the bottle, then puts both arms on my shoulder and kisses me, fast, wet, and boozy, on the mouth. She reels back, grabbing her tequila bottle. \u201cGets the kiss, too,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cHappy New Year.\u201d</p><p>Broodje and I watch her stumble through the sand. Then he turns to me. \u201cI forgot what it\u2019s like, being out with you. What you\u2019re like.\u201d</p><p>Six months ago, I\u2019d have kissed the girl back, and the night would be set. Broodje may know what I\u2019m like, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>When we get our drinks, Broodje makes his way toward the dance area. I tell him I\u2019ll meet up with him later. Up the beach, away from the stage and dance area, I spot a small bonfire with a group of people sitting around it, strumming on guitars. I start off in that direction, but then I see someone walking toward me. Kayla of the car rental agency, waving tentatively, as if she\u2019s not sure it\u2019s really me.</p><p>I pretend to not be me, and pivot toward the shoreline. As crowded and chaotic as the party is, the water is surprisingly quiet. There are a few people splashing about. Farther out, it\u2019s empty, just moonlight reflecting on the water. Even at night, the water is bluer than I imagined it; it\u2019s the only part of this trip that is coming close to meeting expectations.</p><p>I strip down to my boxers and dive in, swimming far out, until I reach a floating raft. I grip the splintering wood. The sounds of the guitars strumming \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d and the heavy bass of a reggae band reverberate through the water. It\u2019s a good party, on a beautiful beach, on a soft, warm night. All the things that used to be enough.</p><p>I swim out a little farther and duck back under. Tiny silvery fish zip by. I reach out to touch them, but they whip out of reach so fast it\u2019s like they\u2019re leaving contrails behind. When I can\u2019t hold my breath any longer, I come up for air to hear the reggae singer announce: \u201cHalf hour until the New Year. Until it all starts again. A\u00f1o nuevo. It\u2019s a tabula rasa.\u201d</p><p>I take a breath and go back under. I scoop up a handful of sand and let it go, watching the grains disperse in the water. I come back up.</p><p>\u201cCome the stroke of midnight, before you kiss your amor, save un beso para t\u00ed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A kiss for you.</p><p>Moments before I\u2019d kissed her for the first time, Lulu had said another one of her strange things: I escaped danger. She was emphatic about it, her eyes had a fire to them, just as they had when she\u2019d come between me and the skinheads. It had seemed a peculiar thing to say. Until I\u2019d kissed her. And then I felt it, as visceral and all-encompassing as the water around me now. Escaping danger. I\u2019m not sure what danger she\u2019d been referring to. All I knew was that kissing Lulu made me feel relief, like I\u2019d landed somewhere after a long journey.</p><p>I turn onto my back, looking at the canvas of a star-spangled sky.</p><p>\u201cTabula rasa . . . time to hacer borr\u00f3n y cuenta nueva, wipe the board clean,\u201d the singer chants.</p> <p>Wipe the board clean? I feel like my board is too clean, perpetually wiped bare. What I want is the opposite: a messy scrawl, constellations of indelible things that can\u2019t ever be washed away.</p><p>She must be here. Maybe not at this party, or on this beach, or at the resorts I visited, but somewhere here. Swimming in this water, the same water I\u2019m in now.</p><p>But it\u2019s a big ocean. It\u2019s an even bigger world. And maybe we\u2019ve gotten as close as we\u2019re supposed to get.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>JANUARY</p> <p>Canc\u00fan</p><p>The bus is shaped like a monkey, it\u2019s full of old people, and I don\u2019t want to be on it. But Broodje does, and after dragging him to half the resorts on the Mayan Riviera, I\u2019m not one to argue.</p><p>\u201cFirst stop, Coba, then we go to a Mayan village. Then a zip line\u2014not sure about these folks and a zip line,\u201d Broodje says, nodding to our mostly gray-haired tour mates. \u201cThen swimming in a cenote\u2014it\u2019s a kind of underground cave lake\u2014then Tulum.\u201d He flips the brochure around. \u201cThis tour costs a hundred and fifty dollars per person and we got it for free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re Dutch on one side, Israeli on the other. By all rights, this should make you the cheapest bastard alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh-huh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHungover more like. When we stop for lunch, we\u2019ll get some tequila. Hair of the dog is what T.J. calls it.\u201d</p><p>I bunch my rucksack into a makeshift pillow and lean my head against the window. Broodje pulls out a copy of Voetbal International. The bus chugs off. I fall asleep, waking when we arrive at Coba. We plod off the bus, standing in a little clump as the guide tells us about the ancient Mayan ruins, a series of isolated temples and pyramids half overtaken by the trees and vines of the jungle. \u201cIt\u2019s very unique,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of the few ruins you can still climb. And you\u2019ll also be interested in the lagoon, La Iglesia, or church, and of course, the ball courts.\u201d</p><p>Behind us, a girl, the only other person our age, asks, \u201cBall courts? What kind of ball did they play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sort of basketball,\u201d the guide answers.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sounds disappointed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like basketball?\u201d Broodje asks her. \u201cI thought Americans loved basketball.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a soccer player,\u201d an older woman says. \u201cShe was all-state in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNana!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What position?\u201d Broodje asks.</p><p>\u201cStriker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidfield.\u201d He taps his chest.</p><p>They look at each other. \u201cWanna go check out the ball courts?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe back in a half hour, Candace,\u201d the older lady says.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Broodje looks at me to come, but I nod for him to go alone. When the rest of the tour sets off toward the lagoon, I turn straight for the Nohoch Mul pyramid, climbing the 120 near-vertical steps to the top. It\u2019s midday and hot so there\u2019s hardly anyone up here, just a family taking pictures. It\u2019s still enough for the quiet to be loud: the rustle of the breeze in the trees, the squawk of tropical birds, the metallic chirp of crickets. A gust of hot wind picks up a dry leaf and carries it over the jungle canopy.</p><p>The stillness is interrupted by a couple of kids, who have started shouting each other\u2019s names in bird chirps. \u201cJosh!\u201d the girl squawks, as her brother laughs.</p><p>\u201cAllie!\u201d the boy, Josh, presumably, chirps back.</p><p>\u201cJoshua, Allison, shh,\u201d their mother chides, gesturing to me. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only ones up here.\u201d</p><p>The kids look at me, cocking their heads, as if inviting me to call out a name, too. I hold up my hands and shrug because I don\u2019t actually know the name I want to yell. I\u2019m not even sure I want to yell it anymore.</p><p>Back at the Monkey Bus, I find Broodje and Candace sharing a Coke, one bottle, two straws. When we lumber back on board, I slip into a seat next to an older man traveling solo, allowing Broodje and Candace to sit together in our row. When I hear them arguing about whether Van Persie or Messi is the best striker, I smile, and my gentleman seatmate smiles back.</p><p>After lunch, we stop at a traditional Mayan village and are given the option of a ten-dollar spiritual cleansing by a Mayan priest. I stay off to the side as the others take turns standing under a smoking canopy. Then we\u2019re herded back on the bus. The doors wheeze open. Broodje climbs on, Candace climbs on, my seatmate with the sandals and the socks climbs on, the guide climbs on. Everyone climbs on, except me.</p><p>\u201cWilly, you coming?\u201d Broodje calls.</p><p>He sees me hesitating by the door and comes back down the aisle to talk to me. \u201cWilly, all is good? Are you mad that I\u2019m sitting with Candace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I do the calculations in my mind. Candace said she was in town until the eighth, longer than we are. Broodje will have company.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting off here.\u201d As soon as I say it, I feel that familiar relief. When you\u2019re on the road, there is always the promise of the next stop being better than the last.</p><p>His face goes serious. \u201cAre you staying away because of what I said before, about you getting all the girls? Don\u2019t worry. I think one actually likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of it. So you should make the most of it. I\u2019ll see you back at the airport for the flight home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s in four days. And you don\u2019t have your things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have what I need. Just bring the rest to the airport.\u201d</p><p>The bus driver guns the engine. The guide taps her watch. Broodje looks panicked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I reassure him, tightening the straps on my rucksack.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get lost?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I paste on a reassuring smile. But of course, the truth is, that is exactly what I intend to do.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Valladolid, Mexico</p><p>Two hitched truck rides later, I find myself on the outskirts of Valladolid, a small colonial town. I wander around the central square, full of low-rise, pastel colonial buildings reflecting in a large fountain. Soon I stumble upon a cheap hotel.</p><p>It feels a world away from the Mayan Riviera here. Not just the lack of megaresorts or partying tourists, but how I got here. Not looking, just finding.</p><p>I have no schedule. I sleep when I\u2019m tired, eat when I\u2019m hungry, grabbing something hot and spicy from one of the food carts. I linger late into the night. I don\u2019t look for anyone. I don\u2019t talk to anyone. After the last few months on Bloemstraat, the boys always around, or if not them, Ana Lucia, I\u2019m not used to being alone.</p><p>I sit at the edge of the fountain and watch people and, for a minute, indulge myself imagining Lulu being one of them, imagining that we really had escaped into the wilds of Mexico. Is this where we\u2019d go? Would we sit at a caf\u00e9, our ankles intertwined, our heads close, like that couple over there under the umbrella? Would we walk all night, ducking into the alleyways to steal a kiss? Would we wake up the next morning, untangle our bodies, pull out a map, close our eyes and decide where to next? Or would we just never get out of bed?</p><p>No! Stop it! This is pointless. A road nowhere. I get up, brush off my pants and return to the hotel. Lying in bed, I spin a twenty-peso coin around my knuckles and ponder what to do next. When the coin falls to the floor, I reach for it. And then I stop. Heads, I\u2019ll stay in Valladolid another day. Tails, I\u2019ll move on. Tails.</p><p>It\u2019s not pointing at the map. But it\u2019ll do.</p><p>The next morning I go downstairs in search of coffee. The worn dining room is practically empty\u2014one Spanish-speaking family at one table, and in the corner by the window, a pretty woman about my age with hair the color of rust.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering about you,\u201d she calls in English. She sounds American.</p><p>I pour some coffee from the samovar. \u201cI often wonder about me, too,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI saw you last night at the food carts. I\u2019ve been trying to brave up to eat at them, but I wasn\u2019t sure what they were serving or if it would kill a gringo like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was pork. I don\u2019t ask too many questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d She laughs. \u201cAnd whatever doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u201d</p><p>We stand there for a second. I gesture to join her at the same time she gestures for me to take a seat. I sit down across from her. A waiter in a tired tuxedo drops off a plate of Mexican sweet bread.</p><p>\u201cCareful there,\u201d she says, flicking at her own stale bread with a turquoise-painted nail. \u201cI almost chipped a tooth.\u201d</p><p>I knock at it. It sounds like a hollow log. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, some kind of a professional adventure eater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d She holds up a hand. \u201cNo, wait, let me guess. Say something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else?\u201d</p><p>She taps a finger to her temple, then snaps her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re Dutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much of an accent, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good ear. I grew up speaking English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you live in England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was just my mother didn\u2019t like speaking Dutch, thought it sounded too much like German. So at home, it was English.\u201d</p><p>She glances at the phone on the table. \u201cWell, I suspect there is a fascinating story behind that, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll have to remain a mystery.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m a day late already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor M\u00e9rida. I was supposed to be there yesterday, but my car broke down, and, well, it\u2019s been a cascading comedy of errors. What about you? Where are you headed?\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cM\u00e9rida\u2014if you\u2019ll give me a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what would piss off David more\u2014driving alone or giving a ride to strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem.\u201d I hold out my hand. \u201cNow I\u2019m not a stranger.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes at my outstretched hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to do better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m Willem de Ruiter.\u201d I reach into my backpack for my stiff new passport and hand it over. \u201cHere\u2019s some identification.\u201d</p><p>She flips through it. \u201cNice picture, Willem. I\u2019m Kate. Kate Roebling. And I\u2019m not showing you my passport because the picture is very unfortunate. You\u2019ll just have to trust me on that.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and slides my passport back across the table. \u201cOkay, then, Willem de Ruiter, traveling adventure-eater. The garage just opened so I\u2019m grabbing the car. Assuming it\u2019s actually ready, I\u2019ll be hitting the road in about a half hour. Does that give you time to get packed and ready to go?\u201d</p><p>I point to my rucksack on the floor next to me. \u201cI\u2019m always packed and ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Kate picks me up in a sputtering Volkswagen jeep, the seats torn, the foam stuffing coming out. \u201cThis is fixed?\u201d I ask, climbing in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just cosmetic.

We do productions, but also training and teaching programs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not impressive at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? I never meant to be quite so ambitious, but when my friends and I moved to New York, we couldn\u2019t get the kind of roles we wanted, so we started our own company. And it\u2019s just kind of grown. We produce our own plays and we teach, and now we\u2019ve started this overseas initiative. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in Mexico. We\u2019re running a workshop on Shakespeare in M\u00e9rida in conjunction with Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teaching Shakespeare in Spanish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not, because I don\u2019t speak a lick of Spanish. I\u2019ll work with the English speakers. David, my fianc\u00e9, he speaks Spanish. Though the funny thing is, even when we do the Shakespeare in translation, I somehow know where we are in the plays. Maybe because I know them so well. Or because Shakespeare transcends language.\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cThe first time I did Shakespeare, I did it in French.\u201d</p><p>She turns to me. Her eyes are green, bright as autumn apples, and there\u2019s a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose. \u201cYou did Shakespeare then? And in French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly in English, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good for a not-serious actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was any good.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cOh, I can tell you were good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I have a Spidey-sense for these things.\u201d She pulls out a package of gum, takes a stick, and offers me a piece. It tastes like talcum powder and coconuts and makes my still-churning stomach rebel a little bit more. I spit it out.</p><p>\u201cVile, right? Yet strangely addictive.\u201d She pops a second piece. \u201cSo how in the world did a Dutchman wind up doing Shakespeare in French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was traveling. I was broke. I was in Lyon. I met this Shakespeare troupe called Guerrilla Will. They mostly performed in English but the director is a little . . . eccentric and she thought the way to one-up the other street performers was to do Shakespeare in the native language. She\u2019d cobbled together a cast of French speakers to do Much Ado About Nothing in France, in French. But the guy who\u2019d been playing Claudio ran off to be with some Norwegian guy he\u2019d met; everyone was already doubling up parts so they just needed someone who could get by in French. And I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never done Shakespeare before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never acted before. I\u2019d been traveling with an acrobatic troupe. So when I tell you it was all by accident, I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did other plays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Much Ado was a disaster but we ran it for four nights before Tor realized it. Then Guerrilla Will switched back to English and I stayed on. It was decent money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re one of those. Doing Shakespeare just for the money,\u201d she jokes. \u201cYou whore.\u201d</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo what other plays did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomeo and Juliet, of course. A Midsummer\u2019s Night Dream. All\u2019s Well That Ends Well. Twelfth Night. All the crowd-pleasers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Twelfth Night; we\u2019re talking about doing that next year when we have time. We just closed a two-year off-Broadway run of Cymbeline and we\u2019ve been touring it. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it, but I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, funny, romantic play and there\u2019s lots of music in it. At least the way we do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs, too. We had a drum circle in our Twelfth Night.\u201d</p><p>She glimpses at me sidelong as she keeps her eyes on the road. \u201cOur Twelfth Night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheirs. Guerrilla Will\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the whore fell in love with the john.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No falling in love,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBut you miss it?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ve moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d We\u2019re quiet for a while. Then she says, \u201cDo you do that a lot? Move on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But only because I travel a lot.\u201d</p><p>She taps out a beat on the steering wheel, audible only to herself. \u201cOr maybe you travel a lot because it lets you move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet again. Then: \u201cSo are you moving on now? Is that what brought you to the grand metropolis of Valladolid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The wind just blew me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Like a plastic bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to think of myself as a ship. Like a sailboat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut sailboats aren\u2019t steered by the wind; they\u2019re powered by it. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>I look out the window. The jungle is everywhere. I look back at her. \u201cCan you move on from something when you\u2019re not sure what it is you\u2019re moving on from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can move on from absolutely anything,\u201d she replies. \u201cBut that does sound a little complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I say. \u201cComplicated.\u201d</p><p>Kate doesn\u2019t answer, and the silence stretches out, shimmery, like the road ahead of us.</p><p>\u201cAnd a long story,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long drive,\u201d she replies.</p><p>There\u2019s something about Kate that reminds me of Lulu. Maybe it\u2019s just that they\u2019re both American or how we met: during journeys, talking food.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s because in a few hours, I\u2019ll never see her again. There\u2019s nothing to lose. So as we drive, I tell Kate the story of that day, but it\u2019s a different version from the one I told Broodje and the boys. You play to your audience, Tor always said. Which is maybe why I can tell Kate the parts of the story that I didn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014tell Broodje and the boys. \u201cIt was like she knew me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cStraightaway, she knew me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>I tell Kate about Lulu thinking I\u2019d deserted her on the train when I\u2019d spent too long in the caf\u00e9. Hysterically laughing, and then out of the blue\u2014my glimmer of her strange honesty\u2014telling me she\u2019d thought I\u2019d got off the train.</p><p>\u201cWere you going to?\u201d Kate asks, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d I answer. And I wasn\u2019t, but the memory of it still shames me because of what I was going to do later.</p><p>\u201cSo how did she see you, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she couldn\u2019t understand why I invited her without an ulterior motive.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughs. \u201cI hardly think you wanting to sleep with a pretty girl qualifies as an ulterior motive.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to sleep with her, of course. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the ulterior motive. I invited her to Paris because I didn\u2019t want to go back to Holland that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurches again. Bram, gone. Yael, all but gone. The houseboat, a signature away from gone. I force a smile. \u201cThat is a much longer story and I\u2019m not done with this one.\u201d</p><p>I tell Kate the double happiness story Lulu told me. About the Chinese boy traveling to take some important exam, and along the way, falling sick. About the mountain doctor taking care of him. About the doctor\u2019s daughter telling him this strange line of verse. About the emperor who, after the boy does well on the exam, recites a mysterious line to him. About the boy immediately recognizing the line as the other half of what the girl told him, and repeating the line the girl had told him, pleasing the emperor, getting the job, going back, and marrying the girl. About double happiness.</p><p>\u201cGreen trees against the sky in the spring rain while the sky set off the spring trees in the obscuration. Red flowers dot the land in the breeze\u2019s chase while the land colored up in red after the kiss.\u201d That had been the couplet. As soon as Lulu told it to me, there had been something instantly familiar about it, even though I\u2019d never heard it before, never heard the story before. Unknown and familiar. Which, by that point, was how Lulu was seeming.</p><p>I tell Kate about Lulu asking who took care of me\u2014as if she knew the answer\u2014and then doing it herself. Stepping between me and the skinheads. Throwing that book. Distracting them so we could get away before we got hurt. Only she got hurt. Even now, the memory of the blood on her neck from when one of the skinheads threw the bottle at her, after all these months, it makes me sick. And ashamed. I don\u2019t tell Kate that.</p><p>\u201cThat was very brave of her,\u201d Kate says when I tell her what Lulu did.</p><p>Saba used to say there was a difference between bravery and courage. Bravery was doing something dangerous without thinking. Courage was walking into danger, knowing full well the risks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell Kate. \u201cIt was courageous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou both were courageous.\u201d</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t. Because I tried to send Lulu back. Cowardly. And then I didn\u2019t manage to. Cowardly. I don\u2019t tell Kate this part either.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here in Mexico to do what?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I think of the boys. They think I\u2019m here to inoculate myself. To find Lulu, sleep with her a few more times, and get on with things.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . find her. At the very least, set the record straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat record? You left a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d I almost say it. Then I stop myself.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Kate asks.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . I didn\u2019t come back,\u201d I finish.</p><p>Kate looks at me for a long moment. The car starts to drift off the road before she returns her attention to driving.</p><p>\u201cWillem, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, Canc\u00fan is back that way?\u201d She points in the reverse direction. I nod. \u201cThe chances of you finding this girl seem unfavorable enough without you going to an entirely different city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to happen. I could tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t ever find things when you\u2019re looking for them. You find them when you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were true, nobody would ever find their keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot keys. The bigger things.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. On one hand, you put all this faith into these accidents of yours, and on the other hand, you write off the chance of one even happening.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write it off. I came all the way to Canc\u00fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd promptly went to M\u00e9rida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to find her. By looking.\u201d I shake my head. It\u2019s hard to explain this part. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeant to be,\u201d Kate scoffs. \u201cExcuse me but I\u2019m having a hard time buying all this woo-woo stuff.\u201d She waves her arms in the air and I have to reach out for the steering wheel until she takes it again. \u201cNothing happens without intention, Willem. Nothing. This theory of yours\u2014life is ruled by accidents\u2014isn\u2019t that just one huge excuse for passivity?\u201d</p> <p>I start to disagree, but then the image of Ana Lucia flits through my head. Right place at the right time. It had seemed like a fortuitous accident back then. Now, it feels more like surrender.</p><p>\u201cHow do you explain us?\u201d I point back and forth to me and her. \u201cRight now, right here, having this conversation, if not for accidents? If not because your car muffler broke and put you in Valladolid, where I wasn\u2019t even meant to be?\u201d I don\u2019t mention the flipped coin being a deciding factor, even though it would seem to support my case.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, don\u2019t go falling in love with me.\u201d She laughs and taps the ring on her finger. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t discount a magical hand of fate. I am an actor, after all, and a Shakespearian, no less. But it can\u2019t be the ruling force of your life. You have to be the driver. And by the way, yes, we are having this conversation because my car\u2014lovely, sweet car that you are,\u201d she baby talks, stroking the dashboard, \u201chad some mechanical issues. But you were the one who asked me for a ride, persuaded me to give you a ride, so you discredit your own theory right there. That was pure will, Willem. Sometimes fate or life or whatever you want to call it, leaves a door a little open and you walk through it. But sometimes it locks the door and you have to find the key, or pick the lock, or knock the damn thing down. And sometimes, it doesn\u2019t even show you the door, and you have to build it yourself. But if you keep waiting for the doors to be opened for you. . . .\u201d she trails off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll have a hard time finding single happiness, let alone that double portion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to doubt that double happiness even exists,\u201d I say, thinking of my parents.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re looking for it. Doubt is part of searching. Same as faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t those opposites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re just two parts of the couplet.\u201d</p><p>It reminds me of something Saba used to say: A truth and its opposite are flip sides of the same coin. It never quite made sense to me before.</p><p>\u201cWillem, I suspect deep down you know exactly why you\u2019re here, exactly what you want, but you\u2019re unwilling to commit to it, unwilling to commit to the wanting, let alone the having. Because both of those propositions are terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>She turns to me and gives me a long, searing look. It goes on a while, and the car starts to drift. Again, I take the wheel to right us. She lets go of the wheel entirely and I grasp it with both hands.</p><p>\u201cLook there, Willem. You grabbed the wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to keep us from crashing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, you might say, to keep us from having an accident.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>M\u00e9rida, Mexico</p><p>M\u00e9rida is a bigger version of Valladolid, a colonial pastel-painted city. Kate drops me off in front of a historic peach-colored building that she has heard is a decent hostel. I book myself a room with a balcony overlooking the square and I sit out and watch people taking shelter from the afternoon sun. Shops are closing up for siesta and though I\u2019d planned to scout out the area and find some lunch, I\u2019m not actually hungry. I\u2019m a little wrung out from the morning\u2019s drive and my stomach still feels as if it\u2019s on the bumpy highway. I decide to take a siesta, too.</p><p>I wake up covered in sweat. It\u2019s dark outside, the air in my room still and stale. I sit up to open my window or the balcony door, but when I do, my stomach heaves. I flop back down on the bed and close my eyes, willing myself back to sleep. Sometimes I can trick my body into righting itself before it realizes something\u2019s wrong. Sometimes that works.</p> <p>But not tonight. I think of the pork in the brown sauce I ate for dinner last night and the memory of it makes my stomach wave and flutter, like there\u2019s a small feral animal trapped inside.</p><p>Food poisoning. It must be. I sigh. Okay. A few hours discomfort, and then sleep. Then it will be over. It\u2019s all about getting to the sleep.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure of the time so I don\u2019t know how long it takes for the sun to come up, but when it does, I haven\u2019t even touched sleep. I\u2019ve puked so many times the plastic wastebin is almost full. I tried, a few times, to crawl to the shared bathroom down the hall, but I couldn\u2019t make it past my door. Now that the sun is up, the room is heating up. I can almost see the toxic fumes from the wastebin spreading out, poisoning me all over again.</p><p>I keep throwing up. There\u2019s no respite or relief in between bouts. I puke until there\u2019s nothing left: no food, no bile, none of me left, it seems.</p><p>That\u2019s when the thirst hits. I\u2019ve long since drunk the rest of the water in my bottle, and thrown that up too. I start to fantasize about mountain streams, waterfalls, rain showers, even the Dutch canal; I\u2019d drink from those if I could. They sell bottled water downstairs. And there\u2019s a tap in the bathroom. But I can\u2019t sit up, let alone stand up, let alone make it to water.</p><p>Is anyone there? I call. In Dutch. In English. I try to remember the Spanish but the words get jumbled. I think I\u2019m talking but I can\u2019t tell and it\u2019s noisy in the square and my weak voice stands no chance.</p><p>I listen for a knock at the door, praying for an offering of water, clean sheets, a cool compress, a soft hand on my forehead. But none comes. This is a hostel, bare bones, no housekeeping, and I prepaid two nights.</p><p>I retch again. Nothing comes out except my tears. I am twenty-one years old and I still cry when I puke.</p><p>Finally, sleep comes to rescue me. And then I wake up, and I see her, so close. And all I can think is: It was worth it if it brought you.</p><p>Who takes care of you now? she whispers. Her breath feels like a cooling breeze.</p><p>You, I whisper back. You take care of me.</p><p>I\u2019ll be your mountain girl.</p><p>I try to reach for her, but now she\u2019s gone and the room is full of the others: C\u00e9line and Ana Lucia and Kayla and Sara and the girl with the worm, and there\u2019s more yet\u2014a Franke in Riga, a Gianna in Prague, a Jossra in Tunis. They all start talking at me.</p><p>We\u2019ll take care of you.</p><p>Go away, I want Lulu back. Tell her to come back.</p><p>Green turtles, red blood, blue sky, double happiness, lalala, they singsong.</p><p>No! That\u2019s not how it goes. That\u2019s not how double happiness goes.</p><p>But I can\u2019t remember how it goes either.</p><p>She left you like this.</p><p>I\u2019ll take care of you.</p><p>French whore.</p><p>Call me if you need anything.</p><p>Wanna share with me?</p><p>Stop it! I yell.</p><p>Take the wheel! Now it\u2019s Kate yelling. Only I can\u2019t see any wheel and I have the awful feeling, like in the dreams, that I\u2019m going to crash.</p><p>No! Stop. Go away! All of you! You\u2019re not real. None of you! Not even Lulu. I screw my eyes shut and cover my ears with the sweat-soaked pillow and curl up into a fetal ball. And finally, finally, like this, I fall asleep.</p><p>I wake up. My skin is cool. The sky is purple. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s twilight or dawn, how long I\u2019ve been out. I\u2019m coherent enough to know that I\u2019m supposed to be back in Canc\u00fan soon to meet Broodje and fly back to Holland, and I need to get word to him somehow, that he might have to leave without me. I swing my legs over the side of the bed. The room teeters before my eyes, but it doesn\u2019t totter over. I plant my feet. I pull to a stand. Like a toddler or a very old man, I take the steps, one at a time, to the lobby.</p><p>In the corner is an Internet caf\u00e9 where you can make long-distance phone calls. I feel like I\u2019ve been in the dark for months, the lights from all those monitors hurt my eyes so. I hand over some money and ask for a phone and am guided to a bank of computers with a telephone handset. I open my address book. Kate\u2019s card, ruckus theater company splashed across the top in red lettering, falls out.</p><p>I start to dial. The digits swim on the page and I\u2019m not sure if I have the country code right or if I dialed correctly.</p><p>But there\u2019s a tinny ring. And then a voice: faraway, tunnel-like, but unmistakably hers. As soon as I hear it, my throat closes.</p><p>\u201cHello. Hello? Who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa?\u201d I manage to croak out.</p><p>Silence. And when she says my name I want to cry.</p><p>\u201cMa,\u201d I say again.</p><p>\u201cWillem, where are you?\u201d Her voice is crisp, officious, businesslike as always.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lost?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been lost before, in new cities with no familiar landmarks to set me straight, waking up in strange beds, unsure of where I was or who was next to me. But I realize now, that wasn\u2019t lost. It was something else. This . . . I may know exactly where I am\u2014in a hostel, in the central square, in M\u00e9rida, Mexico\u2014but I have never been so utterly unmoored.</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence on the line and I\u2019m afraid the call has dropped. But then Yael says: \u201cCome to me. I\u2019ll send you a ticket. Come to me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not what I really want to hear. What I want\u2014what I ache\u2014to hear is come home.</p><p>But she can\u2019t tell me to come to a place that no longer exists, any more than I can go to that place. For now, this is the best either of us can do.</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>FEBRUARY</p><p>Mumbai, India</p><p>Emirates 148</p><p>13 Feb: Departure 14:40 Amsterdam\u201400:10 Dubai</p><p>Emirates 504</p><p>14 Feb: Departure 03:55 Dubai\u201408:20 Mumbai</p><p>Have a safe trip.</p><p>This email, containing my itinerary, comprises the bulk of the communication between Yael and me since I returned from Mexico last month. When I got back from Canc\u00fan, a friendly travel agent named Mukesh called to request a copy of my passport. A week later, I got the itinerary from Yael. I\u2019ve heard little else since.</p><p>I try not to read too much into it. This is Yael. And this is me. The most charitable explanation is that she\u2019s hoarding the small talk so we will have something to say to each other for the next . . . two weeks, month, six weeks? I\u2019m not sure. We haven\u2019t discussed it. Mukesh told me that the ticket was valid for three months and that if I wanted help booking flights within India, or out of India, I should contact him. I try not to read too much into that, either.</p><p>In the immigration line, I\u2019m jangly with nerves. The bar of duty-free Toblerone (meant for Yael) that I wound up eating as the plane descended into Mumbai probably didn\u2019t help matters. As the line lurches forward, an impatient Indian woman pushes into me with her prodigious sari-wrapped belly, as if that will make us go faster. I almost switch places with her. To stop the pushing. And to make us go slower.</p><p>When I exit into the airport arrivals hall, the scene is both space age and biblical. The airport is modern and new, but the hall is thronged with people who seem to be carrying their entire lives on metal trolleys. The minute I get out of customs, I know that Yael is not here. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t see her, though I don\u2019t. It\u2019s that I realize, belatedly, she never specifically said she\u2019d meet me. I just assumed. And with my mother, you never assume.</p><p>But it\u2019s been almost three years. And she invited me here. I go back and forth through the hall. All around me, people swarm and push and shove, as if racing for some invisible finish line. But there\u2019s no Yael.</p><p>Ever optimistic, I go outside to see if she\u2019s waiting there. The bright morning light hurts my eyes. I wait ten minutes. Fifteen. There\u2019s no sign of my mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a gladiator match of taxi drivers and porters vying for passengers. Psst, they hiss at me. I stare at the itinerary now gone limp in my hand, as if it will somehow impart critical new information.</p><p>\u201cAre you being met?\u201d</p><p>In front of me is a man. Or a boy. Somewhere in between. He seems about my age, except for his eyes, which are ancient.</p><p>I give the area one more sweep. \u201cIt appears I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you need a driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I recall the address from the immigration forms I just filled out in triplicate. \u201cThe Bombay Royale. In Colaba. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>He gives his head a half nod, half shake that isn\u2019t exactly reassuring. \u201cI take you there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you a driver?\u201d</p><p>He wags his head again. \u201cWhere is your suitcase?\u201d</p><p>I point to the small rucksack on my back.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cLike Kurma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That is korma. Kurma is one of Vishnu\u2019s incarnations, a tortoise, carries his home on his back. But if you like korma, I can show you a good place.\u201d</p> <p>The boy introduces himself as Prateek and then confidently threads us through the crowd past the airport garage and to a dusty lot. On one side are the runways, the other, high-rise buildings and even higher cranes, swinging in the wind. Prateek locates the car\u2014something that back home might be called vintage, but when I compliment it, he makes a face and tells me it belongs to his uncle and one day, he will buy his own car, a good one made abroad, a Renault, or a Ford, not a Maruti or a Tata. He pays the skinny dusty boy who was guarding the car a few coins and opens the backseat. I toss my rucksack there and try to open the front door. Prateek tells me to wait, and with a complicated sequence of rattles and twists, opens it from the inside, sweeping a pile of magazines from the passenger seat.</p><p>The car shudders to life and the little brass statue cemented to the dash\u2014a tiny elephant with a sort of smile of the perpetually amused\u2014starts to dance.</p><p>\u201cGanesha,\u201d Prateek says. \u201cRemover of obstacles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last month?\u201d I ask the statue.</p><p>\u201cHe was right here,\u201d Prateek answers solemnly.</p><p>We drive out of the airport complex, past a bunch of ramshackle houses, before climbing onto an elevated expressway. I tilt my head out the window. It\u2019s pleasantly hot, but not as hot as it will be, Prateek warns. It\u2019s still winter; it will get warmer until the monsoons come in June.</p><p>As we drive, Prateek points out landmarks. A famous temple. A spidery suspension bridge crossing Mahim Bay. \u201cMany Bollywood stars live in this area. Closer to the studios, which are near the airport.\u201d He thumbs behind us. \u201cThough some live in Juhu Beach, and some in Malabar Hill. Some even in Colaba where you are staying. Taj Mahal Hotel is there. Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Roger Moore, Double-Oh Seven. Also American presidents all stayed there.\u201d</p><p>Traffic starts to back up. We slow down and Ganesha stops his dance. \u201cWhat is your favorite movie?\u201d Prateek asks me.</p> <p>\u201cHard to pick just one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the last movie you saw?\u201d</p><p>I flipped through a half dozen of them on the flights over, but was too antsy to focus on any one. I suppose the last movie I watched in full was Pandora\u2019s Box. That was the movie that started it all, that led to the disastrous trip to Mexico, which funnily enough, has now landed me here. Lulu. If she was far away before, she\u2019s farther now. Not one but two oceans between us now.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of that movie,\u201d Prateek says, wagging his head. \u201cMy favorite movie of the last year is a tie. Gangs of Wasseypur. Thriller. And London, Paris, New York. Do you know how many films Hollywood studios produce a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cI speak of the studios, not an amateur with a camera. One thousand, that would be impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred?\u201d</p><p>His smile flips on like a switch. \u201cWrong! Four hundred. Now do you know how many films Bollywood produces a year? I won\u2019t make you guess because you will be wrong.\u201d He pauses for dramatic effect. \u201cEight hundred!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight hundred,\u201d I repeat because it\u2019s clear he thinks the number warrants repeating.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He\u2019s smiling broadly now. \u201cTwice the number of Hollywood. Do you know how many people in India go to the movies every single day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re going to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen million. Do fourteen million people go to the movies every day in Germany?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019m from Holland. But given that the entire population isn\u2019t much more than sixteen million, I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>He beams with pride now.</p><p>We exit the expressway onto the streets of what must be colonial Mumbai and turn into an area with an arbor of trees and a line of idling double-decker buses belching out black exhaust.</p><p>\u201cThere is the Gateway of India,\u201d Prateek says, pointing out a carved arch monument on the edge of the Arabian Sea. \u201cThe Taj Mahal Hotel I told you about,\u201d he says, pulling past a massive confection of a hotel, all domes and cornices. A group of Arab men in billowing white robes are piling into a series of window-tinted SUVs. \u201cInside is a Starbucks.\u201d He lowers his voice to a whisper. \u201cHave you ever had a Starbucks coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin said that in America they drink it with every meal.\u201d He pulls up in front of another graying building, Victorian, and it seems, almost sweating in the heat. The sign, in fading elaborate cursive, reads bo bay ro al. \u201cHere you are. Bombay Royale.\u201d</p><p>I follow Prateek into a darkened, cool lobby, quiet except for the whoosh and squeak of ceiling fans and the faint chirping of crickets nesting somewhere in the walls. Behind a long mahogany desk, a man so old he seems original to the building is napping. Prateek loudly rings the bell and he startles awake.</p><p>Immediately, the two start arguing, mostly in Hindi but with a few English words thrown in here and there. \u201cRegulations,\u201d the old man keeps saying.</p><p>Eventually, Prateek turns to me. \u201cHe says you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Why did she bring me here? Why did I come?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a private residence club, not a hotel,\u201d Prateek explains.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve heard of those.\u201d</p><p>Prateek frowns. \u201cThere are other hotels in Colaba.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this must be the place.\u201d This is the address I\u2019ve had for her for the last few years. \u201cLook under my mother\u2019s name. Yael Shiloh.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her name, the old man\u2019s head whips up. \u201cWillem saab?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWillem. Yes, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He squints his eyes and grasps my hands. \u201cYou are nothing like the memsahib,\u201d he says.</p><p>I don\u2019t have to know what that means to know who he\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s what everyone says.</p><p>\u201cBut where is she?\u201d he asks.</p><p>There\u2019s a kernel of comfort. I\u2019m not the only one in the dark. \u201cOh, you know her,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d he says, doing the same head nod/shake as Prateek.</p><p>\u201cSo can I go to her flat?\u201d I ask the old man.</p><p>He considers it, scratching the gray stubble on his chin. \u201cRegulations say only members can stay here. When memsahib makes you a member, you will be a member.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not here,\u201d Prateek points out helpfully.</p><p>\u201cRegulations,\u201d the old man says.</p><p>\u201cBut you knew I was coming,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBut you are not with her. What if you are not really you? Do you have proof?\u201d</p><p>Proof? Like what. A surname? Mine is different. Photos? \u201cHere,\u201d I say, pulling out the email, now damp and creased.</p><p>He squints at it with dark eyes that have gone filmy with age. He must decide it\u2019s enough. Because he gives two quick nods of his head and says, \u201cWelcome, Willem saab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt last,\u201d Prateek says</p><p>\u201cI am Chaudhary,\u201d the old man says, ignoring Prateek and handing me a sheaf of papers to fill out. When I finish, he heaves at the opening to the front desk and creaks out from behind. He shuffles down the scuffed wooden hallway. I follow him. Prateek trails behind me. When we reach the elevators, Chaudhary makes a tick-tock gesture to Prateek with his fingers. \u201cMembers only in the elevator,\u201d he tells him. \u201cYou may take the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s with me,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cRegulations, Willem saab.\u201d</p><p>Prateek shakes his head. \u201cI should probably get the car back to my uncle,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me pay you.\u201d I pull out a wad of filthy rupees.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred rupees for no AC. Four hundred with,\u201d Chaudhary says. \u201cThat\u2019s the law.\u201d</p><p>I hand Prateek five hundred rupees, about the price of a sandwich back home. He backs up to leave. \u201cHey, what about that korma?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>His smile is goofy, a little like Broodje\u2019s. \u201cI will be in touch,\u201d he promises.</p><p>The elevator lurches to the fifth floor. Chaudhary opens the gate onto a light-filled corridor, smelling of floor wax and incense. He leads me past a series of slatted wood doors, stopping at the farthest one, and pulls out a master key.</p><p>At first, I think the old man got the wrong room. Yael has lived here for two years, but this is an empty suite of rooms. Anonymous bulky wood furniture, generic paintings on the wall of desert forts and Bengal tigers. A small round table against a pair of French doors.</p><p>And then I smell it. Beneath the competing scents of onion and incense and ammonia and wax, is the undeniable smell of citrus and wet earth. The scent, I realize with the clarity of something you\u2019ve always known, but never needed to recognize before, of my mother.</p><p>I take a tentative step into the hallway and another blast hits me. And just like that, I\u2019m not in India. I\u2019m back in Amsterdam, at home, a long summer twilight. It had finally stopped raining, so Yael and Bram were outside, celebrating the minor miracle of sunshine. Still cold from the rain, I stayed huddled inside under a scratchy wool blanket and watched them through the big picture window. Some students who lived in one of the flats across the canal were blasting music. A song came on, something old and New Wave from when Yael and Bram were younger, and he grabbed her and they danced, head to head, even though it wasn\u2019t a slow song. I watched them through the glass, fixed on the sight of them, pretending not to be. I must\u2019ve been eleven or twelve, an age when such displays should\u2019ve embarrassed me, but didn\u2019t. Yael saw me watching, and\u2014this is what surprised me then, still surprises me now as I remember it\u2014she came inside. She didn\u2019t exactly drag me out or invite me to dance with them, as Bram might\u2019ve. She just folded up the blanket and pulled me up by the elbow. I was enveloped by her smell, oranges and leaves, that ever-present loamy tang of her tinctures, and the canals and all their murky secrets. I tried to make it like I was acquiescing, allowing myself to be led, giving no trace of how happy I was. But I must not have been able to fully contain it because she smiled back at me and said, \u201cWe have to snatch the sun when we have it, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>She could be warm like that. But it came and went with as much regularity as the Dutch sun. Except with Bram. But maybe it was reflected warmth\u2014he was her sun, after all.</p><p>After Chaudhary leaves, I lie down on the sofa. My head rests uncomfortably against the heavy wood arm but I don\u2019t move, because I\u2019m in the sunlight and the heat feels necessary, like a transfusion of sorts. I should probably get in touch with Yael, I think, but drowsiness and jetlag and a certain kind of relief are pulling me under, and before I can do so much as remove my shoes, I am asleep.</p><p>I\u2019m flying again. Back on a plane, which feels wrong because I just got off a plane. But it\u2019s so vivid and real it takes a beat longer than usual to recognize it as the dream; and then it warps and becomes lurid and surreal, heavy and slow, the way dreams do when your mind is rebelling against a betrayed body clock. Maybe that\u2019s why in this dream, there is no landing. No illumination of the seatbelt sign, no inaudible announcement from the captain. Just the buzz of the engines, the feeling of being aloft. Just flying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there is someone next to me. I turn and try to ask, Where are we? But everything is heavy, lugubrious, I can\u2019t get my mouth to work right because what comes out is, Who are you?</p><p>\u201cWillem,\u201d a voice in the distance calls.</p><p>The person in the dream turns. Still faceless. Already familiar.</p><p>\u201cWillem.\u201d The voice again. I don\u2019t answer it. I don\u2019t want out of the dream quite yet, not this time. Again, I turn toward my seatmate.</p> <p>\u201cWillem!\u201d The voice is sharp this time and it pulls me out of the honey stickiness of sleep.</p><p>I open my eyes. I sit up and for a second, we just look at each other, blinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I\u2019ve been wondering that myself for the past month, after my initial optimism about this trip faded to ambivalence and then curdled into pessimism and now has withered into regret. What am I doing here?</p><p>\u201cYou sent me a ticket.\u201d I try to make it seem like a joke, but my head is cloudy with the dream, and Yael only frowns.</p> <p>\u201cI mean what are you doing here? We\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you at the airport.\u201d</p><p>We? \u201cI didn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was needed at the clinic. I sent a driver and he was running a bit late. He said he sent you several texts.\u201d</p><p>I take out my phone and turn it on. Nothing happens. \u201cI don\u2019t think it works here.\u201d</p><p>She looks, disgusted, at my phone, and I feel a sudden and fierce loyalty to it. Then she sighs. \u201cThe important thing is you made it,\u201d she says, which seems both obvious and optimistic.</p><p>I stand up. My neck has a crick and when I circle it, it gives off a loud pop that makes Yael frown again. I stand up, stretch, and look around the room.</p> <p>\u201cNice place,\u201d I say, continuing the small talk that has sustained us for the past three years. \u201cI like what you\u2019ve done with it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like a reflex, trying to make her smile. It never worked for me before and it doesn\u2019t work now. She walks away, opening the French doors leading to the balcony, overlooking the Gateway, the water beyond. \u201cI should probably get something closer to Andheri, but I seem to have grown too accustomed to living on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndheri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the clinic is,\u201d she says, as if I should know this. But how, exactly? Talk of her work has been strictly off limits in our casual chit-chat emails. The weather. The food. The myriad Indian festivals. Postcards, without the pretty pictures.</p><p>I know that Yael came to India to study Ayurvedic medicine. It was what she and Bram had intended to do once I left for university. Travel more. For Yael to study traditional healing methods. India was to be the first stop. The tickets were booked before Bram died.</p><p>After he died, I expected Yael to fall apart. Only this time, I would be there. I would put aside my own grief and I would help her. Finally, instead of me being an interloper into her great love affair, I would be the product of it. I would be a comfort to her. What she wasn\u2019t as a mother, I would be as a son.</p><p>For two weeks, she locked herself in the top-floor room, the one Bram had built for her, shutters closed, door locked, ignoring most of the visitors who\u2019d stopped by. In life, Bram had been all hers, and in death, that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>Then, six weeks later, she\u2019d left for India as scheduled, as if nothing had happened. Marjolein said Yael was just licking her wounds. She\u2019d be back soon.</p> <p>Two months later, though, Yael sent word that she wasn\u2019t coming back. Long ago, before she studied naturopathic medicine, she\u2019d had a nursing degree, and now she was going back to that, working in a clinic in Mumbai. She said she was closing down the boat; she\u2019d already boxed up the important things and everything else was being sold. I should take what I wanted. I packed up a few boxes and stored them in my uncle Daniel\u2019s attic. Everything else, I left. Not long after that, I got kicked off of my program. Then I packed up my own rucksack and took off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just like your mother,\u201d Marjolein had said, somewhat mournfully, when I told her I was leaving.</p><p>But we both knew that wasn\u2019t true. I am nothing like my mother.</p><p>The same emergency that kept Yael from the airport is apparently pulling her back to the clinic after all of an hour in my company. She invites me to come with her, but the invitation is halfhearted and rote, a lot like this invitation to come to India, I suspect. I politely decline, with excuses of jetlag.</p><p>\u201cYou should be out in the sunshine; it\u2019s the best cure.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cThough make sure you cover this.\u201d She touches the mirror image on her face where my scar is. \u201cIt looks fresh.\u201d</p><p>I touch the scar. It\u2019s six months old now. And, for a minute, I imagine telling Yael about it. It would infuriate her if she knew what I said to the skinheads to take their attention off the girls and onto me. A one four six oh three\u2014the identification number the Nazis tattooed on Saba\u2019s wrist\u2014but at least I would get a reaction.</p><p>But I don\u2019t tell Yael. This goes way beyond small talk. It goes to painful things we never mention: Saba. The war. Yael\u2019s mother. Yael\u2019s entire childhood. I touch the scar. It feels hot, as if merely thinking about that day has inflamed it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that fresh,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s just not healing right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can mix you up something for that.\u201d Yael brushes the scar. Her fingers are rough and callused. Workers\u2019 hands, Bram used to say, though he was the one who should\u2019ve had the rougher hands. I realize then we haven\u2019t embraced or kissed or done any of the things one might expect for a reunion.</p><p>Still, when she takes her hand away, I wish she hadn\u2019t. And when she starts packing up with promises of things we will do when she has a day off, I\u2019m wishing I had told her about the skinheads, about Paris, about Lulu. Except even if I\u2019d tried, I wouldn\u2019t have known how. My mother and I, we both speak Dutch and English. But we never could speak the same language.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>I am awoken by the ringing of a phone. I reach for my mobile, remember it doesn\u2019t work here. The phone keeps ringing. It\u2019s the house line. It doesn\u2019t stop. Finally, I pick it up.</p><p>\u201cWillem saab. Chaudhary here.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cOn the line for you, Prateek Sanu,\u201d he continues formally. \u201cWould you like me to ask the nature of his business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. You can put him through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment.\u201d There is a series of clicks. Then Prateek\u2019s voice echoing hellos, interrupted by Chaudhary, declaring. \u201cPrateek Sanu calling for Willem Shiloh.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s funny to be called by Yael and Saba\u2019s surname. I don\u2019t correct him. After a moment of silence, Chaudhary clicks off.</p><p>\u201cWillem!\u201d Prateek booms, as if it\u2019s been months, not hours, since we last spoke. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think of the Maximum City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen much of it,\u201d I admit. \u201cI\u2019ve been asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are awake now. What are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t worked that out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me make a proposal: Pay a visit to me at Crawford Market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Prateek gives me instructions. After a cold shower, I head outside, Chaudhary trailing behind me with dire warnings of \u201cpickpockets, thieves, prostitutes, and roving gangs.\u201d He ticks off the threats on his thick fingers. \u201cThey will accost you.\u201d</p><p>I assure him I can take it, and in any case the only people to accost me are begging mothers, who congregate in the grassy medians in the center of the shady streets, asking for money to buy formula for the sleeping babies in their arms.</p><p>This part of Mumbai reminds me a bit of London with its decaying colonial buildings, except it\u2019s supersaturated with color: the women\u2019s saris, the marigold-festooned temples, the crazily painted buses. It\u2019s like everything absorbs and reflects the bright sun.</p><p>From the outside, Crawford Market seems like another building plucked out of old England, but inside it is all India: bustling commerce and yet more surreally bright colors. I walk around the fruit stalls, the clothing stalls, making my way toward the electronics stalls where Prateek told me to find him. I feel a tap on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLost?\u201d Prateek asks, a grin splitting his face.</p><p>\u201cNot in a bad way.\u201d</p><p>He frowns at that, confounded. \u201cI was worried,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to call you but I don\u2019t have your mobile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mobile doesn\u2019t work here.\u201d</p><p>The smile returns. \u201cAs it happens, we have many mobile phones at my uncle\u2019s electronics stall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you lured me here?\u201d I tease.</p><p>Prateek looks insulted. \u201cOf course not. How did I know you lacked a phone?\u201d He gestures to the stalls around us. \u201cYou can buy from another stall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking, Prateek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He takes me to his uncle\u2019s stall, crammed to the ceiling with cellphones, radios, computers, knockoff iPads, televisions, and more. He introduces me to his uncle and buys us all cups of tea from the chai-wallah, the traveling tea salesman. Then he takes me to the back of the stall and we sit down on a couple of rickety stools.</p><p>\u201cYou work here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do the other days?\u201d</p><p>He does the head nod/wag thing. \u201cI\u2019m studying accounting. I also work for my mother some days. And I help my cousin sometimes to find goreh for movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoreh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite people, like you. It\u2019s why I was at the airport today. I had to drive my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask me?\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am not a casting director, or even an assistant to an assistant. I just drove Rahul to the airport to look for backpackers needing money. Do you need money, Willem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not think so. You are staying at the Bombay Royale. Very high class. And visiting your mother. Where is your father?\u201d he asks.</p><p>It\u2019s been a while since anyone asked me that. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, mine, too,\u201d Prateek says almost cheerfully. \u201cBut I have many uncles. And cousins. You?\u201d</p><p>I almost say yes. I have an uncle. But how do you explain Daniel? Not so much a black sheep as an invisible one, eclipsed by Bram. And Yael. Daniel, the footnote to Yael and Bram\u2019s story, the small print that nobody bothers to read. Daniel, the younger, scragglier, messier, less directed\u2014and not to forget, shorter\u2014brother. Daniel, the one relegated to the backseat of the Fiat, and consequently, it seemed, the backseat of life.</p><p>\u201cNot much family,\u201d is all I say in the end, bookending my vagueness with a shrug, my own version of the head wag.</p><p>Prateek presents me a choice of phones. I choose one and buy a SIM card. He immediately programs his number and, for good measure, his uncle\u2019s into it. We finish our tea and then he announces, \u201cNow I think you must go to the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. What is more Indian than that? Fourteen million people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA day go to the movies here,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a heap of magazines out of his bag, the same ones I\u2019d seen in the car. Magna. Stardust. He opens one and shows me pages of attractive people, all with extremely white teeth. He rattles off a bunch of names, dismayed that I know none of them.</p><p>\u201cWe will go now,\u201d he declares.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn India, work is the master, but the guest is god,\u201d Prateek says. \u201cBesides, between the phone and taxi . . .\u201d He smiles. \u201cMy uncle will not object.\u201d He opens a newspaper. \u201cDil Mera Golmaal is on. So is Gangs of Wasseypur. Or Dhal Gaya Din. What do you think, Baba?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Prateek and his uncle carry on a spirited conversation in a mix of Hindi and English, debating the merits and deficits of all three films. Finally they settle on Dil Mera Golmaal.</p><p>The theater is an art deco building with peeling white paint, not unlike the revival houses Saba used to take me to when he visited. I buy our tickets and our popcorn. Prateek promises to translate in return.</p><p>The film\u2014a sort of convoluted take on Romeo and Juliet, involving warring families, gangsters, a terrorist plot to steal nuclear weapons, plus countless explosions and dance numbers\u2014doesn\u2019t require much translation. It is both nonsensical and oddly self-explanatory.</p><p>Still, Prateek gives it a shot. \u201cThat man is that one\u2019s brother but he doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d he whispers. \u201cOne is evil, the other is good, and the girl is engaged to the bad one, but she loves the good one. Her family hates his family and his family hates her family but they don\u2019t really because the feud has to do with the other one\u2019s father, who engineered the feud when he stole the baby at birth, you see. He is also a terrorist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Then there\u2019s a dance number and a fight scene and then suddenly we are in the desert. \u201cDubai,\u201d Prateek whispers.</p><p>\u201cWhy, exactly?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Prateek explains that the oil consortium is there. As are the terrorists.</p><p>There are several scenes in the desert, including a duel between two monster trucks that Henk would appreciate.</p> <p>Then the film switches abruptly to Paris. One moment, there\u2019s a generic shot of the Seine. And then, a second later, a shot down the banks of the river. Then we see the heroine and the good twin brother, who, Prateek explains, have gotten married and fled together. They break out into song. But they\u2019re no longer on the Seine; now they are on one of the arched bridges that span the canals in Villette. I recognize it. Lulu and I cruised under it, sitting side by side, our legs knocking against the hull. Occasionally, we\u2019d accidentally knock ankles and there had been something electric about it, a turn-on, just in that.</p><p>I feel it now in this musty theater. Almost like a reflex, my thumb goes to the inside of my wrist, but the gesture is meaningless, here in the dark.</p><p>Soon the song is over and we\u2019re back in India for the grand finale when the families reunite and reconcile and there\u2019s another wedding ceremony and a big dance number. Unlike Romeo and Juliet, these lovers get a happy ending.</p><p>After the movie, we walk through the crowded streets. It\u2019s dark now, and the heat\u2019s gone wavy. We meander our way to a wide crescent of sand. \u201cChowpatty Beach,\u201d Prateek tells me, pointing out the luxury highrises on Marine Drive. They sparkle like diamonds against the slender curving wrist of the bay.</p><p>It\u2019s a carnival atmosphere with all the food vendors and clowns and balloon shapers and the furtive lovers taking advantage of the darkness to steal kisses behind a palm tree. I try not to watch them. I try not to remember stealing kisses. I try not to remember that first kiss. Not her lips, but that birthmark on her wrist. I\u2019d been wanting to kiss it all day. Somehow, I knew exactly what it would taste like.</p><p>The water laps against the shore. The Arabian Sea. The Atlantic Ocean. Two oceans between us. And still not enough.</p> <p>Twenty-three</p><p>After four days, Yael finally has a day off. Instead of waking up from my fold-up bed to find her rushing out the door, I see her in her pajamas. \u201cI\u2019ve ordered up breakfast,\u201d she says in that crisp voice of hers, the gutturalness of her Israeli accent ironed out from all the years of speaking English.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door. Chaudhary, who seems to always work and to do every single job here, shuffles in, pushing a trolley. \u201cBreakfast, Memsahib,\u201d he announces.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Chaudhary,\u201d Yael says.</p><p>He studies the two of us. Then shakes his head. \u201cHe is nothing like you, Memsahib,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like his baba,\u201d Yael replies.</p><p>I know it\u2019s true, but it\u2019s strange to hear her say it. Though not as strange, I\u2019d imagine, as seeing the face of her dead husband staring back at her. Sometimes when I\u2019m feeling charitable, I\u2019ll justify this as the reason she\u2019s put such distance between us these last three years. Then the less charitable side of me will ask, What about the eighteen years before that?</p><p>With a dramatic flourish, Chaudhary sets out toast, coffee, tea, and juice. Then he backs out of the door.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he ever leave?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. His children are all overseas and his wife passed. So he works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds miserable.\u201d</p><p>She gives me one of her inscrutable looks. \u201cAt least he has a purpose.\u201d</p><p>She flips open the newspaper. Even that is colorful, a salmony shade of pink. \u201cWhat have you been doing the last few days?\u201d she asks me as she eyes the headlines.</p><p>I went back to Chowpatty Beach, the markets around Colaba, the Gateway. I went to another movie with Prateek. I\u2019ve wandered mostly. Without purpose. \u201cThis and that,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSo today we do that and this,\u201d she replies.</p><p>Downstairs, we are besieged by the usual congregation of beggars. \u201cTen rupees,\u201d a woman carrying a sleeping baby says. \u201cFor formula for my baby. You come with me to buy it.\u201d</p><p>I start to pull out money, but Yael snaps at me to stop and then snaps at the woman in Hindi.</p><p>I don\u2019t say a word. But my expression must give me away, because Yael gives an exasperated explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s a scam, Willem. The babies are props. The women are part of begging rings, run by organized crime syndicates.\u201d</p><p>I look at the woman, now standing across from the Taj Hotel, and shrug. \u201cSo? She still needs the money.\u201d</p><p>Yael nods and frowns. \u201cYes, she does. And the baby needs food, no doubt, but neither of them will get what they need. If you bought milk for that woman, you\u2019d pay an inflated price, and you\u2019d get an inflated sense of goodwill. You helped a mother feed her baby. What could be better?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, because I\u2019ve been giving them money every day and now I feel foolish for it.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you walk away, the milk\u2019s returned to the shop. And your money? The shopkeeper gets a cut; the crime bosses get a cut. The women, the women are indentured, and they get nothing. As for what happens to babies . . .\u201d She trails off ominously.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to the babies?\u201d The question pops out before I realize I might not want to know the answer.</p><p>\u201cThey die. Sometimes of malnutrition. Or sometimes of pneumonia. When life is so tenuous, something small might do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. Sometimes even when life isn\u2019t that tenuous, I think and I wonder if she\u2019s thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, the day you arrived, I was late because of an emergency with one of those very children.\u201d She doesn\u2019t elaborate, leaving it for me to put the pieces together.</p><p>Yael\u2019s non-admission manages to make me feel retroactively guilty for faulting her\u2014there was something more important\u2014and bitter\u2014there always is something more important. But mostly it makes me tired. Couldn\u2019t she have just told me and saved me the trouble of my guilt and bitterness?</p><p>Then again, sometimes I think that guilt and bitterness may be Yael\u2019s and my true common language.</p><p>Our first stop is the Shree Siddhivinayak Temple, an ornate wedding cake of a temple that is being attacked by a tourist horde of ants. Yael and I take our place among the masses and push into a stuffy gold hall, wending our way to a flower-covered statue of the elephant god. He\u2019s beet-red, as if embarrassed, or maybe he\u2019s just hot, too.</p><p>\u201cGanesha,\u201d Yael tells me.</p><p>\u201cThe remover of obstacles.\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>All around us, people are laying garlands around the shrine or singing or praying.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to make an offering?\u201d I ask. \u201cTo get your obstacles removed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d she replies. \u201cOr just chant a mantra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mantra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are several.\u201d Yael doesn\u2019t say anything else for a while. And then, in a low and clear voice, she chants: \u201cOm gam ganapatayae namaha.\u201d She gives me a look, like that\u2019s enough of that.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head. \u201cRoughly I\u2019ve heard it translated as: \u2018Wake up.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me for a second, and though we have the same eyes, I really have no idea what she sees through hers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the translation that matters with a mantra. It\u2019s the intention,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this is what you say when you want a new beginning.\u201d</p><p>After the temple, we hail a rickshaw. \u201cWhere to now?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWe are meeting Mukesh for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Mukesh? The travel agent who booked my flights?</p><p>We spend the next half hour in silence as we weave through more traffic and dodge more cows, finally arriving at a sort of dusty shopping center. As we\u2019re paying the driver, a tall, broad, smiling man in a voluminous white shirt comes barreling out of a place called Outbound Travels.</p><p>\u201cWillem!\u201d he says, greeting me warmly, grasping both my hands. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, looking back and forth between him and Yael, who\u2019s decidedly not looking at him, and I wonder what exactly is going on. Are they together? It would be just her way, introduce the idea of a boyfriend by not introducing him as her boyfriend and leaving me to figure it out.</p><p>Mukesh tells our driver to wait and then goes back into the travel agency to pick up a plastic bag, and then we climb back in and drive through fifteen more minutes of traffic to the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s middle eastern,\u201d Mukesh says proudly. \u201cLike Mummy.\u201d</p><p>Mukesh pushes the menu aside and calls over the waiter, ordering platters of hummus and grape leaves, baba ghanoush and tabouli.</p><p>When the first platter of hummus arrives, Mukesh asks me how I\u2019m liking Indian food so far.</p><p>I explain about the dosas and the pakoras I\u2019ve been eating off the stands. \u201cI still haven\u2019t had a proper curry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will have to arrange that for you,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m here.\u201d He reaches into the plastic bag and pulls out a number of glossy brochures. \u201cYou don\u2019t have so much time here, so I suggest you pick one region\u2014Rajasthan, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh\u2014and explore that. I have taken the liberty of coming up with a few sample itineraries.\u201d He slides me over a computer printout. One is for Rajasthan. It has everything. Return flights to Jaipur, transfers to Jodhpur, Udaipur and Jaisalmer. There\u2019s even a camel trip. There\u2019s a similar packed itinerary for Kerala, flights, transfers, river cruises.</p><p>I\u2019m confused. \u201cAre we taking a trip?\u201d I ask Yael.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d Mukesh answers for her. \u201cMummy has to work. This is a special trip for you, to make sure your time in India is tip-top.\u201d</p><p>And then I understand the guilty look. Mukesh isn\u2019t the boyfriend. He\u2019s the travel agent. The one enlisted to bring me here. The one enlisted to send me away.</p><p>At least I know why I\u2019m here. Not for new beginnings. A hasty invitation that was foolish to issue, foolish to accept\u2014and most foolish of all to solicit.</p><p>\u201cWhich trip do you prefer?\u201d Mukesh asks. He seems unaware of the thorny dynamic he\u2019s stumbled into.</p><p>My anger feels hot and bilious but I keep it bottled until it doubles back and I\u2019m mad at myself. What\u2019s the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.</p><p>\u201cThis one,\u201d I say, flicking the brochure on top of the pile. I don\u2019t even look where it goes to. It hardly seems the point.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>MARCH</p><p>Jaisalmer, India</p><p>It\u2019s ten o\u2019clock in Jaisalmer and the desert sun is beating down on the sand-colored stones of the fortress city. The narrow alleys and staircases are thick with heat and smoke from the early morning dung fires, and that, along with the ever-present camels and cows, gives the city a particular aroma. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I skirt past a group of women, their eyes kohl-dipped, downturned, shy it seems, though they manage to flirt in other ways, with the swoosh of their electric-colored saris, the tinkle of their ankle bracelets.</p><p>At the bottom of the hill, I pass several stalls hawking local textiles. I stop at one of them, peering at a purple-mirrored wall-hanging.</p><p>\u201cYou like what you see?\u201d the young man behind the counter asks casually, no sign that he knows me except for the twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I say noncommittally.</p> <p>\u201cIs there something particular you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my eye on something.\u201d</p><p>Nawal nods solemnly, no hint of a smile, no hint that we have had almost this exact same conversation for the past four days. It\u2019s like a game. Or a play we started acting in when I first found the tapestry I want. Or rather, Prateek wants.</p><p>Two days into my tour of Rajasthan, when I was still full of bitterness and bile and of half a mind to just fly back to Amsterdam early, Prateek sent me a text about his \u201cgrand proposal!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Turned out to be not so grand. He wanted me to shop for Rajasthani handicrafts that he\u2019d sell back in Mumbai for a markup. He\u2019d reimburse me for what I spent and we\u2019d split the profit. At first I told him no, especially after he texted the shopping list. But then one day in Jaipur I wound up in the Bapu Bazaar with nothing much to do, so I started looking for the kind of leather sandals he wanted. And from there, I kept going. Combing the markets for spices and bangles and a very particular kind of slipper has given the trip a sort of shape, allowing me to forget that it\u2019s actually an exile. And because of that, I\u2019ve extended the exile, having Mukesh lengthen it by a week. I\u2019ve now been gone three weeks, and I\u2019ll get back to Mumbai with only a handful days before my return flight to Amsterdam.</p><p>In Jaisalmer, Prateek has instructed me to buy a particular kind of tapestry that the area is known for. It must be silk, and I will know it is silk because I must burn a thread, and it will give off the odor of burnt hair. It should be embroidered, sewn, not glued, and I will know it\u2019s sewn because I must turn it over and yank the thread, which also must be silk and must be tested with a match. And it\u2019s to cost no more than two thousand rupees, and I must bargain, hard. Prateek had grave doubts about my bargaining ability, because he claims I overpaid him for the taxi, but I assured him that I\u2019d seen my grandfather barter down a wheel of cheese by half in the Albert Cuyp market, so it was in me.</p> <p>\u201cSome tea, perhaps, while you look?\u201d Nawal asks. I look under the counter and see that, like yesterday, the tea is already prepared.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>At which point, the script ends and conversation takes over. Hours of it. I sit down in the canvas chair next to Nawal\u2019s, and as we have done for the past four days, we talk. When it gets too hot, or when Nawal gets a serious customer, I leave. Before I do, he will drop the price of the tapestry by five hundred rupees, insuring that I\u2019ll come back and do the whole thing again the next day.</p><p>Nawal pours the spicy tea from the ornate metal pot. His radio is playing the same crazy Hindi pop that Prateek loves. \u201cCricket game on later. If you want to listen,\u201d he informs me.</p><p>I take a sip of the tea. \u201cCricket? Really? The only thing duller than watching cricket is listening to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only say that because you don\u2019t understand the particulars of the game.\u201d</p> <p>Nawal enjoys schooling me about all the things that I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand cricket, or soccer for that matter, and I don\u2019t understand the politics between India and Pakistan, and I don\u2019t understand the truth about global warming, and I certainly don\u2019t understand why love marriages are inferior to arranged marriages. Yesterday, I made the mistake of asking what was so wrong with love marriages, and I got quite a lecture.</p><p>\u201cThe divorce rate in India is the lowest in the world. In the West, it\u2019s fifty percent. And that\u2019s if they even get married,\u201d Nawal had said, disgusted. \u201cHere, I tell you a story: All my grandparents, my aunties, my uncles, my parents, my brothers, all had arranged marriages. Happy. Long lives. My cousin, he chose a love marriage, and after two years, no children, the wife leaves him in disgrace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened is they were not compatible,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cThey were driving without a map. You cannot do that. You must have it arranged properly. Tomorrow I will show you.\u201d</p><p>So today, Nawal has brought a copy of the astrological chart that was drawn up to decide if he and his fianc\u00e9, Geeta, are compatible. Nawal insists it shows his and Geeta\u2019s happy future, ordained by the gods. \u201cWith matters such as these, you have to rely on forces larger than the human heart,\u201d he says.</p><p>The chart looks not unlike one of W\u2019s mathematical equations, with the paper divided into sections and different symbols in each one. I know W believes that all of life\u2019s questions can be solved through mathematical principle, but I think even he would find this a stretch.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in it?\u201d Nawal challenges. \u201cName me one good love marriage that lasts.\u201d</p><p>Lulu had asked me a similar question. Sitting at that caf\u00e9, arguing about love, she\u2019d demanded to know one couple who\u2019d stayed in love, who\u2019d stayed stained. And so I\u2019d said Yael and Bram. Their names had just popped out. And it was so strange because in two years on the road, I had never told anyone about them, not even people I\u2019d traveled with for a long time. As soon as I said that, I\u2019d wanted to tell her everything about them, the story of how they met, how they seemed like interlocking puzzle pieces and how sometimes I didn\u2019t seem to fit into the equation. But it had been so long since I\u2019d spoken of them, I hadn\u2019t known know how to do it. Though in some strange way, it seemed like another unsaid thing she already knew. Still, I wish I\u2019d told her everything. Add it to my list of regrets.</p> <p>I\u2019m about to tell Nawal about them. My parents, who had a pretty spectacular love marriage, but then again, maybe it was there, in the charts all along, how it would end. I have wondered: If you could know going in that twenty-five years of love would break you in the end, would you risk it? Because isn\u2019t it inevitable? When you make such a large withdrawal of happiness, somewhere you\u2019ll have to make an equally large deposit. It all goes back to the universal law of equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cI think this whole falling in love business is a mistake,\u201d Nawal continues. \u201cI mean look at you.\u201d He says it like an indictment.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are twenty-one and you are all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not all alone. I\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>Nawal eyes me pitifully, reminding me that, pleasant as these days have been, he is here to sell something and I am here to buy something.</p><p>\u201cYou have no wife. And I\u2019ll wager you have been in love. I\u2019ll wager you have been in love many times like they always seem to be in Western films.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I have never been in love.\u201d Nawal looks surprised at that, and I\u2019m about to explain that while I haven\u2019t been in love, I\u2019ve fallen in love many times. That they\u2019re separate entities entirely.</p><p>But then I stop. Because once again, I\u2019m transported from the deserts of Rajasthan to that Paris caf\u00e9. I can almost hear the skepticism in Lulu\u2019s voice when I\u2019d told her: There\u2019s a world of difference between falling in love and being in love. Then I\u2019d dabbed the Nutella on her wrist, supposedly to demonstrate my point, but really because it had given me an excuse to see what she tasted like.</p><p>She\u2019d laughed at me. She\u2019d said the distinction between falling in love and being in love was false. It sounds like you just like to screw around. At least own that about yourself.</p><p>I smile at the memory of it, although Lulu, who had been right about me so much that day, was wrong about this. Yael had trained as a paratrooper in the Israel Defense Forces, and she once described how it felt to jump out of a plane: hurtling through the air, the wind everywhere, the exhilaration, the speed, your stomach in your throat, the hard landing. It always seemed the exact right way to describe how things felt with girls\u2014that wind and the exhilaration, the hurtling, the wanting, the freefall. The abrupt end.</p><p>Oddly enough, though, that day with Lulu it didn\u2019t feel anything like falling. It felt like arriving.</p><p>Nawal and I drink our tea and listen to music, talk about upcoming elections in India and upcoming soccer tournaments. The sun blazes through the canopy roof and we go quiet in the heat. No customers come this time of day.</p><p>The ringing of my phone disturbs the idyll. It\u2019ll be Mukesh. He is the only one who calls me here. Prateek texts. Yael does neither.</p><p>\u201cWillem, is everything tip-top?\u201d he asks</p><p>\u201cA-okay,\u201d I say. In Mukesh\u2019s hierarchy, A-okay is one step above tip-top.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Not to worry you but I call with a change in plans. Camel tour is canceled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCanceled? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamels got sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, vomiting, diarrhea, terrible, terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we book another one?\u201d The three-night desert camel tour was the one part of his planned itinerary I was actually looking forward to. When I extended my trip a week, I\u2019d asked Mukesh to reschedule the camel trip for me.</p><p>\u201cI tried. But unfortunately, next tour I could get you on was not for another week, and if you take that, you miss your flight to Dubai next Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Nawal asks.</p><p>\u201cMy camel tour was canceled. The camels are sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin runs a tour.\u201d Nawal is already picking up his mobile. \u201cI can arrange it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMukesh, I think my friend here can book me on a different tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Willem. That will be most unacceptable.\u201d His ever-friendly tone goes brusque. Then, in a milder voice he continues: \u201cI already booked your train back to Jaipur tonight, and a flight back to Mumbai tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight? What\u2019s the rush? I don\u2019t leave for a week.\u201d When I asked Mukesh to extend my Rajasthan trip by a week, I also asked him to book my return flight to Amsterdam for a few days after I am due to get back to Mumbai. I had it all timed out perfectly so I\u2019d only have to see Yael for a couple of days at the tail end. \u201cMaybe I could stay here another few days?\u201d</p><p>Mukesh clucks his tongue, which, in his particular argot, is the exact opposite of A-okay. He starts rattling on about flight schedules and change fees and warnings of me being stuck in India unless I come back to Mumbai now, and finally there is nothing to do but give in. \u201cGood, good. I\u2019ll email you the itinerary,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cMy email\u2019s not working right. I got locked out of it and had to reset the password and then a whole bunch of recent messages disappeared,\u201d I say. \u201cApparently there\u2019s a virus going around.</p><p>\u201cYes, that would be the Jagdish virus.\u201d He tsks again. \u201cYou must set up a new account. In the meantime, I will text you your train and flight itinerary.\u201d</p><p>I get off the phone with Mukesh and reach into my backpack for my wallet. I count out three thousand rupees, the last price Nawal had dropped to. His face falls.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave,\u201d I explain. \u201cThis evening.\u201d</p><p>Nawal reaches behind the counter for a thick square wrapped up in brown paper. \u201cI set it aside on day one so no one else would get it.\u201d He peels back the paper, showing me the tapestry. \u201cI put a little something extra in it for you.\u201d</p><p>We say good-bye. I wish him luck with his marriage. \u201cI don\u2019t need luck; it\u2019s in the stars. You, I think, are the one who needs luck.\u201d</p><p>It makes me think of something Kate said when she dropped me off in M\u00e9rida. \u201cI\u2019d wish you luck, Willem, but I think you need to stop relying on that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not sure which one of them is right.</p><p>I pack up my things and then walk to the train station through the late afternoon heat. The city looks golden up the hills, the sand dunes rippling behind it, and it all makes me feel wistful, nostalgic already.</p><p>The train gets me into Jaipur at six the next morning. My flight to Mumbai is at ten. I haven\u2019t had a chance to set up a new email, and Mukesh has texted nothing about a ride from the airport. I text Prateek. He hasn\u2019t replied to any of my texts in the last two days. So I try ringing him.</p><p>He answers, distracted.</p> <p>\u201cPrateek, hey it\u2019s Willem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a train. I\u2019ve got your tapestry here.\u201d I rattle the package.</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d For all his manic enthusiasm about this latest venture, he seems oddly blas\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter than okay. Very good. My cousin Rahul, he is sick with influenza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible. Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine. But bed rest for him,\u201d Prateek says cheerfully. \u201cI am helping him out.\u201d He lowers his voice to a whisper. \u201cWith the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I find the goreh to act in the movies. If I can get ten, they will put my name in the credits. Assistant to assistant director of casting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says formally. \u201cBut only if I find four more. Tomorrow, I return to Salvation Army and maybe to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, if you\u2019re coming to the airport, that\u2019s perfect. I need a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou return on Saturday, I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange of plans. I\u2019m coming back tomorrow now.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a silence, during which Prateek and I have the same idea. \u201cDo you want to be in?\u201d he asks at the same time I offer, \u201cWould you want me to be in . . . ?\u201d</p><p>The line echoes with our laughter. I give him my flight information and hang up. Outside, the sun is setting; a bright flame behind the train, and darkness in front of us. A short while later, it\u2019s all dark.</p><p>Mukesh has booked me a sleeper seat in an air-conditioned car, which India Rail chills like a meat locker. The bed has nothing but a sheet. I shiver, and then think of the tapestry, thick and warm. I unwrap the paper; out tumbles something small and hard.</p><p>It\u2019s a small statue of Ganesha, holding his ax and his lotus, smiling his smile, like he knows something the rest of us haven\u2019t figured out yet.</p> <p>Twenty-five</p><p>Mumbai</p><p>The movie is called Heera Ki Tamanna, which translates, roughly, as Wishing for a Diamond. It is a romance starring Billy Devali\u2014big star\u2014and Amisha Rai\u2014big, big star\u2014and is directed by Faruk Khan, who apparently is so big, he needs no further description. Prateek tells me all this in a breathless monologue; he has hardly stopped talking since he swooped me out of the arrivals hall and rushed me to the car, barely glancing at the various Rajasthani goods I painstakingly shopped and bargained for over the past three weeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, Willem, that was the last plan,\u201d he says, shaking his head, dismayed that he must explain such things. \u201cI am working in Bollywood now.\u201d Then he tells me that yesterday, Amisha Rai swept by him so close that the edge of her sari brushed his arm. \u201cCan I tell you what it felt like?\u201d he asks, not waiting for me to answer. \u201cIt felt like a caress from the gods. Can I tell you what she smelled like?\u201d He closes his eyes and inhales. Apparently, her odor defies words.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember in Dil Mera Golmaal, the scene after the shootout?\u201d</p><p>I nod. It was like Reservoir Dogs, but on a ship. With dancing.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think all those white people came from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the same magical place as the go-go dancers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom casting directors like me.\u201d He pounds his chest.</p><p>\u201cCasting director? So it\u2019s official. You\u2019re up to ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make eight. But I will get there. You are so tall and handsome and . . . white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can count for two?\u201d I joke.</p><p>Prateek looks at me like I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cNo, you count for one. You are only one man.\u201d</p><p>We arrive in Film City, the suburb that houses many of the studios, and then we pull into the complex and then into what looks like a large airplane hangar.</p><p>\u201cOh, by the way, the payment,\u201d Prateek says nonchalantly. \u201cI must tell you, it\u2019s ten dollars a day.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. I hadn\u2019t planned on being paid anything.</p><p>He mistakes my silence. \u201cI know for Westerners it is not much,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut you get meals, and also lodging so you do not need to commute back to Colaba each night. Please, please tell me you\u2019ll agree to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m not in it for the money.\u201d Which is exactly what Tor used to say about Guerrilla Will. We\u2019re not in it for the money. But half the time she would say this as she was carefully counting the night\u2019s take or checking weather reports in the International Herald Tribune to determine the sunniest\u2014and most lucrative\u2014places to hit next.</p><p>Back then, I was very much in it for the money. Even the little I earned from Guerrilla Will kept me from having to return to an unwelcoming home.</p><p>Funny that, how little things have changed.</p><p>On the set, Prateek introduces me to Arun, the assistant casting director, who takes a brief pause from his mobile phone conversation to appraise me. He says something to Prateek in Hindi and then nods at me and barks, \u201cCostume.\u201d</p><p>Prateek squeezes my arm, as he leads me to the costume room, which is a series of rolling racks full of suits and dresses, tended to by a harried woman with glasses. \u201cFind something that fits,\u201d she orders.</p><p>Everything is at least a head too short for me. Which is about the amount by which I tower over most Indians. Prateek looks worried. \u201cDo you have a suit?\u201d he asks.</p><p>The last time I wore a suit was to Bram\u2019s funeral. No, I don\u2019t have a suit.</p><p>\u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d Neema, the wardrobe lady snaps.</p><p>Prateek grovels, apologizing for my height, as if it were a personality defect.</p><p>She sighs impatiently. \u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>Prateek looks at me in alarm. \u201cI hope they do not send you back. Arun just told me that one of the ashram people left this morning and now I am back down to seven.\u201d</p><p>I slouch, make myself shorter. \u201cDoes that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe suit still will not fit,\u201d he says, shaking his head as if I\u2019m an imbecile.</p><p>Neema returns with a garment bag. Inside is a suit, freshly pressed, shiny blue, sharkskin. \u201cThis is from the actors\u2019 wardrobe, so don\u2019t mess it,\u201d she warns, shoving me into a curtained area to try it on.</p><p>The suit fits. When Prateek sees me, he grins. \u201cYou look so first-class,\u201d he says, amazed. \u201cCome, walk by Arun. Casual, casual. Oh, yes, he sees. Very good. I think I am almost assured a spot in the credits. To think, one day, I might be like Arun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare to dream.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m teasing, but I keep forgetting that Prateek takes everything literally. \u201cOh, yes. To dream is the ultimate dare, is it not?\u201d</p><p>The film set is a faux cocktail lounge, with a grand piano right in the middle. The Indian stars circle the area around the bar, and then deeper into the set mill the fifty or so extras. The majority of them are Indians, but there are about fifteen or twenty Westerners. I go stand next to an Indian in a tux, but he narrows his eyes at me and scoots away.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re such snobs!\u201d a skinny, tan girl in a sparkly blue dress says, laughing. \u201cThey won\u2019t talk to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like reverse colonialism or something,\u201d says a guy with dreadlocks tied back into a band. \u201cNash,\u201d he says, sticking out a hand.</p><p>\u201cTasha,\u201d says the girl.</p><p>\u201cWillem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem,\u201d they repeat, dreamily. \u201cYou at the ashram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. We didn\u2019t think so. We\u2019d have recognized you,\u201d Tasha says. \u201cYou\u2019re so tall. Like Jules.\u201d</p><p>Nash nods his head. I do too. We all nod at this Jules\u2019s height.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to India?\u201d I ask, slipping easily back into Postcard Language.</p><p>\u201cWe are refugees,\u201d Tasha says. \u201cFrom the fame-and-celebrity-obsessed materialistic world in the States. We are here to cleanse ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d I gesture to the set.</p><p>Nash laughs. \u201cEnlightenment ain\u2019t free. It\u2019s kind of expensive, actually. So we\u2019re here trying to buy some more time. What about you, dude? Why brings you to Bollywoodland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fame, of course.\u201d</p><p>They both laugh. Then Nash asks, \u201cWanna go get baked? They aren\u2019t doing anything except making us wait.\u201d He pulls out a fat joint. \u201cI wait just as well stoned.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>We sneak off outside where half of the extras seem to be smoking cigarettes in the shade of the overhang. Nash lights up and takes a hit, passes it to Tasha, who takes a long, deep drag and passes it to me. The hash is strong and it\u2019s been a while, so it hits me immediately. We pass the joint around a few more times.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really . . . tall, Willem,\u201d Tasha says.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think you mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really have to introduce him to Jules,\u201d Tasha drawls. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. And Canadian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d Nash says. \u201cRighteous idea.\u201d</p><p>The world\u2019s gone a bit washed out, overbright and spinny. \u201cWho\u2019s Jules?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a girl,\u201d Nash answers. \u201cCute. Ginger hair. She\u2019s at the ashram but she might come out in a day or two. She\u2019s tall. Oh, Tasha already said that. Shit, here comes the assistant director dude. Hide the joint.\u201d</p><p>Tasha pinches the joint between her fingers just as a birdlike man comes and looks at us. Even though Tasha is holding the joint, it\u2019s me he focuses on. He takes out his phone and snaps a picture, and then disappears without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cOh. Shit,\u201d Tasha says, giggling. \u201cWe got caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got caught,\u201d Nash says. \u201cThey only took his picture.\u201d He sounds a bit insulted.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s hash, you always blame the Dutchman,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Nash says, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paranoid now,\u201d Tasha says.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back. Save the rest of that for later,\u201d Nash says.</p><p>With the hash buzzing around my head, the waiting on set goes slower, not faster. I spend a few minutes twirling a rupee coin across my hand but I keep dropping it. I turn on my phone to play some solitaire, but then, on a strange stoned whim, use my phone for its intended purpose. I make a call.</p><p>\u201cHello . . . this is Willem,\u201d I say when she picks up.</p><p>\u201cI know who this is.\u201d I can hear fury in her voice. Even calling her gets me in trouble? \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a film set. I\u2019m acting in a Bollywood movie for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Yael never had much patience for \u201clow\u201d culture, outside of the cheesy Israeli pop music she couldn\u2019t resist. She didn\u2019t like movies or TV shows. She surely thinks all this is a waste of time.</p><p>\u201cAnd when did you decide to do this?\u201d she says at last. Her voice is flinty enough to spark a fire.</p><p>\u201cYesterday. This morning officially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when did you think to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s the hash, but I actually laugh out loud. Because it\u2019s just funny\u2014in the way that absurd things are.</p><p>Yael doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou wanting to know my itinerary, that\u2019s pretty amusing. When you haven\u2019t given a thought to my whereabouts, my well-being for the last three years. When you brought me over to India and then a week later shipped me right back off again and didn\u2019t bother to call once. You couldn\u2019t even be bothered to come to the airport to pick me up. Oh, I know there was an emergency, something more important, but there always is, isn\u2019t there? So why would you need to know that I was acting in a Bollywood movie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stop.

I see the half dozen missed calls, the Where are you? texts.</p><p>Another missed connection. Story of my life these days.</p> <p>Twenty-six</p><p>That night, we finish up at eight and pile into a rickety bus for an hour-long ride to a squat cement hotel where we\u2019re put four to a room. I wind up with Nash and Tasha and Argin, another acolyte from their ashram. The three of them pass a joint around and tell repeating stories about reaching enlightenment. They offer the joint to me, but after the afternoon\u2019s hash-fueled debacle with Yael, I don\u2019t trust myself. Eventually, I fall asleep, but I\u2019m woken up in the middle of the night to the enthusiastic squeaking of the bedframe. Nash and Tasha. Or maybe all three of them. It is extremely unpleasant\u2014and it\u2019s pathetic because I can\u2019t think of anywhere else I\u2019d rather be.</p><p>The next day, on set, it\u2019s more of the same. After I put on my suit, I see Prateek for half a second before he dashes off. \u201cMust find more people,\u201d he calls to me. \u201cThree left yesterday. I need four today!\u201d Neema evil-eyes me. The assistant director snaps another picture. They really are serious about the suit.</p><p>Late that afternoon Prateek returns with new recruits, including a leggy woman with reddish hair streaked through with pink.</p><p>\u201cJules!\u201d Nash and Tasha scream when she arrives. They all hug and dance in a small circle and then Tasha waves me over.</p> <p>\u201cJules,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is Willem. We\u2019ve decided he\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh have you?\u201d Jules rolls her eyes a bit. She is tall, not quite as tall as me, but nearly. \u201cI\u2019m Jules, but apparently you already know that,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Willem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your suit, Willem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. It\u2019s a very special suit. So special they keep snapping my picture to make sure I don\u2019t mess it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019re a man who knows his way around a closet. I\u2019m supposed to get into wardrobe. Show me where to go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad to.\u201d</p><p>She links an arm around mine as we walk to the racks. \u201cSo you met Nash and Tash, I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the pleasure of spending the night with them.\u201d</p><p>She makes a face. \u201cThey had sex, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cMy condolences.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at that.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m staying in the room with you tonight. I\u2019ll try to even things out.\u201d She gives me a look. \u201cNot like that, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I\u2019m thinking about is getting you into a dress,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks. \u201cGetting me into a dress?\u201d</p><p>I laugh again. Jules has got her arm wrapped around mine, which is a pleasant distraction from the hangover I\u2019ve had since yesterday\u2019s fight with Yael. Girls have always been the best distractions.</p><p>Until a girl became the thing I needed distraction from.</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>It\u2019s after five when we finally get around to shooting. Our scene is a song, the moment when Billy Devali\u2019s character first meets Amisha Rai\u2019s and is so besotted he breaks out singing and playing the piano. We are all supposed to watch, mesmerized by this authentic display of love at first sight. At the end, we clap.</p><p>We spend the rest of the day shooting. When we break for the day, the assistant director tells us to plan on staying at least two more days. Prateek takes me aside to say it\u2019ll probably be more than that and would I mind staying? I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m quite happy to stay until I fly back to Holland.</p><p>We\u2019re lining up for the bus again, when the assistant director snaps yet another picture of me. \u201cMan, they\u2019re building a serious case against you,\u201d Nash says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not even wearing the suit right now.\u201d</p><p>That night in the hotel, there are five of us. Nash, Tasha, Argin, me and Jules. Jules and I share a mattress on the floor. Nothing happens. Not with us, anyhow. Her presence does little to stop Nash and Tasha from their late-night calisthenics, but when it happens, I can see Jules quaking with laughter, and then I am, too.</p><p>She rolls over on her side to face me. \u201cMisery loves company,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>The next day, I\u2019m in the lunch queue for some dal and rice when the assistant director taps me on the back. I even pose this time for the anticipated photo, but there\u2019s no camera. Instead he instructs me to come with him.</p><p>\u201cDid you stain the suit?\u201d Jules calls after me.</p><p>Arun trots up behind us, followed by Prateek, who looks stricken. How much can this suit be worth?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask Prateek as we walk past the set and toward the row of trailers.</p><p>\u201cFaruk! Khan!\u201d He sputters the name like a cough.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Faruk Khan?\u201d But before Prateek can answer, I\u2019m pulled up the stairs and pushed into one of the trailers. Inside, Faruk Khan, Amisha Rai, and Billy Devali are sitting in a huddle. They all stare at me for what seems like an eternity, until Billy finally booms, \u201cThere! Did I not tell you?\u201d</p><p>Amisha lights another cigarette and kicks up her bare feet, which are covered with vinelike henna tattoos. \u201cYou are absolutely right,\u201d she says in a lilting accent. \u201cHe looks like an American movie star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that one,\u201d Billy snaps his fingers. \u201cHeath Ledger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly not dead,\u201d Faruk says.</p><p>They cluck in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI think Heath Ledger was from Australia,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d Faruk says. \u201cWhere are you from? America? UK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolland.\u201d</p><p>Billy wrinkles his nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t have an accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou almost sound British,\u201d Amisha says. \u201cClose enough to South African.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is closer to South African,\u201d I say in a clipped Afrikaans accent.</p><p>Amisha claps her hands. \u201cHe can do accents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfrikaans is close to Dutch,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever acted before?\u201d Faruk asks.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really?\u201d Amisha asks, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cA little Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot say \u2018not really\u2019 and then say you\u2019ve done William Shakespeare,\u201d Faruk says scornfully. \u201cWhat is your name? Or should we call you Mr. Not Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer Willem. Willem de Ruiter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBit of a mouthful,\u201d Billy says.</p><p>\u201cNot a good stage name,\u201d Amisha says.</p><p>\u201cHe can change it,\u201d Billy says. \u201cAll the Americans do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the Indians don\u2019t,\u201d Amisha says. \u201cBilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not American,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI\u2019m Dutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Mr. de . . . Willem,\u201d Faruk says. \u201cNo matter. We have a problem. One of our Western actors, an American named Dirk Digby, he lives in Dubai, perhaps you\u2019ve heard of him?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. It appears Mr. Digby had some last-minute problems with the contract and had to make other plans, and this leaves us with a small part open. It\u2019s a South African diamond dealer, shady character, who tries to woo our Miss Rai while also trying to steal her family\u2019s Shakti diamond. Not a large part, but significant, and we find ourselves in a bit of a bind. We were looking for someone who can look the part and who can manage a few lines of Hindi and a few lines of English. How are you with languages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good,\u201d I say. \u201cI grew up speaking several.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, try this line,\u201d Faruk says, and he reads me something.</p><p>\u201cTell me what it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Amisha says. \u201cA natural actor would want to know. I don\u2019t think Dirk ever knows what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><p>Faruk waves her off. He turns to me. \u201cYou are trying to keep Amisha\u2019s character, Heera, from marrying Billy here, but really, you only want her family\u2019s diamonds. It\u2019s in English with some Hindi. This is the part where you tell Heera you know who she is, and that her name means diamond. I\u2019ll say it, you repeat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMain jaanta hoon tum kaun ho, Heera Gopal. Heera, it means diamond, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Faruk says</p><p>\u201cMain jaanta hoon tum kaun ho, Heera Gopal. Heera, it means diamond, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>They all stare at me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Amisha asks.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sounded as if you spoke Hindi fluently,\u201d Billy says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always had an ear for languages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredible, really.\u201d Amisha turns to Faruk. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to cut the dialogue.\u201d</p><p>Faruk stares at me. \u201cIt is three days shooting, starting next week. Here in Mumbai. You will have to learn lines. I can have someone help you with the Hindi pronunciation and translations, but there is a good bit of English.\u201d He strokes his beard. \u201cI can pay you thirty thousand rupees.\u201d</p><p>I pause, trying to do the conversions.</p><p>Faruk takes my silence for bargaining. \u201cOkay,\u201d he counters. \u201cForty thousand rupees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long would I have to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot starts Monday, should last three days,\u201d Faruk says.</p><p>Monday is when I\u2019m meant to fly back to Amsterdam. Do I want to stay three more days? But then Faruk continues. \u201cWe would put you up in the cast hotel. It\u2019s on Juhu Beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuhu Beach is very nice,\u201d Billy says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meant to leave on Monday. I have a flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you change your flight?\u201d Faruk asks.</p><p>I\u2019m sure Mukesh can. And if they\u2019re putting me up in a hotel, it would keep me from having to go back to the Bombay Royale.</p><p>\u201cFifty thousand,\u201d Faruk says. \u201cBut that\u2019s my final offer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than a thousand dollars, Mr. de Ruiter,\u201d Amisha informs me with a husky laugh and a billowing exhale of cigarette smoke. \u201cToo good to turn down, I think.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>The production immediately relocates me to a posh hotel in Juhu Beach. The first thing I do is shower. Then I plug in my phone, which has been dead for the past day. I half expect a text or call from Yael, but there isn\u2019t one. I consider telling her I\u2019m staying longer, but after our last conversation, after the last three weeks\u2014three years\u2014I feel like she has no right to this information. Instead, I text Mukesh, asking him to bump my departure date by another three days.</p><p>Immediately, he calls back. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided to stay with us longer!\u201d he says. He sounds delighted.</p><p>\u201cJust a few days.\u201d I explain to him about being an extra and now being cast in a small part.</p><p>\u201cOh, that is most exciting,\u201d he says. \u201cMummy must be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMummy doesn\u2019t know, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her. I\u2019ve been staying out by the studios, and now I\u2019m in a hotel in Juhu Beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuhu Beach. Very classy,\u201d Mukesh says. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen Mummy since you came back from Rajasthan? I thought she picked you up at the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange of plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cWhen do you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to start shooting on Monday, and it\u2019s meant to take three days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSafer to assume it\u2019ll take double,\u201d Mukesh says. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I pick up my script. Faruk has written English translations above the Hindi and someone has made me a tape recording of the Hindi. I spend the afternoon repeating the lines.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I pace the room for a bit. It\u2019s all modern and posh, with a bathtub and a shower and a wide double bed. I haven\u2019t slept somewhere this nice in ages, and it\u2019s a little too quiet, a little too pristine. I sit on the bed, watch Hindi TV just to have some company. I order dinner in my room. That night when I go to bed, I find I can\u2019t sleep. The bed is too soft, too big, after so many years of sleeping on trains, in cars, on bunkbeds, sofas, futons, Ana Lucia\u2019s cramped bed. Now I\u2019m like one of those rescued shipwrecked men who, once rescued and back in civilization, can only sleep on the floor.</p><p>Friday I wake up and practice my lines again. The shoot doesn\u2019t start for three more days, and they stretch in front of me, endlessly, like the gray blue sea out my window. When my phone rings, I am embarrassed by my relief.</p> <p>\u201cWillem, Mukesh here. I have news about your flights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soonest I can get you out is April.\u201d He tells me some dates.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? All the flights are booked until then. Easter.\u201d</p> <p>Easter? In a Hindu/Muslim country? I sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re sure there\u2019s nothing sooner? I don\u2019t mind paying a bit extra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to be done. I did the best I could.\u201d He sounds a bit insulted when he says the last bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat about booking me a new flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Willem, it is only a matter of weeks, and flights are expensive this time of year, and also full.\u201d His voice has gone scolding. \u201cIt is just a few extra days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you keep looking? See if any seats open up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly! Will do.\u201d</p> <p>I hang up and try to fight off the sense of impending doom. I\u2019d thought the film would keep me here a few extra days, all of them in a hotel. Now I\u2019m stuck. I remind myself that I don\u2019t need to stay in Mumbai past the shoot. Nash and Tasha and Jules are going to Goa for a few days if they can cobble the cash together. Maybe I\u2019ll go with them. Maybe I\u2019ll even pay.</p><p>I send Jules a text: Is Goa still a go?</p><p>She texts back: Only if I don\u2019t kill N&amp;T. Last night unbearably loud. You are a traitor for deserting.</p><p>I look around my hotel room where last night it was unbearably quiet. I take a shot of the view from the balcony and send it to Jules. It\u2019s quiet here. And there\u2019s room for two if you want to desert, I write.</p><p>I like dessert, she texts back. Tell me where you are.</p><p>A few hours later, there\u2019s a knock at the door. I open it and Jules comes in. She admires the view and hops on the bed. She picks up the script from the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cWant to run lines?\u201d I ask. \u201cThere\u2019s English translations.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>I show her where to start. She clears her throat and arranges her face. \u201cAnd who do you think you are?\u201d she asks in a haughty voice, her attempt, I think, to mimic Amisha.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder,\u201d I reply. \u201cThe name on my birth certificate reads Lars Von Gelder. But I know who you are, Heera Gopal. Heera, it means diamond, doesn\u2019t it? And you glitter as brightly as your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care to discuss my name with you, Mr. Von Gelder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you know me after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all I care to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know I am the top exporter of diamonds in South Africa, so I know a thing or two about precious gems. I can see more with my naked eye than most jewelers can with a loupe. And looking at you, I can tell that you are a million carats. And flawless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord has it that you\u2019re after my family\u2019s diamond, Mr. Von Gelder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am, Miss Gopal. I am.\u201d I pause for a beat. \u201cBut perhaps not the Shakti Diamond.\u201d</p><p>At the end of the section, Jules puts down the script. \u201cThis is quite cheesy, Mr. Van Gelder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Von Gelder, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. Mr. Von Gelder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important, you know? Names,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What\u2019s Jules short for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliana?\u201d I try. \u201cLike the Dutch queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Jules stands up from her chair and walks toward me, smiling as she folds herself into my lap. Then she kisses me.</p><p>\u201cJuliet,\u201d I try.</p><p>She shakes her head, smiling as she unbuttons her shirt. \u201cNot Juliet. But you\u2019re welcome to be my Romeo tonight.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>The next morning, Jules leaves, back to Pune and the ashram with Nash and Tasha. We make vague plans to meet up in Goa the following week. I never do find out what Jules is short for.</p><p>I feel hungover even though we didn\u2019t drink, and lonely even though I\u2019m used to being on my own. I call Prateek to see what he\u2019s doing this weekend, but he\u2019s helping his mother at home today and tomorrow he is going to a big family dinner with his uncle. I spend the day wandering Juhu Beach. I watch a bunch of men play soccer on the sand and it all makes me miss the boys in Utrecht. And then all the missing congeals, and it\u2019s Lulu I miss, and I know it must be displaced, my loneliness a heat-seeking missile, her the heat. Only I can\u2019t seem to find a new source of heat. I don\u2019t miss Jules at all.</p><p>By Sunday, I\u2019m going stir-crazy. I decide to take a train out of the city, a day trip somewhere. I\u2019ve just opened my guidebook to figure out where to go when my phone rings. I practically leap on it.</p><p>\u201cWillem!\u201d Mukesh\u2019s jovial voice echoes through the line. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been happier to hear from him. \u201cWhat are you doing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to suss that out. I was thinking of making a day trip to Khandala.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKhandala is very nice, but far for one day so you must leave early. If you like, I can arrange a driver for you another day. I have a different proposal for you. How about I take you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There are some very lovely temples in Mumbai, smaller temples tourists so rarely see. My wife and daughters are away, so I have the day free.\u201d</p><p>I gratefully accept, and at noon, Mukesh picks me up in a small battered Ford and proceeds to speed me around Mumbai. We stop at three different temples, watching young men do yoga-like calisthenics, watching old Sadhus meditating in prayer. The third stop is a Jain temple, the acolytes all hold small brooms sweeping in front of them as they walk. \u201cTo brush any living creatures out of their way so not to inadvertently take a life,\u201d Mukesh explains. \u201cSuch care for life,\u201d he says. \u201cJust like Mummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Mummy is practically a Jain,\u201d I say. \u201cOr maybe she\u2019s aiming to be the next Mother Teresa?\u201d</p><p>Mukesh gives me a sympathetic look that makes me want to break something. \u201cYou know how I met Mummy, do you not?\u201d he asks as we walk through a breezeway in the temple.</p><p>\u201cI assume it had something to do with the fascinating world of air travel.\u201d I\u2019m being unfair to Mukesh, but such is the price for making himself her emissary.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThat came later. I was with my own mummy who had the cancer.\u201d He clucks his tongue. \u201cShe was having her treatments, tip-top doctor, but it was in the lungs, so not much to be done. We were coming from the specialist one day, waiting for a taxi, but Amma, that\u2019s my mummy, was quite weak and dizzy and she fell on the street. Your mummy happened to be nearby and she rushed up to ask if she could help. I explained to her about Amma\u2019s condition\u2014it was terminal,\u201d he lowers his voice to a whisper. \u201cBut your mummy told me about different things that could help, not to cure her, but to make the dizziness and the weakness better. And she came, every week, to my home, with her needles and her massages and it helped so much. When my amma\u2019s time came, her journey to the next life was so much more peaceful. Thanks to your mummy.\u201d</p><p>I see what he\u2019s doing. Mukesh is attempting to interpret my mother to me much in the way Bram used to do when he\u2019d explain why Yael seemed so gruff or distant. He was the one to quietly tell me stories about Saba, who, after the death of Yael\u2019s mother, Naomi, came undone by one tragedy too many. He turned overprotective, paranoid, or more overprotective and paranoid, Bram said, not allowing Yael to do the simplest things\u2014swim in a public pool, have a friend over\u2014and forcing her to keep disaster preparation checklists for any kind of emergency. \u201cShe promised she would do everything differently,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it would be different for you. So it wouldn\u2019t be oppressive.\u201d</p><p>As if there\u2019s only one kind of oppressive.</p><p>After the temples, we have lunch. I\u2019m feeling bad about how I acted toward Mukesh, so when he tells me he has something extra special he wants to show me\u2014something very few tourists ever see\u2014I paste on my smile and act excited. As we bump across Mumbai, the streets becomes more dense: bicycles, rickshaws, cars, donkey-pulled carts, cows, women with bundles on their heads, all converge onto choked streets that don\u2019t seem built for such traffic. The buildings themselves suffer from the same syndrome; the mix of high-rises and shacks are all overflowing with rivers of people, sleeping on mats, hanging laundry on lines, cooking on small fires outside.</p><p>We turn down a dank narrow alley, shrouded somehow from the bright sunlight. Mukesh points to the row of young girls in tattered saris, standing. \u201cProstitutes,\u201d he says.</p><p>At the end of the alley we stop. I look back at the prostitutes. Some are younger than me, and their eyes look blank, and it all makes me feel ashamed somehow. Mukesh points to a squat cement building with a name written on it in both swirly Hindi and block English. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he says.</p><p>I read the sign. mitali. It\u2019s vaguely familiar.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Mummy\u2019s clinic, of course,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYael\u2019s clinic?\u201d I ask in alarm.</p><p>\u201cYes, I thought we might pay her a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, but . . .\u201d I sputter for excuses. \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday,\u201d I finish, as if the day of the week is the problem.</p><p>\u201cSickness does not take a Sabbath.\u201d Mukesh points to a small teashop on the corner. \u201cI will wait for you there.\u201d And then he\u2019s gone.</p><p>I stand in front of the clinic for a minute. One of the prostitutes\u2014she looks no older than thirteen\u2014starts to walk toward me and I can\u2019t stand the thought that she thinks I\u2019m a client, so I shove open the door to the clinic. The door swings open, right onto an old woman crouched just inside. There are people everywhere, with homemade bandages, and listless babies, napping on pallets on the floor. They\u2019re camped all up the cement stairs and all around the waiting room, giving new meaning to the term.</p><p>\u201cAre you Willem?\u201d From behind the glass partition a no-nonsense Indian woman in a lab coat is looking at me. Two seconds later, she opens the door to the waiting room. I feel all the eyes turn to me. The woman says something in Hindi or Marathi and there is much silent nodding, giving new meaning to the term patient, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Doctor Gupta,\u201d she says, her voice brisk, efficient but warm. \u201cI work with your mother. Let me go find her. Would you like some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you.\u201d I have the sickening feeling that everyone else is in on a joke but me.</p><p>\u201cGood, good. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>She leads me to a small windowless room with a ripped gurney, and a rush of memory overtakes me. The last time I was in a hospital: Paris. The time before that: Amsterdam. Yael had called me at my dorm, very early that morning, telling me to come. Bram was sick.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t understand the urgency. I\u2019d seen him not a week before. He\u2019d been a little off his game, a sore throat, but Yael was tending to him with her usual teas and tinctures. I had an exam that day. I asked if I could come after. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome now,\u201d she said.</p><p>At the hospital, Yael had stood in the corner while three doctors\u2014the traditional kind, with stethoscopes and guarded expressions\u2014surrounded me in a grim little circle and explained to me that Bram had contracted a rare strain of strep that had sent his body into septic shock. His kidneys had already failed and now his liver was going, too. They were doing everything they could, putting him on dialysis and pumping him full of the most powerful antibiotics, but so far, nothing had been effective. I should brace myself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said.</p><p>Neither did they, really. All they could say was, \u201cIt\u2019s one of those one-in-a-million cases.\u201d Such comforting odds, except when you were the one.</p> <p>It was like finding out the world was made of gossamer and could be so easily ripped apart. To be so solely at the mercy of fate. Even with all Bram\u2019s talk of accidents, it seemed inconceivable.</p><p>I looked to Yael, mighty Yael, to intervene, to swoop in, to take care of Bram like she always had. But she just shrank into that corner, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cDo something, goddammit!\u201d I screamed at her. \u201cYou have to do something.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t. And two days later, Bram was gone.</p><p>\u201cWillem.\u201d</p> <p>I turn around and there\u2019s Yael. I always think she\u2019s so frightening, but she\u2019s actually tiny, barely reaching my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d she says.</p><p>I reach out and touch my face and I find it wet with tears. I\u2019m mortified to be doing this. In front of her. I turn away. I want to run. Out of this clinic. Out of India. Forget the shoot. Forget the flight delay. Buy a new ticket. It doesn\u2019t have to be back to Amsterdam. Anywhere that\u2019s not here.</p><p>I feel her hands on me, turning me back around. \u201cWillem?\u201d she asks. \u201cTell me why you\u2019re lost.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s shocking to hear her words, my words. That she remembered.</p><p>But how can I answer her? How can I answer when I\u2019ve been nothing but lost these last three years? So much more than I ever anticipated. I keep thinking of another one of the stories Bram used to tell, a horror story really, about when Yael was a girl. She was ten and Saba had taken her camping in the desert. Just the two of them. As the sun started to set, Saba said he\u2019d be right back, and then left her alone with one of those disaster preparation checklists that he was always having her make. Yael, terrified, but capable because of those very disaster preparation checklists, made a fire, made dinner, made camp, fended. When Saba showed up the next day, she screamed at him, How could you leave me alone? And Saba had said, I wasn\u2019t leaving you alone. I was watching the whole time. I was preparing you.</p> <p>Why didn\u2019t she prepare me? Why didn\u2019t she teach me about the universal law of equilibrium before I had to find it out for myself? Maybe then I wouldn\u2019t miss everything so much.</p><p>\u201cI miss . . .\u201d I start to say, but I can\u2019t get the words out.</p><p>\u201cYou miss Bram,\u201d she says.</p><p>And yes, of course I do. I miss my father. I miss my grandfather. I miss my home. And I miss my mother. But the thing is, for almost three years, I managed not to miss any of them. And then I spent that one day with that one girl. One day. One day of watching the rise and fall of her sleep under the rolling clouds in that park and feeling so peaceful that I fell asleep myself. One day of being under her protection\u2014I can still feel the grasp of her hand as we flew through the streets after she threw the book at the skinheads, her grip so strong that it felt like we were one person, not two. One day of being the beneficiary of her strange generosity\u2014the barge ride, the watch, that honesty, her willingness to show fear, her willingness to show courage. It was like she gave me her whole self, and somehow as a result, I gave her more of myself than I even realized there was to give. But then she was gone. And only after I\u2019d been filled up by her, by that day, did I understand how empty I really was.</p><p>Yael watches me a moment longer. \u201cWho else do you miss?\u201d she asks, like she already knows the answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, and for a minute she looks frustrated, like I\u2019m keeping it from her, but that\u2019s not it, and I don\u2019t want to keep things from her anymore. So I clarify. \u201cI don\u2019t know her name.\u201d</p><p>Yael looks up, surprised, and not. \u201cWhose name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLulu.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that her name?\u201d</p><p>So I tell my mother. About finding this girl, this strange and nameless girl, whom I showed nothing but who saw everything. I tell her how since losing her, I have felt bereft. And the relief at telling my mother this is almost as profound as the relief of finding Lulu was.</p><p>When I finish telling Yael the story about that day in Paris, I look at her. And I\u2019m shocked all over again because she\u2019s doing something I\u2019ve only seen her do in the kitchen while cutting onions.</p><p>My mother is crying.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d I ask her, now crying again myself.</p><p>\u201cBecause it sounds just like how I met Bram,\u201d she says, laughing on a sob.</p><p>Of course it does. I\u2019ve thought about that every single day since I met Lulu. Wondered if that\u2019s not why I\u2019m stuck on her. Because the story is so much like Yael and Bram\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cExcept for one thing,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asks, swiping at her eyes.</p><p>The most important detail. And you\u2019d think I would\u2019ve known better, having heard Bram\u2019s story so many times.</p><p>\u201cYou give the girl your address.\u201d</p><p>Thirty</p><p>APRIL</p><p>Mumbai</p><p>As Mukesh expected, the shoot goes over schedule by double, so for six days I have the pleasure of becoming Lars Von Gelder. And it is. A pleasure. A surprising one. On set, in costume, with Amisha and the other actors across from me, Lars Von Gelder\u2019s cheesy Hindi lines cease to feel cheesy. They don\u2019t even feel like another language. They roll off my tongue and I feel like I am him, the calculating operator who says one thing and wants another.</p><p>In between takes, I hang out in Amisha\u2019s trailer, playing games of hearts with her and Billy. \u201cWe\u2019re all impressed with your abilities,\u201d Amisha tells me. \u201cEven Faruk, though he\u2019ll never say so.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t. Not exactly. But at the end of each day, he pats me on the back and says, \u201cNot bad, Mr. Not Really.\u201d And I feel proud.</p><p>But then it\u2019s the last day and I know it\u2019s over, because instead of saying \u201cnot bad,\u201d Faruk says \u201cgood work,\u201d and thanks me.</p><p>And that\u2019s it. Next week, Amisha and the principles are packing for Abu Dhabi where they will shoot the final scenes of the film. And me? Yesterday I got a text from Tasha. She and Nash and Jules are in Goa. I\u2019m invited to go with them. But I won\u2019t.</p><p>I have a couple more weeks here. And I\u2019m spending them with my mother.</p><p>My first night back at the Bombay Royale, I get in late. Chaudhary is snoring behind the desk, so I take the stairs up to the fifth floor rather than wake him. Yael has left the door propped open, but she\u2019s also asleep when I get in. I\u2019m both relieved and disappointed. We haven\u2019t really spoken since that day at the clinic. I don\u2019t quite know what to expect between us. Have things changed? Do we speak a common language now?</p><p>The next morning she shakes me awake.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, blinking my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says back, almost shyly. \u201cI wanted to know, before I leave for work, if you wanted to join me tonight for a Seder. It\u2019s the first night of Passover.\u201d</p><p>I almost think she\u2019s joking. When I was growing up, we only celebrated the secular holidays. New Year\u2019s. Queen\u2019s Day. We never once had a Seder. I didn\u2019t even know what they were until Saba started visiting and told me about all the holidays he celebrated, that Yael used to celebrate when she was a child.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you go to Seders?\u201d I ask. My question is hesitant, because the mere asking of it touches on the tender spot of her childhood.</p><p>\u201cTwo years now,\u201d she answers. \u201cThere\u2019s an American family that started a school near the clinic, and they wanted to have one last year and I was the only Jew they knew, so they begged me to come, because they said they\u2019d feel funny having one without a Jew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not Jewish then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re Christians. Missionaries, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, but she\u2019s smiling. \u201cI have discovered that no one likes a Jewish holiday quite like a Christian fundamentalist.\u201d She laughs, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I heard her do that. \u201cThere might be a Catholic nun there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nun? This is starting to sound like one of Uncle Daniel\u2019s jokes. A nun and a missionary walk into a Seder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need three. A nun, a missionary, and an imam walk into a Seder,\u201d Yael says.</p><p>Imam. I think of the Muslim girls in Paris, and I\u2019m reminded, again, of Lulu. \u201cShe was Jewish, too,\u201d I say. \u201cMy American girl.\u201d</p><p>Yael\u2019s eyebrows go up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Yael raises her hands into the air. \u201cWell, maybe she\u2019s having her own Seder tonight.\u201d</p><p>The thought hadn\u2019t occurred to me, but as soon as she says it, I get a strange feeling that it\u2019s true. And for a second, even with those two oceans and everything else between us, Lulu doesn\u2019t feel quite so far away.</p><p>Thirty-one</p><p>The Donnellys, the family hosting tonight\u2019s Seder, live in a large sprawling white stucco house with a makeshift soccer pitch out front. When we arrive, several blond people spill out the front door, including three boys who Yael has told me she can\u2019t tell apart. I can see why. Aside from their height, they are identical, all tousled hair and gangly limbs and knobby Adam\u2019s apples. \u201cOne\u2019s Declan, one\u2019s Matthew, and the little one, I think, is Lucas,\u201d Yael says, not so helpfully.</p><p>The tallest one bounces a soccer ball in his hand. \u201cTime for a quick game?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too muddy, Dec,\u201d the blonde woman says. She smiles. \u201cHi, Willem. I\u2019m Kelsey. This is Sister Karenna,\u201d she says, gesturing to a weathered old smiling woman in a full Catholic habit.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, welcome,\u201d the nun says.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Paul,\u201d a mustached man in a Hawaiian shirt says, bundling me into a hug. \u201cAnd you look just like your mama.\u201d</p><p>Yael and I stare at each other. No one ever says that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the eyes,\u201d Paul says. He turns to Yael. \u201cYou hear about the cholera outbreak in the Dharavi slum?\u201d</p><p>They immediately start talking about that, so I go play some soccer with the brothers. They tell me how they\u2019ve been discussing Passover and the Exodus all week long as part of their studies. They are homeschooled. \u201cWe even made matzo over a campfire,\u201d the smallest one, Lucas, tells me.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know more than me,\u201d I say.</p><p>They laugh, like I\u2019m joking.</p><p>After a while, Kelsey calls us inside. The house reminds me of a flea market, a little of this, a little of that. A dining table on one side, a chalkboard on the other. Chore charts on the wall, alongside pictures of Jesus, Gandhi, and Ganesha. The entire house is fragrant with roasting meat.</p><p>\u201cIt smells wonderful,\u201d Yael says.</p><p>Kelsey smiles. \u201cI made roast leg of lamb stuffed with apples and walnuts.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cWe tried to get a brisket, but it\u2019s impossible here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly cow and all,\u201d Paul says.</p><p>\u201cThis is an Israeli recipe,\u201d Kelsey continues. \u201cAt least that\u2019s what the website said.\u201d</p><p>Yael is quiet for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s what my mother would\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>Yael\u2019s mother, Naomi, who escaped the horrors Saba had lived through only to be struck by a delivery truck on the way back from walking Yael to school. Universal law of equilibrium. Escape one horror, get hit by another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat else do you remember?\u201d I ask hesitantly. \u201cAbout Naomi.\u201d She was another unmentionable when I was growing up.</p><p>\u201cShe sang,\u201d Yael says quietly. \u201cAll the time. At the Seders too. So there was lots of singing at the Seders\u2014before. And people. When I was a child, we had a full house. Not after. Then it was just us. . . .\u201d She trails off. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as joyful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tonight, there will be singing,\u201d Paul says. \u201cSomeone get my guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Not the guitar,\u201d Matthew jokes.</p> <p>\u201cI like the guitar,\u201d Lucas says.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Kelsey says. \u201cReminds me of when we met.\u201d Her and Paul\u2019s eyes meet and tell a quiet story, the way Yael and Bram\u2019s used to, and I feel a longing pull at me.</p><p>\u201cShall we sit down?\u201d Kelsey asks, gesturing to the table. We take our seats.</p><p>\u201cI know I railroaded you into this again, but Yael, would you mind being the leader?\u201d Paul asks. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying up since last year and I\u2019ll chime in, but I feel you\u2019re better qualified. Otherwise we can ask Sister Karenna to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I do it?\u201d Sister Karenna jerks up.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a little deaf,\u201d Declan whispers to me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything, Sister, but relax,\u201d Kelsey says in a loud voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Yael tells Paul. \u201cIf you help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tag-team it,\u201d Paul says, winking at me.</p><p>But Yael hardly seems like she needs the help. She says an opening prayer over the wine in a clear strong voice, as if she\u2019s done this every year. Then she turns to Paul. \u201cMaybe you might explain the point of the Seder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Paul clears his throat and starts a long meandering explanation about how a Seder is meant to commemorate the Jews\u2019 exodus from Egypt, their escape from slavery and their return to the Promised Land, the miracles that ensued to make this happen. \u201cThough this happened thousands of years ago, Jews today retell the story every year to rejoice in the triumphant history, to remember it. But here\u2019s why I wanted to jump on the bandwagon. Because it\u2019s not just a retelling or a celebration of history. It\u2019s also a reminder of the price and the privilege of liberation.\u201d He turns to Yael. \u201cThat sound right?\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s a story we repeat because it\u2019s a history we want to see repeated,\u201d she says.</p><p>The Seder continues. We say blessings over the matzo, we eat the vegetables in salt water, and then the bitter herbs. Kelsey serves soup. \u201cNot matzo ball, mulligatawny,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope lentils are okay.\u201d</p><p>While we\u2019re eating our soup, Paul suggests that since the point of the Seder is to retell a story of liberation, we all take a turn and talk about a time in our lives when we escaped some sort of oppression. \u201cOr escaped anything really.\u201d He goes first, talking about his life as it used to be, drinking, drugs, aimless and sad before he found God, and then found Kelsey and then found meaning.</p><p>Sister Karenna goes next, talking about escaping the brutality of poverty when she was taken in by a church school, and going on to become a nun to serve others.</p><p>Then it\u2019s my turn. I pause. My first instinct is to tell about Lulu. Because really that was a day I felt like I escaped danger.</p><p>But I decide to tell a different story, in part because I don\u2019t think this one has been told out loud since he died. The story of one hitchhiking girl and two brothers and the three centimeters that sealed all our fates. It\u2019s not really my escape. It\u2019s hers. But it is my story. The founding tale of my family. And as Yael said about the Seder, it\u2019s a story I repeat because it\u2019s a history I want to see repeated.</p><p>Thirty-two</p><p>The night before I fly back to Amsterdam, Mukesh calls to go over all my flight details. \u201cI got you an exit row seat,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be more comfortable, with all your height. Though maybe if you tell them you are a Bollywood star, you\u2019ll get business class.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does the film come out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. They just finished shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny how it all worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight place, right time,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you wouldn\u2019t have been in the right place in the right time had we not canceled your camel trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it got canceled. Because the camels got sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, camels just fine. Mummy asked me to bring you back early.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cAlso, plenty of flights back to Amsterdam before tomorrow, but when you disappeared to the movie, Mummy asked me to keep you here a little bit longer.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cRight place, right time.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Prateek comes to drive us to the airport. Chaudhary shuffles to the curb to see us off, wagging his fingers and reminding us of the legally mandated taxi fares.</p><p>I sit in the backseat this time, because this time Yael is coming to with us. On the ride to the airport, she is quiet. So am I. I don\u2019t quite know what to say. Mukesh\u2019s confession last night has rattled me, and I want to ask Yael about it, but I don\u2019t know if I should. If she\u2019d wanted me to know, she would\u2019ve told me.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do when you get back?\u201d she asks me after a while.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I really have no idea. At the same time, I\u2019m ready to go back.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you stay?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI can stay on Broodje\u2019s couch for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the couch? I thought you were living there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy room\u2019s been rented.\u201d Even if it hadn\u2019t, everyone is moving out at the end of the summer. W is moving in with Lien in Amsterdam. Henk and Broodje are going to get their own flat together. It\u2019s the end of an era, Willy, Broodje wrote me in an email.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to Amsterdam?\u201d Yael asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s nowhere to go,\u201d I say.</p><p>I look straight at her and she looks straight at me and it\u2019s like we\u2019re acknowledging that. But then she raises her eyebrow. \u201cYou never know,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll land somewhere.\u201d I look out the window. The car is climbing onto the expressway. I can already feel Mumbai falling away.</p><p>\u201cWill you keep looking for her? That girl?\u201d</p><p>The way she says it, keep looking, as if I haven\u2019t stopped. And I realize in some way, I haven\u2019t. Which is maybe the problem.</p><p>\u201cWhat girl is this?\u201d Prateek asks, surprised. I never told him of any girl.</p><p>I look at the dashboard, where Ganesha is dancing away just as he did on that first drive from the airport. \u201cHey, Ma. What was that mantra? The one from the Ganesha temple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOm gam ganapatayae namaha?\u201d Yael asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>From the front seat, Prateek chants it. \u201cOm gam ganapatayae namaha.\u201d</p><p>I repeat it. \u201cOm gam ganapatayae namaha.\u201d I pause as the sound floats through the car. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m after. New beginnings.\u201d</p><p>Yael reaches out to touch the scar on my face. It\u2019s faded now, thanks to her ministrations. She smiles at me. And it occurs to me that I might have already gotten what I asked for.</p><p>Thirty-three</p><p>MAY</p><p>Amsterdam</p><p>A week after I get back from India, while I\u2019m still camped out at the couch on Bloemstraat trying to get over my jetlag and figure out what my next move is, I get an unlikely call.</p><p>\u201cHey, little man. You coming to clear your shit out of my attic?\u201d There\u2019s no introduction, no preamble. Not that I need one. Even though we have not spoken in years, I know the voice. It\u2019s so much like his brother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cUncle Daniel,\u201d I say. \u201cHey. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I? I\u2019m in my flat. With my attic. That has your shit in it.\u201d</p><p>This is a surprise. All the years I grew up, I have never actually seen Daniel in the flat he owns. It\u2019s the same flat on the Ceintuurbaan that he and Bram used to live in. Back then, it was a squat. It\u2019s where they were living when Yael came and knocked on the door and changed everything.</p><p>Within six months, Bram had married Yael and moved them into their own flat. Within another year, he\u2019d cobbled together the funds to buy a broken-down old barge on the Nieuwe Prinsengracht. Daniel stayed in the squat, eventually getting a lease for it and then buying it from the city government for a pittance. Unlike Bram, who went on to fix up his boat, floorboard by floorboard, until it was the \u201cBauhaus on the Gracht,\u201d Daniel left the flat in its state of anarchist disrepair and rented it out. He got almost nothing for it. \u201cBut nothing is enough to live like a king in Southeast Asia,\u201d Bram used to say. So that\u2019s where Daniel stayed, riding the ups and down of the Asian economy with a series of business ventures that mostly went nowhere.</p><p>\u201cYour ma called,\u201d Daniel continues. \u201cTold me you were back. Said you might need a place to stay. I told her you needed to come get your shit out of my attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have shit in the attic?\u201d I ask him, stretching out from the too-short sofa and trying to digest my surprise. Yael called Daniel? For me?</p><p>\u201cEveryone has shit in the attic,\u201d Daniel says, laughing a huskier, smokier version of Bram\u2019s laugh. \u201cWhen can you come over?\u201d</p><p>We arrange for me to come over the next day. Daniel texts me the address, though that\u2019s hardly necessary. I know his flat better than I know him. I know the stuck-in-time furniture\u2014the zebra-striped egg chair, the 1950s lamps that Bram used to find at flea markets and rewire. I even know the smell, patchouli and hash. \u201cIt\u2019s how this place has smelled for twenty years,\u201d Bram would say when he and I would visit the flat together to fix a faucet or deliver keys to a new tenant. When I was younger, the lively multi-ethnic area where Daniel lived, right across from the treasures of the Albert Cuyp street market, seemed like another country from the quiet outer canal where we lived.</p><p>Over the years, the neighborhood has changed. The once working-class caf\u00e9s around the market now serve things with truffles, and in the market, alongside the stalls hawking fish and cheese, there are designer boutiques. The houses have smartened up, too. You can see them through picture windows, the sparkling kitchens, the expensive clean-lined furniture.</p><p>Not Daniel\u2019s place, though. As his neighbors renovated and upgraded, his flat dug into its time warp. I suspect that\u2019s still the case, especially after he warns me that the buzzer doesn\u2019t work and instructs me to call upon arrival so he can throw down the keys. So I\u2019m caught a little off guard when he opens the door to the flat and I\u2019m ushered into a lounge, all wide-plank bamboo floors, sage-colored walls, low, modern sofas. I look around the room. It\u2019s unrecognizable, except for the egg chair, and even that\u2019s been reupholstered.</p><p>\u201cLittle man,\u201d Daniel says, though I am not little at all, a few fingers taller than him. I look at Daniel. His reddish hair is maybe a little shot through with gray, the smile lines cut a little deeper, but otherwise he\u2019s the same.</p><p>\u201cLittle uncle,\u201d I joke back, patting him on the head as I hand him back the keys. I walk around. \u201cYou\u2019ve done something to the place,\u201d I say, tapping a finger to my chin.</p><p>Daniel laughs. \u201cOh. I\u2019m only halfway there, but that\u2019s halfway farther than no way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got big plans. Actual plans. Where are my plans?\u201d Out the window, there\u2019s the roar of a jet rumbling through the clouds. Daniel watches it, then he resumes his search, spinning around peering at the crowded bookshelves. \u201cIt\u2019s a little slow going because I\u2019m doing the work myself, though I can afford to hire it out, but it just seemed like I should do it this way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Afford it? Daniel has always been broke; Bram used to help him out. But Bram\u2019s not here. Maybe one of his Asian business ventures finally hit. I watch Daniel skitter around the room in search of something, finally locating a set of blueprints shoved halfway under the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI wish he was here to help me; I think he\u2019d be happy that I\u2019m finally making this place mine. But in a way I feel like he is here. Also, he\u2019s footing the bill,\u201d he says.</p><p>It takes me a minute to understand who he\u2019s talking about, what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cThe boat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He nods.</p> <p>Back in India, Yael barely spoke of Daniel. I figured that they weren\u2019t in touch anymore. With Bram gone, why would they be? They never liked each other. At least that\u2019s how it seemed to me. Daniel was flakey, messy, a spendthrift\u2014all the things that Yael loved in Bram in less extreme form\u2014and Yael was the person who swept in and upended Daniel\u2019s life. If there wasn\u2019t much room for me, I can only imagine how it felt for him. It made sense to me why Daniel moved half a world away a few years after Yael showed up.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a will,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to do that, but of course she did. That\u2019s your ma for you.\u201d</p><p>Is it? I think about my trip to Rajasthan, an exile that turned out to be what I needed. Then I think about Mukesh, not just canceling the camel tour and delaying my return flight at Yael\u2019s behest, but also dropping me off at the clinic that day, when everyone seemed to be expecting me. I\u2019d always assumed my mother was so hands off, taking care of everyone but me. But I\u2019m starting to wonder if perhaps I misunderstood her brand of caretaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to get that,\u201d I tell Daniel.</p><p>\u201cGood timing, too,\u201d he says. He scratches his beard. \u201cI didn\u2019t offer you coffee. You want coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say no to a coffee.\u201d</p><p>I follow him into the kitchen, which is the old kitchen, all chipped cupboards, cracked tiles, ancient tiny gas range, cold-water-only sink.</p><p>\u201cKitchen\u2019s next. And the bedrooms. Maybe halfway was a bit optimistic. I\u2019d better get on it. You should come live with me. Help me out,\u201d he says with a loud clap of his hands. \u201cYour pa always said you were handy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m handy, but Bram was always drafting me for help with some home-improvement project or another.</p><p>He puts the coffee on the stove. \u201cI gotta get into gear. I\u2019ve got two months now, so tick-tock, tick-tock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo months until what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, shit. I didn\u2019t tell you. I only just told your ma.\u201d His face breaks out into a smile that looks so much like Bram\u2019s it hurts.</p><p>\u201cTold her what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Willem, I\u2019m going to be a father.\u201d</p><p>As we drink coffee, Daniel fills me on the big news. At the age of forty-seven, the perennial bachelor has at last found love. But, because apparently the de Ruiter men can never do things the simple way, the mother of Daniel\u2019s child is Brazilian. Her name is Fabiola. They met in Bali. She lives in Bahia. He shows me a picture of a doe-eyed woman with a lit-from-within smile. Then he shows me an accordion folder, several centimeters thick, his correspondence with the various government agencies to prove the legitimacy of their relationship so she can get a visa and they can be married. In July, he is going to Brazil in preparation for the birth in September, and, he hopes, the wedding soon after. All going well, they\u2019ll be in Amsterdam in the fall, and return to Brazil for the winter. \u201cWinters there, summers here, and when he is old enough for school, we\u2019ll reverse it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Daniel smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy. We know. We already have a name for him. Abra\u00e3o.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbra\u00e3o,\u201d I say, rolling it over my tongue.</p><p>Daniel nods. \u201cIt\u2019s Portuguese for Abraham,\u201d</p> <p>We both are silent for a moment. Abraham, Bram\u2019s full name.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll move in, help, won\u2019t you?\u201d He points to the blueprints, the one bedroom that will be made into two, the flat that once housed the two brothers, and for a spell housed all three of them before it was just Daniel all on his own. And then, not even him.</p><p>But now we are two here. And soon there will be more. After so much contracting, somehow, inexplicably, my family is growing again.</p><p>Thirty-four</p><p>JUNE</p><p>Amsterdam</p><p>Daniel and I are on the way to the plumbing supply shop to pick up a shower body when his bike gets a flat tire.</p><p>We stop to inspect. There\u2019s a nail lodged deep into the tube. It\u2019s four-thirty. The plumbing store closes at five. And then it\u2019s closed for the weekend. Daniel frowns and throws his arms in the air like a frustrated child.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d he curses. \u201cThe plumber\u2019s coming tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>We did the bedrooms first, a mess of studs and drywall and plaster, neither of us knowing exactly what we were doing, but between books and some old friends of Bram\u2019s, we managed to make a tiny \u201cmaster\u201d bedroom, with a loft bed, and a tinier nursery, which is where I\u2019m now living.</p><p>But the learning curve was high and it took longer than we\u2019d expected, and then the bathroom, which Daniel thought would be simple\u2014swapping out seventy-year-old fixtures for modern ones\u2014turned out to be anything but. All the pipes had to be replaced. Coordinating the arrival of the tub and the sink and the plumber\u2014another of Bram\u2019s friends, who is doing the job on the cheap but also on his off hours, nights and weekends\u2014has challenged Daniel\u2019s already limited logistical skills, but he soldiers on. He keeps saying that if Bram built a boat for his family, dammit, he\u2019s going to build a flat for his. And it\u2019s such a strange thing to hear, because I\u2019d always thought Bram built the boat for Yael.</p><p>The plumber came last night, we thought, to finish the bath and shower installations, only to tell us he couldn\u2019t install the new tub that had finally arrived until we had a shower body. And we can\u2019t finish tiling the bathroom and move on to the kitchen\u2014which the plumber said will probably also need all new pipes\u2014until we have a shower.</p><p>For the most part, Daniel has approached the renovation with the sheer enthusiasm of a child building a sand castle at the beach. Every other night, when he and Fabiola Skype, he lugs his battered laptop around the flat, showing off all the latest modifications, discussing furniture placement (she\u2019s big into feng shui) and colors (pale blue for their room; butter yellow for the baby\u2019s).</p><p>But during those semi-nightly calls, you can see the bump is growing. After the plumber left, Daniel admitted he could almost hear the baby inside, ticking like one of those old alarm clocks. \u201cReady or not, here he comes,\u201d he\u2019d said, shaking his head. \u201cForty-seven years, you\u2019d think I\u2019d be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re never ready until it\u2019s upon you,\u201d I\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cVery wise, little man,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cBut goddamn it, if I\u2019m not ready, I\u2019m going to have the flat ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on ahead, take mine,\u201d I tell Daniel now, swinging off my bike. It\u2019s the same beat-up old workhorse I bought off a junkie when I first came back to Amsterdam last year. It stayed locked up outside Bloemstraat all those months I was in India, no worse for wear. When I started working on the flat, I brought it back to Amsterdam, along with the rest of my things, all of which fit on the bottom two shelves of the bookshelf in the baby\u2019s room. I don\u2019t have much: Some clothes. A few books. The Ganesha statue Nawal gave me. And Lulu\u2019s watch. It still ticks. I hear it in the night sometimes.</p><p>Problem solved, Daniel is bright sunshine again. With a gappy grin, he hops onto my bike, and takes off pedaling, waving behind him, almost slamming into an oncoming moto. I wheel his bike off the narrow alley and turn onto the wide canal of the Kloveniersburgwal. I\u2019m in an area sandwiched between the shrinking Red Light District and the university. I head in the direction of the university, more likely to find bike repair shops there. I pass an English-language bookstore I\u2019ve ridden by a few times before, always somewhat curious. On the stoop is a box of one-euro books. I poke through\u2014it\u2019s mostly American paperbacks, the kind of thing I read in a day and traded when I was traveling. But at the bottom of the box, like a displaced refugee, is a copy of Twelfth Night.</p><p>I know I probably won\u2019t read it. But I have a bookshelf now for the first time since college, even if it\u2019s only temporary.</p><p>I go inside to pay. \u201cDo you know of a bike repair place nearby?\u201d I ask the man behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cTwo blocks down, on Boerensteeg,\u201d he says, without looking up from his book.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I slide over the Shakespeare.</p><p>He glances at the cover, then looks up. \u201cYou\u2019re buying this?\u201d He sounds skeptical.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, and then by way of an explanation I don\u2019t need to give, I tell him I was in the play last year. \u201cI played Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it in English?\u201d he asks, in English, with that strange hybrid accent of someone who\u2019s lived abroad a long time.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He goes back to his book. I hand him a euro.</p><p>I\u2019m almost out the door when he calls out: \u201cIf you do Shakespeare, you should check out the theater down the way. They put on some decent Shakespeare plays in English in Vondelpark in the summer. I saw that they\u2019re holding auditions this year.\u201d</p><p>He says it casually, dropping the suggestion like a piece of litter. I ponder it there, on the ground. Maybe it\u2019s worthless, maybe not. I won\u2019t know unless I pick it up.</p><p>Thirty-five</p><p>\u201cName.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem. De Ruiter.\u201d It comes out a whisper.</p><p>\u201cCome again.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat. Try again. \u201cWillem de Ruiter.\u201d</p><p>Silence. I can feel my heartbeat, in my chest, my temple, my throat. I can\u2019t remember ever being nervous like this before and I don\u2019t quite understand it. I\u2019ve never had stage fright. Not even that first time with the acrobats, not even going on with Guerrilla Will, in French. Not even the first time Faruk shouted action and the cameras rolled and I had to speak Lars Von Gelder\u2019s lines, in Hindi.</p><p>But now, I can barely say my name out loud. It\u2019s as if, unbeknownst to me, there is a volume switch on me and someone has turned it all the way down. I squint my eyes and try to peer into the audience, but the bright lights are rendering whoever is out there invisible.</p><p>I wonder what they\u2019re doing. Are they looking at the ridiculous headshot I scrambled to put together? Daniel took it of me in the Sarphatipark. And then we\u2019d printed my Guerrilla Will stats on the back. It doesn\u2019t look half bad from a distance. I have several plays to my credit, all of them Shakespearian. It\u2019s only if you inspect it closely you see that the picture is shitty quality, pixelated to the extreme, taken on a phone and printed at home. And my acting credentials, well, Guerrilla Will isn\u2019t exactly repertory theatre. I\u2019d seen some of the headshots of the other actors. They came from all over Europe\u2014the Czech Republic, Germany, France and the UK, as well as here\u2014and had real plays under their belts. Better photos, too.</p><p>I take a deep breath. At least I have a head shot. Thanks to Kate Roebling. I called her at the last minute for advice because I\u2019ve never auditioned before. With Guerrilla Will, Tor decided what role you\u2019d play. There was some sniping about this, but I didn\u2019t care. The money was split equally, no matter how many lines you had.</p><p>\u201cAhh, yes, Willem,\u201d a disembodied voice says. It sounds bored before I\u2019ve even begun. \u201cWhat will you be reading for us today?\u201d</p><p>The play being produced this summer is As You Like It, one I\u2019ve never seen or heard much about. When I stopped in the theater last week, they told me I could prepare any Shakespearian monologue. In English. Obviously. Kate had told me to take a look at As You Like It. That I might find something really meaty in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSebastian, from Twelfth Night,\u201d I say. I decided to put together three shorter Sebastian speeches. Easiest to do that. It was the last part I played. And I still remembered most of the lines.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>I try to remember Kate\u2019s words, but they swirl in my head like a foreign language I barely know. Choose something you feel? Be who you are, not who they want you to be? Go big or go home? And there was something else, something she told me before she rang off. It was important. But I can\u2019t remember it now. At this point, it\u2019ll be enough to remember my lines.</p><p>A throat clears. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d It\u2019s a woman\u2019s voice this time, in a tone that says: Get on with it.</p> <p>Breathe. Kate said to breathe. That much I remember. So I breathe. And then I begin:</p><p>\u201cBy your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours.\u201d</p><p>The first lines come out. Not too bad. I continue.</p><p>\u201cTherefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone.\u201d</p><p>The words start to flow out of me. Not as they did last summer in that endless array of parks and squares and plazas. Not haltingly, as they did in Daniel\u2019s bathroom, where I practiced them all weekend, to the mirror, to the tiles, and on occasion, to Daniel himself.</p> <p>\u201cIf the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended!\u201d</p><p>The words come differently now. Understood in a fresh way. Sebastian is not just some aimless drifter, going where the wind blows him. He\u2019s someone recovering, rubbed raw and unsure by his spate of bad fortune, by the malignancy of his fate.</p><p>\u201cShe bore a mind that envy could not but call fair,\u201d I say and it\u2019s Lulu I see, on that hot English night, the last time I spoke these words in front of an audience. The faint smile on her lips.</p><p>\u201cShe is drowned already sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.\u201d</p><p>And then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s no applause, only a loud silence. I can hear my breathing, my heartbeat, still hammering. Aren\u2019t the nerves supposed to go away once you are on stage? Once you\u2019ve finished?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman says. Her words are clipped, generic, no actual gratitude in them. For a second, I think perhaps I should thank them.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t. I leave the stage in a bit of a daze wondering what just happened. As I walk up the aisle, I see the director and producer and stage manager (Kate told me whom to expect) already conferring about someone else\u2019s headshot. Then I\u2019m squinting in the bright light of the lobby. I rub my eyes. I\u2019m unsure of what to do next.</p><p>\u201cGlad that\u2019s over?\u201d a skinny guy asks me in English.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say reflexively. Only it\u2019s not true. Already, I\u2019m starting to feel this melancholy set in, like the first cold fall day after a hot summer.</p><p>\u201cWhat brought about the change of mind?\u201d Kate had asked me on the phone. We hadn\u2019t been in any kind of contact since Mexico, and when I told her my plans, she sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019d explained to her about finding Twelfth Night and then being told about the auditions, about being in the right place at the right time.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d it go?\u201d the skinny guy asks me now. He has a copy of As You Like It in his hand, and his knee is thumping, up-down-up-down.</p><p>I shrug. I have no idea. Truly. I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for Jaques. What about you?\u201d</p> <p>I look at the play, which I haven\u2019t even read. I just figured I\u2019d get what they gave me, as it always was with Tor. With a sinking feeling, I begin to suspect that wasn\u2019t the right way to go.</p><p>And it\u2019s then I remember what Kate said on the phone, after I explained the roundabout way I\u2019d come to audition.</p><p>\u201cCommit, Willem. You have to commit. To something.\u201d</p><p>Like so many of the important things these days, the memory comes too late.</p><p>Thirty-six</p><p>A week goes by, I hear nothing. The skinny guy I\u2019d spoken to, Vincent, had said there\u2019d be a series of callbacks before final casting. I don\u2019t get called. I put it behind me and get back to work on Daniel\u2019s flat, channeling so much energy into my tiling that Daniel and I finish the bathroom a couple of days ahead of schedule and get started on the kitchen. We take the metro out to IKEA to pick cabinets. We\u2019re in a showcase kitchen with cabinets the color of red nail varnish when my phone rings.</p><p>\u201cWillem, this is Linus Felder from the Allerzielentheater.\u201d</p><p>My heart thuds like I\u2019m on stage all over again.</p><p>\u201cI need you to learn Orlando\u2019s opening speech and come in tomorrow morning at nine. Can you manage that?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Of course I can manage it. I want to tell him that I\u2019ll more than manage it. \u201cSure,\u201d I say. And before I have a chance to ask any particulars, Linus hangs up.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Daniel asks.</p><p>\u201cThe stage manager from that play I auditioned for. He wants me to come back in. To read for Orlando. The lead.\u201d</p><p>Daniel jumps up and down like an excited child, knocking over the prop mixer in the show kitchen. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d He pulls us away, whistling innocently.</p><p>I leave Daniel in IKEA and spend the rest of the day in the drizzle at the Sarphatipark, memorizing the speech. When it\u2019s a decent hour in New York, I call Kate for more advice but I wake her up because it turns out she\u2019s in California now. Ruckus is about to start a six-week tour of Cymbeline on the West Coast before coming to the UK in August for various festivals. When I hear this, I\u2019m almost embarrassed to ask her for help. But, generous as always, she takes a few minutes to tell me what to expect on a callback. I might read a bunch of scenes and a bunch of parts, opposite several actors, and even though they\u2019ve asked me to read Orlando, I shouldn\u2019t assume that\u2019s the role I\u2019m up for. \u201cBut it\u2019s promising they\u2019ve asked you to read him,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a role for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She sighs, noisily. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t read the play?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m embarrassed all over again. \u201cI will, I promise. Later today.\u201d</p><p>We talk a little more. She says she\u2019s planning on spending nonfestival weekends traveling out of the UK, so maybe she\u2019ll come to Amsterdam. I tell her she\u2019s welcome any time. And then she reminds me again to read the play.</p><p>Late that night, after I\u2019ve read the opening monologue so many times I could recite it in my sleep, I start on the rest of the play. I\u2019m falling asleep at this point and it\u2019s a little difficult to get into. I try to see what Kate means about Orlando. I suppose it\u2019s that he meets a girl and falls in love with her and then meets her again but she\u2019s disguised. Except Orlando gets a happy ending.</p><p>When I arrive at the theater the next morning, it\u2019s almost empty, and dark except for a single lamp burning on the stage. I sit down in the last seat, and a short while later, the house lights flicker on. Linus strolls in, clipboard in hand, and behind him, Petra, the diminutive director.</p><p>There are no pleasantries. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d Linus says.</p><p>This time, I am ready. I\u2019m determined to be.</p><p>Except I\u2019m not. I get the lines right, but as I say one, then the next, I can hear myself say them and then I wonder how they sounded, did I hit the right beat? And the more I do that, the stranger the words start to sound, in the way that a perfectly normal word can start to sound like gibberish. I try to focus, but the harder I try, the harder it becomes, and then I hear a cricket chirping somewhere backstage and it sounds like the lobby of the Bombay Royale, and then I\u2019m thinking about Chaudhary and his cot and Yael and Prateek and I\u2019m everywhere in the world except in this theater.</p><p>By the time I finish, I\u2019m furious with myself. All that practice, and it was for shit. The Sebastian monologue, which I didn\u2019t even care that much about, was infinitely better than this.</p><p>\u201cCan I try that again?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Petra says. I hear her and Linus murmuring.</p><p>\u201cReally. I know I could do better.\u201d There\u2019s a jaunty smile on my face, which may be my finest acting of the day. Because really, I don\u2019t know that I could do better. This was me trying.</p><p>\u201cIt was fine,\u201d Petra barks. \u201cCome back Monday at nine. Linus will get your paperwork before you leave.\u201d</p><p>Is that it? Did I just get the part of Orlando?</p><p>Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so surprised. After all, it was that easy with the acrobats and with Guerrilla Will and even with Lars Von Gelder. I should be elated. I should be relieved. But, weirdly, all I feel is let down. Because this matters to me now. And something tells me if it matters, maybe it shouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><p>Thirty-seven</p><p>JULY</p><p>Amsterdam</p><p>\u201cHey, Willem, how are you feeling today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jeroen. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, the gout is acting up.\u201d Jeroen pounds his chest and heaves a cough.</p><p>\u201cGout is in your leg, you twat,\u201d Max says, sliding into the seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Jeroen flashes her his most charming smile as he limps away, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat a tosser!\u201d Max says, dropping her bag at my feet. \u201cIf I have to kiss him, I swear, I might puke on the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray for Marina\u2019s health then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t mind kissing her though.\u201d Max grins and looks at Marina, the actress who plays Rosalind opposite Jeroen\u2019s Orlando. \u201cAhh, lovely Marina, self-serving though it is, wouldn\u2019t want her to fall ill. She\u2019s so lovely. And, besides if she couldn\u2019t go on, I\u2019d have to kiss that git. He\u2019s the one who I want to get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t get sick,\u201d I tell Max, as though she needs reminding. Since being cast as his understudy, I have heard, endlessly, relentlessly, how in his dozen years of doing theater, Jeroen Gosslers has never, ever missed a performance, not even when he was throwing up with the flu, not even when he had lost his voice, not even when his girlfriend went into labor with their daughter hours before curtain. In fact, Jeroen\u2019s spotless record is apparently why I was given this shot in the first place, after the actor originally cast as an understudy booked a Mentos ad that would\u2019ve required him missing three rehearsals to shoot the commercial. Three rehearsals, for an understudy who will never go on. Petra demands everything of her understudies, while at the same time demanding nothing of them.</p><p>As required, I\u2019ve been at the theater every day since that very first table read, when the cast sat around a long wooden scuffed table on the stage, going through the text line by line, parsing meaning, deconstructing what this word meant, how that line should be interpreted. Petra was surprisingly egalitarian, open to almost anyone\u2019s opinions about what Sad Lucretia meant or why Rosalind persisted on keeping up her disguise for so long. If one of Duke Frederick\u2019s men wanted to interpret an exchange between Celia and Rosalind, Petra would entertain it. \u201cIf you are at this table, you have a right to be heard,\u201d she said, magnanimously.</p><p>Max and I, however, were conspicuously not at the table, but rather seated a few paces away, near enough to hear, but far enough that for us to participate in the discussion made us feel like interlopers. At first, I wondered if this was unintentional. But after hearing Petra repeat, several times, that \u201cperforming is so much more than speaking lines. It\u2019s about communicating with your audience through every gesture, every word unsaid,\u201d I understood it was completely intentional.</p><p>It seems almost quaint now, that I worried about it being too easy. Though it has turned out to be easy, only not in the way I thought. Max and I are the only understudies who don\u2019t have any actual roles in the play. We occupy a strange place in the cast. Semi-cast members. Shadow-cast members. Seat-warmers. Very few people in the cast speak to us. Vincent does. He got his Jaques after all. And Marina, who plays Rosalind, does as well, because she is uniquely gracious. And of course Jeroen makes it a point to talk to me every day, though I wish he wouldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what we got on today?\u201d Max asks in her London cockney. Like me, she\u2019s a mutt; her father is Dutch from Surinam and her mother is from London. The cockney gets stronger when she drinks too much, though when she reads Rosalind, her English goes silky as the British Queen\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going over the fight scene choreography,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Maybe that ponce will actually get hurt.\u201d She laughs and runs a hand through her spiky hair. \u201cWanna run lines later? Won\u2019t be much of a chance once we start tech.\u201d</p><p>Soon, we move the set out of the theater for the final five days of tech rehearsals and dress rehearsals at the amphitheater in Vondelpark where the show will go up for six weekends. In two Fridays, we\u2019ll have our soft opening, and then Saturday, the hard opening. For the rest of the cast, this is the payoff for all the work. For Max and me, it\u2019s when we cash out, when any semblance of us being in the cast disappears. Linus has told us to make sure we know the entire play, all the blocking, by heart, and we\u2019re to trail Jeroen and Marina through the first tech rehearsal. This is as close to the action as we get. Not once has Linus or Petra given us any direction or asked us to run lines or gone over any aspect of the play. Max and I run lines incessantly, the two of us. I think it\u2019s how we make ourselves feel like we\u2019re actually a part of the production.</p> <p>\u201cCan we do the Ganymede parts? You know I like those best,\u201d Max says.</p><p>\u201cOnly because you get to be a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, natch. I prefer Rosalind when she\u2019s channeling her man. She\u2019s such a simp in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a simp. She\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first sight.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cA simp. She\u2019s ballsier when she\u2019s pretending to have balls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier to be someone else,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI should think so. It\u2019s why I became a bleeding actor.\u201d And then she looks at me and snorts with laughter. We may memorize the lines. We may know the blocking. We may show up. But neither one of us is an actor. We are seat warmers.</p><p>Max sighs and kicks her feet up onto the chair, daring a wordless reprimand from Petra and a follow-up telling off from Linus, or, as Max calls him, the Flunky.</p><p>Up on stage, Jeroen is arguing with the choreographer. \u201cThat\u2019s not really working for me. It doesn\u2019t feel authentic,\u201d he says. Max rolls her eyes again but I sit up to listen. This happened about every other day during the blocking, Jeroen not \u201cfeeling\u201d the movements and Petra changing them, but Jeroen not feeling the new blocking either, so most of the time, she changed it back. My script is a crosshatch of scribbles and erasures, a road map of Jeroen\u2019s quest for authenticity.</p><p>Marina is sitting on the cement pilings on the stage next to Nikki, the actress playing Celia. They both look bored as they watch the fight choreography. For a second Marina catches my eye and we exchange a sympathetic smile.</p><p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d Max says.</p> <p>\u201cSaw what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarina. She wants you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be the case, but she was giving you f**k-me eyes at the bar last night.\u201d</p><p>Every night after rehearsal, most of the cast goes to a bar around the corner. Because we are either provocative or masochistic, Max and I go along with them. Usually we wind up sitting at the long wooden bar on our own or at a table with Vincent. There never seems to be room at the big table for Max and me.</p><p>\u201cShe was not giving me f**k-me eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was giving one of us f**k-me eyes. I haven\u2019t gotten any Sapphic vibes off her, though you never can tell with Dutch girls.\u201d</p><p>I look at Marina. She\u2019s laughing at something Nikki said, as Jeroen and the actor playing Charles the wrestler work some fake punches with the fight choreographer.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you don\u2019t like girls,\u201d Max continues, \u201cbut I\u2019m not getting that vibe off you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like girls just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you leave the bar with me every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not a girl?\u201d</p><p>Max rolls her eyes. \u201cI am sorry, Willem, but charming as you are, it\u2019s not going to happen with us.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and give Max a wet kiss on the cheek, which she wipes off, with excess drama. Up on stage, Jeroen attempts a false punch at Charles and stumbles over himself. Max claps. \u201cMind that gout,\u201d she calls.</p><p>Petra swerves around, her sharp eyes full of disapproval. Max pretends to be absorbed in her script.</p><p>\u201cFuck running lines,\u201d Max whispers when Petra\u2019s attention is safely returned to the stage. \u201cLet\u2019s get drunk.\u201d</p><p>That night, over drinks at the bar, Max asks me, \u201cSo why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off with a girl. If not Marina, one of the civilians at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave with me every night, Max.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, a big deep sigh that seems a lot older than Max, who is only a year older than me. Which is why she doesn\u2019t mind seat-warming, she says. My time will come. She makes a slash mark over her chest. \u201cBroken heart,\u201d she says. \u201cDykes take dog-years to heal.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cSo what about you?\u201d Max says. \u201cBroken heart?\u201d</p><p>At times, I\u2019d thought it was something like that\u2014after all, I\u2019d never been quite so strung out about a girl. But it\u2019s a funny thing because since that day with Lulu in Paris, I\u2019ve reconnected with Broodje and the boys, I\u2019ve visited my mother and have been talking to her again, and now I\u2019m living with Uncle Daniel. And I\u2019m acting. Okay, perhaps not acting, exactly. But not accidentally acting, either. And just in general, I\u2019m better. Better than I\u2019ve been since Bram died, and in some ways, better than I was even before that. No, Lulu didn\u2019t break my heart. But I\u2019m beginning to wonder if in some roundabout way, she fixed it.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you waiting for?\u201d Max asks me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer.</p><p>But one thing I do know: Next time, I\u2019ll know it when I find it.</p><p>Thirty-eight</p><p>Before Daniel leaves, we hang the last of the kitchen cabinets. The kitchen is almost finished. The plumber will come to install the dishwasher and we\u2019ll put in the backsplash and then that\u2019s that. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cJust have to fix the buzzer and tackle your shit in the attic,\u201d Daniel says.</p><p>\u201cRight. The shit in the attic. How much is there?\u201d I ask. I don\u2019t remember putting that many boxes up there.</p><p>But Daniel and I lug down at least a dozen boxes with my name on them. \u201cWe should just throw it all away,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve gone this long without.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity gets me. I open one box, papers and clothes from my dorm, not sure why I kept them. I put them in the garbage. I go through another and do the same. But then I come upon a third box. Inside are colored folders, the kind Yael used to keep patient records in, and I think the box must be mislabeled with my name. But then I see a sheet of paper sticking out of one of the folders. I pick it up.</p><p>The wind in my hair</p><p>Wheels bounce over cobblestones</p><p>As big as the sky</p><p>A memory rushes back: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t rhyme,\u201d Bram had said when I\u2019d showed it to him, so full of pride because the teacher had asked me to read it to the entire class.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to. It\u2019s a haiku,\u201d Yael had said, rolling her eyes at him and bestowing upon me a rare conspiratorial smile.</p><p>I pull out the folder. Inside is some of my old schoolwork, my early writing, math tests. I look in another folder: not schoolwork but drawings of a ship, a star of David that Saba taught me to do with two triangles. Pages and pages of this stuff. Unsentimental Yael and clutter-phobic Bram never displayed things like this. I assumed they threw it away.</p><p>In another box, I find a tin full of ticket stubs: airplane tickets, concert tickets, train tickets. An old Israeli passport, Yael\u2019s, full of stamps. Beneath that, I uncover a couple of very old black-and-white photos. It takes me a moment to recognize that they\u2019re of Saba. I\u2019ve never seen him this young before. I hadn\u2019t realized any of these photos had survived the war. But it\u2019s unmistakably him. The eyes, they are Yael\u2019s. And mine, too. In one photo, he has his arm slung over a pretty girl, all dark hair and mystery eyes. He looks at her adoringly. She looks vaguely familiar, but it can\u2019t be Naomi, whom he didn\u2019t meet until after the war.</p><p>I look for more old photos of Saba and the girl, but find just an odd newspaper clipping of her in a plastic liner. I peer closer. She\u2019s wearing a fancy dress and is flanked by two men in tuxedoes. I hold it up to the light. The faded writing is in Hungarian, but there\u2019s a caption with names: Peter Lorre, Fritz Lang\u2014Hollywood names I recognize\u2014and a third name, Olga Szabo, which I don\u2019t.</p><p>I set the photos aside and keep digging. In another box, there are endless keepsakes. More papers. And then in another box, a large manila envelope. I open it up and out tumbles more photos: me, Yael, and Bram, on holiday in Croatia. I remember again how Bram and I walked to the docks every morning to buy fresh fish that no one really knew how to cook. There\u2019s another photo: us bundled up for skating the year the canals froze over and everyone took to their skates. And another: celebrating Bram\u2019s fortieth birthday with that massive party that spilled off the boat, onto the pier, onto the street, until all the neighbors came and it became a block party. There are the outtakes from the architectural magazine shoot, the shot of the three of us before I was cropped out. When I get to the bottom of the pile, there\u2019s one photo left, stuck to the envelope. I have to gently pry it away.</p><p>The breath that comes out of me isn\u2019t a sigh or a sob or a shudder. It\u2019s something alive, like a bird, wings beating, taking flight. And then it\u2019s gone, off into the quiet afternoon.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Daniel asks me.</p><p>I stare at the shot. The three of us, from my eighteenth birthday, not the photo I lost, but a different picture, taken from a different perspective, from someone else\u2019s camera. Another accidental picture.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost this,\u201d I say, gripping the picture.</p><p>Daniel cocks his head to the side and scratches at his temple. \u201cI\u2019m always losing things, and then I find them again in the strangest places.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-nine</p><p>A few days later, I leave for rehearsal and Daniel leaves for the airport. It\u2019s strange to think that when I come back that night, Daniel will be gone. Though I won\u2019t have the flat to myself for long. Broodje has been in The Hague for most of the summer on an internship, and now he\u2019s in Turkey visiting Candace, who\u2019s on a two-week trip there with her grandparents. When he comes back, he\u2019ll stay here with me until he and Henk move into their new flat in Utrecht in the fall.</p><p>Rehearsal today is frenzied and frenetic. The set is being broken down, transported to the park for tomorrow\u2019s tech, and the lack of scenery seems to have unhinged everyone. Petra is a whirlwind of terror, yelling at the actors, yelling at the tech guys, yelling at Linus, who looks like he would like to take cover under his clipboard.</p><p>\u201cPoor Flunky,\u201d Max says. \u201cFor someone menopausal, Petra seems like she\u2019s on the rag. She smashed Nikki\u2019s mobile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask Max, sliding into our usual seats.</p><p>\u201cWell you know how she is if you put your phone on in the \u2018sacred rehearsal room.\u2019 But I heard she\u2019s extra uppity because Geert said \u2018Mackers\u2019 in the theater earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Scottish Play,\u201d she says. When I fail to understand she mouths Macbeth. \u201cVery bad mojo to say it in a theater.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you don\u2019t mess with Petra the day before the first tech.\u201d</p><p>Jeroen walks by. He looks at me and feigns a cough.</p><p>\u201cThat the best you can do?\u201d Max calls after him. She turns to me. \u201cAnd he calls himself an actor.\u201d</p> <p>Linus has the cast do an entire run-through. It\u2019s a mess. Lines are forgotten. Cues are missed. Blocking is flubbed. \u201cThe curse of Mackers,\u201d Max whispers.</p><p>By six o\u2019clock, Petra is in such a state that Linus lets us all go early. \u201cGet a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cTomorrow is a long day. Call is at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to go to the bar,\u201d Max says. \u201cLet\u2019s go eat and then go dancing or hear a band play. We can see who\u2019s on at Paradiso or Melkweg.\u201d</p><p>We ride over to the Leidseplein. Max is beside herself because some musician who was once in a famous band is playing solo tonight at the Paradiso and there\u2019s still tickets left. We buy a pair. Then we wander around the square, which this time of year is ground zero for tourists. There\u2019s a crowd of them surrounding some street performers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just those bloody Peruvian musicians,\u201d Max says. \u201cDo you know, when I was little, I thought it was the same troupe, following me. Took me ages to work out they were clones.\u201d She laughs and knocks her head with her knuckles. \u201cI can be right thick sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not the Peruvians. It\u2019s a group of jugglers. They\u2019re not bad, juggling all kinds of typically spiked flaming things. We watch for a while, and when the hat passes, I toss in a handful of coins.</p><p>We turn to leave and Max pokes me in the side. \u201cNow\u2019s the real show,\u201d she says. I turn around and see who she\u2019s talking about: a woman has her legs wrapped around one of the jugglers\u2019 hips, her arms tangled in his hair. \u201cGet a room,\u201d Max jokes.</p><p>I watch them a moment longer than I ought to. And then the girl drops down and turns around. She spots me and I spot her, and we do a double take.</p><p>\u201cWills?\u201d she calls</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d I call.</p><p>\u201cWills?\u201d Max repeats.</p> <p>Dragging the juggler behind her, Bex comes up to me and gives me a big theatrical hug and kiss. It\u2019s quite a change since the last time I saw her when she would barely shake my hand. She introduces me to Matthias. I introduce her to Max. \u201cYour girlfriend?\u201d Bex asks, sending Max into a theatrical howl of protestation.</p><p>After a bit of chit-chat, we run out of things to say, because we never really did have that much to say even when we were sleeping together. \u201cWe should go. Matthias needs lots of rest before so he can perform.\u201d Bex gives an obvious wink in case anyone wasn\u2019t clear about what kind of resting and what kind of performing she was referring to.</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d We kiss, kiss, kiss good-bye.</p><p>We\u2019re walking away when Bex calls out. \u201cHey, did Tor ever find you?\u201d</p><p>I stop. \u201cTor was looking for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was trying to track you down. Apparently some letter came for you at Headingley.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like a switch is thrown, the way my body surges. \u201cAt Headingley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTor\u2019s place in Leeds,\u201d Bex says.</p> <p>I know where Headingley is. But I rarely gave anyone a mailing address at all, and I don\u2019t remember ever giving anyone Tor\u2019s home address, which was the occasional Guerrilla Will headquarters, where we\u2019d go to rehearse or recuperate. There\u2019s no reason on earth to think she\u2019d send me a letter there, that she\u2019d know to send me a letter there. But still, I walk back toward Bex. \u201cA letter? From whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. But Tor was quite keen to get it to you. She said she tried emailing you but you were unresponsive. Imagine that?\u201d</p><p>I ignore the dig. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She scratches her brow, trying to dislodge the memory. \u201cI can\u2019t remember. It was a bit ago. Wait, when were we in Belfast?\u201d she asks Matthias.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cAround Easter, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think it was earlier. Around Shrove Tuesday,\u201d Bex says. She throws up her hands. \u201cSome time around February. I remember pancakes. Or March. Or maybe it was April. Tor said she tried emailing you and got no reply so she wanted to know if I knew how to reach you.\u201d She widens her eyes, to show the absurdity of such a notion.</p><p>March. April. When I was in India, traveling, and my email account got infected with that virus. I switched to a new address after that. I haven\u2019t checked the old account in months. Maybe it\u2019s right there. Maybe it\u2019s been there all along.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose you know who the letter was from?\u201d</p><p>Bex looks peeved, bringing back a bunch of memories. When it didn\u2019t last between us, and Bex had been nasty the rest of the season, Skev had made fun of me: \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever hear? Don\u2019t shit where you eat, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Bex tells me in a bored tone that seems practiced, so I\u2019m unsure whether she doesn\u2019t know or does but won\u2019t say. \u201cIf you\u2019re so interested, you can just ask Tor.\u201d She laughs then. It\u2019s not friendly. \u201cThough good luck getting her before fall.\u201d</p><p>Part of Tor\u2019s \u201cmethod\u201d was to try to live as close to Shakespearian times as possible while she was on the road. She refused to use a computer or a phone, though she would sometimes borrow someone else\u2019s to send an email or make a call if it was important. She didn\u2019t watch TV or listen to an iPod. And though she obsessively checked the weather reports, which seemed a rather modern innovation, she checked them in the newspapers, which somehow made it fair game because newspapers were around in seventeenth-century England, so she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose you have any idea what she did with it?\u201d My heart has sped up, as if I\u2019ve been running, and I feel breathless, but I force myself to sound as bored as Bex, for fear that if I make the letter sound important, she won\u2019t tell me anything.</p><p>\u201cShe might\u2019ve sent it to the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you used to live on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she even know about the boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Christ, Wills, how should I know? Presumably you told someone about it. You did live with everyone for a year, more or less.\u201d</p><p>I told one person about the boat. Skev. He was going to Amsterdam and asked if I could hook him up with any free places to stay. I mentioned a few squats and also said if the key was still in its hiding place, and no one else was there, he could camp on the boat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I haven\u2019t lived on that boat for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s obviously not that important,\u201d Bex says. \u201cOtherwise whoever wrote it would have known where to find you.\u201d</p><p>Bex is wrong but she\u2019s also right. Because Lulu should\u2019ve known where to find me. And then I stop myself. Lulu. After all this time? The letter\u2019s more likely from a tax collector.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d Max asks after Bex and Matthias have gone.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I look across the square. \u201cDo you mind? I need to duck into an Internet caf\u00e9 for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll grab a coffee.\u201d</p><p>I log onto my old email account. There\u2019s not much there but junk. I go back to the spring, when it got infected with that virus, and there\u2019s a pocket of nothing. Four weeks of messages that have just vanished. I try the bulk bin. Nothing there. Out of habit before I sign off, I scroll back for the emails from Bram and Saba, relieved to find them still there. Tomorrow, I\u2019m going to print them out and also forward them to my new account. In the meantime, I change the settings on my old account to forward all new mail to my current address.</p><p>I check my current email account, even though Tor wouldn\u2019t have known about it because I only told a handful of people the new address. I search the inbox, the junk mail. There\u2019s nothing.</p><p>I send Skev a quick note, asking him to ring me. Then I send a note to Tor as well, asking about the letter, what it said, where she sent it. Knowing Tor, I won\u2019t get a response until the fall. By that point, it\u2019ll have been more than a year since I met Lulu. Any sane person would say it\u2019s too late. It already felt too late that first day, when I woke up in the hospital. But even so, I\u2019ve kept looking.</p><p>I\u2019m still looking.</p><p>Forty</p><p>The tech rehearsal is a monster. Aside from lines, plenty of which get forgotten in the new environment, everything has to be relearned and reblocked on the amphitheater stage. All day long, I stand behind Jeroen, Max behind Marina, as they fumble through their various scenes. Once again we\u2019re like their shadows. Except none of us has a shadow because there\u2019s no sun today, just a steady drizzle that has put everyone in a sour mood. Jeroen hasn\u2019t even made a joke about his malady of the day.</p><p>\u201cIt makes you wonder whose brilliant idea this was,\u201d Max says. \u201cOutdoor bloody Shakespeare. In Holland, where English isn\u2019t even the language and it rains all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget, the Dutch are the eternal optimists,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d she asks me. \u201cI thought they were the eternal pragmatists.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m the optimist. I checked my email when I got back from the Paradiso last night and again before I left this morning for rehearsal. There was an email from Yael, and a forwarded joke from Henk, and a bunch of the usual junk, but nothing from Skev or Tor. What exactly did I expect?</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure what there is to be optimistic about. If the letter is from her, what\u2019s to say it\u2019s not a long-distance piss off? She\u2019d have every right.</p><p>We break for lunch and I check my phone. Broodje\u2019s texted to say he\u2019s heading off on some wooden sailing boat and he\u2019ll be incommunicado for a few days, but he\u2019ll be back in Amsterdam next week. Daniel\u2019s also texted to let me know he\u2019s arrived safely in Brazil, and forwarded a photo of Fabiola\u2019s belly. Tomorrow, I vow, I\u2019m getting a phone that accepts pictures.</p><p>Petra forbids mobile phones in rehearsal. But when she\u2019s talking to Jeroen, I put my ringer to vibrate and slip my phone into my pocket anyway. Optimist indeed.</p><p>Around five o\u2019clock, the drizzle lets up and Linus resumes the rehearsal. We\u2019re having trouble with the light cues, which we can\u2019t see. Because the show starts at dusk and goes into the night, the lights come up halfway through, so tomorrow\u2019s rehearsal will be from two in the afternoon to midnight, so we can make sure the second half, the in-darkness part, is properly lit.</p><p>At six, my phone vibrates. I pull it out of my pocket. Max widens her eyes at me. \u201cCover me,\u201d I whisper, and scuttle off to the wings.</p><p>It\u2019s Skev.</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks for getting back to me,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asks, his voice dropped to a whisper, too.</p><p>\u201cAmsterdam? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in Brighton. Why are we whispering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Amsterdam. Fuck, that\u2019s cool. I gave that shit up. I\u2019m working at a Starbucks now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s all good, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Skev, I can\u2019t talk long but I ran into Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex.\u201d He whistles. \u201cHow is that sweet thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as always, hooked up with a juggler. She mentioned a letter Tor was trying to get to me. Earlier in the year.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cVictoria. Man. She is something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked if I could come back and she said no. Just that one time. Off season. Don\u2019t shit where you eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. About that letter . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man, I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria wouldn\u2019t tell me. Said it was personal. You know how she gets.\u201d He sighs. \u201cSo I just told her to send it you. I gave her the address on the boat. I didn\u2019t know if you could get mail on the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could. We could. We did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you got the letter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Skev. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it must be at the boat, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t live there anymore.

Then we say good-bye.</p><p>I go back to the rehearsal. Max is looking crazed. \u201cI told them you had to puke. The Flunky is mad you didn\u2019t ask first. I wonder if he calls Petra for permission before he makes love to his wife.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an image I do my best not to conjure. \u201cI owe you. I\u2019ll tell Linus it was a false alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell me what this is about?\u201d</p> <p>I think of Lulu, all the wild-goose chases this year that have led nowhere. Why would this be anything else?</p><p>\u201cProbably just what you said: a false alarm,\u201d I tell Max.</p><p>Except that probably becomes a pebble in my shoe, aggravating me for the rest of the day, making it hard to keep from thinking about the letter, where it is, what it says, who it\u2019s from. By the time rehearsal ends, I feel this sort of urgency to know; so even though the rain has returned, and even though I\u2019m bone tired, I decide to try Marjolein. She doesn\u2019t answer her phone and I don\u2019t want to wait until tomorrow. She lives close by, on the ground floor of a wide house in a posh neighborhood at the south end of the park. She\u2019s always told me to drop by any time.</p><p>\u201cWillem,\u201d she says, opening the door. She has a glass of wine in one hand, a cigarette in the other, and she doesn\u2019t seem so happy that I\u2019ve dropped by. I\u2019m dripping wet, and she doesn\u2019t invite me in. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to bother you but I\u2019m trying to find a letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sent to the boat, some time in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still getting mail at the boat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Someone just sent it there.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cIf it went to the boat, it would\u2019ve been forwarded to the office and then on to the address you provided us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Utrecht?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cProbably. Can you call me in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cTry Sara. She handles the mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have Sara\u2019s number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have Sara\u2019s number,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNot for a long time now.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. Then reaches for her mobile. \u201cDon\u2019t start anything up with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I promise.</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re a changed man.\u201d I can\u2019t quite get whether she\u2019s being sarcastic or not.</p><p>Inside, the music changes, from mellow jazz to something wilder with screaming trumpets. Marjolein looks longingly inside. I realize that she\u2019s not alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go,\u201d I say.</p><p>She leans forward to kiss good-bye. \u201cYour mother will be pleased I saw you.\u201d</p><p>She starts to close the door. \u201cCan I ask you something? About Yael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she says absently, her attention already back in the warm house and on whomever\u2019s waiting in there.</p><p>\u201cDid she, I don\u2019t know, do things, to help me, that I didn\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>Her face is half hidden in shadows, but her toothy smile shines in the reflected light. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Marjolein shakes her head. \u201cThen neither can I.\u201d She starts to close the door. Then she stops. \u201cBut did you consider in all those months you were gone, why your bank account never ever went to zero?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t considered it, not really. I rarely used my bank card but when I did, it always worked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was always watching,\u201d Marjolein says. When she shuts the door, she\u2019s still smiling.</p><p>Forty-one</p><p>Utrecht</p><p>Everything takes too long. The train is late. The bike share line is too long. So I catch a bus instead and it stops to pick up every old lady in town. I shouldn\u2019t have left so late, but it was already late when I got hold of Sara this morning. Then it took a bit of cajoling before she finally remembered there was a letter. No, she didn\u2019t read it. No, she didn\u2019t remember where it came from. But she thinks she forwarded to the address on file. The one in Utrecht. Not that long ago.</p><p>By the time I get to Bloemstraat, it\u2019s almost noon. The second tech rehearsal is at 2:00 back in Amsterdam. I have nothing but time in my life, but never enough of it when I need it.</p><p>I ring the eyeball bell. There\u2019s no answer. I have no idea who lives here anymore. I texted Broodje on the train over but he didn\u2019t answer. Then I remembered that he\u2019s in the middle of the Aegean somewhere. With Candace. Whose name he knows, whose telephone number and email address he got before he left Mexico.</p><p>The front door is locked but I still have my key and it still works. The first good sign.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I call, my voice echoing through the empty house. It no longer looks like the place I lived in. No more lumpy sofa. No more boy smell. Even the Picasso flowers are gone.</p><p>There\u2019s a dining room table, with the post scattered all over it. I rifle through the stacks as quickly as possible, but I see nothing, so I make myself slow down and methodically go through each piece of mail, dividing it into neat piles: for Broodje, for Henk, for W, even some for Ivo, who\u2019s still getting letters here, for a couple of unfamiliar girls who must be living here now. There is some mail for me, mostly dead letters from the university and a travel catalog from the agency I used to book our Mexico tickets.</p><p>I look up the stairs. Perhaps the letter is up there. Or in the attic in my old room. Or in one of the cabinets. Or maybe it isn\u2019t the one Sara forwarded. Maybe it\u2019s still back on the Nieuwe Prinsengracht. Or somewhere in Marjolein\u2019s office.</p><p>Or maybe there is no letter from her. Maybe it\u2019s just another false hope I\u2019ve conjured for myself.</p><p>I hear ticking. On the mantel, where the Picasso used to hang, there\u2019s an old-fashioned wooden clock, like the kind Saba once had in his Jerusalem apartment. It was one of the few pieces Yael kept after he died. I wonder where it is now.</p><p>It\u2019s half past twelve. If I want to get the train back in time for the tech rehearsal, I have to leave now. Otherwise, I\u2019ll be late. And being late for tech? The only thing worse in Petra\u2019s book would be not showing for a performance. I think of the original understudy, replaced because he had to miss three rehearsals. It\u2019s too late for her to replace me, but that\u2019s not to say she can\u2019t fire me. I\u2019m nothing but a shadow, anyhow.</p><p>Being fired won\u2019t make any material difference in my life right now. Except I don\u2019t want to be fired. And more than that, I don\u2019t want to hand over that decision to Petra. If I\u2019m late, that\u2019s exactly what will happen.</p><p>The house seems huge all of a sudden, like it would take years to search all the rooms. The moment seems even bigger.</p><p>I\u2019ve given up on Lulu before. In Utrecht. In Mexico. But that felt like surrendering. Like it was me I was really giving up on. This feels different, somehow. Like maybe Lulu brought me to this place, and for the first time in a long time, I\u2019m on the cusp of something real. Maybe this is the point of it all. Maybe this is where the road is meant to end.</p><p>I think of the postcards I left in her suitcase. I\u2019d written sorry on one of them. Only now do I understand what I really should\u2019ve written was thank you.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say quietly to the empty house. I know she\u2019ll never hear it, but somehow that seems besides the point.</p><p>Then I drop my mail in the recycling and head back to Amsterdam, closing the door behind me.</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>One Day</p><p>Forty-two</p><p>AUGUST</p><p>Amsterdam</p><p>The phone is ringing. And I\u2019m sleeping. Two things that shouldn\u2019t be happening at the same time. I open my eyes, fumble for the phone, but the ringing continues, crying out into the still night.</p><p>A light flicks on. Broodje, naked as a newborn, stands in front of me squinting in the yellow light of the lamp, and the lemony walls of the nursery. He holds out my phone. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d he mumbles, and then he flicks off the light and sleepwalks back to bed.</p><p>I put the phone to my ear and I hear the exact four words you don\u2019t want to hear on the other end of a middle-of-the-night phone call.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been an accident.\u201d</p><p>My stomach plummets and I hear a whistling my ears as I wait to hear who. Yael. Daniel. Fabiola. The baby. Some subtraction in my family that I can no longer bear.</p><p>But the voice continues talking and it takes me a minute to slow my breathing and hear what is being said. Bicycle and moto and ankle and fracture and performance and emergency and it\u2019s then that I understand that it\u2019s not that kind of accident.</p><p>\u201cJeroen?\u201d I say at last, though who else can it be? I want to laugh. Not because of the irony, but because of the relief.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jeroen,\u201d Linus snaps. Jeroen the invincible, felled by a drunken moto driver. Jeroen insistent he can go on anyhow, with his foot in a cast, and maybe he can, for next weekend\u2019s performances. But this weekend\u2019s? \u201cWe might have to cancel,\u201d Linus says. \u201cWe need you at the theater as soon as possible. Petra wants to see what you can do.\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes. Light is peeking through the shades. It\u2019s not the middle of the night after all. Linus tells me to be at the theater\u2014the actual theater, not the stage in Vondelpark\u2014at eight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long day,\u201d he warns.</p><p>Petra and Linus hardly look up when I arrive at the theater. A sloe-eyed Marina offers a tired, sympathetic look. She\u2019s holding a roll and breaks off half and hands it to me. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much,\u201d she says.</p><p>I sit down on the edge of the stage, alongside her. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>She arches her eyebrow. \u201cKarma happened.\u201d She tucks a piece of hair behind her ear. \u201cI know it\u2019s his joke to brag about his perfect record, and I\u2019ve heard him do it many times before and nothing\u2019s come of it.\u201d She pauses to dust the crumbs off her lap. \u201cBut you don\u2019t laugh at fate like that without fate eventually having the last laugh. The only problem is, it doesn\u2019t just affect him. It might shut down the remaining run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it down? I thought it was just tonight\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeroen won\u2019t be able to perform either of this weekend\u2019s performances, and even if he can actually manage it in the boot cast he\u2019s apparently going to have to wear for the next six weeks, they\u2019ll have to reblock the whole thing. Plus, there are questions of insurance.\u201d She sighs. \u201cIt might be easier to just cancel.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slump with the weight of that statement. So it falls to me. \u201cI think I\u2019m starting to believe in the Mackers curse,\u201d I tell Marina.</p><p>She looks at me, the worry in her eyes mixed with sympathy. She seems about to say something when Petra orders me to the stage.</p><p>Linus looks miserable. But Petra, she of the thousand tantrums, is actually calm, cigarette smoke swirling around her like a statue on fire. It takes me a minute to realize she\u2019s not calm. She\u2019s resigned. She\u2019s already written tonight off.</p><p>I climb onto the stage. I take a breath. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d I ask her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have the cast on standby for a full run-through later,\u201d Linus answers. \u201cRight now, we\u2019d like to run your scenes with Marina.

Let\u2019s start just before the fight with Le Beau\u2019s line.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you?\u2019\u201d Linus asks. Petra nods.</p><p>\u201cI attend them with all respect and duty,\u201d I say, jumping right in with Orlando\u2019s next line.</p> <p>There\u2019s a moment of surprise as they all look at me</p><p>\u201cYoung man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?\u201d Marina asks as Rosalind.</p><p>\u201cNo, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I come but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth,\u201d I reply, not boastfully, as Jeroen does, but tempering the bravado with a little uncertainty, which I somehow now know is what Orlando must feel.</p><p>I\u2019ve said these words hundreds of times in readings with Max, but they were just lines in a script, and I never stopped to figure out what it all meant because I never really had to. But just as Sebastian\u2019s monologue came alive during my audition months ago, the words seem charged with meaning all of a sudden. They become a language I know.</p><p>We go back and forth and then I get to Orlando\u2019s line: \u201cI shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the world no injury, for in it I have nothing. \u201d As I say the words, I feel a tiny catch of emotion in the back of my throat. Because I know what he means. For a minute, I think to swallow the emotion down, but I don\u2019t. I breathe into it, letting it carry me through the scene.</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling loose and good as we move onto the fight scene, in which I pantomime fighting an invisible opponent. I know this part well. Orlando wins the fight, but he loses anyway. He is cast out of the duke\u2019s kingdom and warned that his brother wants to kill him.</p><p>We reach the end of the scene. Petra, Linus, even Marina, they all stare at me, not saying a thing.</p><p>\u201cShall we continue?\u201d I ask. \u201cOn to Act Two?\u201d They nod. I run that scene with Linus reading the part of Adam, and when I finish that, Petra clears her throat and asks me to take it from the beginning, Orlando\u2019s opening monologue, the one I flubbed so badly during my callback.</p><p>I don\u2019t flub it this time. When I finish, there is more silence. \u201cSo you\u2019re off book, that is clear,\u201d Linus says finally. \u201cAnd the blocking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that too,\u201d I say.</p><p>They look so incredulous. What do they think I\u2019ve been doing all this time?</p> <p>Warming a seat, comes my own answer. And maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so surprised by their surprise. Because isn\u2019t that exactly what I\u2019d thought I\u2019d been doing, too?</p><p>Petra and Linus excuse Marina and me. They have some things to discuss. If they decide to proceed with tonight\u2019s performance, there will be an all-cast rehearsal at the theater at noon, and I\u2019ll have to do an additional tech run-through at the amphitheater later in the day with just Linus.</p><p>\u201cSit tight. Keep your phone on,\u201d Linus says and he pats my back and gives me a look that\u2019s almost fatherly. \u201cWe\u2019ll speak soon.\u201d</p><p>Marina and I head to a nearby caf\u00e9 for coffee. It\u2019s raining, and inside the windows are fogged up. We sit down at a table. I rub a circle of condensation off the window. Across the canal is the bookstore where I first found the copy of Twelfth Night. It\u2019s just opening up for the day. I tell Marina about the flat tire and stopping at the shop, the strange chain of events that led to me being Jeroen\u2019s understudy, and now possibly, playing Orlando.</p><p>\u201cNone of that has anything to do with that performance you just gave.\u201d She shakes her head and smiles, a private smile, and it\u2019s this, more than anything else, that makes me stop feeling like a member of the shadow cast. \u201cYou were holding out on us.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to answer. Maybe I\u2019ve been holding out on myself, too.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell him,\u201d she says, gesturing to the bookstore. \u201cThe guy who sold you the book and told you about the play. If you go on, you should tell him it\u2019s partly because of him.\u201d</p><p>If I go on, there are lots of people I\u2019ll have to tell.</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you want to know?\u201d Marina continues. \u201cThat in some little way, something random you did had such an impact on someone\u2019s life? What do they call that? The Butterfly Effect?\u201d</p><p>I watch the man open the bookstore. I should tell him. Though the person I really want to tell, the person who is somehow intricately tied up in all this, who has really led me to this, I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re confessing,\u201d Marina says, \u201cI should tell you that I\u2019ve been a little intrigued by you from the start, this mysterious actor who keeps to himself, whom no one has ever heard of, but who is good enough to get cast as the understudy.\u201d</p><p>Good enough? That surprises me. I\u2019d thought it was the opposite.</p><p>\u201cI have a strict policy of no showmances,\u201d she continues. \u201cNikki keeps saying you can be an exception because you\u2019re an understudy and not in the show, but now that you maybe are I\u2019m even more intrigued.\u201d She gives me that private smile again. \u201cEither we close tonight or we close in three weeks, but either way, after it\u2019s over maybe we can spend some time together?\u201d</p><p>That surge of longing for Lulu is still in my bloodstream, like a drug wearing out its half life. Marina is not Lulu. But Lulu is not even Lulu. And Marina is amazing. Who knows what might happen?</p><p>I\u2019m about to tell her yes, after we close, I\u2019d like that, but I\u2019m interrupted by the ringing of my phone. She glances at the number and smiles at me. \u201cThat\u2019s your fate calling.\u201d</p><p>Forty-three</p><p>So much to do. There\u2019s an all-cast rehearsal at noon. Then a tech run-through. I need to run back to the flat, grab some things, tell the boys. And Daniel. Yael.</p><p>Broodje is only waking up. Breathlessly, I tell him the news. By the time I\u2019ve finished, he\u2019s already on his phone, calling the boys.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your ma?\u201d he asks when he hangs up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling her now.\u201d</p><p>I calculate the time difference. It\u2019s not quite five o\u2019clock in Mumbai, so Yael will still be working. I send her an email instead. While I\u2019m at it, I send one to Daniel. At the last minute, I send one to Kate, telling her about Jeroen\u2019s accident, inviting her to tonight\u2019s show if she\u2019s at all in the area. I even invite her to stay with me and give her the address of the flat.</p><p>I\u2019m about to log off when I do a quick scan of my inbox. There\u2019s a new message from an unfamiliar address and I think it\u2019s junk. Until I see the subject line: Letter.</p><p>My hand\u2019s shaking a bit as I click on the message. It\u2019s from Tor. Or relayed from Tor via some Guerrilla Will player who doesn\u2019t abide by the email ban as she does.</p><p>Hi Willem:</p><p>Tor asked me to email you to say that she ran into Bex last week and Bex told her that you hadn\u2019t gotten that letter. Tor was pretty upset because the letter was important and she\u2019d gone to a lot of trouble to try to get it to you. She wanted you to know it was from a girl you\u2019d met in Paris who was looking for you because you\u2019d dicked her over and pulled a runner. (Tor\u2019s words, not mine.) She said that you ought to know that actions have consequences. Again, Tor\u2019s words. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger. You know how she is.</p><p>Cheers! Josie</p><p>I sink down onto my bed as very different emotions battle it out. Dicked her over, pulled a runner. I feel Tor\u2019s anger. And Lulu\u2019s too. Shame and regret well up but then just stop there, held at bay by some invisible force. Because she\u2019s looking for me. Lulu is looking for me, too. Or she was. Maybe just to tell me to piss off. But she was looking for me like I was looking for her.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to feel as I wander into the kitchen. It\u2019s all just too much for one day.</p><p>I find Broodje cracking eggs into a frying pan. \u201cWant an uitsmijter?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat something. Keep your strength up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? Henk and W are on their way over. They want to see you. Will you be around at all before your big debut?\u201d</p><p>The rehearsal starts at noon and will take at least three hours, and then Linus said I\u2019d have a break before I go for a run-through at the amphitheater at six. \u201cI can probably get back here around four or five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. We should have the party plans well under way by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParty plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilly, this is big.\u201d He pauses to look at me. \u201cAfter the year you\u2019ve had\u2014the years you\u2019ve had\u2014we should celebrate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d I say, still half dazed.</p><p>I go back into my room to pack up a change of clothes for under the costume, shoes to wear. I\u2019m about to leave when I see Lulu\u2019s watch sitting on my shelf. I hold it in my hand. After all this time, it\u2019s still ticking. I hold it in my hand a moment longer. Then I slip it into my pocket.</p><p>Forty-four</p><p>At the theater, the rest of the cast has assembled. Max comes up behind me. \u201cI\u2019ve got your back,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I\u2019m about to ask her what she means, and then I see what she means. For the better part of three months, I have been mostly invisible to many of these people, a shadow-cast member. And now, the spotlight is glaring and there\u2019s no safety in the shadows anymore. People are looking at me with a particular mix of suspicion and condescension, a familiar feeling from when I was traveling and walked through certain neighborhoods where my kind didn\u2019t tend to wander. As I did when I was traveling, I just act like I don\u2019t notice and carry on. Soon enough Petra is clapping her hands, gathering us together.</p><p>\u201cWe have no time to lose,\u201d Linus says. \u201cWe will do a modified run-through, skipping over scenes that Orlando is not in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did you call all of us in?\u201d mutters Geert, who plays the swing roles of one of Frederick\u2019s men and Silvius; he has almost no scenes with Orlando.</p><p>\u201cI know. Sitting around watching other people act is such a bloody waste of time,\u201d Max says, her voice so sincere that it takes Geert a few seconds to have the good sense to look chastened.</p><p>Max gives me a crooked smile. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cI called everyone in,\u201d Petra says, with an exaggerated patience that lets you know she\u2019s reaching the end of her supply, \u201cso you could all accustom yourself to the different rhythms of a new actor, and so we could all of us help Willem ensure that the transition between him and Jeroen is as seamless as possible. Ideally, you won\u2019t even be able to tell the difference.\u201d</p><p>Max rolls her eyes at this and once again I\u2019m glad she\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cNow from the top, please,\u201d Linus says, tapping his clipboard. \u201cThere\u2019s no set and no marks so just do your best.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I step onto the stage, I feel relieved. This is where I\u2019m meant to be. In Orlando\u2019s head. As we move through the play, I discover more things about Orlando. I discover how key that first scene when he and Rosalind meet is. It\u2019s just for a few moments, but they see something in each other, recognize something. And that the spark sustains the passion, for both of them, for the rest of the play. They don\u2019t see each other\u2014knowingly see each other\u2014again until the very end.</p><p>Such a dance that Shakespeare wrote into a handful of pages of text. Orlando\u2019s about to fight a man far stronger than he is, but he peacocks in front of Rosalind and Celia to impress them. He\u2019s scared, he must be, but instead of showing it, he bluffs. He flirts. \u201cLet your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial,\u201d he says.</p><p>The world pivots on moments. And in this play, it\u2019s the moment when Rosalind says, \u201cThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That one line. It cracks open his facade. It reveals what\u2019s underneath. Rosalind sees Orlando. He sees her. That\u2019s the whole play, right there.</p><p>I feel the lines like I haven\u2019t before, like I\u2019m truly understanding Shakespeare\u2019s intentions. I feel as if there really was a Rosalind and an Orlando and I\u2019m here to represent them. It isn\u2019t acting in a play. It goes back further than that. It\u2019s much bigger than me.</p><p>\u201cTen-minute break,\u201d Linus calls at the end of Act One. Everyone heads out for a smoke or a coffee. But I am reluctant to leave the stage.</p><p>\u201cWillem,\u201d Petra calls to me. \u201cA word.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s smiling, which she rarely does, and at first I read it for pleasure, because isn\u2019t that what a smile communicates?</p><p>The theater empties out. It\u2019s just the two of us now. Not even Linus. \u201cI want to tell you how impressed I am,\u201d she begins.</p><p>Inside I\u2019m a little boy grinning on a birthday morning, about to get the presents. But I try to keep my face professional.</p><p>\u201cWith so little experience, to know the language so well. We were taken with your ease with the language at your audition, but this . . .\u201d She smiles again, only now I notice that it looks a bit like a dog baring its fangs. \u201cAnd the blocking, you have it cold. Linus tells me that you even learned some of the fight choreography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI observed,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI paid attention.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent. That\u2019s just what you needed to do.\u201d And there\u2019s that smile again. Only now do I begin to doubt it reflects any pleasure. \u201cI spoke to Jeroen today,\u201d she continues.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything but my gut twists. All this, and now Jeroen is going to lumber back with his cast.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s terribly embarrassed by what happened, but most of all he\u2019s disappointed to have let down his company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one to blame. He was in an accident,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course. An accident. And he very much wants to be back for the last two weeks of the season and we will do our best to adapt to meet his needs, because that is what you do when you are part of a cast. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though I don\u2019t really understand what she\u2019s on about.</p> <p>\u201cI understand what you were trying to do up there with your Orlando.\u201d</p><p>Your Orlando. Something about the way she says that makes me feel like it won\u2019t be mine for much longer.</p><p>\u201cBut the role of the understudy is not to bring his own interpretation to the part,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt is to play the part as the actor you\u2019re replacing played it. So in effect, you aren\u2019t playing Orlando. You are playing Jeroen Gosslers playing Orlando.\u201d</p><p>But Jeroen\u2019s Orlando is all wrong, I want to say. It\u2019s all machismo and prancing and no revealing; and without vulnerability, Rosalind wouldn\u2019t love him, and if Rosalind doesn\u2019t love him, why should the audience care? I want to say: Let me do this. Let me do it right this time.</p><p>But I don\u2019t say any of that. And Petra just stares at me. Then, finally she asks: \u201cDo you think you can manage that?\u201d</p><p>Petra smiles again. How foolish of me\u2014of all people\u2014not to recognize her smile for what it was. \u201cWe can still cancel for this weekend,\u201d she says, her voice soft, the threat clear. \u201cOur star has had an accident. No one would fault us.\u201d</p><p>Something given, something taken away. Does it always have to work like that?</p><p>The cast starts to drift back into the theater, the ten-minute break over, ready to get back to work, to make this happen. When they see me and Petra talking, they go quiet.</p> <p>\u201cAre we understood?\u201d she asks, her voice so friendly it\u2019s almost singsong.</p><p>I look at the cast again. I look at Petra. I nod. We\u2019re understood.</p><p>Forty-five</p><p>When Linus releases us for the afternoon, I bolt for the door. \u201cWillem,\u201d Max calls.</p><p>\u201cWillem,\u201d Marina calls behind her.</p><p>I wave them off. I have to be fitted for my costume and then I have only a couple hours until Linus will meet me to go through my marks on the amphitheater stage. As for what Marina and Max have to say: if it\u2019s compliments of my performance, so Jeroen-like even Petra was impressed, I don\u2019t want to hear it. If it\u2019s questions about why I\u2019m playing it like this, when I played it so differently before, then I really don\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>They look wounded, each in their own way. But I just walk away from them.</p><p>Back at the flat, I find W, Henk, and Broodje busy at work, pages of yellow pad on the coffee table. \u201cThat\u2019s Femke in,\u201d Broodje is saying. \u201cHey, it\u2019s the star.\u201d</p><p>Henk and W start to congratulate me. I just shake my head. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d I gesture to the project on the table.</p><p>\u201cYour party,\u201d W says.</p><p>\u201cMy party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one we\u2019re throwing tonight,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>I sigh. I forgot all about that. \u201cI don\u2019t want a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t want a party?\u201d Broodje asks. \u201cYou said it was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s not. Cancel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on.\u201d I go into my room. \u201cNo party,\u201d I call.</p><p>\u201cWilly,\u201d Broodje yells after me.</p><p>I slam the door, lie down on the bed. I close my eyes and try to sleep, but that\u2019s not happening. I sit up and flip through one of Broodje\u2019s copies of Voetbal International but that\u2019s not happening either. I toss it back on my bookshelf. It lands next to a large manila envelope. The package of photos I unearthed from the attic last month.</p><p>I open the envelope, thumb through the pictures. I linger on the one of me and Yael and Bram from my eighteenth birthday. It\u2019s like an ache, how much I miss them. How much I miss her. I\u2019m so tired of missing things I don\u2019t have.</p><p>I pick up the phone, not even calculating the time difference.</p><p>She answers straight away. And just like that time before, I\u2019m at a loss for words. But not Yael. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get my email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t checked it. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She sounds panicked. I should know better. Out-of-the-blue phone calls. They require reassurance. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike before. I mean, nobody is sick, though someone did break an ankle.\u201d I tell her about Jeroen, about my taking on his part.</p><p>\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t this make you happy?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I thought it would make me happy. It did make me so happy this morning. Hearing about Lulu\u2019s letter made me happy this morning. But now that\u2019s worn off and all I feel is her recrimination. How far the pendulum can swing in one day. You\u2019d think I\u2019d know that by now. \u201cIt appears not.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cBut Daniel said you seemed so energized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to Daniel? About me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times. I asked his advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked Daniel for advice?\u201d Somehow this is even more shocking than her asking him about me.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if he thought I should ask you to come back here.\u201d She pauses. \u201cTo live with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come back to India?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to. You might act here. It seemed to go well for you. And we could find a bigger flat. Something big enough for both of us. But Daniel thought I should hold off. He thought you seemed to have found something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found anything. And you might\u2019ve asked me.\u201d It comes out so bitter.</p><p>She must hear it, too. But her voice stays soft. \u201cI am asking you, Willem.\u201d</p><p>And I realize she is. After all this time. Tears well up in my eyes. I\u2019m grateful, in that small moment, for the thousands of kilometers that separate us.</p><p>\u201cHow soon could I come?\u201d I ask.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Then she gives the answer I need: \u201cAs soon as you want.\u201d</p><p>The play. I\u2019ll have to do it this weekend, and then Jeroen will come back or I can quit. \u201cMonday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday?\u201d She sounds only a little bit surprised. \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask Mukesh what he can do.\u201d</p><p>Monday. It\u2019s in three days. But what is there to stay for? The flat is finished. Soon enough Daniel and Fabiola will be back with the baby, and there won\u2019t be room for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too soon?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too soon,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful it\u2019s not too late.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a hitch in my throat and I can\u2019t speak. But I don\u2019t need to. Because Yael starts speaking. In torrents, apologizing for keeping me at arm\u2019s length, telling me what Bram always said, that it wasn\u2019t me, it was her, Saba, her childhood. All the things I already knew but just didn\u2019t really understand until now.</p><p>\u201cMa, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I stop her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, though,\u201d she says.</p><p>But it is. Because I understand all the ways of trying to escape, how sometimes you escape one prison only to find you\u2019ve built yourself a different one.</p><p>It\u2019s a funny thing, because I think that my mother and I may finally be speaking the same language. But somehow, now words don\u2019t seem as necessary.</p><p>Forty-six</p><p>I hang up the phone with Yael, feeling as though someone has opened a window and let the air in. This is how it is with traveling. One day, it all seems hopeless, lost. And then you take a train or get a phone call, and there\u2019s a whole new map of options opening up. Petra, the play, it had seemed like something, but maybe it was just the latest place the wind blew me. And now it\u2019s blowing back to India. Back to my mother. Where I belong.</p><p>I\u2019m still holding the envelope of photos. Once again, I forgot to ask Yael about them. I look at the one of Saba and mystery girl and realize now why she looked familiar to me the first time I saw her. With her dark hair and playful smile and bobbed hair, she looks quite a bit like Louise Brooks, this . . . I grab the newspaper clipping . . . this Olga Szabo. Who was she? Saba\u2019s girlfriend? Was she Saba\u2019s one that got away?</p><p>I\u2019m not quite sure what to do with them now. The safest thing would be to put them back in the attic, but that feels a little like imprisoning them. I could make copies of them and take the originals with me, but they still might get lost.</p><p>I stare at the picture of Saba. I flip to one of Yael. I think of the impossible life those two had together because Saba loved her so much and tried so hard to keep her safe. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to simultaneously love something and keep it safe. Loving someone is such an inherently dangerous act. And yet, love, that\u2019s where safety lives.</p><p>I wonder if Saba understood this. After all, he\u2019s the one who always said: The truth and its opposite are flip sides of the same coin.</p><p>Forty-seven</p><p>It\u2019s half past four. I\u2019m not due to meet Linus until six for a quick tech run through before the curtain. Out in the lounge, I hear Broodje and the boys. I don\u2019t want to face them. I can\u2019t imagine telling them I\u2019m going back to India in three days.</p><p>I leave my phone on the bed and slip out the door, saying good-bye to the boys. Broodje gives me such a mournful look. \u201cDo you even want us to go tonight?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I don\u2019t. Not really. But I can\u2019t be that cruel. Not to him. \u201cSure,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Downstairs, I bump into my neighbor Mrs. Van Der Meer, who\u2019s on her way out to walk her dog. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re getting some sun finally,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say, though this is one time I\u2019d prefer rain. People will stay away in the rain.</p><p>But, sure enough, the sun is fighting its way through the stubborn cloud cover. I make my way over to the little park across the street. I\u2019m almost through the gates when I hear someone calling my name. I keep going. There are a thousand Willems. But the name gets louder. And then it yells in English. \u201cWillem, is that you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stop. I turn around. It can\u2019t be.</p><p>But it is. Kate.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, thank God!\u201d she says, running up to me. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you and there\u2019s no answer and then I came over but your stupid bell doesn\u2019t work. Why didn\u2019t you pick up?\u201d</p><p>It feels like I sent her that email a year ago. From a different world. I\u2019m embarrassed by it now, to have asked her to come all this way. \u201cI left it in the flat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood thing I saw your dog-walking neighbor and she said she thought you went this way. It\u2019s like one of your little accidents.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a day of them. Because your email came at the most serendipitous moment. David was intent on dragging me to the most hideous sounding avant-garde Medea in Berlin tonight and I was desperately trying to find an excuse not to go, and then this morning I got your email so I came here instead. And I was on the plane when I realized I had no idea where you were performing. And you didn\u2019t answer your phone and I got a little panicky, so I thought I\u2019d track you down. But now here we are and everything\u2019s good.\u201d She exaggeratedly wipes a hand across her brow. \u201cPhew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhew,\u201d I say weakly.</p><p>Kate\u2019s radar goes up. \u201cOr maybe not phew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask you to do something?\u201d I\u2019ve asked Kate so much already. But having her there? Broodje and the boys, they may not know any better. But Kate will. She can see through all the bullshit.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you not go tonight?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. As if this is a joke. And then she realizes it\u2019s not a joke \u201cOh,\u201d she says, turning serious. \u201cAre they not putting you on? Did the other Orlando\u2019s ankle mysteriously heal?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I look down and see that Kate is holding her suitcase. She literally did come straight from the airport. To see me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d I ask Kate.</p> <p>\u201cThe only place I could find at the last minute.\u201d She pulls out a slip of paper from her bag. \u201cMajor Rug Hotel?\u201d she says. \u201cI have no idea how to pronounce it, let alone where it is.\u201d She hands me the paper. \u201cDo you know it?</p><p>Hotel Magere Brug. I know exactly where it is. I rode past it almost every day of my life. On weekends they used to serve homemade pastries in the lobby, and Broodje and I would sneak in sometimes to take some. The manager pretended not to notice.</p><p>I take her suitcase. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>The last time I was at the boat, it was September; I got as far as the pier before I rode away. It looked so empty, so haunted, like it was mourning his loss, too, which made a certain sense because he built it. Even the clematis that Saba had planted\u2014\u201cbecause even a cloud-soaked country needs shade\u201d\u2014which had once run riot over the deck, had gone shriveled and brown. If Saba had been here, he would\u2019ve cut it back. It\u2019s what he always did when he came back in the summer and found the plants ailing in his absence.</p><p>The clematis is back now, bushy and wild, dropping purple petals all over the deck. The deck is full of other blooms, trellises, vines, arbors, pots, viny flowering things.</p><p>\u201cThis was my home,\u201d I tell Kate. \u201cIt\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d</p><p>Kate was mostly quiet on the tram ride over. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMy father built it.\u201d I can see Bram\u2019s winked smile, hear him announce as if to no one: I need a helper this morning. Yael would hide under the duvet. Ten minutes later, I\u2019d have a drill in my hand. \u201cI helped, though. I haven\u2019t been here in a long time. Your hotel is just around the corner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think everything is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everything isn\u2019t.\u201d She looks at me. Then she asks, \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong, Willem? Stage fright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>I tell her. About getting the call this morning. About that moment in the first rehearsal, finding something new, finding something real in Orlando, and then having it all go to hell.</p><p>\u201cNow I just want to get up there, get through it, get it over with,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWith as few witnesses as possible.\u201d</p><p>I expect sympathy. Or Kate\u2019s undecipherable yet somehow resonant acting advice. Instead, I get laughter. Snorts and hiccups of it. Then she says, \u201cYou have got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>I am not kidding. I don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>She attempts to contain herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the opportunity of a lifetime drops into your lap\u2014you finally get one of your glorious accidents\u2014and you\u2019re going to let a lousy piece of direction derail you.\u201d</p><p>She is making it seem so slight, a bad piece of advice. But it feels like so much more. A wallop in the face, not a piece of bad direction, but a redirection. This is not the way. And just when I thought I had really found something. I try to find the words to explain this . . . this betrayal. \u201cIt\u2019s like finding the girl of your dreams,\u201d I begin.</p><p>\u201cAnd realizing you never caught her name?\u201d Kate finishes.</p><p>\u201cI was going to say finding out she was actually a guy. That you had it so completely wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat only happens in movies. Or Shakespeare. Though it\u2019s funny you mention the girl of your dreams, because I\u2019ve been thinking about your girl, the one you were chasing in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLulu? What does she have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was telling David about you and your story and he asked this ridiculously simple question that I\u2019ve been obsessing about ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your backpack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been obsessing about my backpack?\u201d I make it sound like a joke, but all of a sudden, my heart has sped up. Pulled a runner. Dicked her over. I can hear Tor\u2019s disgust, in that Yorkshire accent of hers.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: If you were just going out for coffee or croissants or to book a hotel room or whatever, why did you take your backpack, with all your things in it, with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big backpack. You saw it. It was the same one I had in Mexico. I always travel light like that.\u201d I\u2019m talking too fast, like someone with something to hide.</p><p>\u201cRight. Right. Traveling light. So you can move on. But you were going back to that squat, and you had to climb, if I recall, out of a second-story building. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d I nod. \u201cAnd you brought a backpack with you? Wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to leave most of your things there? Easier to climb. At the very least, it would\u2019ve been a sure sign that you intended to return.\u201d</p><p>I was there on that ledge, one leg in, one leg out. A gust of wind, so sharp and cold after all that heat, knifed through me. Inside, I heard rustling as Lulu rolled over and wrapped herself in the tarp. I\u2019d watched her for a moment, and as I did, this feeling had come over me stronger than ever. I\u2019d thought, Maybe I should just wait for her to wake up. But I was already out the window and I could see a patisserie down the way.</p><p>I\u2019d landed heavily, in a puddle, rainwater sloshing around my feet. When I\u2019d looked back up at the window, the white curtain flapping in the gusty breeze, I\u2019d felt both sadness and relief, the oppositional tug of heaviness and lightness, one lifting me up, one pushing me down. I understood then, Lulu and I had started something, something I\u2019d always wanted, but also something I was scared of getting. Something I wanted more of. And, also, something I wanted to get away from. The truth and its opposite.</p><p>I set off for the patisserie not quite knowing what to do, not quite knowing if I should go back, stay another day, but knowing if I did, it would break all this wide open. I bought the croissants, still not knowing what to do. And then I turned a corner and there were the skinheads. And in a twisted way, I was relieved: They would make the decision for me.</p><p>Except as soon as I woke up in that hospital, unable to remember Lulu, or her name, or where she was, but desperate to find her, I understood that it was the wrong decision.</p><p>\u201cI was coming back,\u201d I tell Kate. But there\u2019s a razor of uncertainty in my voice, and it cuts my deception wide open.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think, Willem?\u201d Kate says, her voice gentle. \u201cI think acting, that girl, it\u2019s the same thing. You get close to something and you get spooked, so you find a way to distance yourself.\u201d</p><p>In Paris, the moment when Lulu had made me feel the safest, when she had stood between me and the skinheads, when she had taken care of me, when she became my mountain girl, I\u2019d almost sent her away. That moment, when we\u2019d found safety, I\u2019d looked at her, the determination burning in her eyes, the love already there, improbably after just one day. And I felt it all\u2014the wanting and the needing\u2014but also the fear because I\u2019d seen what losing this kind of thing could do. I wanted to be protected by her love, and to be protected from it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand then. Love is not something you protect. It\u2019s something you risk.</p><p>\u201cYou know the irony about acting?\u201d Kate muses. \u201cWe wear a thousand masks, are experts at concealment, but the one place it\u2019s impossible to hide is on stage. So no wonder you\u2019re freaked out. And Orlando, well now!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, again. I know she is. Petra didn\u2019t do anything today except give me an excuse to pull another runner. But the truth of it is I didn\u2019t really want to pull a runner that day with Lulu. And I don\u2019t want to pull one now, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that happens if you do it your way tonight?\u201d Kate asks.</p><p>\u201cShe fires me.\u201d But if she does, it\u2019ll be my action that decides it. Not my inaction. I start to smile. It\u2019s tentative, but it\u2019s real.</p><p>Kate matches mine with a big American version. \u201cYou know what I say: Go big or go home.\u201d</p><p>I look at the boat; it\u2019s quiet, but the garden is so lush and well-tended in a way that it never was with us. It is a home, not mine, but someone else\u2019s now.</p><p>Go big or go home. I heard Kate say that before and didn\u2019t quite get it. But I understand it now, though I think on this one, Kate has it wrong. Because for me, it\u2019s not go big or go home. It\u2019s go big and go home.</p><p>I need to do one to do the other.</p><p>Forty-eight</p><p>Backstage. It\u2019s the usual craziness, only I feel strangely calm. Linus hustles me to the makeshift dressing room where I change out of my street clothes into Orlando\u2019s clothes, hastily altered to fit me. I put on my makeup. I fold my clothes into the lockers behind the stage. My jeans, my shirt, Lulu\u2019s watch. I hold it in my hand one second longer, feel the ticking vibrate against my palm, and then I put it in the locker.</p><p>Linus gathers us into a circle. There are vocal exercises. The musicians tune their guitars. Petra barks last-minute direction, about finding my light and keeping the focus and the other actors supporting me, and just doing my best. She is giving me a piercing, worried look.</p><p>Linus calls five minutes and puts on his headset, and Petra walks away. Max has come backstage for tonight\u2019s performance and is sitting on a three-legged stool in the wings. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but just looks at me and kisses two fingers and holds them up in the air. I kiss the same two on my hand and hold them up to her.</p><p>\u201cBreak a leg,\u201d someone whispers in my ear. It\u2019s Marina, come up behind me. Her arms quickly encircle me from behind as she kisses me somewhere between my ear and my neck. Max catches this and smirks.</p><p>\u201cPlaces!\u201d Linus calls. Petra is nowhere to be seen. She disappears before curtain and won\u2019t reappear until the show is over. Vincent says she goes somewhere to pace, or smoke, or disembowel kittens.</p><p>Linus grabs my wrist. \u201cWillem,\u201d he says. I spin to look at him. He gives a small squeeze and nods. I nod back. \u201cMusicians, go!\u201d Linus commands into his headset. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The musicians start to play. I take my place at the side of stage.</p><p>\u201cLight cue one, go,\u201d Linus says.</p><p>The lights go up. The audience hushes.</p><p>Linus: \u201cOrlando, go!\u201d</p> <p>I hesitate a moment. Breathe, I hear Kate say. I take a breath.</p><p>My heart hammers in my head. Thud, thud, thud. I close my eyes and can hear the ticking of Lulu\u2019s watch; it\u2019s as if I\u2019m still wearing it. I stop and listen to them both before I walk onto the stage.</p><p>And then time just stops. It is a year and a day. One hour and twenty-four. It is time, happening, all at once.</p><p>The last three years solidify into this one moment, into me, into Orlando. This bereft young man, missing a father, without a family, without a home. This Orlando, who happens upon this Rosalind. And even though these two have known each other only moments, they recognize something in each other.</p><p>\u201cThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you,\u201d Rosalind says, cracking it all wide open.</p> <p>Who takes care of you? Lulu asked, cracking me wide open.</p><p>\u201cWear this for me,\u201d Marina says as Rosalind, handing me the prop chain from around her neck.</p><p>I\u2019ll be your mountain girl and take care of you, Lulu said, moments before I took the watch from her wrist.</p><p>Time is passing. I know it must be. I enter the stage, I exit the stage. I make my cues, hit my marks. The sun dips across the sky and then dances toward the horizon and the stars come out, the floodlights go on, the crickets sing. I sense it happening as I drift above it somehow. I am only here, now. This moment. On this stage. I am Orlando, giving myself to Rosalind. And I am Willem, too, giving myself to Lulu, in a way that I should\u2019ve done a year ago, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou should ask me what time o\u2019 day: there\u2019s no clock in the forest,\u201d I say to my Rosalind.</p><p>You forget, time doesn\u2019t exist anymore. You gave it to me, I said to my Lulu.</p> <p>I feel the watch on my wrist that day in Paris; I hear it ticking in my head now. I can\u2019t tell them apart, last year, this year. They are one and the same. Then is now. Now is then.</p><p>\u201cI would not be cured, youth,\u201d my Orlando tells Marina\u2019s Rosalind.</p><p>\u201cI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind,\u201d Marina replies.</p><p>I\u2019ll take care of you, Lulu promised.</p><p>\u201cBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,\u201d Marina\u2019s Rosalind says.</p><p>I escaped danger, Lulu said.</p><p>We both did. Something happened that day. It\u2019s still happening. It\u2019s happening up here on this stage. It was just one day and it\u2019s been just one year. But maybe one day is enough. Maybe one hour is enough. Maybe time has nothing at all to do with it.</p><p>\u201cFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love,\u201d my Orlando tells Rosalind.</p> <p>Define love, Lulu had demanded. What would \u201cbeing stained\u201d look like?</p><p>Like this, Lulu.</p><p>It would look like this.</p><p>And then it\u2019s over. Like a great wave crashing onto a shore, the applause erupts and I\u2019m here, on this stage, surrounded by the shocked and delighted smiles of my castmates. We are grasping hands and bowing and Marina is pulling me out front for our curtain call and then stepping to the side and gesturing for me to walk ahead and I do and the applause grows even louder.</p><p>Backstage, it is madness. Max is screaming. And Marina is crying and Linus is smiling, although his eyes keep darting to the side entrance that Petra left from hours ago. People are surrounding me, patting me on the back, offering congratulations and kisses and I\u2019m here but I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m still in some strange limbo where the boundaries of time and place and person don\u2019t exist where I can be here and in Paris, where it can be now and then, where I\u2019m me and also Orlando.</p><p>I try to stay in this place as I change out of my clothes, scrub the makeup off my face. I look at myself in the mirror and try to digest what I just did. It feels completely unreal, and like the truest thing I have ever done. The truth and its opposite. Up on stage, playing a role, revealing myself.</p><p>People gather round me. There is talk, of parties, celebration, a cast party tonight, even though the show doesn\u2019t wrap for two more weeks and to celebrate now is technically bad luck. But it seems like everyone has given up on luck tonight. We make our own.</p><p>Petra comes backstage, stone-faced and not saying a word. She walks right past me. Goes straight to Linus.</p><p>I leave the backstage and go out the gate that serves as a stage door. Max is at my side, jumping up and down like an exuberant puppy. \u201cSo was Marina a decent kisser?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she was glad not to be kissing Jeroen,\u201d Vincent says, and I laugh.</p><p>Outside, I scan the area for my friends. I\u2019m not quite sure who will be here. And then I hear her call my name.</p><p>\u201cWillem!\u201d she says again.</p><p>It\u2019s Kate, charging toward me, a blur of gold and red. My heart seems to expand as she leaps into my arms and we spin around.</p><p>\u201cYou did it. You did it. You did it!\u201d she murmurs in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI did it. I did it. I did it.\u201d I repeat, laughing with joy and relief and awe at the direction this day has taken.</p><p>Someone taps me on the shoulder. \u201cYou dropped something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Your flowers,\u201d Kate says, leaning over to pick up a bouquet of sunflowers. \u201cFor your stunning debut.\u201d</p><p>I take the flowers.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I have no answer, no words. I just feel full. I try to explain it but then Kate interrupts: \u201cLike you just had the best sex in the world?\u201d And I laugh. Yeah, something like that. I take her hand and kiss it. She twines an arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cReady to meet your adoring public?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not. Right now, I just want to savor this. With the person who helped make it happen. Leading her by the hand, I take us over to a quiet bench under a nearby gazebo and attempt in some way to articulate what just happened.</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d is all I can think to ask.</p><p>She holds my hands in hers. \u201cDo you really need to ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do. It felt like something otherworldly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI believe in the muse and all, but don\u2019t go attributing that performance to one of your accidents. It was all you up there.\u201d</p><p>It was. And it wasn\u2019t. Because I wasn\u2019t alone up there.</p><p>We sit there for a little while longer. I feel my whole body buzzing, humming. This night is perfect.</p><p>\u201cI think your groupies are waiting,\u201d Kate says after a while, gesturing behind me. I turn around and there are Broodje, Henk, W, Lien, and a few other people, watching us curiously. I take Kate by the hand and introduce them to the boys.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming to our party, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Broodje asks.</p><p>\u201cOur party?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Broodje manages to look a tiny bit sheepish. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to un-throw a party at short notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially since he has now invited the cast, and about half the audience,\u201d Henk says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Broodje says. \u201cNot half. Just a couple of Canadians.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and laugh. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Lien laughs and takes my hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to say goodnight. One of us should be coherent tomorrow. It\u2019s moving day.\u201d She kisses W. Then me. \u201cWell done, Willem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to follow her out of the park,\u201d Kate says. \u201cThis city confounds me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI have some things I need to do first. I\u2019ll come later. Prop the door open for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I say. I go to kiss her on the cheek and she whispers into my ear, \u201cI knew you could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You just needed a pep talk.\u201d</p><p>But I don\u2019t mean the pep talk. I know Kate believes that I have to commit, to not rely on the accidents, to take the wheel. But had we not met in Mexico, would I be here now? Was it accidents? Or will?</p><p>For the hundredth time tonight, I\u2019m back with Lulu, on Jacques\u2019s barge, the improbably named Viola. She\u2019d just told me the story of double happiness and we were arguing over the meaning. She\u2019d thought it meant the luck of the boy getting the job and the girl. But I\u2019d disagreed. It was the couplet fitting together, the two halves finding each other. It was love.</p><p>But maybe we were both wrong, and both right. It\u2019s not either or, not luck or love. Not fate or will.</p><p>Maybe for double happiness, you need both.</p><p>Forty-nine</p><p>Inside the flat, it is complete mayhem. More than fifty people, from the cast, from Utrecht, even old school friends from my Amsterdam days. I have no idea how Broodje dug everyone up so fast.</p><p>Max pounces on me as soon as she comes in the door, followed by Vincent. \u201cHoly. Shit,\u201d Max says.</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve mentioned you could act!\u201d Vincent adds.</p><p>I smile. \u201cI like to preserve a bit of mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, everyone in the cast is bloody delighted,\u201d says Max. \u201cExcept Petra. She\u2019s pissy as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because her understudy just completely cockblocked her star. And now she has to decide whether to put up a lame, and I mean that both literally and figuratively, star, or let you carry us home,\u201d Vincent says.</p><p>\u201cDecisions, decisions,\u201d Max adds. \u201cDon\u2019t look now but Marina is giving you the f**k-me eyes again.\u201d</p><p>We all look. Marina is staring right at me and smiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t even deny it, unless it\u2019s me she wants to shag,\u201d Max says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I tell Max. I go over to her to where Marina\u2019s standing by the table Broodje has turned into the bar. She has a jug of something in her hand. \u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely sure. One of your mates gave it to me, promised me no hangover. I\u2019m taking him at his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your first mistake right there.\u201d</p><p>She runs a finger along the top of the rim. \u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m long past making my first mistake.\u201d She takes a gulp of her drink. \u201cAren\u2019t you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already feel drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Catch up with yourself.\u201d</p><p>She hands me her glass and I take a sip. I taste the sour tequila that Broodje now favors, mixed with some other orange-flavored booze. \u201cYeah. No hangover from this. Definitely not.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, touches my arm. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you how fantastic you were tonight. You\u2019re probably sick of hearing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever get sick of hearing it?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cNo.\u201d She looks away. \u201cI know what I said earlier today, about after the show, but all the rules seem to be getting broken today. . . .\u201d She trails off. \u201cSo really, can three weeks make much of a difference?\u201d</p><p>Marina is sexy and gorgeous and smart. And she\u2019s also wrong. Three weeks can make all the difference. I know that because one day can make all the difference.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I tell Marina. \u201cThey can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, sounding surprised, a little hurt. Then: \u201cAre you with someone else?\u201d</p><p>Tonight on that stage, it felt like I was. But that was a ghost. Shakespeare\u2019s full of them. \u201cNo,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just saw you, with that woman. After the show. I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>Kate. The need to see her feels urgent. Because what I want is so clear to me now.</p><p>I excuse myself from Marina and poke through the flat, but there\u2019s no sign of Kate. I go downstairs to see if the door is still propped open. It is. I bump into Mrs. Van der Meer again, out walking her dog. \u201cSorry about all the noise,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says. She looks upstairs. \u201cWe used to have some wild parties here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou lived here back when it was a squat?\u201d I ask, trying to reconcile the middle-aged vrouw with the young anarchists I\u2019ve seen in pictures.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I knew your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he like then?\u201d I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m asking that. Bram was never the hard one to crack.</p><p>But Mrs. Van der Meer\u2019s answer surprises me. \u201cHe was a bit of a melancholy young man,\u201d she says. And then her eyes flicker up to the flat, like she\u2019s seeing him there. \u201cUntil that mother of yours showed up.\u201d</p> <p>Her dog yanks on the leash and she sets off, leaving me to ponder how much I know, and don\u2019t know, about my parents.</p><p>Fifty</p><p>The phone is ringing. And I\u2019m sleeping.</p><p>I fumble for it. It\u2019s next to my pillow.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I mumble.</p> <p>\u201cWillem!\u201d Yael says in a breathless gulp. \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa?\u201d I ask. I wait to feel the usual panic but none comes. Instead, there\u2019s something else, a residue of something good. I rub my eyes and it\u2019s still there, floating like a mist: a dream I was having.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Mukesh. And he worked his magic. He can get you out Monday but we have to book now. We\u2019ll do an open-ended ticket this time. Come for a year. Then decide what to do.\u201d</p><p>My head is hazy with lack of sleep. The party went until four. I fell asleep around five. The sun was already up. Slowly, yesterday\u2019s conversation with my mother comes back to me. The offer she made. How much I wanted it. Or thought I did. Some things you don\u2019t know you want until they\u2019re gone. Other things you think want, but don\u2019t understand you already have them.</p><p>\u201cMa,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not coming back to India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d There\u2019s curiosity in her voice, and disappointment, too.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou belong where I belong.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a relief, after all this time, to hear her say so. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true. I\u2019m grateful that she has made a new home for herself in India, but it\u2019s not where I\u2019m meant to be.</p><p>Go big and go home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to act, Ma,\u201d I say. And I feel it. The idea, the plan, fully formed since last night, maybe since much longer. The urgency to see Kate, who never did show up at the party, courses through me. This is one chance I\u2019m not going to let slip through my fingers. This is something I need. \u201cI\u2019m going to act,\u201d I repeat. \u201cBecause I\u2019m an actor.\u201d</p><p>Yael laughs. \u201cOf course you are. It\u2019s in your blood. Just like Olga.\u201d</p><p>The name is instantly familiar. \u201cOlga Szabo, you mean?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. I can feel her surprise crackle through the line. \u201cSaba told you about her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I found the pictures. In the attic. I meant to ask you about them but I didn\u2019t, because I\u2019ve been busy . . .\u201d I trail off. \u201cAnd because we never really talked about these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We never did, did we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she? Saba\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was his sister,\u201d she replies. And I should be surprised, but I\u2019m not. Not at all. It\u2019s like the pieces of a puzzle slotting together.</p><p>\u201cShe would have been your great aunt,\u201d Yael continues. \u201cHe always said she was an incredible actress. She was meant to go to Hollywood. But then the war came and she didn\u2019t survive.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t survive. Only Saba did.</p><p>\u201cWas Szabo her stage name?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo. Szabo was Saba\u2019s surname before he emigrated to Israel and Hebreified it. Lots of Europeans did that.\u201d</p><p>To distance himself, I think. I understand that. Though he couldn\u2019t really distance himself. All those silent films he took me to. The ghosts he held at bay, and held close.</p><p>Olga Szabo, my great aunt. Sister to my grandfather, Oskar Szabo, who became Oskar Shiloh, father of Yael Shiloh, wife of Bram de Ruiter, brother of Daniel de Ruiter, soon to be father of Abra\u00e3o de Ruiter.</p><p>And just like that, my family grows again.</p><p>Fifty-one</p><p>When I emerge from my bedroom, Broodje and Henk are just waking up and are surveying the wreckage like army generals who have lost a major ground battle.</p><p>Broodje turns to me, his face twisted in apology. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can clean it all later. But we promised we\u2019d meet W at ten to help him move. And we\u2019re already late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick,\u201d Henk says.</p><p>Broodje picks up a beer bottle, two-thirds full of cigarette butts. \u201cYou can be sick later,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made a promise to W.\u201d Broodje looks at me. \u201cAnd to Willy. I\u2019ll clean the flat later. And Henk\u2019s vomit, which he\u2019s going to keep corked for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll clean it all. I\u2019ll fix everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so cheerful about it,\u201d Henk says, wincing and touching his temples.</p><p>I grab the keys from the counter. \u201cSorry,\u201d I say, not sorry at all. I head to the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Broodje.</p><p>\u201cTo take the wheel!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unlocking my bike downstairs when my phone rings. It\u2019s her. Kate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling you for the last hour,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m coming to your hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hotel, huh?\u201d she says. I can hear the smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI was worried you\u2019d leave. And I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, propositions are best proposed in person. But sit tight because I\u2019m actually on my way to you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. Are you home?\u201d</p><p>I think of the flat, Broodje and Henk in their boxers, the unbelievable mess. The sun is out, really out, for the first time in days. I suggest we meet at the Sarphatipark instead. \u201cAcross the street. Where we were yesterday,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cProposition downgraded from a hotel to a park, Willem?\u201d she teases. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether to be flattered or insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me neither.\u201d</p><p>I go straight to the park and wait, sitting down on one of the benches near the sandpit. A little boy and girl are discussing their plans for a fort.</p><p>\u201cCan it have one hundred towers?\u201d the little boy asks. The girl says, \u201cI think twenty is better.\u201d Then the boy asks, \u201cCan we live there forever?\u201d The girl considers the sky a moment and says, \u201cUntil it rains.\u201d</p><p>By the time Kate shows up, they\u2019ve made significant progress, digging a moat and constructing two towers.</p><p>\u201cSorry it took so long,\u201d Kate says, breathless. \u201cI got lost. This city of yours, it runs in circles.\u201d</p><p>I start to explain about the concentric canals, the Ceintuurbaan being a belt that goes around the waist of the city. She waves me off. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019m hopeless.\u201d She sits down next to me. \u201cAny word from Frau Directeur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ominous.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMaybe. Nothing I can do. Anyway, I have a new plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kate says, widening her already big green eyes. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. In fact, that\u2019s what my proposition is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thick plottens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d She crosses her legs, leans in toward me. \u201cI\u2019m ready. Proposition me.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand. \u201cI want you.\u201d I pause. \u201cTo be my director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little like shaking hands after making love?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened last night,\u201d I begin, \u201cit happened because of you. And I want to work with you. I want to come study with Ruckus. Be an apprentice.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes slit into smiles. \u201cHow do you know about our apprenticeships?\u201d she drawls.</p><p>\u201cI may have looked at your website one or a hundred times. And I know you mostly work with Americans, but I grew up speaking English, I act in English. Most of the time, I dream in English. I want to do Shakespeare. In English. I want to do it. With you.\u201d</p><p>The grin has disappeared from Kate\u2019s face. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be like last night\u2014Orlando on a main stage. Our apprentices do everything. They build sets. They work tech. They study. They act in the ensemble. I\u2019m not saying you wouldn\u2019t play principal roles one day\u2014I would not rule that out, not after last night. But it would take a while. And, there are visa issues to consider, not to mention the union, so you couldn\u2019t come over expecting the spotlight. And I\u2019ve told David he needs to meet you.\u201d</p><p>I look at Kate and am about to say that I wouldn\u2019t expect that, that I\u2019d be patient, that I know how to build things. But I stop myself because it occurs to me that I don\u2019t need to convince her of anything.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think I was last night?\u201d she asks. \u201cI was waiting for David to get back from his Medea, so I could tell him about you. Then I arranged for him to get his ass on a plane so he could see you tonight before that invalid comes back. He\u2019s on his way, and in fact, I have to leave soon to go to the airport to meet him. After all this trouble, they\u2019d better put you on again, otherwise, you\u2019re going to have to do it solo for him.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. But Ruckus is a small operation so we make decisions like this communally. That\u2019s another thing you have to be prepared for, how dysfunctionally co-dependent we all are.\u201d She throws up her arms. \u201cBut every family is like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, wait? You were going to ask me?\u201d</p><p>The grin is back. \u201cWas there any doubt? But it pleases me no end, Willem, that you asked me. It shows you\u2019ve been paying attention, which is what a director wants in an actor.\u201d She taps her temple. \u201cAlso, very clever of you to move to the States. Good for your career but also it\u2019s where your Lulu is from.\u201d</p><p>I think of Tor\u2019s letter, only today the regret and recrimination is gone. She looked for me. I looked for her. And last night, in some strange way, we found each other.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I want to go,\u201d I tell Kate.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI know. I\u2019m just teasing. Though I think you\u2019ll really take to Brooklyn. It has a lot in common with Amsterdam. The brownstones and the rowhouses, the loving tolerance of eccentricity. I think you\u2019ll feel right at home.\u201d</p><p>When she says that a feeling comes over me. Of pausing, of resting, of all the clocks in the world going quiet.</p><p>Home.</p><p>Fifty-two</p><p>But Daniel\u2019s home. That is a mess.</p><p>When I get back, the boys have left, and there is crap everywhere. It looks like how Bram used to describe it in the old days, before Yael arrived and asserted her brand of order.</p><p>There are bottles and ashtrays and plates and pizza boxes and every dish seems dirty and out. The whole place smells like cigarettes. It\u2019s certainly not a place that a baby should live. I\u2019m momentarily paralyzed, not sure where to start.</p><p>I put on a CD of Adam Wilde, that singer-songwriter Max and I went to see a few weeks ago. And then I just go. I empty out the beer and wine bottles and put them in a box for recycling. Next, I dump the ashtrays and rinse them out. Even though there\u2019s a dishwasher now, I fill the sink with hot, soapy water and clean all the dirty dishes, then dry them. I throw open the windows to air our the place, and sunshine and fresh air come blowing in.</p><p>By noon, I\u2019ve collected the bottles, tossed the cigarette butts, washed and dried the dishes, dusted and vacuumed. It\u2019s about as clean as it was on its best day with Daniel, though when he comes home with Abra\u00e3o and Fabiola, I\u2019ll have it spotless. Ready.</p><p>I make a coffee. I check my phone to see if there\u2019s any word from Linus, but it\u2019s sitting on my bed, dead. I plug it in to charge, setting the coffee on my shelf. The envelope is still there, with the photos of me Yael, Bram, Saba, Olga. I run my finger along the crease of the envelope, feel the weight of history inside. Wherever I\u2019m going next, these are coming with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance at my phone. It\u2019s still dead, but soon there will be some word from Linus and Petra. Part of me thinks that I must be fired. That has to be the price to pay for last night\u2019s triumph, and it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s a price I\u2019m willing to pay. But another part of me is losing faith that the universal law of equilibrium operates that way.</p><p>I go back into the lounge. The Adam Wilde CD has been repeating and the songs are starting to become familiar enough that I know I will be able to hear them when I\u2019m not listening to them.</p><p>I look around the room. I fluff the cushions and lie down on the sofa. I should be in suspense, waiting for word about tonight, but I feel the opposite. It\u2019s like that moment of pause when I step out of a train station or bus station or airport into a new city and it\u2019s nothing but possibility.</p><p>Through the open window, the dissonant sounds of the city\u2014of tram chimes and bicycle bells and the occasional jet roaring overhead\u2014drift in and mingle with the music and lull me to sleep.</p> <p>For the third time in one day, I\u2019m woken up by the ringing of a phone. Like this morning when Yael called, I have that same feeling, of being somewhere else, somewhere right.</p><p>The ringing stops. But I know it must be Linus. My fate, Marina had called it. But it\u2019s not my fate; it\u2019s just about tonight. My fate is up to me.</p><p>I go into my room and pick up the phone. Out the window, climbing through the clouds I make out the blue-and-white underbelly of a KLM jet. I picture myself on a plane, flying out of Amsterdam, over the North Sea, over England and Ireland, past Iceland and Greenland and down Newfoundland and along the Eastern Seaboard, into New York. I feel the jerk, hear the skid of the tires touching down, the explosion of applause from the passengers. Because we are all of us, so grateful for having at last arrived.</p><p>I glance at my phone. It\u2019s full of congratulatory texts from last night, and a voicemail from Linus. \u201cWillem, can you please call in as soon as possible,\u201d he says.</p><p>I take a deep breath, prepare myself for whatever he has to say. It doesn\u2019t really matter. I went big and now I\u2019m going home.</p> <p>Just as Linus answers there\u2019s a faint knock at the front door.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello . . .\u201d Linus\u2019s voice echoes.</p><p>There\u2019s another knock, louder this time. Kate? Broodje?</p><p>I tell Linus I\u2019ll call him right back. I put the phone down. I open the door. And once again, time stops.</p><p>I\u2019m shocked. And I\u2019m not. She is just as I remember her. And completely transformed. A stranger. And someone I know. The truth and its opposite are flip sides of the same coin, I hear Saba say.</p><p>\u201cHello Willem,\u201d she says. \u201cMy name is Allyson.\u201d</p> <p>Allyson. I say the name in my head and a year\u2019s worth of memories and fantasies and one-sided conversations are revised and updated. Not Lulu. Allyson. A strong name. A solid name. And somehow, a familiar name. Everything about her seems familiar. I know this person. I\u2019m known to this person. It\u2019s then I understand what I was dreaming about this morning, who it is that\u2019s been sitting next to me on that plane all this time.</p><p>Allyson walks in.</p><p>The door clicks shut behind her. And for a minute, they\u2019re in the room with us too. Yael and Bram, thirty years ago. Their entire story rushes through my head, because it\u2019s our story, too. Only now, I realize, it was an incomplete story. Because so matter how many times he told it, Bram never told me the important part. What happened during those first three hours together in the car.</p><p>Or maybe he did, only without words. With his action.</p><p>\u201cAnd so I kissed her. Like I\u2019d been expecting her all that time,\u201d my previously melancholy father would say, always with wonder in his voice.</p><p>I\u2019d thought the wonder was for the accidents. But maybe it wasn\u2019t. Maybe the wonder was for the stain. Three hours in a car, that was all it took. And two years later, there she was.</p><p>Maybe he was overwhelmed, like I am overwhelmed, by that mysterious intersection where love meets luck, where fate meets will. Because he\u2019d been waiting for her. And there she was.</p><p>So he\u2019d kissed her.</p> <p>I kiss Allyson.</p><p>I complete the history that came before us, and in doing so, begin one all of our own.</p><p>Double happiness: I get it now. </p> </body></html>"]
