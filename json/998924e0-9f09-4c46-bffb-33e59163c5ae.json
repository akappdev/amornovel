Mari was everything to him. He couldn\u2019t think about the void in his life or how it would be without her. Trystan\u2019s fingers slid along the neck of the guitar as he strummed, playing the song that brought him solace. When his world cracked apart the song always rose to the front of his mind.</p><p>The weight within him felt like it was too much to bear, crushing his bones while he still breathed. Nothing changed. Life continued down the same hellish path, beating him in every way possible. Maybe it\u2019d be different if he gave up, but he wouldn\u2019t. That was Trystan\u2019s problem\u2014he didn\u2019t stay down. It was like that with his father. It didn\u2019t matter how many times his father\u2019s hand flew, he got back up. It was the same with his life. It didn\u2019t matter how many bad hands he was dealt, he always got back up.</p> <p>A numb tingling filled his body again as he played softly. There was no peace. No refuge. He was alone. There\u2019d always been an ember of hope burning within him, but when Mari said she didn\u2019t like him, it felt like someone ripped his lungs out. The ember died, shriveling within his chest, leaving a dull ache in its place. Mari\u2019s words left him mute, unable to respond. It was the one time he didn\u2019t get up again. He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Trystan sat silently on the stool, softly playing the guitar in his lap, and felt the familiar sense of loss fill him. When his voice finally came, he sang without realizing it. Barely whispering, Trystan\u2019s mouth formed the words that spilled from his heart. The lament, the song\u2014Mari\u2019s song\u2014it helped purge him. It gave him a false sense of control, which was something Trystan desperately needed.</p><p>In the moments when Trystan was weakest, it was like there was nothing else\u2014no air touching his skin or filling his lungs. There was no stool, no music stand. He was just a voice, a heartbeat, and a breath of song. That was why he failed to hear the door, failed to hear her footfalls inching closer and closer.</p><p>By the time Mari was standing in front of him it was too late. She saw him. She heard him. She knew who he was and what he\u2019d been hiding. Her slender fingers touched her lips as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re Day Jones.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s guitar slipped from his lap and slid to his side as he stood. Shock and fear twisted his stomach into a knot. His throat was too tight to speak. Instead of attempting an explanation, he stared at her with his pulse pounding in his ears. Mari stood there, looking at him with her jaw dangling open. She stared into his eyes, unblinking, waiting for him to speak.</p> <p>A thousand thoughts flew through Trystan\u2019s mind, but he asked, \u201cWhy\u2019d you come back?\u201d</p><p>The shock melted off of Mari\u2019s face. She stood a few paces away from him. Uncertainty filled her eyes. It was like she\u2019d never seen him before, like she never noticed the guy fighting so hard to survive that he\u2019d do anything.</p><p>Her pink lips pressed together. The scent of strawberries filled his head as he remembered kissing those lips not so long ago. Mari\u2019s eyes darted away from his. She made a few false starts, before saying, \u201cI was going to tell you something, but I think you might have something to tell me instead.\u201d</p><p>Trystan stared, his body tense. The grip on the neck of his guitar tightened, but he didn\u2019t put it down. The faint golden light doused Mari softly, highlighting the gentle curves of her face. He couldn\u2019t stop looking at her.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he replied, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>Mari stepped forward with an incredulous look on her face, \u201cAre you seriously going to deny it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s just nothing to tell.\u201d Trystan\u2019s heart felt like it was going to explode.</p><p>The fame that Day Jones achieved wasn\u2019t something he wanted. He knew what would happen if he revealed himself\u2014reporters would start digging into his personal life. It would expose everything his father had done to him. The thought made him sick. Trystan saw the offers and the endless requests to reveal his identity, but he couldn\u2019t. Now, it was everything he could do to keep it a secret. He considered deleting the page, but he thought that might give him away. If someone was watching when he did it, they could track him down. The risk was too great, so he left it there and watched the comments and likes swiftly grow to staggering numbers.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she asked softly. Mari\u2019s big brown eyes lowered like she was afraid he wouldn\u2019t tell her.</p><p>Trystan sat back down on the stool and pulled the guitar onto his lap. He looked down at the instrument, his dark hair falling into his eyes. \u201cThere are some things that are too hard to tell\u2014you know what I mean?\u201d He glanced up at her to see her nod and step closer. Trystan lowered his gaze to the strings and slowly began strumming again. He waited a moment before asking, \u201cIs the door closed?\u201d His voice was so soft he could barely hear it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, watching him closely.</p><p>Trystan nodded and started the song again. He didn\u2019t plan to sing, but as he played, the words poured through him and he couldn\u2019t stop. This was what he wanted, he wanted her to know. He wanted her to believe him. Trystan forced himself to look her in the eye as he sang and felt the bottom of his stomach lurch into a free-fall that didn\u2019t seem to end. Mari\u2019s big brown eyes locked with his as he sang. She breathed slowly, her slender fingers still pressed to her lips.</p><p>Suddenly, the song didn\u2019t seem melancholy anymore. It was Mari\u2019s song and Mari was here. The corners of Trystan\u2019s mouth pulled up slightly, giving him a ghost of smile. His voice and the music flowed together, mingling and conveying the things locked inside of his heart.</p><p>Mari watched him. She didn\u2019t move. Her beautiful body remained still, standing in front of him, her lips slightly parted. He took in every inch of her, every soft curve, and every twisting brown curl as she watched him sing. When Trystan played the last note he looked down at his hands. The music faded until the only sound he could hear was his breath.</p> <p>Mari\u2019s body was tense, her slender arms rigid as her hands fell to her sides. She flexed her fingers one by one like she was nervous. Her voice was soft, curious, \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Trystan glanced up at her. He pressed his lips together and closed his eyes. He shook his head, indicating that he couldn\u2019t answer. The pit of his stomach lifted as his throat tightened. Trystan could feel the words in his mouth, the confession his lips that he wanted to bare, but he couldn\u2019t force it out. She had to see it for herself.</p><p>When Trystan looked up, Mari smiled down at him sadly. She sucked in a quick breath and it was like flipping a switch. Something changed, but he didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell, you know.\u201d Mari said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to walk in on you.\u201d She stepped toward him, closing the gap between them and rested her hand on his shoulder. Even though it was only a moment, only a small touch, Trystan nearly jumped out of his seat. Her touch set his skin on fire. It made him want to touch her in return, but he couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want him. She didn\u2019t like him that way.</p><p>Heart pounding in his chest, he tried to sound like his old self, but his voice was still too timid. Nodding, Trystan said, \u201cThank you. I don\u2019t want anyone to know. I thought I was alone...\u201d His voice trailed off. Mari released his shoulder and moved to the couch. Sitting across from him, she remained on the edge of her cushion like she might jump up at any moment. Her hands were clutched in her lap, gripping her pointer finger like she was wringing it out.</p><p>\u201cYou were alone. I didn\u2019t hear anything until I stood by the door.\u201d She forced that smile again, the one that said her insides were being ripped apart, but he didn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>Glancing at her, Trystan stood and walked the guitar back to its place in the corner. He wished she would talk to him. He\u2019d do anything to get that look off her face and make her laugh. Instead, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019d you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Mari stiffened, \u201cWhat?\u201d She startled, like there was a loud crack next to her ear.</p><p>Trystan watched her for a moment. Something wasn\u2019t right, but he didn\u2019t know what. His emotions were so out of whack. Maybe he was reading her wrong? Brow pinched, he said, \u201cYou said you were looking for me, to tell me something.\u201d</p><p>Trystan put the music stand away and stuffed the sheet music he was working on back into his pocket. When he was finished he walked to the couch and looked down at her. God, she was beautiful. Her skin was pale and perfect. The way her mouth curved made him want to kiss her. Trystan scolded himself. He had to stop acting like this around her. For whatever reason, she came back. He wouldn\u2019t chase her off again. Having her as a friend was better than not having her at all. That thought made his gut twist. There was no way he could deal with losing Mari.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d She blinked up at him a few times like she\u2019d forgotten something important. \u201cI decided to take Tucker\u2019s pass. It wasn\u2019t upstairs and neither were you. I assumed you took it.\u201d</p><p>Trystan reached into his pocket and pulled out the pink paper. His eyes never left Mari\u2019s as he reached out and handed it to her. When her fingers brushed his hand, he wished he could pull her into his arms. Instead, he tried to capture some of his old swagger and hide just how much she affected him.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s lips pulled into a soft smile as she reached out, but Trystan didn\u2019t release the paper. She glanced up at him. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want it,\u201d he breathed, stepping closer to her.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d she whispered, tugging the pass, but he didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cYour mind is usually a difficult thing to change.\u201d He grinned, looking down at her perfect face.</p><p>She smiled, \u201cNot when there\u2019s a good reason for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what reason is that?\u201d</p><p>Her brown gaze drifted over his face before returning to his eyes. She tilted her head to the side and her dark hair fell over her shoulder. \u201cA sad song, being sung alone in the basement.\u201d</p><p>The way she said it gave him hope. Something inside of him came to life and told him to hold on tight. The way her lips wrapped around the words, the way she said them softly, glancing away for a moment like it was something she shouldn\u2019t admit, made it difficult to breathe and wiped the smug expression off his lips.</p><p>Trystan tilted his chin up, still watching Mari. Carefully, he asked, \u201cYou think you\u2019ll figure out who the girl in the song is, if you hang around me long enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I will,\u201d she said with a soft voice that was exceedingly confident. It made the corners of his lips curve up. \u201cYou wear your heart on your sleeve when no one is looking, but I\u2019m always looking. I\u2019ll see it, even if no one else does. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Her words sounded like, I want to figure it out. I want to know who brought you to your knees.</p><p>Her fingers were still touching his, each of them clutching the pass. As they spoke, their faces became closer and closer. Trystan could feel her breath on his lips. Every inch of his body was tingling. He wanted to say something great, reach out and take her face between his hands, and press his lips to hers. The way she was looking at him, the way her mouth was so close to his, made him think that she might be thinking the same thing, but he couldn\u2019t believe that any more. Before she stormed off, he would have thought she liked his attention, but now\u2014he didn\u2019t know anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before he did something stupid and scared her off, Trystan smiled and released the pass. \u201cI hope you do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>Did I just say that? Did I actually confess that I was always looking at Trystan? I was so flustered. Trystan stood there, his warm skin brushing mine with that playful look in his eye. He tugged the pass hard and I tugged back. We were nose to nose by the time he said that. His lips were so close, so perfect. I sighed inside, wanting to fall into his arms, but I couldn\u2019t. He was lost in some other girl. If I threw myself at him now, it wouldn\u2019t end well. I\u2019d be second to whoever stole his heart.</p> <p>I heard myself say, \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d not knowing what I\u2019d do after that. I just didn\u2019t want to leave. Part of me wanted to confess why I came back in the first place. Heart racing, I looked into his vibrant eyes, unable to look away.</p><p>Trystan grinned and released the pass. \u201cI hope you do.\u201d</p><p>I replayed the whole thing over again in my mind as I walked to class in a daze. Trystan Scott was in love. As if that wasn\u2019t weird enough, he was also Day Jones. I didn\u2019t even know what to ask him about that, so I didn\u2019t ask anything. I cursed myself for thinking I could tell Trystan that I was in love with him. Naivety often blindsided me. I\u2019d listened to that Day Jones song enough times to know that whoever wrote it was completely and totally lost to love\u2014even if she didn\u2019t even know he was alive.</p><p>A spark of jealousy flamed to life inside of me. I knew Trystan was alive. Every inch of me knew Trystan was alive and wanted to know him more. Sighing, I put my books on my desk and slid into my seat. I\u2019d walked so fast that I\u2019d gotten to class early. While many students still lingered in the halls, hardly any were at their seats, yet.</p><p>Katie arrived half a beat later. I heard her voice before I saw her face. She slipped into the seat next to me asking, \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, not bothering to look up. \u201cCouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Katie was pumped, ready to support me however I needed, but she couldn\u2019t tell what I needed. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me! Tell me.\u201d She shook my arms as she said it and I sat upright in my seat.</p><p>I glanced at the front of the room. The bell would ring in a second. Mathboy started to hand back papers. When he passed Katie\u2019s desk, she practically drooled a puddle on the floor.</p><p>\u201cLater. I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d Just as I finished saying it, a wadded-up piece of paper nailed me in the back of the head. Katie and I turned in unison looking for the source.</p><p>Brie Parker. She had that horrible smile on her face, the one she wore after she did something really bad. I was in advanced math and Brie wasn\u2019t. Since the school budget didn\u2019t pass this year or last, there wasn\u2019t an honor\u2019s class. Instead they combined a class of nerds with the class of burn-outs who were a year older than us. It had to be hell for the teacher. I didn\u2019t like it much either. It meant I had to hear about Brie and Trystan all last year while they dated. Sometimes he had come into the room and taken her in his arms. Every other girl was jealous, enviously watching Brie and Trystan. When they broke-up, there was a lot of chatter about who Trystan would date next. It drove Brie crazy. Trystan bounced from girl to girl, while Brie snagged the first thug she could wrap her pointy little fingers around. She made sure to slobber all over her new boyfriend in front of Trystan regularly.</p><p>I hated her guts before, but after Brie got me in trouble the other day I hated her even more. I figured out that I must have done something that pissed her off, but I had no idea what. Throwing stuff wasn\u2019t the normal backstabbing Brie-method of humiliation. She was usually more subtle, more devastating than that. It worried me that she seemed to have chosen me as her new target. There would be more crap like she pulled the other day. I\u2019d hoped that Trystan humiliating her would have made her focus on him. As far as I could tell, she didn\u2019t change targets. Maybe it was because Trystan was already on her hit list.</p> <p>Katie snatched up the paper and hurled it back at Brie\u2019s face, but Mathboy chose that second to walk in front of her. The paper wad nailed him in the back. He turned around and cocked his head, staring straight at Katie.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked as a brow drifted higher on his face.</p><p>Katie flushed scarlet and she turned around in her seat. Mathboy picked up the paper-ball and stuffed it into the crook of his arm and continued to pass back papers. When he stopped in front of Katie\u2019s desk, he placed another of her tests in front of her, along with the wadded paper. Brie was sniggering from the back with her clones. When the hot guy finished passing out the papers, he left the room to do something else. The teacher walked to the front of the class and started the lesson.</p><p>On the side of the crumpled paper, there was a blue pen mark that looked like a number. It wasn\u2019t there before. I poked it with my pencil and glanced at it several times to get Katie to notice. When she did, she smoothed the piece of paper and saw Mathboy\u2019s phone number. The day got a lot more interesting after that.</p><p>As Katie and I walked to my locker after school, she leaned in close to make sure no one could hear her over the sound of slammed lockers and hallway chatter. The last bell had rung. There were ten minutes before I was supposed to be at practice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d Katie asked, bumping my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out if it since lunch.\u201d</p><p>I was out of it. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Trystan, about that guitar in his lap, and the beautiful tone of his voice when he sang. I\u2019d never heard him sing before. It was breathtaking and heartbreaking at the same time. Whoever caught his attention did a good job.</p><p>A jolt of jealousy shot through me, straightening my spine. I glanced at Katie. I couldn\u2019t tell her what happened. I couldn\u2019t say that Trystan was Day Jones. I promised I wouldn\u2019t say anything, even if I didn\u2019t understand why. Revealing that he was Day would have meant financial independence. He could leave this place and never look back, but Trystan left the agents\u2019 requests unanswered and kept his identity a secret.</p> <p>Clearing my throat I said, \u201cNothing. Everything. I can\u2019t get him out of my head.\u201d I stared blankly ahead. I didn\u2019t want to lie to her, but felt I had to. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like that about me, Katie.\u201d</p><p>The smile slipped off her face, \u201cHow do you know if you didn\u2019t tell him?\u201d She leaned closer to me, clutching her books to her chest. Her eyes darted back and forth to make sure no one else could overhear us.</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me that he likes someone else.\u201d That wasn\u2019t a lie. Not totally. His song said he liked someone very much. He sounded like he was in love with her. I didn\u2019t understand how he could have written that, and sang that way, if he didn\u2019t. Swallowing the lump in my throat, I stopped in front of my locker and took a deep breath before opening it. I tossed my books in as Katie put a hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mari. But at least you know now. You can move on. Find someone else.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and stared into the open locker like I was forgetting something. \u201cI know.\u201d And I knew there would never be anyone else like Trystan. Every time I thought I knew all there was to know about him, another thing popped up\u2014like Day Jones. It drew me to him more, making him too irresistible to forget.</p><p>CHPATER 3</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>Tucker sat in the first row like he always did, pinching the bridge of his nose as he watched the actors on stage. Everyone wondered why he taught all the theater classes, since he appeared to hate it so much. There were rumors that he was paying his dues, being the youngest English teacher in the school, but Trystan wasn\u2019t so sure. At times he saw the subtle smile on Tucker\u2019s face that said he enjoyed it. The man may have been new to teaching, but it also gave him passion some of the older teachers were lacking. Tucker didn\u2019t seem to think anyone was a lost cause, which was probably why he paid attention to Trystan when the rest of his teachers couldn\u2019t wait to shove him out the door.</p><p>Tucker stood and stomped up the steps, his gut shaking as he went. His voice was strained, \u201cBrie, dear\u2014\u201d he started and she beamed at him, bating those blue eyes like she thought he was going to compliment her.</p><p>Trystan stood opposite Brie, his arms folded across his chest and rolled his eyes. Brie shot Trystan a nasty look when Tucker wasn\u2019t looking. She was still pissed about her skirt going over her head. Brie\u2019s expiration date on revenge was never. He\u2019d been waiting, but so far she didn\u2019t seem to be plotting anything.</p><p>As Trystan watched Tucker coach Brie, he looked away. Everything about her irritated him. When she messed up, she\u2019d pout and toss her golden hair over her shoulder. Her bottom lip would slowly push out until it looked like she\u2019d cry. It kept her from getting the correction she needed.</p><p>Trystan couldn\u2019t believe how fake she was and that he failed to see it sooner. Brie smiled and said something. Tucker walked her through her lines again. Trystan stared into the stage wing, peering through the darkness, looking for Mari. Instead of seeing the girl who stole his heart, he only saw her empty chair. She was downstairs. They didn\u2019t need her to prompt anymore, and Tucker had sent her into the prop room to dig something up.</p><p>Trystan couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Mari. She consumed his thoughts to the point that he didn\u2019t hear his own name.</p><p>\u201cScott!\u201d Tucker bellowed.</p><p>While Tucker coached Brie, he\u2019d retreated to the other side of the stage and slid onto the table. He sat there, dangling his legs over the side and staring at his feet, while Brie played dumb. When people thought you were stupid, they didn\u2019t expect much from you. Trystan knew that trick. It was one of the reasons he\u2019d been assigned someone to run lines with. No one knew the other reasons.</p><p>Trystan looked up slowly. He\u2019d been so focused on the memory of Mari listening to his song, the way her face looked as he sang to her, that he failed to hear Tucker. Coolly, Trystan lifted his gaze and said, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Tucker folded his arms across his massive chest and looked at Trystan like he was crazy. Tucker jabbed his thumb at Brie, \u201cRun through the end of the second act with her.\u201d When Trystan didn\u2019t move, Tucker added. \u201cNow.\u201d The large man turned, huffed as he descended the stage stairs, and walked back to his seat. Clapping his massive hands, he bellowed, \u201cTop of the second act people.\u201d Those who weren\u2019t supposed to be on stage cleared the stage, leaving Trystan alone with Brie under the spotlight.</p><p>As Trystan slipped off the table, he saw a sliver of light cut across the wall backstage. A moment later, Mari appeared. Her long curls dangled down her back as she rounded the stage, appearing next to Tucker below. She handed him something too small to see and went back to her metal chair in the wing.</p><p>As Trystan\u2019s gaze followed Mari back to her seat, Brie stepped closer and whispered with her ruby red lips a little too close to his face, \u201cYou\u2019ll never nail that. Her mom\u2019s on the school board and her dad\u2019s a doctor. There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll let their only daughter anywhere near scum like you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood thing your parent\u2019s didn\u2019t care then, huh?\u201d Trystan\u2019s gaze cut to Brie.</p><p>The snake-like smile that spread across her face fell as his words hit her. \u201cFuck you, Trystan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, Brie.\u201d Trystan smirked, as Brie\u2019s face contorted into a scowl that resided in evil bitch territory. Brie folded her arms across her chest and turned away. Venom radiated off of her. He\u2019d pay for that later. He knew every jab, every insult he hurled at her would be repaid tenfold, but Trystan didn\u2019t care. Brie needed to be knocked down a few pegs and he didn\u2019t mind doing it, not when she kept trying to screw with him.</p><p>Tucker yelled, \u201cFrom the top. Now, people.\u201d</p> <p>They started again. The guy in the lighting cage changed the lights on the set so there was a single golden spot on center stage. Its broad beam was soft, spilling light across the stage like a streetlight on a dark night. Trystan moved to stage left and started his lines again. He had no trouble with this part. As the scene went on, they moved closer together. Romantic tension was rising steadily. Tucker didn\u2019t stop them. Brie played her part well, but not as well as Mari. Trystan said his lines with conviction. They were perfectly played, because he pretended Brie was Mari, the girl he wanted and couldn\u2019t ever have. It fit perfectly into that scene and made it easier to act opposite Brie and not puke on her.</p><p>They ran through the act perfectly. Everything was flowing at a steady rate toward the end of the scene. Trystan\u2019s stomach was pooling with dread. That act ended with a kiss, a passionate kiss. To make matters more awkward, Trystan could feel Mari\u2019s eyes on him, watching him get ready to kiss someone else. He couldn\u2019t think about that now. If he wasn\u2019t half way convincing, Tucker would have them start over.</p><p>With every ounce of charm he had in him, Trystan pulled Brie close, gently wrapping his fingers around her waist. Brie let him, and slipped into his arms like she belonged there. The scent of her perfume filled his head. At one time it had been attractive, but now the scent repelled him. He breathed through his mouth, inhaling as little as possible. Brie pressed against him, letting him feel her curves.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s voice was deep and seductive. He acted as though he were saying the line to Mari, \u201cI\u2019d do this.\u201d Trystan moved in slowly and pressed his lips to Brie\u2019s. Revulsion shot through him, but he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>It\u2019s Mari, he told himself. Pretend she\u2019s Mari. Trystan closed his eyes and splayed his hands across Brie\u2019s cheeks, kissing her a second longer than he should have. The students in the wings got wrapped up in the steamy kiss. Trystan could feel all eyes on him, and for once, he wished they weren\u2019t. It was the emptiest kiss he\u2019d ever had.</p> <p>After all this time, he finally understood what Mari meant\u2014that a kiss was worth something\u2014that it meant something. This was the difference between a shallow kiss and one that he craved with every ounce of his being. When Trystan opened his eyes, he looked Brie in the face. For once, she was silent. Shocked. They both stared at each other as the spot light faded and curtain swung shut.</p><p>Trystan dropped his hands and stepped away. He felt sick, like he\u2019d done something wrong.</p><p>\u201cTrystan,\u201d she said his name like he had a tremendous effect on her. Brie stared at him with her red lips parted, waiting for him to respond. He\u2019d never kissed her like that before. Sure, he\u2019d kissed her plenty of times before that, but it never meant anything. It was purely fun, purely lust. This time was different, because he was thinking of Mari and her perfectly sweet lips. Apparently, Brie felt the difference. The look in her eye said she wasn\u2019t done with him yet, that he could have more.</p><p>Trystan said nothing. There was no way he was telling her what changed, why the kiss felt passionate. Instead, he turned to the wing where Mari was sitting and walked off stage. When he passed through the curtain, there were several stage crew members blocking his path. One slapped him on the back and said, \u201cHoly hell! That was hot!\u201d</p><p>Brie watched him walk away with her fingers to her lips like she never realized what she had while she had it.</p><p>When Trystan finally plowed through the kids, he found Mari\u2019s seat empty. It wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t right. That was Mari\u2019s kiss and he gave it to someone else\u2014someone he detested. Trystan sat down hard in Mari\u2019s chair and leaned back, running his fingers through his hair. Where was she?</p> <p>Tucker\u2019s voice boomed from the other side of the curtain, \u201cTake a break, Scott.\u201d</p><p>That was all he needed to hear. Trystan got up and exited through the side stage door. He walked through the empty halls toward the cafeteria and went to the vending machines. He normally didn\u2019t buy stuff like that. It was too expensive, but he wanted caffeine. He was shaking, his stomach churning inside of him like he\u2019d be sick.</p><p>Fishing a dollar out of his pocket, Trystan fed it to the machine and then pressed a button. A Coke tumbled out of the bottom of the machine. He bent down and picked it up, lost in thought. Trystan walked back slowly, drinking his sugar quickly, when Seth ran up next to him. A teacher screamed at Seth to stop running, but he didn\u2019t slow until he reached Trystan.</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Seth huffed. \u201cYou almost done? I have us a dinner date lined up.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows, very proud of his latest catch. It had to be the 7-Eleven twins. Seth had been hanging around them nearly every day.</p><p>Trystan groaned inside, but he didn\u2019t show any sign that he wasn\u2019t interested. He didn\u2019t want to fight about Mari again. Nodding, Trystan said, \u201cYeah. Give me about forty-five minutes. We should be done by then.\u201d</p><p>Seth grinned, \u201cShe\u2019s so hot, man. And her rack is like,\u201d he paused his hands cupping the air as a look of awe spread across his face, \u201cso perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it matters?\u201d Seth laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re twins. They\u2019ve got the same of everything.\u201d He elbowed Trystan, like his crass comment amused them both and then took off in the other direction. \u201cLater, Scott! Don\u2019t be late!\u201d</p> <p>Trystan shook his head. He was starting to think that he and Seth had little in common anymore. At some point, Seth fixated on bodies and Trystan wanted more than that. A good body was great, but without a brain it didn\u2019t hold much appeal. Mari had a great mind, filled with tack-sharp wit and other awesome things. Plus she had the body, too. He grinned, thinking about it. Trystan started back toward the auditorium, chugging the rest of his Coke.</p><p>As he rounded the corner, Trystan saw Mari leaning against the wall by the stage door. Her head was tilted up, her eyes closed like she was upset. His heart twisted in his chest. He watched her for a moment, unsure if he should approach, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. His feet took him to her. It was like they were two magnets and when she was near, he couldn\u2019t pass her by.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Trystan asked, stopping in front of her.</p><p>Mari jumped when she heard his voice. She looked directly at him. There were no tears in her eyes, but he knew something was bothering her. Something had been bothering her all day. Mari seemed more agitated and jumpy than normal. \u201cYeah, fine.\u201d She waited a moment, then crossed her arms and sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Trystan leaned his shoulder against the wall next to her. The hairs on the back of his neck started to rise. He ignored the warning premonition. Looking down into her face, he asked, \u201cWhat don\u2019t you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you can do that. How you can make everyone believe your emotions are real, even when they aren\u2019t. That kiss...\u201d She spit out the word kiss, shaking her head. Mari\u2019s soft brown curls moved as she did it, falling forward into her face. She pushed them back, her gaze skewering him in place. \u201cIt makes it hard to believe that you like someone else. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Trystan didn\u2019t understand why she was upset. Her reaction was strange considering what she\u2019d told him earlier. She didn\u2019t care about him that way, and while kissing Brie made Trystan feel dirty, it shouldn\u2019t have had any effect on Mari. Unless...</p><p>Unless what, Scott? Take a hint, the voice inside his head scolded, she doesn\u2019t like you. Stop acting like she does.</p><p>Maybe his words were too clipped, but once he said them, he couldn\u2019t take them back. \u201cWhy does it matter, Mari? It doesn\u2019t affect you.\u201d And you\u2019d tell me if it did, he hoped.</p><p>She straightened like he\u2019d hit her.</p><p>Crap. That was the wrong thing to say.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Mari looked at him once like he was cruel, and started to walk away.</p><p>He reached for her, grabbing her wrist, wanting an explanation. \u201cHey, wait a second. Mari, what is this? You know me.\u201d His heart throbbed harder as his hand gripped her wrist. Her skin was so warm, so smooth. When she looked up at him with those dark eyes, he was lost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure anymore.\u201d She looked down at his hand on her arm like she didn\u2019t want it there.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Of course you know me.\u201d Trystan tried to strangle the pleading tone out of his voice, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. An icy feeling was pooling in his stomach as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never really sure if the guy I know is the real Trystan or the act.\u201d She tucked a curl behind her ear and looked up at Trystan with those eyes. They said everything. She didn\u2019t trust him. She didn\u2019t know what to believe anymore and it was his own damn fault. \u201cYou can put on a dazzling show when you try. How I am supposed to know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not?\u201d When she asked the question, she couldn\u2019t look at him. Her gaze fell to the floor.</p><p>He took her shoulders in his hands. \u201cLook at me, Mari. You know me. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you. About anything.\u201d Her gaze lifted and met his. Her brown eyes seemed incredibly vulnerable right then, and he didn\u2019t know why. Trystan knew this was important to her, that she felt misled and he wanted to fix it. He lifted a hand to her face and tucked a stray hair behind her ear, letting his fingers linger in her soft hair. His voice was soft, beseeching, \u201cYou know me better than anyone else. You always have.\u201d</p><p>Mari swallowed hard, her eyes locked on his. She didn\u2019t look away. She didn\u2019t shirk him off like she usually did. Instead she stood there, barely breathing, looking for the truth in his eyes. His gut twisted like someone was wringing it out. The way she looked at him said so much. Did she really not see it? Of course not. She saw the guy on stage, the one who kissed Brie\u2014the one who was never serious about anyone.</p><p>Finally she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the prop room tomorrow with Tucker\u2019s pass. I\u2019ll show you that I\u2019m serious. Acting is acting. Brie doesn\u2019t have my heart.\u201d He paused, willing her to see it, to feel it. Squeezing her shoulders, he said, \u201cSomeone else does.\u201d</p><p>Mari broke the intense gaze, nervously tucking her hair behind her ear, and stepped back. He smiled at her. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear was a tick that he hadn\u2019t noticed before. Something about the way she did it, like she was trying to hide from him, made him adore her even more.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, I guess. I want to believe you. I really do. I just... I don\u2019t know anymore, but I\u2019ll come. I\u2019ll be there because of what happened today. All of it.\u201d Mari gave him a weak smile and turned on her heel to leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trystan\u2019s eyes slid over her curves and landed on her hips for a second. The black top she wore wasn\u2019t tight, but it wasn\u2019t loose either. Coupled with those jeans and that sexy hair, she looked like a goddess\u2014and just as far out of reach.</p><p>Mari was too good for him and he knew it.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>~MARI~</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to watch that part, but the end of the second act drew me back to my seat. No one blocked my line of sight, so I had the perfect place to watch Trystan give Brie a perfect kiss. The tension in the air was so thick, the way he looked at her made my stomach twist. It was like watching the lines when he ran them with me. Nothing seemed real in that moment. The guy I loved was inching closer to someone else, his lips pressing to hers, his hands gently touching her face. It was like hitting replay and watching him kiss me. Suddenly it felt like there was no air. The room grew hotter as my heart slapped into my ribs, banging inside of me like I was going to die.</p><p>That was my kiss. It was the same kiss he gave me in the prop room. I\u2019d known it was fake, that he was acting, but somehow seeing it in front of me was too much. I felt sick and couldn\u2019t stay there for another second. My stomach churched like I ate glass as I staggered to my feet. My head was caught somewhere between being crushed in a vice and floating away. Anger surged through my veins, but not at Trystan\u2014at myself.</p><p>How could I be so stupid? I\u2019d come to think that the kiss we shared meant something to him. The way he looked at me, the way he leaned in so slow that my heart felt like it would burst, even the way he gently pressed his lips to mine\u2014it was all nothing. Out on the stage, it looked like Trystan hit a replay button. The entire thing played out, just as it was done to me, but he was with another girl and it was right in front of my face. It didn\u2019t matter that he was acting. I couldn\u2019t get control of myself. My eyes stung as I tried not to blink. Tears would roll down my cheeks. I looked insane as it was, shoving my way through gawking kids and running away like there was a fire.</p><p>My kiss was nothing to Trystan. Our kiss meant nothing.</p><p>Irritated with myself for being so naive, I hurried through the hallway to my locker. Pretending that I forgot something gave me a moment\u2019s peace. I darted from my chair while everyone else watched the lights fade to black. It was like the air was charged with hormones and I imagined Trystan would get a fair amount of high-fives and crass statements for delivering such a smoking-hot kiss in front of so many people.</p> <p>I fumed as I raced to my locker, trying to calm down. The teachers wouldn\u2019t say anything as long as I didn\u2019t linger, and as long as I didn\u2019t run. I opened the door and leaned my head against the shelf, feeling the cold metal against my skin. The scent of paper and musty textbooks filled my head.</p><p>How dumb am I? I wondered.</p><p>For a moment I thought that Trystan actually liked me. When I heard him sing, it made me feel like there was a part of him that I couldn\u2019t see. There was genuine pain and longing in that song. Could he have concocted that song and all its haunting beauty like he concocted that kiss? Could he toy with a girl\u2019s emotions as easily? I felt sick. How could I be so stupid? And what about everything else? All those looks, the way he brushed my hand when I was close, the way he looked at me\u2014I swear, if I didn\u2019t know better I would have thought he liked me.</p><p>But I did know better. I knew Trystan Scott and this was one-hundred percent Trystan behavior. Damn, the guy was like a total sociopath. He wore so many masks, way more than I\u2019ve ever even tried on, and each one fits him perfectly. He can become what he needs to be, what people expect, at the snap of a finger. The guy I saw so rarely was hidden somewhere beneath layers too deep to fathom.</p><p>Why does he do that? Why does he change when different people are around? The version of Trystan that sat in the basement and played the guitar, the earlier version that wasn\u2019t Day Jones even, those were great. What\u2019s not to like? Why hide when everyone loves you? There has to be a reason for it, but I had no idea what it was.</p><p>Yeah, you know. He likes getting what he wants, my inner-voice chided.</p> <p>Oh God, was he that shallow? Did he really change to suit who he was with to get what he wanted? Trystan couldn\u2019t be that shallow. Deep in my bones, I knew he wasn\u2019t like that. There was something else. Something more that damaged him. There had to be. Trystan had that lost puppy thing about him. It made girls flock to him and want to be with him. That was always there. It never went away. He wore it like a scar. It was a piece of him that he couldn\u2019t hide no matter how much he smiled and flirted.</p><p>I checked my face in my mirror and pressed the locker closed. Walking back to the stage door, I stopped for a second and leaned against the wall trying to blow off what I\u2019d just seen.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter what he does with Brie or anyone else. Trystan and I are nothing, but friends. I kept telling myself that, but it didn\u2019t take away the sting. Pressing my eyes closed, I took a deep breath. When I opened them again, I saw Trystan standing in front of me with a can of Coke, asking me a question that I barely heard.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Trystan asked. His eyes found mine and held my gaze gently, like he knew I was close to tears.</p><p>Irritation and anger mingled together and vaporized my resolve. It floated away like I never had any. Trystan\u2019s gaze was so convincing, which made it harder not to fall for him. I spewed out the words before I could stop them. \u201cYeah, fine.\u201d My teeth bit into my bottom lip. I tried to shut up, I tried to stop talking, but I couldn\u2019t. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said, arms flying around like a crazy person, my tone too clipped to be fine.</p><p>Trystan leaned next to me and looked down into my face. Those startling blue eyes were like twin pools. I wanted to get lost in them. I wanted them on me and only me. \u201cWhat don\u2019t you get?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow you can do that?\u201d I squeak, unable to keep my mouth shut. \u201cHow you can make everyone believe you\u2019re emotions are real, even when they aren\u2019t? That kiss...\u201d I shook my head. My brain was telling my mouth to shut up, but it kept going. My heart overpowered my head, like it usually did. Taking a deep breath, the rest of the thought rolled out, \u201cIt makes it hard to believe that you like someone else. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter, Mari? It doesn\u2019t affect you.\u201d His words struck me like a blow to the cheek. I never expected him to say it. Not to me. Not so callously.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Sickened, I turned away. I had to leave. Now. I couldn\u2019t stand there another minute. Trystan was all talk, all smooth lips, and smoother lies. I didn\u2019t want that from him. I thought I knew him and I didn\u2019t. It felt like someone was strangling me. I couldn\u2019t stand it another second.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed my wrist, stopping me, \u201cHey, wait a second. Mari, what is this? You know me.\u201d</p><p>Heart pounding, I looked down at his hand and then up at Trystan\u2019s face. I wanted to say so many things, but the only one I could manages was, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure anymore.\u201d</p><p>He looked offended, dark hair falling into his eyes, his lips curving into a confused expression, \u201cWhat do you mean? Of course you know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never really sure if the guy I know is the real Trystan or the act. You can put on a dazzling show when you try. How I am supposed to know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not?\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop the words flying out of my mouth. It was like I was running straight into a freight-train and hoping it would miss smashing me to bits when it hit. I knew what he thought of me, how he felt for me, and yet\u2014I was standing there doing what? Demanding more?</p><p>He\u2019s not mine, I reminded myself. I shouldn\u2019t be so upset. It shouldn\u2019t matter if he can photocopy a kiss and give it to every girl in the school. Trystan isn\u2019t mine. His heart belongs to someone else, assuming he has a heart at all.</p><p>Trystan shocked me out of my thoughts when he placed his hands on my shoulders. A current ran through me. That jolt laced around my throat, traveling down into my stomach, and froze me in place. I couldn\u2019t breathe. My brain was fighting it, screaming for him to let go. I couldn\u2019t take his touch and his false sincerity.</p><p>Panic clutched me harder until I heard his voice, \u201cLook at me, Mari.\u201d But I couldn\u2019t look at him. Those eyes, that gaze would knock the sense out of me. He continued, his voice pleading with me, \u201cYou know me. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you. About anything. You know me better than anyone else. You always have.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. As he spoke, my gaze lifted to meet his and once I did, I couldn\u2019t look away. Trystan stole my heart and I couldn\u2019t take it back. Hope and dread mingled together as his words washed over me. They were too easy to believe. I wanted to believe him, but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>By the time I spoke, my voice was small, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the prop room tomorrow with Tucker\u2019s pass. I\u2019ll show you that I\u2019m serious. Acting is acting. Brie doesn\u2019t have my heart. Someone else does.\u201d</p><p>His words were like a foot to my stomach. There was no air. I tried to cover it up. I looked away even though I felt his gaze burning a hole on the side of my face. Tucking a piece of hair behind my ear, I pressed my lips together trying to find an answer that wouldn\u2019t hurt me more.</p><p>Brie. He gave Brie my kiss. He kissed Brie before. He slept with Brie, I reminded myself. Closing my eyes, I wished he was gone. I didn\u2019t shirk him off this time. His hands felt too good. They were strong and warm, holding me in place, demanding something from me that I was afraid to give.</p><p>I babbled a few words that I couldn\u2019t remember saying even if I tried and then added, \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore, but I\u2019ll come. I\u2019ll be there because of what happened today.\u201d</p><p>Because of what you did for me. Because of your gaze in the closet. Because of the way you defended me to Tucker. Because of the song that poured from your heart. Because I heard it from your lips. Because I\u2019m not sure who you are anymore and I think I\u2019m more in love with this version of you than the last.</p><p>Oh God. Katie was right. He was going to hurt me and I was giving him every means possible. I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. Turning, I freed myself from his grip. When his hands fell away, it felt like someone ripped off a piece of my heart. I walked away leaving Trystan behind. For once, he didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t bound up the hallway chasing after me. Instead he stayed there, staring, speechless.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>\u201cWell, that couldn\u2019t have gone worse,\u201d Trystan mumbled, as he walked back into the theater. Running his fingers through his hair, he pressed his eyes closed. There were so many things he did that totally screwed his relationship with Mari. It was like the whole relationship went up in a ball of flames before he even realized he liked her\u2014before he fell in love with her.</p><p>Regret snaked through his stomach, as he walked to a few rows behind Tucker and slouched down into a seat. Within a matter of moments, girls he didn\u2019t really know filled the seats next to him. They fell from the sky like rain. They were always there chattering. He was never alone, but he always felt isolated. Trying to block out the chatter, he watched the beginning of the third act on stage. Brie was sucking-up her lines and trying to cover it by blaming someone else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s when he finally zoned in on the conversation going on around him.</p><p>The girl was saying, \u201cI know, right? I heard there\u2019s a reward for the person who outs him.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s gaze snapped toward her, \u201cOuts who?\u201d</p><p>Regan beamed, glad that he noticed her. Her inky hair gleamed in the dim light, falling over her shoulders as she leaned closer to him. \u201cDay Jones. Who else? The guy\u2019s a shadow. Every time someone thinks they got a line on him, he vanishes. Poof.\u201d She lifted her hand, making the fingers of her fist fly open. Her dark brows rose as if it were impressive.</p> <p>Another voice spoke and Trystan turned to see Jamie, a coppery-haired girl with olive skin. \u201cThere\u2019s a reward, and it\u2019s huge. That rich dude said he\u2019d offer a million bucks to the person who finds him. Something about wanting Day to sing at his kid\u2019s birthday.\u201d She shrugged like it was a normal thing to do. Trystan never celebrated his birthday. Actually, he spent it as far away from his dad as he could manage. It was a reminder of everything they lost, of everything he\u2019d never have.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s skin prickled as ice filled his stomach. He shifted in his seat, hiding behind that cool smile he always wore. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he was shocked, but he hid it like he hid everything.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with people? Why couldn\u2019t they admire a song and leave a guy alone?</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d Regan replied. She laughed and turned toward Tessa behind her. \u201cDid you see that Day-Tracker site? The one with all the leads and how they panned out?\u201d</p><p>Tessa laughed, \u201cYeah, that was awesome,\u201d she leaned forward. \u201cThat last guy they tracked seemed like a good fit, but in the end, it wasn\u2019t him. I was totally hoping they\u2019d find him. I can\u2019t wait to see what he\u2019ll do\u2014and what he looks like. With a voice like that, he has to be hot. The shy thing just makes him more appealing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Regan smiled, nodding in agreement.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you see the Facebook page for Find Day?\u201d Tessa continued, \u201cIt\u2019s hysterical.\u201d</p><p>Regan nodded, smiling huge. \u201cI know right? And the pictures were an awesome touch.\u201d She turned to look at Trystan, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like the ultimate Where\u2019s Waldo of hot guys. Girls have been uploading pics of what they think Day looks like and where they think he is. I\u2019m totally uploading my guess later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, what\u2019s that?\u201d Trystan asked, a smirk on his face. He folded his arms over his chest while they were speaking and sat up a little bit. His stomach was tangling into a knot. They were looking for him.</p><p>Regan giggled, \u201cWell, with a song like that there\u2019s no question that he\u2019s been playing for a long time. His accent sounded a little Cajun, and based on the way he plays, I\u2019m thinking New Orleans.\u201d She turned quickly and pointed a finger at the others, \u201cYou better not steal my idea. Post your own city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in New Orleans,\u201d Tessa whispered as Tucker looked back at them, a clear signal to shut up, but they kept talking. \u201cCajun accent,\u201d she mimicked and rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? He\u2019s clearly from Long Island. Did you hear the way he said his G\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>Regan contested, \u201cYeah, but he didn\u2019t put W\u2019s in the middle of everything. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s from around there. You\u2019d hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott!\u201d Tucker yelled. \u201cSilence your posse or get out.\u201d</p><p>Trystan stood, heart racing, all too happy to flee. The girl\u2019s looked up at him as he rose. \u201cMr. Tucker, you know as well as I do that there\u2019s nothing that will get them to stop talking, short of the apocalypse, and even then I imagine that they\u2019ll be pointing out which zombie is wearing what, so I\u2019ll take you up on your offer and leave.\u201d The girl\u2019s watched him slack-jawed, admiring him and then bursting into giggles at the zombie fashion reference.</p><p>Trystan headed out the back door, his head spinning. People were looking for him, trying to discover Day Jones\u2019 identity. The thought never occurred to him, not in his wildest dreams. Dread pooled in his stomach as he walked to his locker and opened the metal door. Staring into space, he wondered if there was anything telling on the video\u2014any signs of who he was or where he was. Trystan admitted he wasn\u2019t very careful. When he made the video he was only thinking of Mari. He leaned his head against the cold metal and took a deep breath. He\u2019d have to watch the video later to make sure there was nothing identifiable. Although he\u2019d done it already, he felt like there was something there, something that would lead them to him. Trystan was certain that their only real clue was the YouTube account and his user name. Even if someone managed to track the IP address, it would show his neighbor, not Trystan\u2019s home. The thought still made him squirm. That was too close.</p><p>Trystan grabbed his leather jacket and slammed the locker door. As he headed outside, a cool burst of wind caught his jacket and Trystan tugged it shut. Night was falling. Practice was running longer and longer, as it normally did, up until the day of the dress-rehearsal. Trystan walked down the street. Car horns blared on the busy road next to him. The scent of exhaust mingled with the crisp autumn air filled his lungs.</p><p>Passing store fronts, he walked to the diner to meet Seth and his date. Trystan cringed inside. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. He laughed hollowly. Yeah right. Knowing Seth, there wasn\u2019t really another option. He sighed, his breath coming out in a white cloud. Sometimes he wished he had a different life, a different father, a different past.</p><p>Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad if people knew he wrote that song, but the thought made him cringe. What would his life be like if people knew he was Day Jones? What would they think when they found out his mother ran out on him and that his dad hated him? Trystan hung his head, his gaze intent on the sidewalk in front of him. He could see it, picture it in his mind\u2019s eye\u2014everything everyone ever thought about him was a lie. He wasn\u2019t anyone special. He wasn\u2019t anyone at all. Revealing Day Jones\u2019 identity would destroy him. It would strip away the little parts of his life that mattered.</p><p>Frustration shot through Trystan. Moving his feet faster, he came up with a plan for the date. He\u2019d have dinner with Seth, so he didn\u2019t get grilled with more Mari questions, and then get rid of the girl. There was no way he could feel okay. Not tonight. Not after today. Everything had started off so promising, before it derailed and turned to ash in his hands.</p> <p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>Katie got my text and met me at the diner in ten minutes flat. She must have hitched a ride, since she didn\u2019t have a car and there was no other way she could have arrived so quickly. I didn\u2019t expect her to get there so fast.</p><p>She slipped into the booth across from me, gasping like she was out of breath, \u201cWhat the hell happened? I ran out after stuffing dinner down my throat. My parents think I\u2019m a lunatic as it is. After tonight, they\u2019re gonna have me committed.\u201d I was near tears. \u201cAwh, damn. It\u2019s Trystan, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and started spilling my guts, telling her how that kiss felt\u2014the way it seemed like it was tailored just for me. Seeing him kiss Brie like that in front of everyone, giving her my kiss, shattered the illusion.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lie,\u201d I finished up, slumping back in the booth, folding my arms over my chest. I let my dark hair fall forward to hide my face and cast a shadow over the pain in my eyes. \u201cHe used me. No\u2014he was running lines. The entire thing was fake and I was too stupid to notice.\u201d</p><p>It felt like Trystan wrapped his fingers around my heart and squeezed. I couldn\u2019t stand it. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do, but suddenly sitting in the booth felt uncomfortable. I wiggled in my seat, trying to slink out of sight when some girls who knew Brie walked by. Katie shot daggers at them and they passed without comment, which was good because I couldn\u2019t take anything else today.</p><p>A waiter came by again and asked for our order. When I first sat down, he tried to get my order, but I said I was waiting for someone. He huffed and walked off, like I screwed up his night. It\u2019s not like I was rude. I didn\u2019t understand people sometimes.</p><p>Katie ordered for both of us. \u201cTwo sides of fries and two chocolate milkshakes\u2014tall with extra whipped cream. And she wants a cherry on top.\u201d Katie winked at me and the strangle-hold on my heart lessened. She always knew how to make me feel better. She dug through her purse and pulled out a ponytail holder. She pulled back her hair as she spoke, \u201cI\u2019m sorry this happened, that you found out this way, but at least now you know. Before you couldn\u2019t tell what he was doing. Now you know he\u2019s a goddamn liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn actor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d Katie said. When she finished tugging the ponytail tight, she leaned forward saying, \u201cListen, if anything, that thespian genius makes it harder to see through his little flirtations. There\u2019s no way to know if things are real with a guy like that. He\u2019s always acting.\u201d Her head tilted to the side and her eyebrows crept up her face. It was her uh-durrr face, she was just too kind to actually say it to me.</p><p>Some of what she said seemed true, but my mind rebelled against it. My voice was flat. I wasn\u2019t defending him, but I had to point it out, \u201cWe\u2019re all always acting. What the hell do you think high school is? You really think I strut around being myself all day? Come on, Katie. You have to do better than that.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head at me like I was retarded. Leaning forward she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. Actors don\u2019t just hide who they are, they manipulate people. They carefully construct a false facade and use emotions to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice alliteration,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>She smirked. Katie was always a poet and totally bent on making her point. \"People like that make you love them. They make you laugh. He\u2019s an expert at pulling emotional strings and he pulled all of yours. He did it knowing that a kiss meant something to you, and he stole one. He\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to think of that. It was true. Trystan could make anyone love him. He had that ability, which was why he was such a good actor. It was throwing me off, because the time I spent with him felt real. They weren\u2019t conflicting versions of Trystan, and I\u2019d seen how he acted around other guys and love-struck girls. He didn\u2019t change over the years. Actually, scratch that\u2014the first major change I\u2019d seen was that Trystan was in love. Descending the staircase and hearing him tell Seth that some girl had turned him inside out was the first change. The second was the revelation that he was Day Jones, and that he wrote a song that said he was in love.</p><p>Something changed Trystan, no, someone changed him\u2014that girl he loves\u2014she altered him.</p><p>The waiter put the plates of fries and milkshakes down in front of us. Sighing, I looked up at Katie. Sitting up straighter in the booth, I pushed my hair out of my face. I felt less fragile and more like I could handle this, and whatever else was thrown in my face tonight. \u201cThanks for meeting me here so fast.\u201d</p><p>She plucked a fry from the plate, swiped it through the whipped cream, and popped it in her mouth. \u201cSure, what are friends for?\u201d she grinned at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s so gross.\u201d My lip pulled up a little bit, as she swiped another fry through ketchup and then dipped it into her shake.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cCreative cuisine was never your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not cuisine. It\u2019s seeing how many things you can put on a fry before shoving it in your mouth.\u201d I reached for the pepper shaker and said, \u201cTry this and maybe some jelly next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwit,\u201d she laughed, and then added a heaping amount of pepper to her fry that was already covered in milkshake. This was why guys loved to watch her. She stuck anything in her mouth. I cringed, watching.</p> <p>Before I had a chance to unwrap my straw, the diner door swung open, and Seth walked in with a girl on his arm. My face must have shown my distain, because Katie turned and looked. She started to open her mouth to say something, but she was half-choking on pepper. Turning fast, she sloshed half a cup of water down her throat, before turning around and seeing Trystan and another girl follow Seth inside. The four of them stood, waiting to be seated, just inside the door.</p><p>Trystan had on his leather jacket. It looked so soft. It was the same one he wore every year once there was a chill in the air. There were tiny white lines in the leather, showing its age. It must have belonged to someone before him. The jacket didn\u2019t look new, but it sure made him look good. When he wore black, his gaze always seemed more intense, more vivid. More blue.</p><p>They didn\u2019t see us. Trystan had his hand on the small of the girl\u2019s back. She was pretty, all curves and hair, with big eyelashes with lots of make-up. She was the kind of girl who dated for fun.</p><p>I was her polar opposite. I was looking for love, which apparently was not fun.</p><p>Katie swung around before they saw her, \u201cHoly shit. Is he frickin\u2019 serious?\u201d She blinked at me like she couldn\u2019t believe it, and then glanced back at Trystan and Seth.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go,\u201d I said softly, feeling the rest of my heart shatter and fall into my shoes. \u201cI can\u2019t watch this.\u201d</p><p>Katie shook her head, \u201cNo. We\u2019re staying. Something\u2019s up with him.\u201d A waitress led them to a booth on the other side of the door. There was a long counter with silver stools with thick padded red seats between us, along with a scattering of booths. I was in their line of sight. As soon as they sat down, Trystan would see me.</p><p>When their backs were turned, Katie jumped up, \u201cQuick, switch sides with me.\u201d I did as she said, my heart racing way too fast. I clung to the table, slipping silently into the booth while she passed behind me. \u201cI\u2019ll watch them for a while and let you know what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly, wishing I were somewhere else. I didn\u2019t really feel like eating, but I picked at the fries and sipped the shake. I couldn\u2019t tell Katie about the other side of him, the Day Jones side that was hiding from fame. If that part didn\u2019t exist, I would have thrown him out of my life. But I couldn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t make sense. Katie thought he was a glory-hog, but that wasn\u2019t it. I didn\u2019t know what the truth was, but it hurt to watch, trying to figure it out.</p><p>Katie told me about Mathboy. They shared a phone call earlier and some texts. \u201cHe\u2019s so hot, Mari. Look what he said.\u201d</p><p>I took her phone and read the texts, as she beamed back at me. It appeared that he had quite the crush. \u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201cit was a good thing Brie pegged me in the head. Just think, if she hadn\u2019t done that, and you hadn\u2019t tried to protect me, you and Mathboy would have never connected.\u201d</p> <p>The corners of her mouth curved up. She cradled the phone in her hand, looking down at the messages. \u201cHe has a name you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I figured we\u2019d be calling him Mathboy until you guys got married. Then we\u2019d call him, Mathman. That\u2019d make you, Mrs. Mathman.\u201d I smiled at her, but was distracted. Her eyes kept flicking over my head, back to Trystan\u2019s table. After a little bit, I said, \u201cCan we leave now? He\u2019s on a date. You don\u2019t have to protect me. I know what\u2019s going to happen. He\u2019ll leave with her, they\u2019ll screw around, and I\u2019ll cry. I really don\u2019t want to know all the details, Katie.\u201d</p><p>Katie ignored me, her gaze still over the top of my head. \u201cTrystan isn\u2019t acting like himself. He\u2019s sitting next to her, but they aren\u2019t touching at all. Weird, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Okay, that was weird for him. Every time I was around him, it was like he found some excuse to touch me. I\u2019d seen him do it to other girls, too. Not touching was weird.</p><p>Katie continued, \u201cSexbot, on the other hand, has got some heavy hands for a public place.\u201d Her face scrunched up, \u201cGross. He\u2019s feeling her up and sucking her face off. Where does he find these girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoes-R-Us, aisle 4.\u201d I said deadpan, not really thinking about my words. There was no explaining, Seth. Katie snorted. I continued, \u201cHow someone could find him appealing, with that mouth, is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t stopped sucking his face\u2014to shut him up.\u201d</p><p>I laughed a little too loud. I smacked my hands over my mouth and grinned.</p> <p>Katie\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cHoly friggin\u2019 frack. Just sit there. Smile and laugh again.\u201d When I started to turn around she hissed at me, \u201cJust do it!\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what was going on, so I smiled uncertainly and laughed again. It was a weak haha that sounded totally fake. Katie stomped my foot and I made a strangled sound, as a grin spreads across my face. Then, I kicked her back, laughing louder, not realizing that someone was approaching behind me.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you,\u201d Trystan said, as he stopped in front of our table. His leather jacket was gone. The shirt he wore clung to his body and his scent filled my head. Trystan slipped his hands into the pockets of his jeans and looked from Katie to me.</p><p>Katie had a plastic smile on her face. She raised her eyebrows at me, but made no other indication that she thought this was unusual.</p><p>Every hair on the back of my neck stood on end when he spoke. My heart stopped. Don\u2019t turn, don\u2019t turn. If I look at him, I\u2019m toast, I thought to myself. I continued to smile at Katie, tilting my head back like I looked up at him, but I didn\u2019t. My glance grazed his shoulder, not his face.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I replied, sounding as normal as possible. When I glanced up, I didn\u2019t catch his expression until the memory of his face registered in my mind. The look in his eyes was soft, like he was fragile. God, I wanted to die. I couldn\u2019t take this.</p><p>As if Katie could read my mind, she blurted out, addressing Trystan, \u201cSo, double date with the boobie twins?\u201d</p><p>Trystan glanced back at his table. Running his hands through his hair, he sighed, \u201cYeah. Seth needed a wingman. Personally, I\u2019d rather be over here.\u201d</p><p>Katie had her foot on the bench next to me, keeping him from sitting down. She pulled her foot down, and said, \u201cThen sit, actor-boy, but don\u2019t steal Mari\u2019s cherry. It\u2019s kind of important to her,\u201d Katie smirked evilly at her innuendo, as she glanced at my bright red Marciano cherry, still sitting on top of my spoon. \u201cShe saves the best for last.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, I flushed head to toe and promptly kicked her in the shin.</p><p>Trystan grinned deeply, showing off a set of dimples that made me die. He slipped into the booth next to me, his shoulder brushing mine. God, he smelled good. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d He glanced at the cherry, and then looked at me. \u201cPlan on demonstrating any cool party tricks? Tying the stem in a knot?\u201d</p><p>I started to answer, but Katie cut me off, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s privileged information.\u201d</p><p>Trystan smirked at her. \u201cReally?\u201d He folded his arms across his chest and stared Katie down.</p><p>\u201cMmm. \u2018Fraid so.\u201d</p><p>Trystan turned to me, \u201cYou\u2019re a bottomless box of surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bottomless anything. Not around you,\u201d I said dryly. Katie had her straw in her mouth, sucking up some milkshake and promptly choked.</p><p>Trystan raised a single brow at me and smiled. Leaning in closer, he breathed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on it.\u201d</p><p>A tingle shot through my stomach. The way he looked at me, the way he said it, made my heart slap into the sides of my ribs so hard that I thought they\u2019d crack. I did everything humanly possible to not react to his words, to his charm\u2014because that\u2019s what it was, charm. Flirtation. There was nothing else there.</p><p>Holding my gaze for a moment, he smiled softly. Heat spread through my body and I couldn\u2019t look away. Trystan might as well have been holding my face in his hands. I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t think. The power he had over me scared me to death, especially, because he didn\u2019t seem to care. Every part of me reacted to him, was drawn to him. Trystan was beautiful\u2014like a wisp of flame\u2014and I knew trying to hold him would only get me burned, but I was mesmerized.</p><p>Trystan slipped out of the booth and stood, leaving me there with my jaw hanging open like an idiot. \u201cSee you around, Jennings.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go? The food\u2019s getting cold.\u201d Seth glanced around after Trystan excused himself, but he didn\u2019t see who he was talking to. The diner was full of the dinner crowd and he could barely make out the top of Trystan\u2019s head across the room.</p><p>\u201cNowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cJust thought I saw someone.\u201d</p><p>Seth groaned, \u201cOh, God. Seriously? You\u2019re on a fucking date.\u201d Exasperated, Seth dug his fingers into his scalp before letting out a huff of air.</p><p>The blonde next to Seth recoiled a little, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019d he do?\u201d She glanced around as she said it, and then looked back at Seth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Trystan said, ignoring his own date, who didn\u2019t seem to care one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Seth scolded, his gaze narrowing on Trystan.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Trystan hissed. \u201cDrop it.\u201d He slouched back into the booth and put his arm along the top of the seat, not touching his date.</p><p>\u201cI will when you stop acting like a lovesick dick. You can\u2019t live like that, man. She\u2019ll rip your goddamn heart out of your chest.\u201d</p><p>Trystan held his temper in check. That was one good thing about having a father like his\u2014he could hide his feelings so that no one had a clue. Trystan dropped his arm down onto his date\u2019s shoulders. Grinning at Seth, he said, \u201cNot planning on it. I\u2019ve got Beth here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy,\u201d the blonde corrected.</p><p>Trystan didn\u2019t bother correcting himself. \u201c\u2014and nothing is distracting me from her beautiful face.\u201d</p><p>Seth stared at him from across the table. A plate of half eaten food sat in front of him. The guy\u2019s arms were wide, made to hit stuff. Trystan could tell that he pissed Seth off by looking for Mari, but when he heard her laugh, he had to see her. Trystan did it without thinking and didn\u2019t plan on giving Seth, or anyone else, an explanation. Besides, he was gone less than five minutes. There was nothing to tell.</p><p>Seth\u2019s tongue moved over his teeth under his lips, as his jaw tensed. \u201cI thought you were into this,\u201d he hissed, pointing at the girl next to Trystan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d he insisted even though he wasn\u2019t. He pulled the girl closer. \u201cYou guys go do your thing. We\u2019ll do ours.\u201d</p><p>Seth watched him for a moment. Uncertainty clouded his eyes. Or maybe that was lust. Either way, Seth was frozen in place. He wanted to keep Trystan from doing something stupid, but the girl sitting next to him was a sure thing. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, Scott,\u201d he said and scooted out of the booth. Twin number one\u2014Bess\u2014followed. Bess and Seth threaded their fingers together. She leaned into him and threw her hip out, annoyed that Seth stopped again.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d Trystan urged. \u201cWe\u2019re fine. Right, Betsy?\u201d Trystan said, as he gently pushed a strand of golden hair away from her face. The girl giggled and nodded so furiously that Trystan thought her head might snap off. Turning back to Seth, he said, \u201cSee, we\u2019re fine. Go.\u201d</p> <p>Seth didn\u2019t need more encouragement. He took the check, paid, and left. It was the normal agreement. Trystan was fine being the wingman, if Seth paid the bill. He stretched and placed his arm over her shoulders again. This part was going to suck.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you want to do?\u201d she asked snuggling into his chest. Her fingers played with the collar of his shirt, slipping between the buttons.</p><p>Mari chose that second to appear at the door and looked over at them. His heart clenched tight, but he didn\u2019t move. Instead they stared at each other. She was a million miles away, someone he\u2019d never have. Katie\u2019s warning was clear enough, even if it did embarrass Mari\u2014keep away.</p><p>When his date\u2019s lips landed on his neck, Mari shot him a disgusted look and walked out. Trystan pulled his date off his throat, but Mari was already gone. Katie watched her friend walk out the door and looked back at Trystan. The way Katie looked at him made his balls jump up into his body. That girl would castrate him, if she could. He stared her down, refusing to look away.</p><p>Betsy, Beth, or whoever she was seemed impatient. She pulled on his shirt front and grabbed Trystan\u2019s face, pulling him to her for a kiss. Before the kiss connected, he saw Katie walk out. Betsy\u2019s lips pressed into his, but they were cold and lifeless. There was no passion there. It was a kiss without feeling. Trystan didn\u2019t want this, but Mari wasn\u2019t his. She never would be. He peeled Betsy off his mouth and they slipped out of the booth, walking out the door hand-in-hand.</p> <p>The rest of the night passed in a blur. After making out with Betsy, he walked her to her sister\u2019s car in front of Seth\u2019s house. She tried to talk Trystan into more, but he wasn\u2019t interested. It was like part of him died. Trystan didn\u2019t think a single girl could have such control over him, but if he couldn\u2019t have Mari, he didn\u2019t want anyone. And, to his horror, making-out with this girl didn\u2019t help him forget. If anything, it made the realization that he didn\u2019t have Mari more painful. Trystan didn\u2019t know what to do. Part of him wanted to give up and give in\u2014say yes to the beautiful woman in front of him\u2014but her kisses left him hollow and cold. He could only image what sleeping with her would feel like. He ran his hands through his hair and walked away.</p><p>Frustrated, Trystan walked home alone. Carefully, he cracked open the front door and glanced around for his dad. The lights were still on, the TV blaring. Trystan slipped around the door quietly and saw his father passed-out on the couch.</p><p>Relief flooded through him. While he wished his dad would just snap out it, he knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen. He wasn\u2019t a little kid anymore. This was his life. This was all there was. He stripped off his shirt as he walked back to his room, wishing he had his guitar. The weight on his chest felt like it was going to crush him.</p><p>Trystan closed his door and slid the new bolt shut before lying on his bed. He finally had time to think, time to rest.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>~MARI~</p> <p>I slumped against my bedroom door, tossing my book bag on the floor. Thoughts of Trystan filled my mind in an endless wave. It wasn\u2019t fair. Why\u2019d he have to show up with a girl on his arm? He didn\u2019t seem like he was that into her, but when Katie and I left, the girl was going all vampy on his neck and he didn\u2019t seem to mind. Actually, he seemed comfortable with it. If I ever did anything like that in a diner, I\u2019d die of embarrassment. The concept of a public-display-of-affection was foreign to me. I wanted my private life private, so what Trystan was doing with that girl, in front of everyone, made me feel sick.</p><p>That would never be me.</p><p>Before I had time to think another thought, someone pounded on my door. Pressing my eyes closed, I peeled my back off the door and opened it. Dad was home. That was his knock. I braced for whatever scolding I was about to receive. Pulling the door open, I said, \u201cHey, Dad. Home from work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said in a clipped tone, pushing past me into my room. He had that look on his face, the one that said I didn\u2019t measure-up, the one that made me feel like a failure. \u201cYou\u2019re progress report showed up today. Would you like to tell me anything before we discuss it?\u201d Dad had the piece of paper in his hand. The school sent weekly progress reports via email to psycho-parents, like mine, who demanded them. That was one of the changes my Mom made while she sat on the school board. Dad thought it was a great idea, while I found it to be less than stellar.</p><p>Dad\u2019s dark hair was silvering at the temples. Wrinkles sprouted from the corners of his eyes making him appear older than he was. Dad had seen too much, first in the military, and then in the hospital. To him, getting good grades was a life or death thing.</p><p>I pressed my shoe to the floor, staring at the black toe. I\u2019d loved these shoes when I\u2019d gotten them. They were so cute, but now they seemed frivolous. Dad probably thought so, too. I shook my head, \u201cNo, sir. There\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says here that you received detention this week? Mari, we\u2019ve talked about this. You cannot have such childish things on your permanent record. College is next year. It\u2019s not three years away. It\u2019s only one year away, and you can bet they\u2019ll look at this year and see this blemish.\u201d He became more stressed as he spoke, slapping the paper into his fist. When I didn\u2019t look up at him, he snapped, \u201cYou\u2019re destroying your future, Mari. It\u2019s not something that can be undone.\u201d</p><p>My mind broke. Maybe it was Trystan, I don\u2019t know, but I couldn\u2019t take the emotional berating he was giving me. The guilt he dumped on me sank into my stomach and sat like soured milk. It curdled and I spewed verbal vomit at him, ranting like a lunatic, \u201cIt\u2019s one detention, Dad! Out of how many days of school? Like seven hundred and twenty! One day doesn\u2019t matter! They won\u2019t even look at it.\u201d</p> <p>Dad laughed, but the sound was angry, \u201cYoung lady, so help me, I\u2019m going to get through to you.\u201d He leaned close to my face, speaking deliberately slow, like I was too stupid to fathom what he was saying, \u201cEverything you do, from now until graduation, matters\u2014every grade, every test, every day\u2014all of it. It\u2019s recorded and they\u2019ll see it. If you just blew your shot at Yale, so help me God, I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What will you do?\u201d Tears streamed from my eyes. I couldn\u2019t hold them back anymore. \u201cI made a mistake. It wasn\u2019t even something I did. Mom knew about it and she didn\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your mother doesn\u2019t know! Did she go to Yale? Did she attend an Ivy League school and have her parent\u2019s pay for medical school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He was still up in my face. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I did. I know what they expect and this little stunt might have just cost you everything.\u201d He sighed and shook his head, like he knew everything and I knew nothing. Closing his eyes he inhaled hard and let it rush back out. \u201cI only want what\u2019s best for you, Mari.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. I wanted to believe him, but I didn\u2019t. I felt like a trophy child, someone he had around to show off. It felt like it was more important that his daughter was smart, that his daughter was perfect\u2014but, I was his daughter and I was neither of those things. I worked hard to get my grades, and I tried so hard to meet his expectations, but I failed. Over and over again, I fell short. I didn\u2019t measure up. That feeling never faded. It\u2019s there every day when I got a test back.</p><p>School was not for learning, not to Dad. School was to demonstrate how smart I already was, but I wasn\u2019t. And I wasn\u2019t him\u2014he just didn\u2019t see it.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cI know, Dad.\u201d There was nothing else to say. He couldn\u2019t see me. It\u2019s like I was nothing more than that paper he held in his hands. That one blemish blinded him to all the A\u2019s. I knew it was coming. I knew he\u2019d react this way. He always did, but today I couldn\u2019t just nod and take it. Tears streaked my face, and I knew he saw that as a sign of weakness.</p><p>He lifted my chin in his hand, and looked me in the eye, \u201cOnly the cream rises to the top, Mari. You\u2019re mother and I know you\u2019re cream. Don\u2019t disappoint us again.\u201d His grip felt cold and distant, his gaze was even more so. I swallowed hard and nodded. He released me and said, \u201cGet in a little studying before bed.\u201d With that, he turned on his heel and left.</p><p>Every inch of me wanted to scream, but I couldn\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t know how trapped they made me feel, how smothered I was. I pushed the door shut and went to the computer not thinking about what I was doing. Before I knew it, I was on the Day Jones page and clicking play on his song, letting Trystan\u2019s voice fill my head. I laid down on my bed, clutching the pillow, crying into it, as the song played softly and drowned out my sobs.</p><p>There were so many things that I wanted to say to my parents, but I couldn\u2019t. They both worked non-stop trying to give me everything they never had. They acted like I was an adult with some things and a child with other things. I just wished they\u2019d see Mari, their daughter. I wished they saw how much I liked art and how much I didn\u2019t want to dedicate my life to something I wasn\u2019t passionate about. It left me, their only child, alone. From the time I turned twelve, I\u2019d spent more days alone than with them. Last year, their work schedules lined up and they were pleased. It meant they\u2019d get more time together, but it also meant I saw them less. They worked four days on, three days off. For the days they were gone, I was on my own, and they were proud they had such a self-sufficient child.</p><p>Tears chilled my face, as they sank into my pillow. I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. For once, I wished I wasn\u2019t me, that I didn\u2019t feel the way I felt about everything. I wished I could just hook up with a random guy and not hand over a piece of my heart. It would help me forget the things that I tried so hard not to remember. No matter what happened, in a year, I knew if I didn\u2019t fight for my life, I\u2019d be stuck on this path forever, living the life my father wanted\u2014not the one I wanted.</p><p>Pushing off the bed, I looked at the screen. More comments, more pleas for Day to play another song, reveal his name, post a pic, anything\u2014and they all went unanswered.</p><p>Emotional insanity compelled me to do it. Staring at the screen, I typed in one word at a time. I watched as my fingers wrote something I would never say, something I never tried before. I wanted to know if it helped take away the sting, if that was why he did it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO SLEEP WITH SOMEONE YOU DON\u2019T LOVE?</p><p>My hands hovered over the keyboard. I hesitated to post it. Trystan would know it was me. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t, and since he didn\u2019t answer anyone, what was the point? But I wanted to know. Maybe his way of dealing with life was better. Maybe a random hookup didn\u2019t leave everyone feeling hollow inside. Maybe that was just me and I could get over it.</p><p>My pointer finger smacked the enter button hard. The key clicked and the message posted.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p> <p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>By the time Trystan was safe in his room, it was late. Out of habit, he grabbed the old laptop and turned it on. The machine made a hissing noise, followed by something that sounded like Cookie Monster munching gravel. It came from inside his hard drive, and Trystan knew the laptop wouldn\u2019t last much longer, but the machine finally turned on. The screen flared to life and he checked his Facebook page, stopping by Mari\u2019s page to look at her picture for a second, and then moving onto the Day Jones\u2019 YouTube page. Although he vowed to stay away from it, he couldn\u2019t. It was too insane how quickly it\u2019d grown, how many people liked the song.</p><p>He didn\u2019t read every post. Instead he read a handful of new comments. One post that was in bold type caught his eye. The rest of the comments were of the same vein, but this one was different. His heart clenched when he read it. It had to be Mari. It had to be. There was no way to know for certain, but he could feel it tugging on his gut like a guitar string. The girl who wanted every kiss to have profound meaning was asking for pointers on sleeping around? That didn\u2019t make sense. It pained him, cutting through his core, like he\u2019d been cleaved in half. Trystan\u2019s breath was ragged, as he stared at the screen.</p><p>Answer her.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s fingers twitched, dying to respond. He wasn\u2019t sure if she was scolding him or asking him how to get started. A sick feeling crept up from his gut and lodged itself in his throat. He swallowed hard, trying to force it down, but it wouldn\u2019t go away. Every part of him said that this was Mari, this was her question.</p> <p>Trystan\u2019s fingers tapped out a response on the keyboard. Carefully constructing his reply, he crafted each word so she\u2019d know. His answer was plain and simple. There were no excuses or pleas, just the naked truth. Trystan\u2019s finger hovered above the button. He wanted to click, he wanted to post the reply, but it was so risky. There were ways to track things back to him. He knew that, and with the number of people trying to find him, Trystan couldn\u2019t click.</p><p>He deleted his post and closed the laptop, knowing that he had to wait until tomorrow. He\u2019d ask her when he showed her what he was working on. The thought made him feel better. Lying back on his bed, Trystan pictured her face as he sang. The memory was burned into his brain and he loved it. Closing his eyes, he could see her face, her brown eyes filled with curious flecks of gold surrounded by a cascade of curls that were soft as silk.</p><p>Trystan closed his eyes and for once, fell asleep with a smile on his lips.</p><p>Trystan heard his dad moving around when he was finishing up in the shower. Damn it. He\u2019d taken too long. Toweling off fast, Trystan pulled on a pair of tattered jeans and a tee shirt. His clothing had seen better days. He hid it by layering his shirts with a flannel or button down shirt. He let the front hang open, which still gave him that neatly messy look.</p><p>Before he could reach the door, his father\u2019s voice rang in his ears, \u201cI\u2019ve got tickets to the hockey game this weekend. I thought me and you could go.\u201d His voice sounded softer than usual. Trystan turned slowly, carefully, and looked his old man over. \u201cIt\u2019d be like old times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat old times were those?\u201d he asked, knowing he shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Trystan\u2019s dad looked down and sighed. He was wearing a gray suit with a jewel-toned blue tie. It brought out his eyes. Damn, they looked alike. It made Trystan\u2019s skin crawl to think he was turning into his dad. He wanted nothing to do with him. Starting a new life somewhere else was a dream. He thought about it day and night. The only think holding him here was Mari. How many times had Trystan wanted to run? How many times did he nearly walk away and leave everything? Too many, he thought bitterly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. I do the best I can. This was something I could do. Give me another chance, kid. I promise you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour promises don\u2019t mean much. Not anymore. I\u2019m not the little kid who used to wait for your approval. I gave up on you a long time ago. There\u2019s no point in pretending... not anymore. As soon as I graduate, I\u2019m gone and I\u2019m never coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrystan... ,\u201d Dad said, stepping toward him. It was hard to look his father over, hard to see how normal he seemed in the light of day. Wearing that suit, smiling that smile, he could be any nice guy, but Trystan knew better. He was the jaded drunk who\u2019d hit him faster than he could blink.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dad. There\u2019s no need to pretend anymore.\u201d</p><p>His father look genuinely confused, \u201cPretend what?\u201d</p><p>Trystan was so disgusted that he couldn\u2019t even say it. Pretend you care about me\u2014pretend you love me. Instead, he closed his eyes and shook his head. Trystan turned on his heel and left without another word.</p><p>By the time Trystan got to school, he was late. He sat down in homeroom, but Tucker didn\u2019t say anything. No commentary on his tardy, no threat to dock his grade.</p> <p>When the bell rang at the end of class, Tucker stopped him, \u201cMr. Scott.\u201d</p><p>Trystan stopped. He stared straight ahead, not wanting to look at the man. It was like Tucker had radar for screwed-up students, and he was sniffing out what was wrong with Trystan. The thought made his skin grow cold and clammy. No one could know that part of his life. Ever. And Tucker was getting way too close to the truth.</p><p>Tucker waited for the other students to pass, \u201cWant to tell me why you were late today?\u201d</p><p>Trystan shrugged, \u201cHad better things to do.\u201d</p><p>Tucker hmmmfed, but didn\u2019t say anything else about it. Instead, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll check on you and Mari later today. You\u2019re a good kid, Scott, but you need to be careful. You\u2019re walking the line and it\u2019s too damn thin\u2014too easy to fall on the wrong side.\u201d</p><p>Trystan\u2019s gaze lifted and met Tucker\u2019s. He wanted to say, You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2014you haven\u2019t lived my life, but he was silent. Trystan nodded once and walked out, leaving Tucker watching his back as the room filled with the next class.</p><p>Trystan sat through his classes, not paying attention to anything. The lump in his throat didn\u2019t abate last night. It didn\u2019t fade while he slept. His concern over Mari\u2019s question twisted into worry. What if she was really asking? What if she intended to sleep with someone she didn\u2019t care about? What could he do about it?</p><p>Nothing, he thought, gripping his pencil so hard that it snapped. The crack was audible. Trystan ignored the looks of his classmates, including Seth who sat shaking his head next to him.</p><p>After the bell rang, Seth walked out next to him, \u201cThought you would have hit that last night, but obviously you didn\u2019t. What happened to promising to stay away from her?\u201d he said referring to Mari. \u201cDo your promises mean nothing?\u201d there was a joking quality to his voice, but it hit way too close to home for Trystan.</p><p>Trystan rounded on his friend, shoving Seth\u2019s shoulders hard. Surprised by the sudden hostility, Seth flew back into the lockers, tripping several students in the process. When his back slammed against the metal doors, Seth\u2019s face pinched with anger, \u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d Seth stood and walked back toward Trystan, shoving him back. Trystan tried to keep walking, but Seth wouldn\u2019t shut up, \u201cShe\u2019s nothing but a bitch,\u201d he enunciated the word, spitting it at his friend\u2019s back, \u201ca tease,\u201d he said it slowly, but Trystan still didn\u2019t turn. Seth\u2019s anger got the best of him and he added, \u201cA little cun\u2014\u201d but before Seth could finish speaking, Trystan was on him.</p><p>The word made him snap. No one could call Mari that. Trystan threw his books to the floor and charged Seth, ramming his shoulder into Seth\u2019s stomach. The two slammed into a group of lockers. Trystan\u2019s fists punched into Seth\u2019s sides, one after the other. Seth screamed at him, returning every punch, but Trystan was a better fighter. After years of beatings, he knew how to take a hit. His body moved, taking Seth\u2019s shots in less vulnerable places or moving out of the way, so Seth\u2019s fists missed Trystan entirely.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for a group of kids to circle around them. They chanted fight, fight, fight.</p><p>Trystan thought that was stupid, standing around them in a circle and cheering them on to fight. What do they think we were doing? Dancing? Just as the thought entered his mind, Seth\u2019s fist connected with his stomach. Trystan folded in half and rammed Seth with his shoulder. Neither of them could breathe. Blood dripped down Trystan\u2019s lip and he wondered if it was his.</p><p>Before anything else could happen, Tucker stepped between them, yanking them apart. \u201cGet to class!\u201d Tucker yelled at the crowd. The kids groaned, slowly walking away when they realized there was nothing else to see. Tucker glanced at Trystan with a look of exasperation on his face, \u201cGet to where you\u2019re going, Scott. Seth, my room. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just gonna let Trystan walk?\u201d Seth argued, following after Tucker but looking over at Trystan with malice. His broad shoulders were tense, the muscles in his arms still taut and ready to punch something. This wasn\u2019t over. That much Trystan knew.</p><p>Tucker didn\u2019t look back. He walked at a pace that was fast for him, forcing Seth to keep up and release some that anger burning in his body. He snapped over his shoulder, \u201cScott\u2019s already taken care of; you on the other hand need some guidance. Not another word or I hand this mess over to the principle and you both get suspended. Rumor has it that one more suspension gets you expelled.\u201d Seth groaned dramatically and trailed behind Tucker and out of sight.</p><p>Trystan headed straight for the stage, rage still flowing through his muscles. He couldn\u2019t control himself. He\u2019d never hit Seth like that before. They\u2019d rough-housed, wrestled and that kind of thing, but this was a fight. Trystan threw punches not caring where they landed, as long as they did some harm. He couldn\u2019t process what was happening. Up until then, Seth had been his best friend. The guy always had his back, but this was insane. It was like he was forbidding Trystan to be with Mari, like Seth would make him choose between them.</p><p>What kind of friend would do that? Maybe he missed something. Maybe it wasn\u2019t what it looked like, because it looked an awful lot like jealousy\u2014but that didn\u2019t make any sense. Seth didn\u2019t like Mari. Trystan\u2019s arms were still tense. His fingers clenched over and over again trying to work it out, as he bounded up the stage stairs and walked behind the wing. It was dark, as usual. He made his way to the basement door and pulled it open.</p><p>Descending swiftly, Trystan stopped at the bottom to see Mari with her legs hanging over the end of the couch and her dark hair fanned around her beautiful face. The little white tee shirt she wore clung to her body. He watched her chest rise slowly, as she drew in a breath. Mari\u2019s eyes were closed like she was daydreaming, thinking about something wonderful. The way her pink lips pulled up slightly at the corners gave her a ghost of a smile. Her foot swung and he was treated to a full smile, though he didn\u2019t know the cause. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mari\u2019s eyes opened, and she saw him standing across the room. \u201cOh,\u201d she said startled. Her hands slipped to her sides like she was going to push herself up.</p><p>Trystan crossed the room quickly, before she could sit up. Grinning down at her, he asked, \u201cHanging upside down off the end of the couch, are we?\u201d</p><p>Mari smirked, \u201cMaybe.\u201d Trystan laughed and it was contagious. Mari\u2019s soft laugh filled his body and warmed him, chasing away the rest of the animosity he felt toward Seth. \u201cDefinitely. I wanted to see if my hair could touch the floor if I leaned over the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, \u201cYup.\u201d Mari\u2019s eyes were focused on his mouth. Trystan squirmed a little wondering why she was looking at him like that. \u201cWhat happened to you? There\u2019s blood on your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Trystan straightened and tried to dab it away. \u201cNothing. Seth and I don\u2019t see eye to eye on something. It didn\u2019t end well.\u201d</p><p>Mari slipped off the couch and stood up in front of him. She licked the back of her thumb and ran it over his mouth, removing the rest of the dried blood, before wiping her hands on her jeans. The touch was light, gentle. Trystan\u2019s stomach felt like it was floating. How she could do that, how she could reach out and touch him without thinking twice was... he didn\u2019t know what it was. The nurse wore gloves when blood was involved, but Mari didn\u2019t seem to think Trystan was anything to be worried about. She trusted him in a way that surprised him.</p><p>Mari looked down and when she met his eyes again, Trystan asked her softly, \u201cWhat does it feel like to sleep with someone you don\u2019t love?\u201d Her eyes widened and she looked up at him. Her lips parted like she wanted to say something, but her jaw just hung there suspended. Trystan became serious, all traces of humor stripped away by the question, \u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d Do you already have someone picked out? Did you give up on your dreams? Was I the one that pushed you to do it? He stared down at her, hating himself. Breathing hard, heart fluttering, he watched her. Her brown eyes didn\u2019t stray from his.</p><p>She didn\u2019t apologize, she didn\u2019t explain. She just stood there, watching him breathe like everything was normal. After a moment, Mari smiled sheepishly. \u201cYou knew that was me. I figured you would.\u201d She looked down at her fingers, as they twisted in her hands.</p> <p>He stepped closer to her, \u201cOf course I would. And I knew what you meant, too. I just couldn\u2019t write it there. Too many people are watching, looking for me.\u201d He wrapped his fingers around hers as he spoke, suspending the nervous wringing of her hands.</p><p>Mari didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cSo, what\u2019s it like?\u201d She sounded curious and it killed him. It killed him that she asked\u2014that she wanted him to tell her it was good. He could hear the hope in her voice.</p><p>Trystan watched her dark, rich eyes. There was a hint of something in her voice, like she\u2019d given up on her ideal. Guilt gnawed at him, like he was the one who pushed her to it. What was he supposed to say? That sleeping around helped him forget about his life? That he used it to hide from reality for a while. In those moments, it felt like time was suspended, like there was nothing to fear\u2014like he could survive the lot he\u2019d been given. But now, seeing the look on Mari\u2019s face, he couldn\u2019t say that.</p><p>Sleeping with her would be different. He lowered his lashes, and glanced at her hands. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he finally said, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it, not compared to what you could have.\u201d His thumb stroked the smooth skin on the back of her wrist. His heart pounded harder. It felt like a confession, like everything he\u2019d done until now was wrong\u2014like he knew his salvation was standing in front of him.</p><p>\u201cCompared to what I could have?\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that, Mr. Scott?\u201d One of her dark brows lifted. It made her look jaded and he didn\u2019t like it. Cynical was something Mari was not. There\u2019d been a pureness that attracted him to her. The way she lived her life with her whole heart was brave. She put herself out there and was willing to take chances that he never took. That demanded admiration, even if she didn\u2019t realize it. Now, it seemed like she was thinking about chipping that away. The thought killed him.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d Trystan\u2019s voice was deep and determined. \u201cIt makes everything else seem trite.\u201d He looked down, unable to meet her gaze.</p> <p>\u201cYou sound like a little hypocritical, there Trystan. There can\u2019t be one set of rules for you and another set for me.\u201d She sucked in air and added, \u201cI saw you leave with her last night. Ten bucks says you didn\u2019t even bother to get her name.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Trystan ran hands through his hair, his heart sinking into his shoes, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t know her name. And the truth is, I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do until the moment came.\u201d It was a confession that he didn\u2019t plan to give, but if fell from his lips like drops of rain.</p><p>Mari\u2019s hands fell to her sides, her gaze locked on Trystan\u2019s face. \u201cOh, and what\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook her home. Said goodnight.\u201d He glanced up at her from under his brow, \u201cShe\u2019s not the one I want.\u201d His eyes connected with hers and held. There were so many things he wanted to say. Trystan\u2019s body felt light and lithe. In that moment he wanted nothing more than to lift his hand and feel Mari\u2019s soft skin under his fingers, and taste her lips. The longing in his gaze made him feel exposed. He wanted her to see it. He wanted her to know she was the one.</p><p>But for whatever reason, Mari was blind\u2014or worse\u2014she didn\u2019t care. Mari looked away and nodded, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Trystan smiled softly, whispering, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t\u2014but I wish you would.\u201d Glancing at her, Trystan\u2019s heart beat wildly in his chest. Every urge he had was wrong. He wanted to wrap his arms around her, pull her to him, and kiss her with all his might. The way her eyes darted away, the way her lips parted like she was disappointed, killed him. Part of him wanted to tell her\u2014no, to show her, how he felt\u2014but his mind kept telling him not to. There was only one chance for him to get this right, and now was not the time.</p><p>Before he could say anything else, Mari smiled weakly and leaned forward, her beautiful face coming closer to his until her lips met his cheek. Her soft lips brushed his face, pressing against his cool skin before retreating.</p><p>Shocked, Trystan stared after her, unable to speak. Bewildered, he finally managed to ask, \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p> <p>Mari shrugged, and looked up at him out of the corner of her eye, with a grin on her lips, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re the only one who can steal a kiss?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>My heart was pounding in my chest, beating harder than I\u2019d ever felt it as I leaned toward Trystan\u2019s face. It wasn\u2019t a conscious plan. I didn\u2019t think, hey, let\u2019s kiss Trystan on the cheek and then grin like an idiot. Instead, I found my body moving without my consent. I was so happy he didn\u2019t sleep with her. I was so glad that it flooded my body like liquid sunshine coursing through my veins. Before I could stop myself, I felt my lips brush his cheek. Wildly fighting every urge within me, I made sure it was just a peck. I made sure I didn\u2019t take his gorgeous face in my palms and pull his lips to mine. Breathing steadily, I looked up at him when I stepped away, trying to ignore the jitters that were making me giddy.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s voice was airy and filled with shock, \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>The perplexed look on his face made me say it. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, looking at him from the corner of my eyes. I could feel the smile spreading across my lips and I couldn\u2019t hide it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can steal a kiss?\u201d</p><p>Trystan blinked like he didn\u2019t hear me right. It was a moment that I\u2019d play over in my mind again and again. Everything about it was perfect. That look, that baffled look on his face, made me want to dance. Unable to hide my giddiness, I swallowed a giggle, but it sounded like a sultry laugh instead.</p><p>Trystan tilted his head to the side, eyes wide, like he didn\u2019t know what came over me. Before I could say anything, he stepped behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist. The vixen, that seemed to possess me moments ago, fled when Trystan\u2019s fingers started tickling my sides.</p><p>His lips were next to my ear. I could feel his breath wash over my neck as he teased, \u201cKiss stealer.\u201d</p><p>I laughed hysterically, my knees buckling from under me. Trystan scooped me up in his arms and tossed me in the air. I shrieked as I fell straight down onto the couch. Before I could breath, Trystan pinned me by sitting on my legs and continued to tickle me.</p><p>\u201cKiss ninja,\u201d I laughed, trying to get my fingers to wiggle in a ticklish spot on Trystan\u2019s lean body.</p><p>\u201cKiss ninja?\u201d he laughed, moving his hands over my sides, applying the perfect amount of pressure to make me laugh the hardest.</p><p>Between hysterical giggles I managed, \u201cYeah, because you sneak up all stealthy like a ninja.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss thief,\u201d he said smiling, his fingers moving between my belly and my underarms. Laughter made me shake so hard I couldn\u2019t stop. The glimpses I got of Trystan were filled with pure joy. His eyes sparkled, brilliant blue as he laughed.</p><p>\u201cKiss cowboy,\u201d I blurted out. That one made him chuckle really hard.</p><p>\u201cKiss bandit.\u201d</p><p>Right then his hands were on both sides of my waist, applying enough pressure to make me squealing with laughter. \u201cKiss assassin! You\u2019re killing me! Stop!\u201d I laughed, certain I was going to explode in a ball of giggles. As we wrestled on the couch, Trystan leaned into me. From trying to pull away my hair was covering my face, several curls stuck to my lips.</p><p>Panting hard, he stilled and brushed the hair out of my face. \u201cA kiss assassin sounds kind of sexy. I\u2019d like to see one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab a mirror, because I\u2019m totally looking at one. He has bright blue eyes, a killer smile, and he\u2019s a closet musician.\u201d A wicked grin spread across my lips. \u201cAll the kiss assassins are\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before I could say anything else, his fingers tickled me again. This time when I stopped laughing, something changed. I was more aware that here he was, how he was laying with half of his body on top of mine, on the couch\u2014the nearness of his mouth and his breath on my face.</p><p>Trystan looked down at me, still smiling softly. My heart hammered in my chest, but this time it wasn\u2019t from tickles or silly words. His gaze pinned me in place, those sapphire eyes stole my breath and my brains in one look. They swept over my face, moving slowly from my eyes to my lips, and back again. Trystan\u2019s mouth parted like he was going to say something, but he didn\u2019t. He froze like that, watching me beneath him with an unreadable expression on his face. Just when I thought my heart couldn\u2019t take another shock, the door above us banged open.</p><p>Tucker\u2019s voice bellowed down the stairs, \u201cScott, get up here. Now!\u201d</p><p>As soon as we heard the door open, we shot apart. Trystan pushed himself upright, and stood as I rolled to my side and patted my hair, trying to make it look normal and not like we\u2019d been doing something naughty. I glanced over at him. Trystan didn\u2019t meet my eyes. Instead, he shoved his hands in his pockets and walked away. Before he got to the stairs, he looked over his shoulder. \u201cLater, kiss thief.\u201d He treated me to a dimpled grin and I nearly died. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ignoring the fact that my heart was half way up my throat, I slumped back into the couch nodding and said, \u201cYou know it, ninja.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>~TRYSTAN~</p><p>\u201cWhat are you plans after high school, Scott?\u201d Tucker asked him pointe-blank. Irritation made Tucker\u2019s face a reddish, blotchy color. He stood with his arms folded, eyes narrowed, waiting for an answer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m enlisting,\u201d Trystan replied. He didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to do that when you\u2019re arrested for assault?\u201d</p><p>Trystan blanched. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eighteen, Trystan. For chrissakes, use your head. You\u2019re not a child anymore. When you hit someone, it\u2019s assault. You should know this by now.\u201d Tucker used little restraint when talking to him. Trystan didn\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t dumped in the principal\u2019s office, why Tucker seemed to be watching out for him, but it seemed like he was.</p><p>Before another thought came into Trystan\u2019s head, he blurted out, \u201cSeth\u2019s filing charges?\u201d Worry and shock pinched the spot between his brows.</p> <p>Tucker sighed and his arms fell to his sides. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take to get through to you? This isn\u2019t a game. You get one shot at life and if you screw it up now\u2014\u201d he trailed off, not completing the thought. He let it linger there, allowing Trystan to fill in the blank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing games, Mr. Tucker.\u201d Trystan looked away. The anger he had toward Seth was still simmering below the surface.</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell is going on with you? Seth\u2019s your best friend. What did he do that made you react like that?\u201d</p><p>Trystan stared at the floor. A quick shake of his head was the only answer he could manage.</p><p>Tucker\u2019s stance shifted. They were standing in front of the stage. The only light in the room came from the recessed lights that hung above the exit doors. It cast a faint yellow glow across the stage, illuminating the place where they stood.</p><p>Tucker took Trystan\u2019s shoulder in his hand, \u201cI can\u2019t keep you out of trouble forever. I want you to have a shot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Trystan blurted out. He sounded bitter, jaded. It was like he couldn\u2019t believe Tucker\u2019s words. He felt his face pinch when he said it, and it didn\u2019t matter how hard Trystan tried, he couldn\u2019t hide it. He couldn\u2019t believe that someone would look out for him.</p><p>Tucker dropped his hand. He blinked once, slowly, his forehead pinching together forming rows of wrinkles that made him look much older than he was. He sounded remorseful when he spoke, \u201cSomeone told you wrong, Trystan. They lied to you.\u201d He shook his head sadly, as he said it and then turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Trystan said to his back. Turning, Trystan watched Tucker as he walked away up the dark aisle toward the exit at the back of the auditorium.</p><p>When he reached the door, Tucker turned back to Trystan and said, \u201cYou\u2019re worth something, Scott, your life is valuable. Right now, you have a chance to escape whatever you\u2019re running from, but if things keep up like this, you\u2019re going to blast your only escape route straight to hell.\u201d With that, he disappeared through the door leaving Trystan alone.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>~MARI~</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to overhear what I heard, but when Trystan\u2019s voice echoed from the other side of the stage curtain, I stopped. I was no longer interested in exiting the stage door in front of me. Instead, I lingered, listening.</p><p>Did he say he was enlisting? My throat tightened. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I had no idea what Trystan planned after school. I assumed he would go to college, but now that I thought about it, I hadn\u2019t heard him mention applications and admission interviews. It felt like someone was crushing my heart. Frozen, I stood behind the curtain and heard everything.</p> <p>Tucker\u2019s warnings rang in my ears. I peered through the stage curtain to see Trystan sitting in the first row with his face in his hands after Tucker left the auditorium. Trystan leaned forward so that I couldn\u2019t see his eyes. The light spilled onto the curve of his back before it mixed with shadow. Dark hair hung forward, blocking his face.</p><p>Paralyzed by fear, I stood there staring at him. If he enlisted, I\u2019d never see him again. The thought made me shiver. Sickness crept up my throat and soured in my mouth. There were only a few months of school left. Then, he\u2019d be gone.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t think. I didn\u2019t think. I walked down the stairs, quietly making my way straight toward him. I didn\u2019t care if he loved someone else. I had to tell him. I had to say it before he left or I\u2019d regret it for the rest of my life.</p><p>Trystan lifted his head when he saw me descending the stairs. His eyes seem hollow, like he was weary and broken. He didn\u2019t speak. That dark brooding gaze followed my movements. There was a hardness to his gaze that usually vaporized around me, but this time it remained in place. I knew that he\u2019d be angry that I heard. Trystan never told me he was running from anything, but Tucker seemed to have figured it out. Trystan looked like he\u2019d been sucker-punched with the truth. Knowing that I was standing there, knowing that I\u2019d seen it happen, made it worse. His eyes said it all.</p><p>Heart pounding harder, I reached the lower landing and stepped onto the floor. I didn\u2019t know what to do, what to say, so I didn\u2019t say anything. There were no words to comfort, no words to explain how I felt or what I wanted. Walking toward him with my shoulders back, my long hair swayed gently with each step. Trystan gazed at me with a desperate look in his eye, like he was drowning and I wasn\u2019t welcome to watch.</p><p>When I was two steps in front of him, Trystan abruptly looked away. He pushed out of his seat, making us stand nose to nose. \u201cMari, I don\u2019t think now is a good time\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t stop moving toward him. I didn\u2019t answer him. I didn\u2019t speak. Pulse pounding in my ears, I lifted my hands and curled my fingers in his shirtfront. Surprised flashed across his eyes, as I pulled his face to mine. I yanked his shirt hard, pulling him closer to me, fast. His lips pressed into mine and I kissed him.</p><p>I kissed Trystan Scott. And it was a real kiss. I didn\u2019t hold back and I wouldn\u2019t apologize for it later.</p><p>My lips moved against his and this kiss was my doing, not his. His hands lifted and tangled in my hair. I flicked my tongue against his lips until he parted them, and let me deepen the kiss. His arms tightened around me, embracing me harder. Breathless, I kissed him more, feeling every curve of his mouth and tasting every inch of his soft lips. My hands released his shirt and tangled in his silky hair. I didn\u2019t want it to end. The moment was perfect. The kiss was perfect and I knew without a doubt it was my kiss, that it was real, and that I meant every bit of it.</p><p>When we parted he looked at me with that soft smile on his face. Breathing hard, he said, \u201cYou have to stop doing that, thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop letting me,\u201d I replied, smiling back at him. My fingers pushed through his hair and then fell to rest on his shoulders. He closed his eyes, feeling my touch, enjoying the sensation.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, Trystan was more breathless than before. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Icy fear crawled out of my stomach and up my throat. He wanted to tell me that he was in love with someone else. If he said it, I\u2019d die. There was no way I could handle it, and once I knew the name, it would be impossible to kiss him and not feel guilty. I could barely speak, but I managed to shake my head, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need to know. I like things like this. I\u2019m okay with things like this...\u201d</p><p>Trystan was quiet for a moment. He reached for me, running his fingers through my hair. When he spoke, his voice was barely a whisper, \u201cYou deserve more...\u201d</p><p>My heart was in my throat, ready to crawl out of my mouth. The words, I love you, were on my tongue. I was going to say it, but the way he looked at me, rendered me speechless.</p><p>Trystan\u2019s breath warmed my cheek. He was that close, his body against mine. When he pressed his lips to my face, I couldn\u2019t speak. My breath caught in my throat as Trystan slowly bestowed one kiss after another across my cheek. I closed my eyes, and enjoyed every second of it. Every bit of me felt light and happy.</p><p>When Trystan pulled back again, I couldn\u2019t hide my grin. \u201cAssassin,\u201d I breathed into his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me. You know that?\u201d The warm playful tones in my voice let him know how much I liked it.</p><p>Trystan pulled back enough to see my face, his smile widening as he did so. \u201cI could say the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are we going to do about it?\u201d This confidence, this insane person who was speaking wasn\u2019t me. She was blurting things out that I never had the guts to say. But he\u2019s leaving, a voice in the back of my mind whispered. You don\u2019t have another year. You barely have another semester. He\u2019ll be gone after graduation. Take a risk, give a kiss. See what happens. I listened to that voice for once, finding resolve that was foreign to me.</p><p>Trystan released me and stepped back. Before I could ask what he was doing, he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and showed it to me. \u201cI wanted to tell you this for so long, but\u2014\u201d his voice trailed off.</p><p>I took the wrinkled sheet from his hands, my eyes scanning the page like it could devastate me. It was the song\u2014the Day Jones song about the girl. My stomach clenched, as I tried to shove it back into his hands. Shaking, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to know who she is. Having you like this is better than nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly at me, but shook his head. \u201cNot until you read the last line on the page. Flip it over, Mari.\u201d Trystan watched me, his eyes burning into mine.</p><p>My stomach acted like it was in a free-fall. I looked down at the page in my hands and flipped the paper over. It felt like time stopped. The rapid beat of my heart filled my ears. I could feel Trystan\u2019s gaze on my face, as my eyes trailed down the page looking for the last line. There were two lines of words filling the space were only one line belonged. It was an alternate ending, an ending that showed a name.</p><p>My skin prickled as I read it. I didn\u2019t understand. I looked up at him and couldn\u2019t stop shaking. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe original ending\u2014the real last line where I tell the girl I love her and call her by name.\u201d My chest swelled as my throat tightened. I shook so hard that I dropped the song, and tried to step away. Trystan didn\u2019t chase after the sheet with his music and words. Instead he chased after me. His hands slipped around my waist and he pulled me to him.</p><p>Looking down at me, he said, \u201cThe girl who inspired that song, the girl who stole my heart\u2014she\u2019s standing right in front of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
