She paced her office, repeatedly circling her high-gloss black-lacquer-and-brass desk. She felt so helpless. She should\u2019ve gone to Citizenship and Immigration Services with Jerry rather than wait for their decision.</p> <p>Rubbing her palms together, she retracted the thought. She was a wreck and the Immigration people would have instantly picked up on that and it could hurt their case. She couldn\u2019t help being anxious. The future of the company rested on the outcome of today\u2019s hearing. Ultimately she was the one responsible for the welfare of Conrad Industries, the business her grandfather had started thirty years earlier.</p><p>In an effort to calm herself she stared out the window. The weather seemed to echo her mood. There was a ceiling of black clouds, thunder roared and a flash of lightning briefly brightened the room. The lights flickered.</p><p>Julia\u2019s reflection was mirrored in the window and she frowned, mesmerized by the unexpected sight of herself. Her dark hair was swept back from her face and secured with a gold clasp. She wore a dark suit with a pale gray blouse, which\u2014in her view, anyway\u2014conveyed tasteful refinement. She looked cool, calm and collected, but inside she was a mass of tension and nerves. At thirty she had a pleasant face when she smiled, but she hadn\u2019t been doing much of that lately. Not in the past three years. Her cheekbones were high, her jaw strong, but it was her eyes that told the story. Her eyes revealed vulnerability and pain.</p><p>The image of herself distressed Julia and she hurriedly glanced away. Sighing, she circled her desk once more, silently praying for patience. She was determined to get the company back on its feet, to overcome the odds they faced. Jerry, her brother, had worked with her, sacrificing his personal life the way she had hers. They\u2019d met with a handful of small successes. And now this.</p><p>Both Julia and Jerry were determined to revive Conrad Industries. Julia owed her father that much. Jerry had shown such faith in her by volunteering his services. If their situations were reversed, she wasn\u2019t sure she would\u2019ve been so forgiving. But her brother had stuck by her through all the turmoil.</p> <p>Slowly she lowered her gaze, disturbed by that revelation. However, she didn\u2019t have the time or the inclination to worry about it. If she ever needed a cool head and a cooler heart, it was now. Two years\u2019 worth of innovative research was about to be lost because they\u2019d allowed the fate of the company to hinge on the experiments and ideas of one man. Aleksandr Berinski was a brilliant Russian biochemist. Jerry had met him some years earlier while traveling in Europe and convinced Julia he was the answer to their problems. Her brother was right; Alek\u2019s ideas would revolutionize the paint industry. Bringing him to the United States had been a bold move on their part, but she hadn\u2019t been sorry. Not once.</p><p>Hiring Aleksandr Berinski from Russia and moving him to Seattle\u2014it was the biggest risk Conrad Industries had ever taken. Now the fate of the company rested in the hands of a hard-nosed official.</p><p>Julia wondered again if she should\u2019ve attended the hearing at the district office of Citizenship and Immigration. She\u2019d done everything within her power to make sure Aleksandr\u2019s visa would be extended. She\u2019d written a letter explaining his importance to the company and included documentation to prove that Aleksandr Berinski was a man of distinct merit and exceptional ability.</p><p>Jerry, who was a very good corporate attorney, had spent weeks building their case. Professional certifications, affidavits, a copy of Aleksandr\u2019s diploma and letters of reference filled Jerry\u2019s briefcase.</p><p>Her brother had told her there could be problems. It was often difficult to renew an H-2 visa, the type Aleksandr had been granted when he\u2019d entered the United States. The H-2 is one of temporary employment. He\u2019d warned her that if it looked as though employment might become permanent, then Immigration and the Labor Department would be reluctant to extend the visa.</p><p>On top of all that, the case had been assigned to a particularly difficult bureaucrat. Jerry had warned her that the agent hearing their case might decide Alek had applied for the temporary visa knowing the job was really permanent and refuse to grant an extension on principle.</p> <p>She checked her watch again and exhaled with impatience. Only a few minutes had passed. Annoyed with herself for the uncharacteristic display of anxiety, she sat down on her white leather chair. Everything was neatly arranged on the polished black desk. A small marble pen stand was next to the phone. The address and appointment books were perfectly aligned with everything else. Behind the desk stood her computer table, the company website pulled up, its logo prominent. Julia liked to keep her office and her world under control.</p><p>When her phone rang, the sound caught her off guard. She grabbed the receiver. \u201cJerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSis,\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice greeted her. \u201cI\u2019m on my cell. I thought you\u2019d want to know the decision as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it didn\u2019t go as well as we\u2019d hoped. They\u2019ve decided not to renew Alek\u2019s visa.\u201d</p><p>His words felt like a kick in the stomach. She closed her eyes and waited until the shock had passed. It wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t known the likelihood of this verdict. The fact that Aleksandr had no proof of a permanent residence in Russia didn\u2019t help. In the eyes of Immigration Services that was a red light indicating he didn\u2019t intend to return. Furthermore, she and Jerry were dealing with a large, complex bureaucracy. In a fit of worry, Julia had tried to contact the agency herself, reason with them. She\u2019d spent nearly an hour on the phone and hadn\u2019t spoken to a single person. She was forced to listen to one recording after another. Press a number on the phone, listen, press another one, then another. She quickly became lost in a hopeless tangle of instructions and messages.</p><p>\u201cWhen will he have to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the end of the week, when his current visa expires.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you about it as soon as we get back to the office,\u201d her brother said in reassuring tones. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got a contingency plan.\u201d</p><p>Nice of him to mention it now, Julia mused. He might\u2019ve said something this morning and saved her all this grief.</p><p>Ten minutes later, her intercom buzzed; her assistant announced that Jerry was in her outer office. Julia asked Virginia to send him in and waited, standing by the window.</p><p>Jerry entered and Aleksandr Berinski followed. Although Aleksandr had been working for Conrad Industries for nearly two years, she\u2019d only talked to him a handful of times. Even those conversations had been brief. But she\u2019d read his weekly reports and been excited by the progress he was making. If he was allowed to continue, Julia didn\u2019t doubt that his innovations would put Conrad Industries back on a firm financial footing.</p><p>Julia and Jerry, but primarily Julia, had taken on the impossible task of resurrecting the family business, literally from the ashes. Three years before, the plant and adjacent warehouse had been severely damaged by fire; fortunately, it hadn\u2019t spread to the lab and the offices. Because of the rebuilding they\u2019d had to do, she\u2019d decided the line of paints Aleksandr was developing would be called Phoenix.</p><p>To be so close to success and lose it all now was more than she could bear. For three long, frustrating years, she\u2019d hung on to the business by wheeling and dealing, making trades and promises.</p><p>Being aggressive and hardworking had come naturally to her. Jerry possessed the same determination and had been a constant help. If she was cold and sometimes ruthless, she credited it to Roger Stanhope. She\u2019d needed to be, but Julia didn\u2019t have any more tricks up her sleeve once Aleksandr returned to Russia.</p><p>She feared that losing the business would be a fatal blow to her grandmother. No one knew better than Julia how fragile Ruth\u2019s health had become these past few months.</p><p>\u201cYou said you have a contingency plan.\u201d She spoke crisply, the sound of her steps muffled by the thick wheat-colored carpet as she stalked back to her desk. She leaned forward and averted her gaze from Aleksandr\u2019s.</p><p>The man disturbed her in ways she didn\u2019t understand. He was tall and lanky with impeccable manners. His face wasn\u2019t handsome the way Roger\u2019s had been, but rawboned and lean. His eyes were dark, the brows arched slightly, and in him she read strength and character. Unwillingly she found her own eyes drawn to his, and the shadow of a smile crept across Aleksandr\u2019s face. She focused her attention on Jerry.</p><p>\u201cThere is one way,\u201d her brother said, with obvious reluctance.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to play guessing games. Tell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she snapped, hardly believing he could be holding something back. Jerry knew as well as she did what kind of predicament the company was in.</p><p>Her brother set down his briefcase and motioned toward the leather chair. \u201cPerhaps you should take a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She noted that his voice was strained, which surprised her almost as much as his request.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Alek,\u201d Jerry advised as he moved to the opposite end of her office.</p><p>Julia turned toward him and tried to read his features in the gloom of late afternoon. The storm had darkened the sky, stationing shadows around the room until it resembled a dungeon, Julia thought.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you have to say, please say it, Jerry. You\u2019ve never worried about phrasing before.\u201d</p><p>Jerry\u2019s eyes traveled from Julia to Aleksandr, and she saw that his cheeks were flushed. He sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s only one legal way I know to keep Aleksandr in the country.\u201d Slowly he leveled his gaze on Julia. \u201cYou could marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d stop by and see me.\u201d Julia\u2019s grandmother, Ruth Conrad, spoke softly, stretching out one hand. She was sitting up in bed, her thin white hair arranged in a chignon of sorts. Ruth was pale, her skin a silky shade of alabaster, her eyes sunken now with age, revealing only a hint of the depth and beauty that had been hers in years past. She was frail and growing more so daily.</p><p>The cool facade Julia wore in her role with Conrad Industries quickly melted whenever she saw her grandmother. She sank gratefully into the chair next to the brass four-poster bed and slipped off her shoes, tucking her feet beneath her.</p><p>Visiting Ruth at the family home was an escape for her. She left her worries and troubles outside. Her world was often filled with chaos, but with Ruth she found calm; the day\u2019s tension was replaced by peace and solace.</p><p>The storm outside seemed far removed from this bedroom haven.</p><p>\u201cThe thunder woke me,\u201d Ruth said in a low voice, smiling weakly. \u201cI lay back and I could hear huge kettledrums in the sky. Oh, how they rumbled. Then I had Charles open the drapes so I could look outside. The clouds billowed past like giant puffs of smoke. It was a marvelous show.\u201d</p><p>Julia took her grandmother\u2019s hand and released a slow, uneven breath. She glanced around the room, studying the treasures Ruth had chosen to keep nearby. A row of silver-framed pictures rested on the nightstand, next to several prescription bottles. There was one of her son\u2014Julia\u2019s father\u2014another of the family together, plus Ruth\u2019s own wedding portrait and a candid photo of her beloved husband, Louis. A chintz-covered Victorian chair sat in front of the fireplace, a wool afghan draped over the back for when Ruth felt well enough to venture from the bed. The round table beside the chair was covered with a dark velvet cloth. Julia\u2019s picture, one taken shortly after she\u2019d graduated from college, was propped up beside the lamp. Julia looked away, unable to bear the na\u00efvet\u00e9 and innocence she saw in that younger version of herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased you stopped by,\u201d Ruth said again.</p><p>Julia came almost every day, knowing the time left with her grandmother was shrinking. Neither spoke of her death, although it was imminent. Julia was determined to do whatever she could to make these last days as comfortable and happy for her as possible. That was what kept Julia going day after day. She spent hours talking to her grandmother, telling her about Alek\u2019s ideas, the innovations he was currently working on, her own hopes for the company. They discussed the future and how the entire industry was about to change because of Alek\u2019s vision. Her grandmother had been as impressed with Alek as Julia was. Ruth had wanted to meet him, and Julia had asked Jerry to bring Alek over. From what she heard later, the two had been quite charmed by each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you,\u201d Ruth whispered.</p><p>She sounded so weak. \u201cRest,\u201d Julia said urgently. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth responded with a fragile smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have much longer, Julia. A few weeks at the most....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d The truth was too painful to face, yet much too persistent to ignore. \u201cYou\u2019re just tired, that\u2019s all. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s eyes drifted shut, but determination opened them a moment later. \u201cWe need to talk about Roger,\u201d her grandmother said insistently.</p><p>A muscle in Julia\u2019s neck tensed, and a cold shiver went down her backbone. \u201cNot...now. Some other time. Later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight not...have later. Best to do it now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrandma, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe betrayed you, child, and you\u2019ve held on to that grief all these years. Your pain is killing you just as surely as this heart of mine is draining away my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even think of him anymore.\u201d Julia tried to reassure her, although it was a lie. She struggled to push every thought of Roger from her mind, but that wouldn\u2019t happen until she\u2019d completely rebuilt what he\u2019d destroyed.</p><p>\u201cRegret and anger are poisoning you like...like venom.... I\u2019ve watched it happen and been too weak...to help you the way I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, please, Roger is out of my life. I haven\u2019t seen him in over a year. What\u2019s the point of talking about him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone...but you haven\u2019t forgotten him. He failed you.\u201d</p> <p>Julia clenched her teeth. That was one way of putting it. Roger had failed her. He\u2019d also betrayed, tricked and abandoned her. When she thought of how much she\u2019d loved him, how much she\u2019d trusted him, it made her physically ill. Never again would she allow a man into her heart. Never again would she give a man the power to manipulate her.</p><p>\u201cThe time\u2019s come to forgive him.\u201d</p><p>Julia closed her eyes and shook her head. Her grandmother was asking the impossible. A woman didn\u2019t forgive the things Roger had done. Roger, the company\u2019s onetime director of research and development\u2014and Julia\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2014had taught her the most valuable lesson of her life. She wasn\u2019t going to turn her back on the humiliation he\u2019d caused her. Forgive him? Out of the question. She\u2019d rather bury herself in work, insulate herself from love, than forgive Roger.</p><p>\u201cI want you to love again,\u201d Ruth said, but her voice was so frail Julia had to strain to hear. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can die in peace, knowing you\u2019re so miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, how can you say that? Jerry and I are working hard to rebuild the company. We\u2019re on the brink of doing truly amazing things. I\u2019ve told you about them and about everything Aleksandr\u2019s done. How can you say I\u2019m miserable? These are the most challenging, exciting days of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that means much...not when you\u2019re still imprisoned in pain. I\u2019ve waited all these years for you to break free and fall in love again. It hasn\u2019t happened. I...look at you\u2014\u201d she hesitated and tears moistened her faded eyes \u201c\u2014and my heart aches. I want you to marry, to discover the happiness I found. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s kept me alive. I\u2019ve waited for your season of suffering to pass....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be able to trust another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must for your own sake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, not after what Roger did. Surely you understand. Surely you\u2014\u201d</p><p>With what must have required supreme effort, Ruth raised her hand, cutting Julia off. \u201cI\u2019ve longed for the day you\u2019d proudly introduce me to the man you love. I was hoping it would be Aleksandr.... He\u2019s such a dear man, and so brilliant. I\u2019d also like Jerry to find a woman to love....\u201d She paused. \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. My time is short, so...very short.\u201d Her eyes drifted closed once more and her head slumped forward.</p><p>Julia sat quietly while the seeds of fear took root within her. Love again? Impossible. Something she refused to even consider.</p><p>Marriage. To Alek.</p><p>Twice in the same day someone had suggested she marry him. First Jerry, as a ridiculous solution to their problem with the Immigration people, and now her grandmother, as the answer to her pain.</p><p>Julia stood, her arms wrapped around her. Glancing over at Ruth, she realized her grandmother was asleep. The grandmother who\u2019d loved and supported her all her life, who\u2019d stood by her when the whole world exploded. When Ruth had lost her son and Julia her father, when the man who was supposed to love her betrayed them all.</p><p>Julia remembered a time, long past, when she\u2019d been a child and a fierce thunderstorm had raged in the dead of night. Terrified, she\u2019d raced down the hallway to Ruth\u2019s room and slipped into bed with her. Even then she\u2019d known that was the safest place in all the world for her to be.</p><p>That security had always been with her. Soon she would lose her anchor, the person who\u2019d guided and loved her. Ruth had never asked anything of her before. Julia didn\u2019t know how she could refuse now.</p><p>Julia\u2019s request came as no surprise. Aleksandr had been waiting for it since the scene in her office the day before. If he lived to be a wise, old man he doubted he\u2019d ever understand this country he\u2019d come to love. Nor was he likely to understand Julia Conrad. She was a woman encased in frost, a woman with a wounded soul. He\u2019d recognized this from the moment they\u2019d met. She was uncomfortable with him; he knew that from the way she avoided eye contact. He hadn\u2019t had much contact with her, and he suspected she preferred to communicate through her brother.</p><p>Julia\u2019s assistant let him into the office and announced his arrival. Julia was sitting at her desk writing. When he entered the room, she glanced up and smiled.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit down,\u201d she said politely, motioning toward the chair on the other side of her desk. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting your work.\u201d</p><p>For a few seconds Aleksandr didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. Her pain was closer to the surface than ever before, almost visible beneath the facade she\u2019d erected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never too busy for you, Ms. Conrad,\u201d he said, bowing his head slightly.</p><p>Her features seemed perfect to him, her beauty so flawless it was chilling. He noted that her creamy skin was flushed but her eyes dark and clear as they studied him with equal interest.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be a good idea if we talked,\u201d she suggested haltingly.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAbout my work?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Not answering, she stood and moved away from him, carefully placing herself in the shadows where it was more difficult to read her expression.</p><p>\u201cTell me how your experiments are progressing,\u201d she said, her hands clasped behind her back. He sensed her reserve\u2014and her tension.</p><p>Aleksandr was well aware from the notes he\u2019d received from her that Julia had read and understood his weekly reports. Nevertheless he humored her. The additives he\u2019d been working on for Conrad paints had impressive capabilities. His first innovation had been a simple one. Once an exterior surface was painted, if the owner wished a different color at some later date, all he or she needed to do was wash the surface with another solution, one that would be available only through Conrad Industries. It was an approach that would work on homes, cars and lawn furniture.</p><p>His second innovation had been just as successful so far. He\u2019d developed a blend of chemicals that, when applied to a surface, would completely remove the old paint. No more scraping or heating it. A spray of the solution would dissolve it away with a minimum of effort, without harmful effects or harsh chemicals to damage the environment.</p><p>Aleksandr gave Julia a detailed description of his most recent experiments. He regretted that he wouldn\u2019t be with Conrad Industries to see his work come to fruition, but there was nothing more he could do. He was sorry to be leaving America, especially since there was still such poverty and upheaval in his homeland.</p><p>He paused, awaiting her response.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very close, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin a few months,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>Her brows arched with what he assumed was surprise and delight. Both emotions quickly left her expression as she looked away. Her eyes avoided his, and Aleksandr wondered privately how many hearts she\u2019d broken. She held herself distant, the unattainable prize of many a man, the untouchable dream of loveliness.</p><p>\u201cAleksandr.\u201d She spoke with a casual familiarity, although as far as he could recall, it was the first time she\u2019d addressed him by his first name. \u201cWe have a problem...as you know.\u201d</p><p>She moved toward him, her eyes wide, and when she spoke again it was in a whisper. \u201cWe\u2019re too close to lose everything now. I can\u2019t let it happen. My brother...came up with a solution.\u201d</p><p>Aleksandr\u2019s mind churned with confusion. She couldn\u2019t possibly be considering Jerry\u2019s suggestion that they get married, could she? Only a day earlier she\u2019d scoffed at her brother for even mentioning something so preposterous. Alek hadn\u2019t been given a chance to comment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about Jerry\u2019s idea,\u201d she continued demurely, glancing over her shoulder at him as she returned to her desk. \u201cIt seems marriage is our only solution.\u201d</p><p>Aleksandr wasn\u2019t fooled by her demeanor; there wasn\u2019t a shy, retiring bone in that delectable body of hers. Julia Conrad was too proud and stubborn to play the role well. But there was no limit to her determination.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019d be well compensated for your...contribution to Conrad Industries. Even more than we\u2019re currently paying you. We\u2019d be happy to double your salary. Naturally it wouldn\u2019t be a real marriage, and when you\u2019ve finished with your work, we\u2019d obtain a quiet divorce. If you\u2019re agreeable, I\u2019ll have Jerry draw up a prenuptial agreement for us to sign.\u201d</p><p>Aleksandr was convinced that if there\u2019d been any other way to solve the problem, Julia would have opted for it. She was offering him a pretend marriage, followed by a discreet divorce.</p><p>He frowned, disliking the fact that she was trying to bribe him with money. His wages were already far beyond what he could ever hope to make in Russia. Much of what he earned now he sent to his family, while he lived as frugally as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI understand there are several members of your family still in Russia,\u201d she said cautiously. \u201cWe might be able to help them immigrate to the States if we did decide to go ahead with this marriage.\u201d</p><p>At his silence, Julia added, \u201cIf that\u2019s something you\u2019d care to consider\u2014bringing your immediate family into the country. Is it?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>Aleksandr\u2019s voice was strained when he spoke. \u201cMy sister is unmarried and lives with my mother, who is a widow.\u201d Unable to remain seated, he stood and walked to the window, his back to her. He felt a strong desire to take Julia in his arms, but he was painfully aware that there was no warmth in her, nor would she welcome his touch.</p><p>For two years Aleksandr had studied Julia Conrad. Outwardly she was often arrogant and sometimes sarcastic. But she wasn\u2019t entirely capable of hiding her softer side. Every now and then he caught puzzling, contradictory glimpses of her. She cared deeply for her employees and was often generous to a fault. Then there\u2019d been the day, shortly after Alek had come to America, when he\u2019d seen Julia with her grandmother.</p> <p>Julia\u2019s facade had melted away that afternoon. If Alek hadn\u2019t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn\u2019t have believed such a transformation was possible. Julia had glowed with joy and pride as she gave her grandmother a tour of the rebuilt facilities. Alek had watched from a distance\u2014and had held on to that image of her ever since.</p><p>Marriage. He sighed inwardly. His religion didn\u2019t accept divorce and he refused to sacrifice his life and his happiness for a business proposition.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d say something,\u201d she said.</p><p>He returned to the chair and kept his features as expressionless as he could. \u201cThere\u2019s much we would need to consider before we enter into this agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she returned.</p> <p>\u201cYour money does not interest me.\u201d</p><p>She seemed surprised by his words. \u201cEven for your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven for my family.\u201d What he earned now was adequate. Julia wasn\u2019t the only one who was proud. Alek couldn\u2019t be bought. She, a woman who needed no one, needed him, and he appreciated what it had taken for her to approach him with this offer. Alek wasn\u2019t being completely unselfish, nor was he without greed. He had a price in mind.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it you want?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, not knowing how to tell her.</p><p>Restlessly she came to her feet and walked away from him. He admired her smooth, fluid grace. She was a woman who moved with confidence, sure of herself and her surroundings. Usually. But at the moment she seemed sure of nothing and obviously that disturbed her.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Aleksandr answered truthfully.</p><p>\u201cDo you find the idea of marriage to me so distasteful?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t money, then what? A percentage of my stock? A vice presidency? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Americans regard marriage differently than we do in my country. There, when a man and woman marry, it is for many reasons, not all of them love. Nevertheless, when we marry it is for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t in Russia now, you\u2019re in America.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAmericans treat marriage like dirty laundry. When it becomes inconvenient, you toss it aside. My head tells me I live in your country now, but my heart believes in tradition. If we marry, Julia, and it would be my wish that we do, there will be no divorce.\u201d</p><p>Her breath escaped in a rush and her dark eyes flared briefly.</p><p>Aleksandr ignored the fury he read in her and continued. \u201cWe both stand to gain from this arrangement. I will remain in the country and complete my experiments. You will have what you wish, as well. But there is a cost to this, one we should calculate now. The marriage will be a real one, or there will be no marriage.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze cut through him with ill-concealed contempt. \u201cSo you want more than the golden egg, you want the whole goose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe goose?\u201d Aleksandr hadn\u2019t heard this story. He smiled. \u201cIn my family, goose is traditionally served at the wedding meal. I do not know about the golden egg, but you may keep that. I want only you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was husky when she spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>The phone on her desk rang just then and Julia reached for it. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to be disturbed,\u201d she said impatiently. Her face tightened as she listened. \u201cYes, yes, of course, you did the right thing. Put me through immediately.\u201d Several seconds passed. \u201cDr. Silverman, this is Julia Conrad. I understand you\u2019ve had my grandmother taken to Virginia Mason Hospital.\u201d</p><p>Alek watched as the eyes that had been distressed and angry a moment earlier softened with emotion. She blinked, and Alek thought he might have noticed the sheen of tears.</p><p>\u201cNaturally. I\u2019ll let my brother know right away and we\u2019ll meet you there as soon as we can. Thank you for contacting me so soon.\u201d She replaced the receiver, stood and started out of the room, apparently forgetting Aleksandr was there.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother is ill?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She whirled around, apparently surprised at the sound of his voice, and nodded. \u201cI...have to leave. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any need for us to discuss this further. I can\u2019t agree to your conditions. I refuse to be trapped in the type of marriage you\u2019re suggesting. I\u2019d hoped we\u2019d be able to work out some kind of compromise, but that doesn\u2019t seem possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed. We would\u2019ve had fine children.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as if he\u2019d spoken in his native tongue and she didn\u2019t understand a word he\u2019d said. \u201cChildren?\u201d she repeated. A sadness seemed to steal over her; she shook her head, perhaps to dispel the image.</p><p>\u201cI will think good things for your grandmother,\u201d Alek told her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d With what looked like hard-won poise, she turned and left the office.</p><p>Alek watched her go, and the proud way in which she carried herself tugged at his heart. He wished her grandmother well, but more importantly, he wished Julia a happy life.</p><p>Knowing his time in the States was limited to mere days, Aleksandr worked well past five, when his colleagues had all gone home. He felt it was his moral obligation to do everything within his power to see that the next series of experiments was performed to the standards he\u2019d set for the earlier ones. He wouldn\u2019t be with Conrad Industries to oversee the ongoing research, and that bothered him, but he had no choice.</p><p>The laboratory was silent, and the footsteps echoing down the wide corridor outside his office were louder than they would otherwise have been.</p><p>He raised his eyes expectantly when Julia Conrad opened the door without knocking and walked inside. She was pale, her eyes darker than he\u2019d ever seen them before.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d he said, standing abruptly. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She looked sightlessly around, as though she didn\u2019t know where she was or how she got there.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded and gnawed on her bottom lip. \u201cShe...she had another heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew upward as if to gauge the sincerity of his words. For a lengthy moment she said nothing. Then she inhaled a shaky breath and bit her lip so hard, Aleksandr was afraid she\u2019d draw blood.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019ve reconsidered, Mr. Berinski. I\u2019ll marry you under the conditions you\u2019ve set.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want an elaborate wedding.\u201d Julia folded her arms, moving to the far side of her office. Her brother was being impossible. \u201cHow could there even be time to arrange one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, you\u2019re not listening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cI just don\u2019t happen to like what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reception at the Four Seasons isn\u2019t so much to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a wedding with guests and this whole thing about wearing a fancy wedding dress is ridiculous! Jerry, please, this is getting out of hand. I understand marriage is the best solution, but I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be forced to endure the mockery of a formal wedding.\u201d</p><p>Jerry gestured helplessly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make this as credible as we can. Apparently you don\u2019t understand how important this is\u2014and not just the wedding, either. That\u2019s only the first hurdle. You have to make everything appear as though you\u2019re madly in love. Nothing less will convince the Immigration people. If you fail... I don\u2019t even want to think about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already gone through this.\u201d More times than she cared to count.</p><p>\u201cAlek has to live with you, too.\u201d</p><p>This was the part that disturbed Julia most. Her condo was her private haven, the one place where she could be completely herself. She was about to lose that, too. \u201cBut why?\u201d She knew the answer, had argued until Jerry was seething with exasperation. Julia didn\u2019t blame him, but this marriage was becoming far more complicated than she\u2019d ever thought it would.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jerry shouted, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cI\u2019ve made everything as plain as I can. Alek isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s you. What I don\u2019t understand, Julia, is why you\u2019re being so difficult when we\u2019re the ones who stand to benefit from this arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making Alek sound like a saint for marrying me.\u201d She frowned. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see you running for the altar.\u201d Jerry had recently ended yet another brief liaison.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away, which irritated her even more. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d he finally said. \u201cConrad Industries is gaining far more from this marriage than Alek ever will. And,\u201d he added, \u201cmy marital status is irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes at that. \u201cI offered to pay him, and very generously, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou insulted him. The man has his pride, Julia. He isn\u2019t doing this for the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is he going through with it?\u201d</p><p>Jerry shrugged. \u201cDarned if I know.\u201d</p><p>His words reiterated that Alek wasn\u2019t getting any bargain by marrying her. \u201cHe wants to help his family,\u201d Julia reminded her brother. She remembered Alek mentioning a sister and his widowed mother. As the oldest son, Alek would feel responsible for taking care of his family. Julia had promised to do whatever she could to bring both his mother and his sister to the United States. This marriage provided plenty of incentives for Alek, she told herself, so she didn\u2019t need to worry about taking advantage of him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to the man than meets the eye,\u201d Jerry muttered. \u201cI\u2019m convinced he\u2019s not interested in monetary gain. When he read over the prenup, he insisted on no stake in the company. We\u2019re about to make a fortune because of him, and he wants no part of it.\u201d</p><p>This discussion wasn\u2019t doing anything to ease Julia\u2019s conscience. \u201cI agreed to the marriage,\u201d she said, not wanting to stray any farther from the subject than they already had. \u201cBut no one said anything about a wedding. I thought we\u2019d make an appointment with a justice of the peace and be done with it.\u201d She walked over to her desk, opened the old-fashioned appointment book and flipped through the pages. \u201cFriday at four is open.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Jerry returned with a sigh. \u201cAs I\u2019ve explained\u2014we\u2019ve got to make this as real as we can for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said Alek can move in with me.\u201d To Julia, that was a major concession. She wasn\u2019t pleased by it, nor did she feel good about tricking Alek. He\u2019d insisted from the first that their marriage be real. He\u2019d made it known that he intended to sleep with her; he also wanted children. Julia couldn\u2019t allow any of that. Alek didn\u2019t understand and neither did Jerry. Julia was incapable of love, the kind of trusting love a husband and wife shared. That possibility was dead, destroyed by Roger\u2019s treachery. Never again would she put her faith in a man. Alek expected her to be his wife in every way, but soon he\u2019d learn the truth. Soon he\u2019d know for himself how badly he was being cheated. Such deception didn\u2019t sit well with Julia, but there was no avoiding it.</p><p>While Julia admired Alek, she found herself nervous around him. He left her feeling naked, somehow. Exposed. He seemed to be able to look into her very soul. That didn\u2019t make sense, but she couldn\u2019t shake the suspicion that in some uncanny way he knew all there was to know about her.</p><p>\u201cImmigration is going to ask about the wedding,\u201d Jerry went on. \u201cWe need proof that what prompted the marriage to Alek was nothing less than earth-shattering love. A hurried-up affair in some judge\u2019s chambers won\u2019t work. They\u2019re going to want evidence of your commitment and devotion to each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA hurried-up affair at the Four Seasons will convince them of all that?\u201d she asked sarcastically.</p><p>Jerry sighed again. \u201cIt looks better. Now, I suggest you go out and get yourself a fancy wedding dress while I make arrangements with Virginia. We\u2019ll deal with the caterers and the photographers and see to having the invitations hand-delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, this is crazy!\u201d Julia protested. The idea of dressing up in an elaborate wedding gown, as if she were a loving bride on display, appalled her. Nor was she keen on posing for a series of photographs, like a new wife passionately in love with her husband. It was too much. \u201cI can\u2019t go through with this,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the marriage, yes, but not this...this circus. It\u2019s becoming a Hollywood production, a show for media attention.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA show is what we need if we\u2019re going to fool the Immigration investigators,\u201d Jerry argued. \u201cAnd trust me, Julia, this marriage will be investigated.\u201d</p><p>Julia walked over to the window and studied the street several floors below. In a moment of weakness, when her fears had been rampant and she was so deathly afraid of losing Ruth, Julia had gone to Alek and agreed to his terms. Even now she didn\u2019t understand what had prompted her. She was sick of analyzing it, furious with herself for being so weak. This morning, once her head had cleared, she\u2019d realized it had all been a mistake. But by then Alek had contacted Jerry, who\u2019d put everything in motion. Now, it seemed, there was no turning back.</p><p>Her intercom hummed before Virginia\u2019s efficient voice reached out to her. \u201cMr. Berinski is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked at her brother in sheer panic. She wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with Alek just yet. They hadn\u2019t spoken since she\u2019d consented to the marriage.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Jerry prompted when she didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cSend him in,\u201d Julia instructed her assistant, steeling herself for the confrontation.</p> <p>No sooner had the words left her mouth than the door leading to her office opened. Alek walked in and his dark eyes shone brightly as he gazed over at her. A slow, seductive smile appeared on his lips.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon.\u201d Alek spoke to her brother first, then returned his attention to her. \u201cJulia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek,\u201d she said briskly, surprised by how defensive she sounded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem perturbed by her lack of welcome. Last night she\u2019d agreed to become his wife, accepting the stipulations he\u2019d set. She\u2019d been overwrought with anxiety, frightened and lost. Yet no matter how hard she argued with herself, Julia wouldn\u2019t change her mind...unless Alek wanted out. She was a woman of honor, a woman of her word. She knew he was the same way.</p><p>\u201cI was just clearing the wedding arrangements with Julia,\u201d Jerry explained.</p><p>Alek\u2019s eyes refused to leave her. She felt her face heat and wished with everything in her that she could escape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like some time alone with my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Alek said.</p><p>Julia sent Jerry a pleading glance, not wanting him to leave her. Jerry ignored the unspoken request, mumbled something under his breath and walked out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to talk?\u201d she asked abruptly. She rubbed her palms and walked away from him. Her shoulders felt stiff and her legs heavy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervous.\u201d</p><p>Nervous. Terrified. Afraid. None of those words adequately described what Julia was experiencing. The situation had an eerie, unreal quality that she couldn\u2019t shake. Only a few years earlier she\u2019d looked forward to being a happy bride. She\u2019d dreamed of the day Roger would slip a wedding band on her finger and gaze down at her with love.</p><p>She felt a flash of unexpected pain, then forced herself to shake the image from her head.</p><p>\u201cAll brides are nervous,\u201d she said quietly in response to his question.</p><p>\u201cHow is your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be seeing her this afternoon.... Better, I believe.\u201d According to the nurse Julia had spoken with that morning, Ruth had slept restfully through the night. But that had been after Jerry had spoken to her and said Julia would be marrying Aleksandr Berinski. Her grandmother had only met Alek once, and that had been recently. He\u2019d obviously made quite an impression, because his name had cropped up with alarming frequency ever since.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to cancel the wedding?\u201d Alek probed.</p><p>Here was her chance, handed to her on the proverbial silver platter. All she needed to do was tell him that she hadn\u2019t been herself, that she hadn\u2019t been fully aware of what she was doing. She opened her mouth to explain it all away and found she couldn\u2019t. The words refused to come. While she was fumbling for a reply, he stepped behind her and rested his hands on her shoulders. He leaned forward, gently kissing the side of her neck.</p><p>Julia froze. It was the first time a man had touched her since Roger. She couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t breathe. Alek didn\u2019t seem to notice. Sliding his arms around her, he brought her against him. His breath stirred shivers along her spine and a curious warmth crept into her blood.</p><p>Alek turned her around to face him. She wasn\u2019t given the opportunity to object as he pressed his mouth to hers. His lips moved slowly over hers. She wedged her hands between them, braced her palms against his hard chest and pushed herself free. Her lungs felt as though they were about to burst, and she drew in a deep breath.</p><p>Alek didn\u2019t seem offended or surprised by her actions. His eyes danced with mischief as they sought hers. Julia raised the back of her hand to her mouth and held it there. She burned with anger. He\u2019d done this intentionally so she\u2019d know he expected to touch her and kiss her often after the ceremony. She was to be his wife in every sense of the word and he wouldn\u2019t tolerate a loveless, sexless marriage. He wanted her and he was making sure she knew it.</p><p>What was she going to do?</p><p>Julia stood outside the bridal shop with all the thrill and anticipation of a long-overdue visit to the dentist.</p><p>She opened the door and walked inside, grateful the saleswoman wasn\u2019t busy.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Julia said stiffly, fanning out the billowing chiffon skirt of a pale yellow bridesmaid\u2019s dress that hung from a rack.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d came the friendly voice.</p><p>Julia revealed her lack of enthusiasm with a noncommittal shrug. \u201cI need a wedding dress for this Friday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper was petite, hardly more than five feet tall with soft brown hair. The woman was a dreamer; Julia could see it in her eyes. She, too, had once worn that same look of innocence....</p><p>\u201cThe wedding is this Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that doesn\u2019t give me much time,\u201d Julia said, feeling foolish. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those spur-of-the-moment things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the saleswoman assured her, hurrying toward a long rack of plastic-covered wedding dresses. \u201cSpur-of-the-moment weddings are often the most romantic.\u201d</p><p>Julia had nothing to add. She could tell that this woman was more than a dreamer; she was also hopelessly sentimental. She had her head in the clouds when it came to love, and no doubt her attitude had been influenced by her job. She dealt with women who were deeply in love, women for whom the entire world was there for the taking.</p><p>Three years earlier, Julia had been one of them. Young, enthusiastic and so much in love she didn\u2019t recognize what should\u2019ve been obvious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a very plain dress,\u201d she said forcefully, breaking off her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cPlain,\u201d the woman repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cThe plainer the better,\u201d Julia reiterated, strolling about the store.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have a limited selection of plain dresses.\u201d</p><p>That was what Julia feared. \u201cSomething simple, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple and elegant?\u201d she asked, grinning approvingly. \u201cWould you like to look through this rack? Choose the designs that appeal to you, I\u2019ll get them in your size, and then you can try them on.\u201d</p><p>As far as Julia was concerned, this business with the wedding dress was a waste of time. She wanted it to be over and done with so she could head for the hospital and visit Ruth.</p><p>The saleswoman led her to the appropriate display of gowns. Julia shuffled through them quickly, making two selections. Neither dress really appealed to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try on these two,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>The woman made no comment as she went into the back room and returned a few minutes later with the two dresses in the correct size. She took them into the dressing room and placed them on the hook.</p><p>Julia obediently followed her inside. She undressed and slipped into the first dress. It was just as the saleswoman had promised. Simple and elegant. A straight skirt made of silk, a beaded yoke and cuffs. It looked fine, Julia supposed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the shop-owner said with certainty. \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the woman repeated. \u201cDon\u2019t even bother to try on the next dress. It wouldn\u2019t suit you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dress is one of the most important aspects of your wedding. Every bride deserves to feel beautiful on her special day.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t know why she felt like crying, but she did. Buckets of tears welled up inside her. She was grateful the woman didn\u2019t seem to notice. Brides deserved a whole lot more than feeling beautiful; they deserved to marry a man they loved. A man who loved them, too.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d she instructed. She left the changing area and came back a moment later carrying a lovely ornate dress. The silk gown with pearls and sequins was anything but simple. Rarely had Julia seen a dress as intricate as this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTry it on,\u201d she said when Julia hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. This dress was designed for someone with your body type. It\u2019s perfect. It arrived this afternoon, almost as though I\u2019d sent away for it with you in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Julia murmured. The woman held up the gown for her inspection. It was lovely, ten times more elaborate than the one she\u2019d tried on earlier. Ten times more beautiful, too. It was the kind of dress a woman in love would choose, knowing her groom would treasure its beauty. Would treasure her beauty. A groom who\u2019d cherish her devotion all his life. It was the style of dress she would\u2019ve worn for Roger before she learned of his betrayal. Before she\u2019d learned what a fool she\u2019d been.</p> <p>She wanted to argue, but one look convinced her that the woman would hear none of it. Not exactly sure why she\u2019d allowed this stranger to dictate her actions, Julia put on the dress. The silk and taffeta rustled as it slid effortlessly over her hips. She kept her eyes lowered as she turned around and the shopkeeper fastened the small pearl closures down her back.</p><p>Julia felt strangely reluctant to look into a mirror, almost fearing her own reflection. When she did raise her eyes to the glass, she was startled at the beautiful young woman who gazed back at her. It took her a wild second to realize it was herself.</p><p>Gone were the lines that told of the bitterness and disappointment she\u2019d carried with her since her father\u2019s death. The cool, disinterested look in her eyes had warmed. The calculating side of her personality faded, replaced by the woman she\u2019d been before she\u2019d fallen in love with Roger Stanhope. Open, trusting, naive\u2014too young for her years.</p><p>Unable to look at herself any longer, Julia dragged her eyes away from the graceful reflection of the woman she\u2019d once been. The woman Roger\u2019s deception had destroyed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d the saleswoman was saying with a sigh of appreciation. \u201cJust perfect. It\u2019s as if the dress was meant for you.\u201d</p> <p>Julia opened her mouth to contradict the woman, but before she could voice her objection she looked at the mirror one last time. A few days earlier she\u2019d caught a stormy glimpse of herself reflected in her office window. She\u2019d disliked what she\u2019d seen, the woman she\u2019d become, cold, uncaring and driven.</p><p>She\u2019d quickly abandoned her self-analysis and had concentrated on what was happening with Alek and Jerry at the Immigration office instead. The events of that afternoon had resulted in this farce of a wedding.</p><p>Alek had been adamant that there be no divorce. Julia had agreed to those terms, but not in the spirit he\u2019d intended. If it weren\u2019t for these particular circumstances, Julia doubted she would ever have married. This would be her only wedding, her one chance to wear such a beautiful gown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d she said, calling herself a fool even as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cSomehow I knew you would.\u201d The saleswoman grinned broadly.</p><p>It took an additional twenty minutes, while the dress was wrapped up and the bill paid, before Julia was able to leave the shop. Nervously she glanced at her watch as she headed toward her parked car. She was already late and knew Ruth would be worried.</p> <p>As often as she\u2019d visited hospitals, Julia could never accustom herself to the antiseptic smell. She rushed down the polished hallway to the wing that housed her grandmother. She hated the thought of Ruth being here, away from her comfortable home and the pictures she loved and kept close to her side.</p><p>Ruth had tried repeatedly to prepare Julia for her death, but Julia refused to listen, refused to accept life without her adored grandmother.</p><p>Checking in at the nurses\u2019 station, Julia was left to wait until Velma Williams, the head nurse, returned. A striking arrangement of red, blue, yellow and white flowers overfilled an inverted straw hat on a corner of the long counter. Julia admired it as she stood there. A few minutes later, Velma was back and Julia was ushered to Ruth\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Julia whispered. She couldn\u2019t tell if Ruth was sleeping or simply resting her eyes. Her grandmother seemed to be doing more of both lately. There were various tubes and pieces of equipment attached to Ruth\u2019s body, monitoring her heart and administering drugs intravenously. Julia looked down on this woman she loved so much and had to force back her growing sense of alarm. It seemed to ring in her ears, announcing that the time was fast approaching when Ruth would no longer be with her.</p><p>The older woman\u2019s eyes gradually drifted open. \u201cJulia, my dear, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. Come, sit with me.\u201d</p><p>Julia pulled up a chair and sat next to the high hospital bed. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Ruth gestured weakly with her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not important now. Tell me about you and Alek. How I\u2019ve prayed for this day. How I\u2019ve hoped you\u2019d learn to love again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding\u2019s on Friday afternoon.\u201d Julia half suspected her grandmother would find the timing suspicious, but instead Ruth smiled tenderly and a faraway look came into her tired eyes.</p> <p>\u201cFriday... It\u2019s a good thing you won\u2019t have a long engagement, because I doubt I\u2019ll last more than a week or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, please don\u2019t say that. You\u2019re going to be around for years and years.\u201d</p><p>The weary smile didn\u2019t waver. \u201cI won\u2019t see my great-grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Julia wanted to argue with her, but she couldn\u2019t; there\u2019d never be children for her and Alek because there would never be a real marriage. She suffered a slight twinge of guilt but pushed it aside as a luxury she couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late but I was trying on wedding dresses,\u201d Julia explained, injecting some enthusiasm into her voice. She was mildly surprised at how little effort it required to sound excited about the dress she\u2019d bought at the bridal shop. She described it in detail and was pleased at the way her grandmother\u2019s eyes brightened.</p><p>\u201cYou and Alek will come see me after the ceremony, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Julia promised.</p><p>Ruth motioned toward the nurses\u2019 station. \u201cHe sent me flowers. He\u2019s a very thoughtful boy. Velma carried in the bouquet for me to see. Did you notice them?\u201d \u201cWho sent you flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Alek. An enchanting arrangement, and such a sweet thing to do. I like him, Julia. You\u2019ve chosen well, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Julia was uncomfortable talking about Alek. He\u2019d been foremost in her thoughts all day and she wanted to escape him, escape the memory of his gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your romance. You\u2019ve been so close-mouthed about it all...yet I knew.\u201d Ruth\u2019s eyes closed slowly and she sighed. With what seemed to be a good deal of effort she opened her eyes again. \u201cHe\u2019s a special man, that one. Just hearing about you two gladdens my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Julia hesitated, not sure what to say. \u201cIt all happened rather quickly...almost overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered.\u201d A spark appeared in Ruth\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh, how I adore a love story. Tell me more before I fall back asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek\u2019s green card was about to expire.\u201d Keeping everything as close to the truth as possible made this much easier.</p><p>\u201cHis green card,\u201d Ruth repeated. \u201cOf course, I\u2019d forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was going to have to return to Russia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you realized you couldn\u2019t let that happen, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized how important he was to me,\u201d Julia said, adding drama to her voice. \u201cJerry did everything he could to persuade the Immigration people to let Alek stay, but nothing he said convinced them. The three of us were talking and suddenly I understood how vital it was to me that Alek remain in the United States. I...don\u2019t think I could bear to go on without him.\u201d This was a stretch, but Julia knew what a romantic her grandmother was. If she was exaggerating the truth just a little, it was a small price to pay to satisfy Ruth.</p><p>\u201cJulia, my sweet child.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s delicate hand reached for Julia\u2019s and she squeezed her fingers. \u201cI always trusted that in time you\u2019d open your heart to love again. It took a special man like Alek. Be happy, my child. Promise me you won\u2019t let go until you\u2019ve found your joy.\u201d</p><p>Julia wasn\u2019t sure she understood Ruth\u2019s words. They made little sense to her. She would have questioned her if Ruth hadn\u2019t chosen that moment to slip into a peaceful slumber. For several minutes Julia remained at her grandmother\u2019s side, taking in the solace she felt whenever she spent time with Ruth.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d The sound of her name, said with that soft European accent, caught her attention. She jerked around to find Alek standing in the doorway.</p><p>She got up abruptly, resenting his intrusion into these quiet moments. She walked toward the door, not wanting him to interrupt her grandmother\u2019s rest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked when they were well into the corridor.</p><p>The edge of his mouth lifted in a half smile. \u201cI came to see you. There is much we need to discuss.\u201d He tucked her hand in the crook of his elbow and sauntered over to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI left the wedding arrangements in Jerry\u2019s hands. He\u2019ll look after everything. As far as I can see, there\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>She saw the anger in him, in the prideful squaring of his shoulders and the way his mouth thinned.</p><p>\u201cYou want me, Julia, and you need me. I just wonder how long it will take before you realize this.\u201d</p><p>The arrogance of the man was beyond description. She glared at him. She needed no one, especially a man, and never a husband. She wanted to shout out the words, but a hospital corridor was the last place to do that.</p><p>Long seconds passed as they stared into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou need me,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she returned defiantly. Conrad Industries needed him; she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Their eyes lingered and it seemed neither of them knew what to say or do next. Jerry had mentioned how proud Alek was, and she could see that colossal ego for herself. He released her arm and turned away.</p><p>He was several yards down the hospital corridor before Julia spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t need you, Alek,\u201d she called after him. She had to say something. They\u2019d quickly make each other miserable if this friction between them continued. If he wouldn\u2019t make an effort, then it was up to her.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve already said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am willing to admit we need each other.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he turned back. His smile grew as he returned to her side. For a heartbeat, he said nothing. Then he lowered his mouth to hers and kissed her. His touch was as gentle as before. Light as air, it left her wondering if she\u2019d imagined his kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His smile was worth waiting for. \u201cBecause, my soon-to-be-wife, you deserved it.\u201d He brushed the hair away from her face. \u201cFor that matter,\u201d he said with a roguish grin, \u201cso did I.\u201d</p><p>Three </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wedding ceremony was a nightmare for Julia. When it came time to repeat her vows, her throat closed up and she could barely speak. Not so with Alek. His voice rang out loud and clear, without the least hesitation.</p><p>Love and cherish.</p><p>Julia\u2019s conscience was screaming. She had no intention of loving Alek. She didn\u2019t want to love any man, because love had the power to hurt her, the power to break her. Julia had worked hard to blot it from her life. Love was superfluous, unnecessary, painful when abused, and her heart had yet to recover from her first experience with it.</p><p>Signing the final documents was even worse than enduring the ceremony. Her hand trembled as she wrote her name on the marriage certificate. Her eyes glazed with tears as she stared at the official document, all too aware of the lie she was living.</p> <p>Jerry, her assistant and the minister all seemed unaware of her distress. She didn\u2019t know what Alek was thinking. His fingers pressed against the small of her back as though to encourage her. She continued to hold the pen and remained bent over the document long after she\u2019d finished signing her name.</p><p>\u201cMay your marriage be a long and fruitful one,\u201d the minister was saying to Alek. Julia squeezed her eyes shut, drew in a steadying breath and straightened. She dared not look at Alek for fear he could read her thoughts.</p><p>Long and fruitful, Julia\u2019s mind echoed. A sob welled up inside her and she was afraid she\u2019d burst into tears. This deception was so much more difficult than she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cShall we join the others?\u201d Jerry, who had served as Alek\u2019s best man, suggested, gesturing toward the door. Julia was grateful for an excuse to leave the room.</p><p>The reception was being held in a large hotel suite across the hall from where the wedding had taken place. Their guests were helping themselves to a wide array of hors d\u2019oeuvres served on silver platters, and crystal flutes of champagne.</p> <p>Julia was surprised by how many people had come on such short notice. Most were business associates, but several family friends were also in attendance. She had few friends left, allowing the majority of her relationships to lapse after her father\u2019s death.</p><p>Alek was at her side, smiling and cordially greeting their guests. He placed his arm casually around her shoulders. Julia stiffened at the unwelcome familiarity, but if he noted her uneasiness, he paid no heed.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how beautiful you look?\u201d he whispered close to her ear.</p><p>Julia nodded. He hadn\u2019t been able to take his eyes off her from the moment she\u2019d arrived in her wedding dress. Oddly, that depressed her, planning to deceive him the way she was. He was expecting more from this marriage than she was going to give him. She should\u2019ve opted for the plain, simple, unadorned dress instead of the ornate one she\u2019d chosen.</p><p>The minute she\u2019d viewed herself before the wedding, she was sorry she\u2019d bought this gown. Even Jerry had seemed dumbstruck when he went to escort her to Alek\u2019s side. He\u2019d become especially maudlin with his compliments, which added to her stress. And her guilt.</p><p>\u201cCould you pretend to love me?\u201d Alek whispered. \u201cJust for these few hours?\u201d His warm breath against her skin sent shivers down her spine. \u201cSmile, my love.\u201d</p> <p>She complied obediently, her expression no doubt looking as stiff as it felt.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he murmured under his breath.</p><p>\u201cHow soon can we leave?\u201d</p><p>Alek chuckled softly. \u201cI know you\u2019re eager for me, but if we left too soon, it would be unseemly.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s face burned with a wild blush, which appeared to amuse Alek even more. \u201cWould you like me to get you a plate?\u201d he offered.</p><p>She shook her head. Food held no appeal. \u201cDo you want something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He turned to her, his eyes ablaze. \u201cRest assured, I do, but I\u2019ll get my dessert later.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t think her knees would support her much longer. From obligation more than desire, she drank a glass of champagne. It must\u2019ve been more potent than she realized because she felt giddy and light-headed afterward.</p> <p>It was the dress, she decided. She wanted to change out of the wedding gown because it made her feel things she had no right to feel. With Alek standing at her side, she felt beautiful and wanted and loved when she didn\u2019t deserve or want any of it. She\u2019d gone into this marriage for all the wrong reasons. She was uncomfortable, using Alek for her own gain, giving nothing of herself in return.</p><p>Until she\u2019d stood before the preacher, marriage had been little more than a concept, an idea she didn\u2019t believe in. She hadn\u2019t expected a few words mumbled before a man of God to be so powerful. But she\u2019d been wrong. Julia was shaken and uncertain afterward, as if she was mocking important human values.</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d She reached out to her brother and clasped his arm with both hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here....\u201d</p><p>He must have read the desperation in her eyes, because he nodded gravely. Whatever he said to Alek, Julia didn\u2019t hear. She assumed her brother would escort her from the room, but it was Alek who slipped his arm around her waist. It was her husband who led her out of the reception.</p><p>\u201cJerry is making our excuses,\u201d he explained.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered as he took her down the hallway to the changing room. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling faint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now, thanks.\u201d Or she would be, once she was out of this dress and back in her own clothes. And once he removed his arm from her waist.... The walls seemed to close in around her. She wished Alek would leave her, but he stayed even when she reached the door leading to the changing room.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t kiss,\u201d Alek whispered. \u201cNot properly.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t bother to pretend she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. When Alek was told to kiss his bride, Julia had made sure he\u2019d merely given her a peck on the cheek. Alek had been disappointed, and Jerry\u2019s eyes had revealed his frustration. A passionate kiss would\u2019ve put the stamp of credibility on their act.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sick, are you?\u201d</p><p>She could have lied, could have offered him countless excuses, but she didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, just as she had a minute earlier.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll kiss my bride.\u201d</p><p>Her first instinct was to put him off, to thwart him again, but a kiss seemed like such a simple way to ease her conscience. His touch had always been tender, as if he understood and appreciated her need for gentleness.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed breathlessly.</p><p>Her back was against the wall and his arms went around her waist. Unsure what to do with her own hands, she splayed them across his chest. He pulled her against him, and for a long moment he held her, as if savoring the feel of her in his arms.</p><p>The trembling returned and Julia closed her eyes. She could smell his cologne, feel his heart beat beneath her flattened palms. His breath echoed in her ears and rustled her hair.</p><p>His mouth met hers. His touch was light and brief. She tipped her head back and her eyes drifted shut as his mouth brushed hers again. And again. A sigh worked its way through her as his tongue outlined the shape of her mouth. After a series of nibbling kisses, he caught her lower lip between his teeth.</p><p>Julia held her breath, unable to respond. She was content to let him be the aggressor, to allow him to touch her and kiss her without fully participating herself.</p><p>But her lack of involvement obviously bothered Alek.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d he pleaded, \u201ckiss me back.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, shyly, her mouth opened to him and he moaned, then deepened the kiss. His arms tightened their hold and he slanted his mouth over hers. Strange, unwelcome pleasure rippled through her body.</p><p>She sighed at the sensations she experienced; she couldn\u2019t help it. She felt hot and shaky, as though she\u2019d suffered a near miss, as though she\u2019d stepped off a curb and felt the rush of a car passing by and come within inches of being struck.</p><p>Her hands, which had seemed so useless moments before, were buried in his dark hair. Her body, so long untouched, felt about to explode. She moved against him, clinging to him, fighting back tears.</p><p>The sound of someone clearing his throat broke the spell. Alek stilled, as did Julia. Slowly, reluctantly, she opened her eyes to find half of the reception guests lined up in the hall watching them.</p><p>Jerry stood in the background, smiling broadly. He gave her a thumbs-up, looking ecstatic. If they were hoping to fool their guests, they\u2019d succeeded beyond her brother\u2019s expectations.</p><p>As though loath to do it, Alek released her. He seemed perturbed by the interruption and muttered something she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change clothes,\u201d she said, hurriedly moving into the room. She was grateful there was a chair. Sinking down onto it, she pressed her hands to her red face and closed her eyes. She felt as if she\u2019d leapt off a precipice in the dark and had no idea of where she\u2019d be landing. A kiss that had begun as a compromise had become something else. She\u2019d been trying to soothe her conscience, but instead had added to her growing list of offenses, leading Alek to believe he should expect more.</p><p>Julia took her time changing. Fifteen minutes later she reappeared in a bright red flowered dress she\u2019d found in the back of her closet. These days she dressed mostly in business suits\u2014jackets, straight skirts and plain white blouses. The dress was a leftover from her college days. The design was simple and stylish.</p><p>Alek was pacing the hallway anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I took so long.\u201d</p><p>His smile was enthusiastic. He touched her lips, still swollen from his kiss. The color hadn\u2019t faded from her cheeks, either; if anything, it had deepened with this fresh appraisal.</p><p>\u201cI...promised my grandmother we\u2019d stop in at the hospital after the reception,\u201d Julia said nervously. \u201cI\u2019d hate to disappoint her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means we will see her.\u201d</p><p>They said their farewells and left the reception. Julia knew the minute they walked into Ruth\u2019s hospital room that she\u2019d been waiting for them. Her grandmother\u2019s smile was filled with love as she held her hands out to them.</p><p>Julia rushed forward and hugged her. She was reminded each and every time she saw her grandmother that Ruth was close to death. She clung to life, not for herself, but for Julia\u2019s sake. It hurt her to know Ruth was in pain. Why did those who were good always have to suffer? Why couldn\u2019t God spare her grandmother just a few more years? This day, her wedding day, had started a cauldron of emotions churning in her mind. She couldn\u2019t bear to think of what her life would be like without her grandmother.</p><p>It had been Ruth\u2019s kindness that had gotten her through Roger\u2019s deception and her father\u2019s death. Otherwise, Julia feared she would\u2019ve ended up in a mental ward.</p><p>Other emotions long buried and ignored came to the surface, as well. Kissing Alek had stirred up needs and desires she\u2019d assumed were lost to her.</p><p>There were no answers, at least none she felt confident enough to face. Only myriad questions that assailed her on every front. She couldn\u2019t trust herself; her power to discern had been sadly lacking once and had cost her and her family dearly. She dared not trust herself a second time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was married to a man she didn\u2019t love, a man who didn\u2019t love her, either. To complicate everything, her grandmother was dying. This was what her life had come down to. A loveless marriage and a desperate loneliness.</p><p>When Julia released her grandmother, Ruth looked up and brushed the tears from Julia\u2019s cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re crying?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cThis should be the happiest day of your life.\u201d</p><p>Alek placed his arm around Julia\u2019s waist and helped her into the chair next to the bed. He stood behind her, his hands resting lightly on her shoulders. Julia pressed Ruth\u2019s hand to her cheek and held it there. Her grandmother seemed much weaker today.</p><p>\u201cI remember when I married Louis,\u201d she said with a wistful smile.</p> <p>Her grandfather had been dead many years now. He was only a vague memory to Julia, who guessed she\u2019d been about seven or eight when he died.</p><p>\u201cI was frightened out of my wits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrightened?\u201d Julia didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if I was doing the right thing. There were very few divorces in those days and if a woman happened to marry the wrong man, she was often sentenced to a miserable life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you\u2019d known him for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth arched one delicate brow. \u201cA long time?\u201d she repeated. \u201cIn a manner of speaking, you\u2019re right. But we\u2019d only gone out on a handful of dates before we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d always assumed you knew Grandpa for years.\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s hand stroked Julia\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s true that in the early days Louis worked for my father at the paint company my family owned. I\u2019d see him now and then when I dropped in at the office, but those times were rare.\u201d</p><p>Julia was enthralled. She knew her grandmother had deeply loved her grandfather, but she couldn\u2019t remember ever hearing the story of their courtship.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you fall in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouis stopped working for my father, and Dad was furious with him. They were both strong-willed men and it seemed they were constantly disagreeing. Louis started his own business in direct competition with my family\u2019s.\u201d She smiled whimsically. \u201cIt was a bold move in those depression years, before the war. He managed to keep his head above water, which infuriated my father even more. I think at that point Dad would\u2019ve taken pleasure in seeing Louis fail.\u201d She paused and closed her eyes for a moment, as though to gather her strength.</p> <p>\u201cThen the war came and Louis joined the army. Before he left for England he came to the house. I thought he was there to see my father. Can you imagine my surprise when he said I was the one he\u2019d come to see? He told me he was going overseas and he asked if I\u2019d be willing to write him. Naturally I told him I would be, and then he did the strangest thing.\u201d</p><p>When Ruth didn\u2019t immediately continue, Julia prompted her. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>Ruth shook her head. \u201cIt was such a little thing and so very sweet, so much like Louis. He took my hand and kissed it.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s gaze fell to her hand, as if she still felt the imprint of his lips.</p><p>\u201cAs I look back on it,\u201d Ruth went on, \u201cI realize that was when I lost my heart to Louis. You see, I don\u2019t believe he ever expected to return from the war. He loved me then, he told me much later, and had for a long time, but Louis was afraid Dad would never approve of him as my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was he away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see him for three years, although I heard from him regularly. I treasured his letters and reread them so often I nearly wore them out. By the time he came home I was so deeply in love with him, nothing else mattered. My family knew how I felt and I feared the worst when Dad insisted on accompanying me to meet Louis\u2019s train.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>Ruth\u2019s smile was weak, but happy. \u201cDad offered to merge his business with Louis\u2019s. Even though Louis himself had been away, his small company had survived the war. Louis accepted, with the stipulation that both the company and I take on his name.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cIt was a...unique proposal. My father agreed without much hesitation\u2014and I agreed with none at all. We were married less than a month later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful story,\u201d Julia whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe had a wonderful life together, better than I dared dream. I\u2019ll never stop missing him.\u201d</p><p>Julia knew her grandmother had taken Louis\u2019s death hard. For a long while afterward, she\u2019d closed herself off from life. It was in those bleak years that Julia\u2019s father had wisely sent Julia and Jerry to spend the summers with their grandmother.</p><p>\u201cYou, my children,\u201d Ruth continued, turning to Alek, \u201cwill have a good life, too. Alek, be gentle with my lamb. Her heart\u2019s been bruised, and she can be a bit...prickly, but all she needs is love and patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d</p><p>Ruth chuckled and gestured with her hand. \u201cOff with you now. You don\u2019t want to spend your wedding night with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Julia murmured as Ruth settled back against the pillows. \u201cHave a good sleep, and I\u2019ll call you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a privilege to spend this time with you,\u201d Alek said. Reaching for her grandmother\u2019s hand, he bent down and kissed it. \u201cI would have liked your Louis,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe was a rare man of honor.\u201d</p><p>A smile coaxed up the corners of Ruth\u2019s mouth. \u201cIndeed he was. When we first married, there was talk, there always seemed to be talk. Some folks said Louis had married me for my connections, for the money I would one day inherit. Few realized the truth. I was the fortunate one to be loved by such a man.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked at Alek, but when their eyes met, she quickly glanced away.</p><p>\u201cNow go,\u201d Ruth urged. \u201cThis is your wedding night.\u201d</p><p>The words echoed in Julia\u2019s ears. Her grandfather had been a man of honor, but she clearly hadn\u2019t inherited his grit or his honesty. She planned to cheat Alek and he was about to learn exactly how much.</p><p>Julia had surprised him. Alek had misjudged this woman who was now his wife. For two years he\u2019d studied her, astonished by her tenacity. Jerry had told him little of what had led to the company\u2019s financial problems. Ever since his arrival, he\u2019d picked up bits and pieces of what had happened, but no one had explained the events that had brought near ruin. From what he understood, Conrad Industries had come very close to introducing a long-lasting exterior paint with a twenty-five-year guarantee. Jerome Conrad, Jerry and Julia\u2019s father, had been a chemist, too, and he\u2019d been personally involved in developing it. The company was on the brink of making one of the most innovative and progressive advances in the industry. This high-tech development was expected to have a dynamic impact on sales and give Conrad Industries a badly needed financial boost. The company had been set for expansion, confident of success. Then a series of mishaps occurred.</p><p>This was the part that remained vague to Alek. He\u2019d heard something about a burglary and a defection to a rival company. But by far the worst was a huge fire that had destroyed the lab and the warehouse. Not until much later had they learned the fire was arson.</p><p>An employee was suspected. That much he\u2019d been told by Jerry. But there wasn\u2019t enough proof to prosecute whoever it had been. Shortly after the fire, Jerry and Julia\u2019s father had suffered a heart attack and died. It was then that Julia had taken over the company. They\u2019d struggled for a year, trying to recover lost ground, before Jerry made the arrangements to bring Alek from Russia. Since that time he\u2019d been working hard on implementing his ideas.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet,\u201d Julia commented, breaking into his thoughts.</p><p>He glanced over at his bride. Her nervousness didn\u2019t escape him. He wanted to do whatever was necessary to put her at ease. He\u2019d enjoyed listening to the story of Ruth and Louis Conrad\u2019s love. It had touched his heart, reminding him of his own grandparents, long dead. They\u2019d loved each other deeply and he could have asked for no finer heritage. His grandfather had died first and his grandmother had followed less than a year later. His mother claimed her mother-in-law had succumbed to a broken heart.</p><p>Julia shifted restlessly in the car. He caught the movement from the corner of his eye and wondered about this woman he\u2019d begun to love. He\u2019d been observing her for two years; he knew her far better than she could possibly grasp. And he\u2019d known the instant Jerry had suggested they marry that he would accept nothing less than total commitment from her. He was not a man who did things by half measures. He looked forward to the time he would sleep with his wife. He\u2019d sensed fire in her, but hadn\u2019t realized how hot the flames were until they\u2019d kissed. Really kissed.</p><p>No woman had ever affected him as strongly as Julia. The kisses had enhanced his appetite for what was to follow. He would be patient with her. Careful and slow. Although every instinct insisted he take her to his bed now, do away with her fretting and worry so they could enjoy the rest of the evening together. He must be patient, he reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to go for dinner?\u201d he asked. He suggested a couple of his favorite restaurants.</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d she echoed, as though she hadn\u2019t given the matter a second thought. \u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if we went to my...our condo?\u201d In one of their few practical conversations, they\u2019d agreed that he\u2019d move into her place; his own apartment had been a furnished rental, so there hadn\u2019t been much to bring over\u2014just books, his computer, clothes and a few personal effects. He had a small moving company take care of it and continued to pay rent on the place so his sister, Anna, could eventually move in there.</p><p>Alek\u2019s nod was eager. She would relax there and\u2014what was the American term\u2014unwind? Yes, she would unwind so that when the time came for them to retreat to the bedroom, she\u2019d be warm with wine and eager for his touch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to send out for something,\u201d Julia announced when they reached the high-rise condominium. It was situated in the heart of downtown Seattle on the tenth floor, overlooking Puget Sound. A white-and-green ferry could be seen in the distance. The jagged peaks of the Olympic Mountains rose majestically to the west. The day had been clear and bright, but now the sun was setting, casting a pink glow over the landscape.</p><p>\u201cSend out?\u201d he repeated, frowning.</p><p>Julia stood in the middle of her modern home and clasped her hands in front of her. \u201cI don\u2019t cook much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Now he understood. \u201cI am excellent in the kitchen.\u201d In the bedroom, too, but he couldn\u2019t say that without embarrassing her. She would learn that soon enough.</p><p>\u201cYou want to make our dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, pulling his attention from the magnificent view and following her into the kitchen. He liked her home. The living room was long and narrow with windows that extended the full length. The dining room and kitchen were both compact, as if their importance was minimal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like a glass of white wine?\u201d Julia asked him.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d While she was busy with the wine, he explored his new home. A narrow hallway led to two bedrooms. The larger was dominated by a king-size bed, covered with a bright blue comforter and what seemed like a hundred small pillows. The scent of flowers, violets he guessed, hung in the air. The second bedroom was much smaller and the closet was filled with boxes. A quick examination revealed Christmas decorations.</p><p>He returned to the kitchen and took the wineglass from his wife\u2019s hand. Her eyes, so large and dark, appealed to him, but for what he wasn\u2019t sure. One thing was certain: Alek knew he couldn\u2019t wait much longer to make love to her.</p><p>Julia felt like a fox about to be released for the hunt. She would soon be cornered, trapped by her own lies. Alek didn\u2019t realize, at least not yet, that she had no intention of sleeping with him. So far he\u2019d been patient and kind, but she couldn\u2019t count on his goodwill lasting.</p> <p>\u201cI found a couple of chicken breasts in the freezer,\u201d she told him. She felt as though she was in danger of swallowing her heart. She was pretending for all she was worth, acting the role of devoted wife, when she was anything but. \u201cI\u2019ll make a salad.\u201d</p><p>He was searching through her drawers, stopping when he came across an old cloth dish towel. He tucked it at his waist and continued to survey her cupboards, taking out a series of ingredients.</p><p>He\u2019d chopped an onion, a green pepper and several mushrooms by the time she dragged a stool to the counter. Perhaps she\u2019d learn something about cooking from him. She\u2019d seen Alek working in the laboratory. But now he astonished her with the familiar way he moved about her kitchen, as if this was truly his second home.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you learn to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a boy. My mother insisted and I enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank her for me.\u201d</p><p>Alek paused and, glancing her way, smiled. \u201cYou can do that yourself someday. I\u2019m doing what I can to arrange for her immigration to the States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf...there\u2019s anything I can do, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, seemingly pleased by her offer.</p><p>Julia drank her wine and refilled both their glasses. Her mind was working at a frantic pace, devising ways of delaying the inevitable moment when he\u2019d learn the truth. Her original plan had been to get him drunk. Two glasses of wine and she was feeling light-headed and a bit tipsy. Alek had consumed the same amount and was completely sober. He wielded a large knife without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>Her next thought was to appeal to his sense of honor. A strange tactic, she had to admit, coming from a woman who planned on cheating him out of an intimate relationship. He must recognize that she didn\u2019t love him. This was a business arrangement that profited them both; turning it into something personal could ruin everything.</p> <p>The kiss. She must\u2019ve been mad to let him kiss her like that. She\u2019d done nothing to resist him. Instead she\u2019d encouraged him, led him to believe she welcomed his touch.</p><p>She\u2019d been shaken afterward. It shouldn\u2019t have happened. The very fact that she\u2019d permitted him to hold her and touch her in such an intimate manner defeated her own purpose. Anger rose within her, not at Alek, but at herself for having let things go so far. Now he expected more, and she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t allow it. She was angry, too, about the enjoyment she\u2019d found in his arms. It was as if she\u2019d been looking for a way to prove herself as a woman, to show him\u2014and everyone else\u2014that she was more feminine than they\u2019d suspected.</p><p>Her foolishness had only complicated an already difficult situation.</p><p>\u201cMore wine?\u201d she asked nervously. The rice was cooking in a covered pot and the chicken was simmering in a delicious-smelling sauce. Alek appeared relaxed and at ease while Julia calculated how many steps it would take to reach the front door.</p><p>Alek shook his head. \u201cNo more wine for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set the table,\u201d she said, slipping down from the stool and moving into the dining room. Soon he\u2019d know. Soon he\u2019d discover what a phony she was. He\u2019d learn that she was a liar and a cheat and a coward.</p><p>Her hands were trembling as she set the silverware on the table. She added water glasses, anything to delay returning to the kitchen. To Alek.</p><p>He\u2019d filled up their plates when she walked back into the room. Julia didn\u2019t know if she could eat a single bite, and she watched transfixed as he carried their meal into the dining room.</p> <p>\u201cJulia, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your love,\u201d she told him coolly, leaning back against the kitchen counter.</p><p>His grin was slow. Undisturbed. \u201cNot yet, perhaps, but you will be.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, afraid to imagine what might come next.</p><p>\u201cLet us eat,\u201d Alek said, taking her unresisting hand and leading her to a chair. With impeccable manners, he held it out for her, then seated himself.</p><p>\u201cThis is very nice,\u201d she said. The smells were heavenly. In other circumstances she would have appreciated his culinary skills.</p><p>\u201cMy sister is an excellent cook,\u201d he said casually. He removed the linen napkin from the table and spread it across his lap. \u201cIf you agree, she will prepare our meals once she arrives from Russia. She\u2019ll welcome the job and it\u2019ll simplify her receiving a visa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course...\u201d Julia was more than willing to be generous with his family.</p><p>\u201cYou are nervous?\u201d Alek asked, after several bites. Julia hadn\u2019t managed even one taste.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cUnderstandably. Don\u2019t worry, I will be gentle with you.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart plummeted.</p><p>\u201cI admire you, Julia. It isn\u2019t any woman who would accept the terms of our marriage. You are brave as well as beautiful. I feel fortunate to have married you.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Julia vaulted to her feet, startling Alek. Her hand clutched the pink linen napkin as though it were a life-line, and her dark eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it! I can\u2019t go through with it... You expect me to share a bed and for us to live like a normal married couple, but I just can\u2019t do it. I lied...everything\u2019s a lie. I\u2019m sorry, Alek, truly sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to my terms,\u201d he reminded her without rancor. She was pale and trembling and it disturbed him to see her in such emotional torment. He would have liked to take her in his arms and comfort her, but he could see she wouldn\u2019t welcome his touch.</p><p>\u201cI was overwrought. I...I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. Everything happened so fast.\u201d</p><p>Alek considered her words and slowly shook his head. \u201cYou knew.\u201d</p><p>She retreated a couple of steps. \u201cI\u2019ve had a change of heart. It\u2019s understandable, given the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>It pained him to see her so distraught, but she\u2019d willingly agreed to his stipulations, and there\u2019d been ample opportunity for her to speak her mind before the wedding. Calmly he pointed this out.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to go through with the ceremony, but you did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wanted this marriage, but you refuse to admit it even to yourself.\u201d He stared at her, demanding that she relent and recognize her foolishness. They were married, and she was his wife. There was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cI...I felt I had no choice. Jerry was convinced that marrying you was the only way to keep you in the country. My grandmother\u2019s dying and she likes you, believes in you, and it seemed, I don\u2019t know, it just felt like the right thing to do at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now it doesn\u2019t?\u201d he asked calmly, despite his mounting frustration.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel the least bit right.\u201d</p><p>Alek rubbed his hand over his chin as he contemplated her words. \u201cYou Americans have many sayings I do not understand. There is one expression I remember and it seems to fit this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHogwash.\u201d</p><p>Julia went speechless. Once she\u2019d composed herself, she tilted her head regally and glared at him. Alek suspected she used this cold, haughty regard to intimidate those who dared to differ with her. A mere look was incapable of daunting him or distracting him from his purpose. It was apparent his bride had much to learn about him.</p><p>\u201cHave you so little pride,\u201d she asked disdainfully, \u201cthat you\u2019d hold me to an agreement I made when I was emotionally distraught?\u201d</p><p>Alek was impressed with her ability to twist an argument. \u201cPride,\u201d he echoed slowly. \u201cI am a proud man. But what are you, Julia? Have you so little honor that you would renege on an agreement made in good faith and expect me to accept weak excuses?\u201d</p><p>Her face reddened and she slumped into her chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fulfilled my part of the bargain,\u201d he continued. \u201cIs it wrong or unjust to expect you to live up to yours? I think not. You have what you wanted, what you needed. Therefore, shouldn\u2019t you satisfy my demands?\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him and even though an entire room separated them, Alek could feel the heat of her outrage. \u201cYou ask too much,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cAll I ask is that you be my wife\u2014share my life and bear our children.\u201d</p><p>Tears marked her pale cheeks. \u201cYou have every right to be angry, every right to curse me, but I can\u2019t be your wife the way you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late to change your mind.\u201d His voice was flat and hard. \u201cWe are married. You spoke your vows, you signed your name to the document. There is no turning back now. I suggest you forget this foolishness and finish your meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease try to understand. This isn\u2019t easy for me, either. I\u2019ve been sick with guilt. I don\u2019t want to cheat you...I never wanted that.\u201d</p><p>Alek sighed, his patience shrinking. \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound like a disobedient child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re correct about one thing,\u201d she said, gesturing beseechingly with her hands. \u201cI should\u2019ve said something sooner. I should never have gone through with the ceremony, but it\u2019s not too late. I\u2019m saying something now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are married.\u201d He sat down at the table and reached for his fork. He refused to give her the satisfaction of thinking her arguments had troubled him.</p><p>In abject frustration, Julia threw her hands in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said readily enough. \u201cBut you are my wife and, as you yourself have agreed, you shall remain so.\u201d</p><p>Without another word she stormed out of the dining room. He heard her in the kitchen banging around pots and pans, but couldn\u2019t tell what she was doing. He finished his meal, although his appetite had long since deserted him.</p><p>He heard her trying to make a phone call, but whoever she called didn\u2019t answer. From his chair he witnessed her frustration when he saw her replace the receiver and lean her forehead against the wall.</p><p>His dinner finished, Alek returned to the kitchen to find Julia busily rinsing dishes and placing them in the dishwasher.</p><p>She ignored him for several minutes, until he said, \u201cShall we prepare for bed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia froze, then turned and stared at him. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Each word was spoken slowly, as if he didn\u2019t understand English.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered thoughtfully. \u201cI am a husband. Yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Alek,\u201d she said, her face pale, her voice shaking. \u201cI know I should\u2019ve spoken up before the ceremony.... I\u2019ve put in a call to my brother. As soon as possible I\u2019ll make whatever arrangements are necessary to have our marriage annulled.\u201d</p><p>Alek didn\u2019t swallow the bait. Jerry Conrad was not only his friend but an attorney and had sanctioned this marriage with his sister. In fact, he\u2019d encouraged it from the beginning.</p> <p>Although Jerry hadn\u2019t shared his concerns with Alek, he was convinced Julia\u2019s brother was worried about her. Whenever Jerry mentioned Julia\u2019s name his eyes clouded. After working with her these past two years, Alek understood her brother\u2019s anxiety. She was aggressive, domineering and driven. In themselves those weren\u2019t negative attributes, especially for a woman in a competitive business, but Alek had noticed something else. Julia Conrad had closed off her life from everything that didn\u2019t involve Conrad Industries. Perhaps he was a fool, but Alek saw this woman as a challenge. More than that, he liked Julia and with very little effort could find himself in love with her. Already he admired her and was attracted to her; he longed for the day she\u2019d feel the same about him.</p><p>No, Alek reasoned, Jerry wouldn\u2019t give in to her dictates. He would be unemotional, reasonable. Alek knew they couldn\u2019t count on the same behavior from Julia. Smiling to himself, he decided he rather looked forward to the battle of wills.</p><p>Alek had met Jerry years earlier while the young American had traveled across Europe. Together they\u2019d spent a restless day in a train station. Eager to learn what he could of America, Alek had questioned him and found they shared several interests. Alek had liked Jerry. They\u2019d corresponded over the years and Alek had shared his frustration with his country and his work. Jerry had offered Alek employment soon after the fire that had nearly destroyed Conrad Industries. It had taken them almost a year to secure the necessary visa for him to live in the United States.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Julia asked. \u201cI\u2019m arranging an annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not your love,\u201d she cried, sounding close to tears.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not now,\u201d he returned confidently, \u201cbut you will be soon. Sooner than you realize. Ah, Julia,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will have such marvelous children....\u201d</p><p>Alek knew when her eyes drifted shut that she wasn\u2019t envisioning their offspring, but was desperately fighting to hold on to her temper. Once she accepted their marriage, he told himself, she would be a splendid lover. Already he\u2019d experienced the passion that simmered within her. Soon, in her own time, she would come to him\u2014and he\u2019d be waiting.</p><p>Alek sauntered back into the living room, turned on the television and sat back to watch the nightly news.</p><p>No man had ever infuriated her more. Julia had needed every ounce of courage she\u2019d ever possessed to confront him with the truth. But he\u2019d been so blas\u00e9 about it, as if he\u2019d expected her to default on their agreement. As if he\u2019d been calmly waiting for her to defy him.</p><p>Then to have him casually announce it was too late to change her mind? That was too much! She\u2019d rather rot in jail than make love to such an uncaring, ill-tempered, scheming\u2014</p> <p>Suddenly she felt tired. If anyone had been scheming, she was the one. Exhaustion permeated her bones, and it was almost more than she could do to finish the dishes. Alek sat in her living room, watching television. Undaunted. Confident. Sure of himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d she said shakily, praying he wouldn\u2019t follow her.</p><p>Alek reached for the remote and turned off the television. He was on his feet, trailing her into the master bedroom, before she had time to protest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very tired.\u201d Her eyes pleaded with him. If she couldn\u2019t reason with him, then perhaps she could evoke sympathy. Bottom-of-the-barrel compassion was all she had left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, as well.\u201d He stood at the opposite side of her bed and unfastened the buttons of his shirt.</p><p>Julia felt like weeping. \u201cYou expect to sleep in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her voice cracked.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t pause in his movements, tugging the shirt free from his waist.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d Her words were low and barely audible.</p><p>He turned back the bed covers. \u201cWe are married, Julia, and we will share this room. You needn\u2019t worry that I will make any unwelcome...advances. I\u2019m certain that in time you\u2019ll come to me. You will, you know, and when you do, I\u2019ll be waiting. I can be patient when the prize is of such high value.\u201d</p><p>The presumptuousness of the man continued to astound her. \u201cI can\u2019t...sleep with you,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI am not a monster, Julia, but a man.\u201d He stopped and looked at her as if expecting her to argue further.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d she cried, nearly hysterical. \u201cI\u2019ve cheated you and lied to you. Why do you still want me? You should be glad to be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife.\u201d</p><p>It demanded all of Julia\u2019s energy just to hold up her head. This man confused her and she lacked the resources to go on arguing.</p><p>He pulled back the sheets and rearranged the pillows on his side of the bed, making certain she understood that he wouldn\u2019t be dissuaded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think clearly,\u201d she said, holding her hands to her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep in the guest bedroom.\u201d</p><p>His disappointment was obvious. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, then.\u201d</p><p>Listlessly she moved around the foot of the single bed. She\u2019d made a mess of this marriage from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d His voice was softly accented and warmly masculine. Something in the way he said her name gave her pause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said before he could speak. She could hear the tears in her voice.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. For another failure. For dragging him into a loveless marriage with a cold, unwilling wife. For countless unconfessed sins.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spent today and many others before it fighting yourself. You\u2019re weary of the battle, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded. He was behind her, moving closer. She should leave now, walk away from him before he started to make sense, before he convinced her there was hope. She couldn\u2019t allow it to happen, because ultimately she would disappoint him. Even hurt him.</p><p>\u201cI am your husband,\u201d he whispered once more as he turned her into his arms. \u201cLet me carry your burdens and lighten your load. I\u2019m here to be your helpmate, your friend, your lover. Let me take care of you, Julia. Let me love you.\u201d As he spoke, his mouth was drawing closer and closer to hers, until their breath mingled.</p><p>As hard as she tried, Julia couldn\u2019t dredge up a single protest when his mouth settled firmly on hers. He kissed her the way a woman dreams a man will kiss her, with a tenderness that touched some long-hidden spark within her.</p><p>And then...he altered the kiss, making it hot and fierce. He buried his hands deep in her hair.</p><p>Alek sighed and her name spilled from his lips. His voice was filled with need. With unbridled desire.</p><p>\u201cBe my wife.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes fluttered open. It took her a second to comprehend what he\u2019d said. When she did, she stared at him, unable to speak. Her heart was pounding, tapping out a dire warning. One she should heed.</p><p>\u201cI...need time.\u201d</p><p>He continued to hold her gaze. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and she bit her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the short end of the stick with me, Alek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort end of the stick?\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. \u201cIt means you\u2019re getting less than you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be the judge of that. As I said, in time you\u2019ll come to me of your own accord. In time you\u2019ll want me as much as I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many things you don\u2019t know about me,\u201d she said, her words so low he had to strain to hear.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust remember, I warned you.\u201d</p><p>He released her, maintaining their contact as long as possible. His hands slid down the full length of her arms and, catching her fingers, he held on to the tips with his own.</p><p>\u201cGood night, my wife,\u201d he whispered, then turned away. \u201cI shall be lonely without you.\u201d</p><p>Julia left the room quickly, knowing that if she stayed a moment longer, she\u2019d end up in the bed next to Alek....</p><p>Julia found it surprisingly easy to avoid Alek. Their schedules were different and they drove to work in separate cars. She left for the office early, before he awoke. In the afternoons she visited her grandmother, then ate a quiet meal by herself. She was usually preparing for bed about the time Alek returned from the lab.</p><p>He was working long, hard hours, getting ready to put his latest research into production. From the weekly reports he sent her, she knew that they were speeding ahead; the marketing and distribution plans for Phoenix Paints were under way. The advertising blitz had yet to be decided, but that was coming. Everything looked promising.</p><p>But then, it had looked promising three years ago, too. Yet within the course of a single week she\u2019d lost her father, been betrayed by the man she loved and nearly destroyed a business that had been in the family for four generations.</p><p>Julia had learned harsh but valuable lessons about promises. Probably the most painful lessons of her life. She\u2019d come away convinced she could trust only a cherished few. Equally important, she\u2019d learned never, ever to cash in on mere potential. The promise of a check in the mail wasn\u2019t money in the bank.</p><p>Dear heavens, she mused as she left the office, she was becoming very philosophical. Perhaps that was what marriage did to a woman.</p><p>Marriage.</p><p>Even the word sounded strange to her. She was married for better or worse. Married. After her tirade on their wedding night, when she\u2019d pleaded, threatened and tried to reason with Alek, she\u2019d decided he was right. There was no backing out now. They were married, for better or worse.</p><p>Her decision was prompted by a certain amount of pride. Jerry had made sure the news of their wedding was carried by the local newspapers. The business community and their acquaintances would know about her marriage. It would be acutely embarrassing to seek an annulment so soon after the ceremony.</p><p>Mentally she added vanity to her growing list of character defects.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Ruth said weakly when she entered the hospital room, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Julia grinned as she leaned forward to kiss her grandmother\u2019s pale cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek will never forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek is hard at work,\u201d she assured Ruth.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re newlyweds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia\u2019s gaze skirted past her grandmother\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s been so busy lately. I\u2019d rather spend time with you than go home to an empty apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about you,\u201d Ruth said, her voice growing weaker.</p><p>\u201cWorry?\u201d Julia repeated. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. Our schedules are hectic just now. Coming here is the best thing for me.... That way, when Alek gets home, I\u2019m calm and relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He\u2019s such a dear boy. You married well.... I so want you to be happy\u2014it\u2019s what you deserve. Your season of pain is past now that you have Alek.\u201d</p> <p>Julia wanted to avoid the subject of her husband. \u201cWould you like me to read to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. From the book of Psalms, if you would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Julia reached for the well-worn Bible and sat in the chair next to her grandmother\u2019s bed and began. She read long past the moment Ruth had fallen asleep. Long past the dinner hour. Long past the time she should leave for home.</p><p>The night was hot and muggy, the air heavy. Her air-conditioning system must not be working properly because it felt like the hottest night of the year. Even her skimpy, baby-doll pajamas seemed clammy and constricting.</p><p>Sleep seemed just beyond her grasp no matter how hard she tried to capture it. The night was still and dark, and she flopped from her side to her back, then onto her side once more, attempting to find the touch of a cool breeze. But there was none.</p> <p>Another hour passed and she gave up the effort. Getting out of bed, she moved into the living room, standing in front of the window. A few scattered lights flickered from Puget Sound. The last ferry crossing before dawn, she guessed, on its way to Winslow on Bainbridge Island.</p><p>The lights from Alki Point gleamed in the distance.</p><p>Julia had no idea how long she stood there, looking into the still, dark night. Raising her arms high above her head, she stretched, standing on her toes. The thin fabric of her pajama top rustled. Her hair felt damp and heavy and she lifted the long tresses from the back of her neck. She shook her head, sending a spray of hair in a circle around her face.</p><p>She heard the briefest of noises behind her and whirled around to see a shadow unfold from the chair. Alek stood. He wore only the bottom half of his pajamas and his hard chest glistened in the muted light.</p><p>\u201cAlek,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, either,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cHow...long have you been here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t spying on you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re insinuating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...you startled me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again and watched as his jaw tightened at her refusal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore me the rest of your life. We made a bargain, which has yet to be fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>Why he chose to bring up the subject of their marriage now, Julia didn\u2019t know. They\u2019d lived peacefully together for nearly two weeks, barely seeing each other, rarely talking. She\u2019d almost convinced herself they could continue like this forever.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about our marriage.\u201d</p> <p>She sensed that his irritation turned to amusement. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t imagine you do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...I didn\u2019t mean to snap at you. It\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t realize you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I forgive you. Now sit and we can talk.\u201d</p><p>Julia hesitated, then decided it would do more harm than good to refuse him. She sank onto the sofa across from him. Holding a decorative pillow to her stomach helped ease her discomfort over her state of undress, although not by much.</p><p>\u201cHow is your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the same. I talked to her doctor this afternoon and he said...\u201d She paused, biting her lip. \u201cHe said we shouldn\u2019t expect her to return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sometimes, although she tries to hide it from me. Listen, do you mind if we don\u2019t talk about Ruth, either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I didn\u2019t mean to bring up a subject that causes you distress.\u201d</p><p>Julia lowered her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...she\u2019s so important to me. Ruth\u2019s all the family Jerry and I have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother died years ago, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Julia wasn\u2019t surprised he knew that, since he and Jerry had been friends since her brother\u2019s college days, when they\u2019d met in Europe. \u201cWhen I was fifteen, and as you probably recall, my father,\u201d she added, \u201cdied three years ago...shortly after the fire.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched between them. Julia\u2019s pressure on the pillow increased. Even in the darkened room, she could feel his smoldering gaze move caressingly over her. He wanted her and was growing impatient. Her heart pounded with dread and some other emotion. Regret? Perhaps...yearning?</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d she begged. It seemed as if his eyes were about to devour her. He wanted her to know how much he longed to make love to her. The memory of his kisses returned to haunt her and she tried to dispel the image before it took root in her mind and her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard those meaningless words before. Beauty was fleeting and counted for little of real value in life. Being outwardly attractive hadn\u2019t made her a better judge of character. It didn\u2019t do one iota of good as far as her grandmother\u2019s health was concerned. If anything, it had been a curse, because it attracted the wrong kind of man.</p><p>\u201cThis makes you sad?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cBeauty means nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wise to recognize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you mention it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were not beautiful, not in the same way, when we first met. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve come to appreciate that you are a real woman.\u201d</p><p>A real woman. Julia nearly laughed aloud. \u201cThis is what makes being married to you and not sleeping with you so difficult. Have you reconsidered yet, my love? Come with me, share my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t, please don\u2019t ask me.\u201d Her response was immediate. Tossing the pillow aside, she leapt to her feet, needing to escape. \u201cGood night, Alek.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer and she didn\u2019t look back as she rushed to her room. Her heart was roaring in her ears when she reached the bed. Not for the first time she felt like the fox in an English hunt, and the baying of the hounds was closing in on her.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d</p><p>She nearly fell off the bed when she looked up and found Alek framed in her doorway. Her breath froze in her lungs.</p><p>\u201cSomeday you won\u2019t run from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t running from you.\u201d It was a lie and they both knew it, yet Julia persisted in claiming otherwise.</p><p>His smile was more than a little cocky. \u201cSomeday you will come to me voluntarily.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to argue with him. He watched her closely in the muted moonlight and she studied him with equal intensity. She suddenly realized her top had inched up and exposed her breasts. Furiously she tugged it down, glaring at him as though he\u2019d purposely arranged the immodest display.</p><p>He smiled roguishly at her. \u201cAs I said earlier, you are very beautiful.\u201d Then he turned and left.</p><p>After a sleepless, frustrating night, Julia was in no mood to deal with a long list of complicated problems. Virginia, her middle-aged assistant, looked apologetic when Julia arrived at the office early the next morning.</p><p>\u201cPlease get my brother on the line when you can,\u201d Julia said. Her mind was made up. She wanted out of this farce of a marriage.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already called for you.\u201d Virginia hugged a file folder against her chest. \u201cHe asked that you call him the moment you got here.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached for her phone and punched out the extension. Jerry answered on the first ring. \u201cCome down to my office,\u201d he said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>This morning was quickly going from bad to worse, much like her life. She paused, catching herself. Her thoughts hadn\u2019t always been this negative. When had it started? The wedding? No, she decided\u2014long before then. Three years before... She wondered why she was so aware of it now.</p><p>She rounded the corner that led to the suite of offices her brother occupied on the floor below her own.</p><p>\u201cJerry, what\u2019s this all about?\u201d she asked before she noticed Alek. She halted when she saw her husband sitting in one of the visitor\u2019s chairs, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d Her brother motioned toward Alek.</p><p>Julia did as he asked. Jerry paced back and forth behind his desk. \u201cI was contacted this morning by the Immigration people. I knew this would happen, I just didn\u2019t expect it to be quite so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being investigated?\u201d Alek murmured.</p><p>Jerry nodded. \u201cThe two of you are going to have to convince them you\u2019re madly in love. Do you think you can do it?\u201d</p><p>Julia saw that he focused his gaze on her. \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alek responded without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cJulia, what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d She\u2019d never been good with pretense.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll convince them.\u201d Alek revealed far more confidence in her than she had in herself. \u201cIt won\u2019t take much effort.\u201d He reached for her hand, gripping it in his own. \u201cAll we need is a little practice, isn\u2019t that right, Julia?\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Only seconds earlier Julia had decided she wanted to end this charade of a marriage, no matter what the price. Just when it seemed that very thing was about to happen, she discovered herself willing to do whatever was necessary to keep their relationship intact.</p><p>Counseling. That was what she needed, Julia thought. Intensive counseling. She wasn\u2019t an indecisive woman; that would be a death knell for someone in her position. Generally she knew what she wanted and went after it with a determination that left everyone in her wake shaking their heads in wonder.</p><p>It was Aleksandr who managed to discomfit and confuse her. It was Alek who made her feel as though she was walking through quicksand.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d Jerry turned the full force of his attention on her. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d</p><p>Both men were studying her. Could she pretend to be in love with Alek? Pretend her happiness hinged on spending the rest of her life with him? Could she?</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I repeat what\u2019s at stake here?\u201d Jerry muttered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t necessary; he\u2019d gone over the consequences of their actions when he\u2019d proposed the idea of marrying Alek in the first place. The government did much more than frown upon such unions. There was the possibility of jail time if they weren\u2019t able to persuade the Immigration department of their sincerity.</p><p>\u201cJulia knows,\u201d Alek assured Jerry calmly. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fully aware of what could happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine and dandy, but can you be convincing enough to satisfy the Immigration people?\u201d Jerry demanded.</p><p>She nodded slowly, thoughtfully. It wasn\u2019t just a question of being able to pull this off with the finesse required; it also meant lowering her guard, opening her heart to the truth. She was attracted to him, both physically and emotionally. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have participated in or enjoyed the few times they\u2019d kissed. The most important factor wasn\u2019t her ability to fool Immigration, but resurrecting the shield protecting her against the pull she felt toward Alek.</p><p>To complicate matters, the attachment she felt was growing stronger every day. She often found herself thinking about him. Hard as it was to admit, Julia had discovered she enjoyed his company and looked forward to the short time they spent together in the evenings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Jerry asked, sounding as if he thought she was anything but.</p> <p>\u201cPositive,\u201d she said, chancing a look in Alek\u2019s direction. He caught her eye and smiled reassuringly. Taking her hand, he squeezed her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do just fine,\u201d Alek said to Jerry. \u201cWait and see. What both of you fail to realize is that Julia and I did marry for love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop pacing,\u201d Alek said, more testily than he intended. The Immigration officer was due in fifteen minutes and Julia was understandably nervous. Unable to sit still, she stalked the living room.</p><p>\u201cWalking helps take my mind off the interview,\u201d Julia snapped back.</p><p>The tension between them was thick enough to slice and serve for dinner. That would hurt their case more than anything they said or did. The man or woman doing the interview would sense the strain immediately and count it against them.</p> <p>\u201cYou should know more about me,\u201d Julia said, whirling around to face him as if this was a new thought. \u201cThe brand of toothpaste I use and stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.... That\u2019s exactly the kind of questions he\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, my love,\u201d he said patiently, \u201ca man doesn\u2019t pay attention to such things. Now relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so calm?\u201d Julia shrugged, raising both hands. \u201cOur future hinges on the outcome of this meeting. There\u2019s a very real possibility I could go to jail for involving myself in this...marriage.\u201d Her arms seemed to have lost their purpose and fell lifelessly to her sides. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who has a lot at stake with this. Your mother and sister\u2019s plans depend on the outcome, as well. Didn\u2019t you mention you\u2019ve already seen to the necessary paperwork for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen how can you be so calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery simple, my love.\u201d He said this evenly and without emotion as he leaned forward, clasped her around the waist and brought her down into his lap.</p><p>Julia struggled at first. \u201cStop,\u201d she said, wriggling against him. \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d</p><p>He let her struggle, but her efforts were weak. His arms were around her and he felt her yielding. Taking advantage of her acquiescence, he brushed his face against her hair. She\u2019d left it down, at his request, and he gathered the length of it in his hands, loving its clean jasmine scent.</p><p>\u201cAlek, are you insane?\u201d</p><p>He dropped a trail of moist kisses along her throat and shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he whispered as her tight muscles relaxed. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think we should be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as his hand caressed her back in a slow, soothing motion. \u201cThis?\u201d He eased her against the chair until her hair spilled over his arm. A sigh escaped her as he pressed his lips to hers.</p> <p>Julia felt hot, then cold and shaky in his embrace, but no more so than he. They\u2019d kissed a handful of times and each had been a battle for him. His wife had balked at his touch in the beginning, then gradually she\u2019d opened herself to him until he was so needy he ached.</p><p>This time the skirmish between them was over even before it started. Julia accepted his kiss with little more than a token protest. Perhaps she was ready for more....</p><p>He broke off the kiss and told her how badly he needed her. He pleaded with her as only a man who needs his wife can implore. It wasn\u2019t until he saw the confusion in her eyes that he realized he\u2019d spoken in his native tongue. His English was hopeless just then.</p><p>Julia\u2019s fingers were digging into his shoulders. He felt the rapid beat of her heart and heard the ragged echo of her breath as it rasped in his ear.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Alek would have ignored it if Julia hadn\u2019t frozen and then jumped from his lap as though she\u2019d caught fire.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d she cried. Her face was a rich shade of red as she swept back her hair. \u201cThe interviewer is here.\u201d She stared at him as if he had the magical power to make everything right.</p><p>\u201cThat would be my guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek.\u201d Her voice shook as she quickly adjusted her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Everything will be fine,\u201d he said. He gave her a moment to fuss with her hair before he stood, kissed her lightly on the lips and answered the door.</p><p>Although Alek appeared outwardly composed, he was as shaken as Julia. And not because their future hung in the balance. His head reeled with the aftershock of their kissing. A few kisses, he\u2019d thought, to take the edge off their nervousness. In another five minutes, he would\u2019ve carried her to his bed....</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Alek said, opening the door to admit a lanky, official-looking gentleman. He wore a crisp business suit and from the tight set of his mouth, Alek guessed he would brook no foolishness. His expression was sharp and unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cPatrick O\u2019Dell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Alek and this is my wife, Julia,\u201d Alek said.</p><p>Julia stood on the far side of the room, her smile fleeting and strained. \u201cWelcome to our home, Mr. O\u2019Dell. Would you care to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He moved into the living room and didn\u2019t pause to look at the view. Indeed, there might not have been one for all the notice O\u2019Dell took. He sat on the recliner they\u2019d recently vacated and set his briefcase on the coffee table.</p><p>Alek walked over to Julia\u2019s side and held her hand in his. Together they ventured to the sofa opposite the interviewer and sat down.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Dell removed a file from his briefcase. He scanned the contents, then frowned with clear disapproval. \u201cHow did you two meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough my brother,\u201d Julia said quickly. \u201cHe\u2019d met Alek several years earlier while he was in Europe. They corresponded for a number of years and then after the fire...\u201d She hesitated and turned to Alek.</p><p>\u201cJerry offered me a job in this country almost three years ago. I\u2019ve lived here for the past two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your work.\u201d</p><p>Alek answered the questions thoroughly, while minimizing his importance to Conrad Industries. No need to raise suspicions.</p><p>\u201cAlek is a gifted biochemist,\u201d Julia added with unnecessary enthusiasm. \u201cThe company was nearly ruined a few years back following the fire I mentioned. I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve become of us if it hadn\u2019t been for Alek.\u201d</p><p>Although he smiled, Alek was groaning inwardly. Julia was offering far more information than necessary. He wished now that they\u2019d gone over what they planned to say. Jerry had advised them to do so, but Alek had felt spontaneity would serve them better than a series of practiced responses.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you needed Mr. Berinski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very much so.\u201d Julia was nothing if not honest.</p><p>\u201cDo you continue to need him?\u201d the interviewer pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alek answered before Julia could.</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d she returned, looking briefly at Alek. \u201cI find we need him more than ever now. The new line of paints Alek\u2019s been working on for the past two years is ready to be marketed. That\u2019s only the beginning of the ideas he\u2019s developing.\u201d</p><p>Alek\u2019s concern mounted as O\u2019Dell made a notation. Julia really was as bad at pretense as she\u2019d claimed.</p><p>\u201cMy husband has worked hard on this project. He deserves to reap the fruits of his labors.\u201d Fortunately, Julia didn\u2019t stumble over the word husband. She\u2019d said it a number of times since their marriage and it always seemed to cause her difficulty.</p><p>\u201cYou give me more credit than I deserve, my dear,\u201d he murmured, feeling they\u2019d dug themselves into a pit.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Julia said, obviously warming to her subject. \u201cAlek is a genius.\u201d</p><p>Another notation.</p><p>Alek squeezed Julia\u2019s fingers, willing her to stop speaking, but the more he tried to discourage her, the more she went on.</p><p>\u201cIf you two held each other in such high esteem, why did you wait until Alek\u2019s visa had almost expired before you agreed to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t always planned,\u201d Julia answered quickly. \u201cNo one completely understands matters of the heart, do they? I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d She glanced shyly toward Alek.</p><p>\u201cI understand why the Immigration department is suspicious of our marriage,\u201d Alek added. \u201cWe realized you would be when we decided to go ahead and marry. It didn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</p><p>Another notation, this one made with sharp jagged movements of his pen.</p><p>There were several more questions, which they answered as forthrightly as possible. Alek was uncertain of how well they were coming across. He\u2019d rarely heard Julia sound more animated and, to his surprise, sincere. When he\u2019d first learned of the interview, his biggest concern had been Julia, but now he suspected she\u2019d be his strongest asset.</p><p>If he was forced to return to Russia, Alek would go, because he had no other choice. He hadn\u2019t dwelled on the consequences, refusing to allow any negative suggestions to enter his mind. He realized as they were speaking how much he\u2019d hate to leave Julia.</p><p>\u201cI think that answers everything,\u201d O\u2019Dell said, closing his file and placing it back in his briefcase.</p><p>The unexpectedness of his announcement caught Alek off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Apparently Julia was as astonished as he was. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know what brand of toothpaste Alek uses or about his personal habits?\u201d</p><p>The official smiled for the first time. \u201cWe leave that sort of interrogation for the movies. It\u2019s obvious to me that you two care deeply for each other. I wish all my assignments were as easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I need to sign anything?\u201d Julia asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d O\u2019Dell said as he stood. \u201cI\u2019ll file my report by the end of the week. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any reason for us to be in further contact with you. I appreciate your agreeing to see me on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>Alek stood in order to escort Mr. O\u2019Dell to the door. Julia seemed to be in a state of shock. She sat on the sofa, her mouth hanging open, staring up at the official with a baffled, uncertain look.</p><p>\u201cThank you again for your trouble,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Dell said when Alek opened the front door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJulia and I should be the ones thanking you.\u201d</p><p>The two men exchanged handshakes. Alek closed the door with relief and leaned against the frame. He slowly expelled his breath.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d He whispered her name as he returned to the living room. She hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cWe did it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as though she was in a trance.</p> <p>\u201cYou were fantastic.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went to him and she blinked. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were straightforward and honest. At first I was worried. I thought you were giving him far more information than necessary. Then I realized that was what convinced him. You acted as though you had nothing to hide. As if our staying married meant all the world to you. It wasn\u2019t anything I said or did, it was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she repeated again, sounding close to tears.</p><p>Alek knelt down in front of her and took her hands. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>Sniffling, she shook her head. The ordeal had been a strain, but he was surprised by her response. Julia wasn\u2019t the type of woman to buckle easily. Nor did she weep without provocation. Something was definitely going on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked tenderly, resisting the urge to take her in his arms.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and she made an effort to blink them away. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go lie down for a while. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Alek didn\u2019t want her to leave. He was hoping they could pick up where they\u2019d left off before they were interrupted by O\u2019Dell\u2019s arrival. The craving she\u2019d created in him had yet to be satisfied. He wanted her to share his bed. She was his wife. They belonged together.</p><p>Alek had learned enough about Julia to know that she\u2019d come to him in her own time, when she was ready and not before. He prayed he had the patience to wait her out.</p><p>As she lay in her bed, pretending to nap, Julia realized it wasn\u2019t until the Immigration official had stood to leave that she\u2019d recognized how sincere she was in what she\u2019d told him. She\u2019d answered the questions as candidly as possible, becoming more fervent the longer she spoke. It had suddenly struck her that Alek was as important to her personally as he was to the company. Perhaps more so. That came as an unexpected shock.</p> <p>He\u2019d been patient and loving and kind. His kisses stirred her soul. That sounded fanciful, overdramatic, but she was at a loss to explain it otherwise.</p><p>Heaven help her, she was falling in love with him. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen this way. She didn\u2019t want to love him, didn\u2019t want to care about him. After Phoenix Paints was launched and he\u2019d established his mother and sister in the country, she wanted Alek out of her life. That was what she\u2019d planned. Involving her heart would be both foolish and dangerous. She\u2019d already learned her lesson when it came to trusting a man. Roger had taught her well.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d His voice was a whisper. She kept her eyes closed, not wanting Alek to know she was awake. Afraid he might want to resume what they\u2019d started...</p><p>Her face filled with color at the memory of their kisses. She couldn\u2019t believe the liberties Alek had taken with her earlier that afternoon. Worse, liberties she\u2019d encouraged and enjoyed. She would be forever grateful that Mr. O\u2019Dell had arrived when he had.</p><p>Julia had eventually drifted off. Because of her nap, she was unable to sleep that evening. Hoping to sidestep any questions from Alek, she\u2019d gone to the hospital to visit Ruth later in the afternoon.</p><p>The condo was empty when she returned and Julia guessed Alek had gone to the lab to work. Feeling somewhat guilty, she microwaved her dinner, hoping he\u2019d pick up something for himself while he was out.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t back by the time she showered and readied for bed. She should\u2019ve been grateful; instead she found herself waiting for him. It was nearly eleven when she heard the front door open. Light from the kitchen spilled into the hallway outside her bedroom as he rummaged around, apparently looking for dinner.</p><p>A second bout of guilt didn\u2019t improve her disposition. Knowing next to nothing about cooking should prove beyond a doubt what a terrible wife she was. Another, more domesticated woman would have been knitting by the fireplace, awaiting his return with a delectable meal warming in the oven. Forget that it was summer; this imaginary dutiful wife would have a cozy fire roaring anyway.</p> <p>Then, when he\u2019d eaten, she\u2019d remove her housecoat and stand before him dressed only in a sheer nightie.</p><p>But Alek hadn\u2019t married the ideal wife; instead he was stuck with her.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>She was so surprised by the sound of her name that she lifted her head from the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I hadn\u2019t gone to sleep yet.\u201d She sat up in bed and tugged the sheets protectively around her.</p><p>His shadow loomed against the opposite wall like...like some kind of fairy-tale monster. But try as she might, Julia couldn\u2019t make him into one.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your grandmother?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged hopelessly. It became more apparent with every visit that Ruth wouldn\u2019t last much longer. A part of Julia clung to her grandmother and another part struggled to release Ruth from this life and the pain that accompanied it.</p><p>\u201cYou were at the lab?\u201d</p><p>Alek nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs it really necessary for you to work so many hours?\u201d</p><p>Alek crossed his arms and leaned against the door-jamb. \u201cWork helps me deal with my frustration.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to clarify his answer. Julia knew he was referring to the sexual disappointment of their marriage.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he sighed and added, \u201cI know why everything went so smoothly with the Immigration official. You, my dear wife, are in love with me.\u201d</p><p>The audacity of the comment was shocking. \u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love with me,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re badly in need of some reality therapy,\u201d Julia said, making her words as scathing as she could. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I promise you it\u2019ll get better. Much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch worse, you mean,\u201d she said with an exaggerated yawn. \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek, please, it\u2019s nearly midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted you hadn\u2019t been to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I need my rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave it until morning,\u201d she suggested next.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife. How long will it take before you live up to your end of our bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...already explained I need time...to adjust to everything. Why are you doing this?\u201d she cried, furious with him for dragging out a subject she considered closed. \u201cI refuse to be pressured into making love just because you\u2019ve got an overactive libido.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPressured,\u201d he echoed, and a deep frown formed. He rubbed his hand over his face, sighing audibly. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you since our wedding night. You agreed that we\u2019d be married in every sense of the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few weeks,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cAh, but you love me. You proved it this afternoon. There\u2019s no need to wait any longer, Julia. I need you, and you need me.\u201d With a knowing smile, he turned and walked away.</p><p>The comment irritated her so much she couldn\u2019t bear to let it go unanswered. Grabbing her pillow with both hands, she threw it after him. It hit the doorframe with a soft thud that was barely discernible. She knew Alek heard it, however, because he started laughing.</p><p>The following morning, as was her habit, Julia rose early and stood barefoot in the kitchen while she waited for the first cup of coffee to filter into the glass pot. The aroma pervaded the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Alek spoke groggily from behind her.</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes flew open. Normally Alek didn\u2019t get up until after she\u2019d left for work. \u201cMorning,\u201d she greeted him with little enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cFine. How about you?\u201d Her attention remained focused on the coffeepot. She didn\u2019t dare turn around to confront her rumpled, groggy husband. Knowing he was only a few feet behind her activated her imagination. His hair was probably unkempt and his eyes drowsy, the way hers were. He\u2019d look sexy and appealing.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d he whispered, moving forward. He slipped his arms around her waist and nuzzled her neck. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. We\u2019re married. When are you going to recognize that?\u201d</p><p>She braced her hands against his, which were joined at her stomach. His lips located the pulse pounding at the side of her neck and he kissed her. Small, soft kisses...</p><p>Julia\u2019s breath caught in her throat. \u201cAlek, please, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d He raised his head as though she couldn\u2019t have meant it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep for want of you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her throat felt as dry as a desert. Speaking was impossible.</p><p>\u201cAll I could think about was how good you tasted and how much I wanted to hold you and kiss you again,\u201d he went on.</p><p>The coffee had finished brewing, but Julia couldn\u2019t make herself move.</p><p>\u201cI know you want me, too. Why do you torture us like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...have to get to work.\u201d Each syllable was a triumph.</p><p>\u201cLet me make love to you,\u201d Alek urged, his mouth close to her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo. We can\u2019t. I...I\u2019ll be late for work.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for him to argue with her, but rushed toward her bedroom. Toward sanity.</p><p>By the time Julia reached her office, she was in a terrible mood. She blamed Alek for this. As much as she wished it, she wasn\u2019t made of stone. She was flesh and blood. A woman. When he kissed her and touched her she experienced a certain sexual yearning.</p><p>It was inevitable. A mere physiological reaction. It meant nothing. He insisted she was in love with him, but Julia knew that was just talk. Sweet talk, with a single purpose. To seduce her.</p><p>Julia had been seduced before, by an artful master. In comparison, Alek was so much more honest and, therefore, easier to defend herself against. She refused to give in to his pressure, subtle or otherwise. As for misleading him, she had, but only to a limited degree.</p><p>Furious now, she marched into her office, reached for her phone and dialed Jerry\u2019s extension. \u201cCan you come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jerry paused. \u201cI thought things went hunky-dory with the inspector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did, as far as I know. This has to do with Alek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right up,\u201d her brother said.</p><p>She was pacing her office with precise steps when he arrived. Julia stopped, angry with herself, feeling close to tears and not understanding why.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, his concern evident in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI...there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhom,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAleksandr Berinski.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jerry frowned, then sighed with resignation. \u201cWhat\u2019s he done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything... Listen, I don\u2019t want to get into this. Let me make this as plain and simple as I can. I think it\u2019s time he moved out of the condo. One of us has to and it\u2019s either him or me.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cYou want Alek out of your condo?\u201d Jerry repeated.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me the first time,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cOur marriage has been sanctioned by the government. What reason do we have to continue this charade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia...\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard that tone all too often. \u201cJerry, I\u2019m not in any mood to argue with you.\u201d She walked around her desk and claimed her seat. Reaching for a file from her in-basket, she opened it. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the arrangements in your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to talk this over with Alek?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought of that. \u201cIt...won\u2019t be necessary. He\u2019ll get the picture once he hears from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Her brother\u2019s refusal caught her attention as nothing else could have. \u201cWhat do you mean, you won\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I won\u2019t have you treating Alek as though he\u2019s...some pest you\u2019re trying to get rid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be like that,\u201d she insisted, realizing even as she spoke that Jerry was right. She couldn\u2019t treat Alek this way.</p><p>\u201cSecondly,\u201d her brother said, \u201cit\u2019d be crazy to throw everything away now. You think that just because you\u2019ve passed some interview with an Immigration official, you\u2019re in the clear. Think again, Julia. That\u2019s exactly the kind of thing the government\u2019s expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it. They make it their business to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, please.\u201d She rarely pleaded with her brother. \u201cThe man\u2019s impossible.... I\u2019ve done my duty. What more do you expect of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek is your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound just like him! He frightens me.... He makes me feel things I don\u2019t want to feel. I\u2019m scared, Jerry, really scared.\u201d Close to tears, she covered her mouth, fearing she\u2019d break down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Jerry said with a sympathetic shrug. \u201cI wish I did, for your sake. Alek\u2019s, too.\u201d</p><p>With nothing left to say, he returned to his own office.</p><p>Her mood didn\u2019t improve when two hours later Alek unexpectedly showed up. He walked into her office without waiting for her assistant to announce him. Julia happened to be on the phone at the time and she glanced up, irritated by the intrusion. Alek glared at her, and every minute she delayed appeared to infuriate him further.</p><p>He began to pace, pausing every other step to turn and scowl in her direction.</p> <p>Julia finished her conversation as quickly as she could without being rude\u2014and without letting him believe he was intimidating her.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted something?\u201d she asked calmly as she replaced the receiver.</p><p>Anger was etched on his features. \u201cYes, I do. I understand you spoke to Jerry this morning about one of us moving. I want to know what\u2019s going on in that head of yours.\u201d</p><p>Julia folded her hands on her desk. \u201cIt seemed the logical thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She stood, feeling at a distinct disadvantage sitting. \u201cIt makes sense. The only reason we were living together was for show because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re living together, my dear wife, because we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn name only.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something blistering in Russian, and Julia was grateful she couldn\u2019t understand him.</p><p>\u201cYou deny your vows. You abuse my pride by involving your brother. You ask for patience and then stab me in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...explained on our wedding day that I need time. I let you know you were being cheated in this marriage. You can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d Contacting Jerry had been wrong, she saw now. But she was frightened and growing more so each day. No longer could she ignore the powerful attraction she felt for Alek. No longer could she ignore his touch. He was chipping away at the barrier she\u2019d erected to protect herself from feelings. From love. He was working his way into her life and her heart. She had to do something.</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife,\u201d Alek shouted.</p><p>Julia closed her eyes at the anger in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a very good one,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe are married, Julia. When will you accept that?\u201d He turned away from her and stalked to the door.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>At her words, he spun around.</p><p>They stood no more than a few feet apart, yet an ocean might have lain between them. He was furious with her and she with him.</p><p>\u201cI may never be your wife in the way you want.\u201d Julia didn\u2019t know what drove her to say that.</p><p>And yet, at the same moment, she realized she wanted him. Needed him. And that frightened her half to death.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked as if he could read her thoughts. \u201cAfraid you aren\u2019t woman enough to satisfy me. That\u2019s what\u2019s behind all this, isn\u2019t it? That, and the fact that you\u2019re afraid to trust another man. But I\u2019m not like the one who hurt you, Julia, whoever he was. I\u2019m not like him at all. I respect you\u2014and I want you. Which, if you\u2019re honest, is how you feel about me, too.\u201d</p><p>Stricken, Julia closed her eyes. It felt as if he\u2019d blinded her with the truth, identified her fears, hurled them at her to explain or reject.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>She sobbed once, the sound nearly hysterical as she backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean...\u201d he began.</p><p>She stopped him by holding out her arm.</p><p>He cursed under his breath, and reaching for her, drew her into his arms. She didn\u2019t resist. Without pause he lowered his head and covered her mouth, sealing their lips together in a wild kiss. The craziness increased with each impatient twist of their heads, growing in frenzied desperation.</p><p>Her breasts tingled and her body grew hot as his powerful hands held her against him. It was where she wanted to be....</p><p>His hands were busy with the zipper at the back of her straight, no-nonsense business skirt. It hissed as he lowered it. Julia made a token protest, which he cut off with a bone-melting kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m through fighting you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWill you stop fighting me?\u201d</p><p>He gently brought his mouth back to hers. They were so close Julia felt as if they were drawing in the same breath, as if they required only one heart to beat between them.</p><p>Sobbing, she slid her arms around his neck and buried her face, taking deep, uneven breaths. Not understanding her own desperate need, she clung to him as a low cry emerged from her lips. The grief she felt was overwhelming. She was lamenting the wasted years, when she\u2019d closed herself off from life. Ever since her father\u2019s death and Roger\u2019s betrayal, she\u2019d lived in limbo, rejecting love and laughter. Rejecting and punishing herself.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Alek whispered, stroking her hair, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, unable to answer.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he told her softly, sitting in her chair and taking her with him so she was nestled in his lap. \u201cTell me you need me. Tell me you want me, too.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed and with tears streaming down her face, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough. I want the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...need you. Oh, Alek, I\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>He held her, kissed her gently, reassured her while she rested her head on his shoulder and cried until her tears were spent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you put up with me,\u201d she finally gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d he asked, chuckling softly. \u201cI have the feeling you\u2019ll figure it out soon enough, my love.\u201d</p><p>Her intercom hummed and Virginia\u2019s voice echoed through the silence. \u201cYour nine-thirty appointment is here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes regretfully met Alek\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSend whoever it is away,\u201d Alek urged.</p><p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and kissed the tip of her nose. He released her slowly.</p><p>Just when Julia was convinced her day couldn\u2019t possibly get any more complicated, she received a call from Virginia Mason Hospital. Her grandmother had slipped into a coma.</p><p>Jerry was away, so she left a message for him and for Alek, canceled her appointments for the rest of the day and drove directly to the hospital.</p><p>Julia realized the instant she walked into her grandmother\u2019s room that Ruth\u2019s hold on life was tenuous, a slender thread. Her heart was failing, and Julia felt as though her own heart was in jeopardy, too.</p><p>In the past few years she\u2019d faced a handful of crises, starting with the fire that had nearly destroyed the business and their family. Her father\u2019s death had followed. Immediately afterward she\u2019d realized Roger had used her, had sold out her family. And her.</p><p>Ruth, her beloved Ruth, was dying, and Julia was powerless to stop it. She was terrified. For the past months she\u2019d watched helplessly as her grandmother\u2019s health deteriorated.</p><p>Sitting at Ruth\u2019s bedside now, Julia could almost hear the older woman\u2019s calming voice. \u201cMy death is inevitable\u2014\u201d the unspoken words rang in her head \u201c\u2014but not unwelcome.\u201d</p><p>Silently Julia pleaded with her grandmother to live just a little longer, to give her time to adjust, to grant her a few days to gather her courage. Even as she spoke, Julia recognized how selfish she was being, thinking of herself, of her own pain. But she couldn\u2019t make herself stop praying that God would spare her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cYou have walked through your pain,\u201d the silent voice continued. \u201cThe journey has made you wiser and far stronger than you know.\u201d</p><p>Julia wanted to argue. She didn\u2019t feel strong. Not when it seemed Ruth was about to be taken from her. She felt pushed to the limits, looking both ways\u2014toward despair in one direction and hope in the other, toward doubt and faith.</p><p>An hour passed as Julia struggled with her grief, refusing to let it overwhelm her. Fear controlled her, the knowledge that if she gave in to her grief, she might never regain her sanity.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she pleaded aloud, praying Ruth heard her. It was the selfish prayer of a frightened child.</p><p>Jerry arrived, pale and shaken. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Julia shrugged. Their grandmother\u2019s physician, Dr. Silverman, had been in earlier to explain the medical symptoms and reasons. Most of what he\u2019d said had meant only one thing. Ruth was close to death.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a coma,\u201d Julia answered. \u201cI talked to her doctor earlier. He\u2019s surprised she\u2019s hung on this long.\u201d</p><p>Her brother pulled out a chair and sat down next to Julia. \u201cI love this old woman, really love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do without her, Jerry?\u201d</p><p>Her brother shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll make do the way we always have, I suppose.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss her so much.\u201d Julia heard the tears in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He reached for Julia\u2019s hand and gently squeezed it. \u201cAlek phoned. He\u2019ll be here as soon as he can.\u201d</p><p>Julia instinctively wanted Alek with her. She\u2019d never needed him like this before. That thought produced another regret. Alek was devoted to her and she didn\u2019t deserve it. She\u2019d treated him terribly and yet he loved her.</p><p>Her grief, fed by her burning tears and broken dreams, was overwhelming. She couldn\u2019t sit still; she stood and started pacing, then returned to her chair.</p> <p>They sat silently for another hour. She did what she could to make her grandmother more comfortable. She held Ruth\u2019s hand, read her favorite passages from Scripture, stroked her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Jerry spoke from behind her.</p><p>Understanding, Julia nodded. She loved her brother and knew he was grieving in his own way. She was grateful he was leaving; she preferred this time alone with Ruth.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you go home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p> <p>The next thing she heard was the sound of the door closing. Being alone was a relief and a burden. Julia recognized the inconsistency of her reactions. Never had she craved Alek\u2019s company more, and yet she wanted these hours alone with her grandmother, sensing that it would be the last time they\u2019d be together.</p><p>She found it ironic that hope and despair could feel the same to her.</p><p>The nurses came in a number of times. One encouraged her to take a break, go have some dinner, but Julia refused. She was afraid to leave, fearing that once she did, her grandmother would quietly release her hold on life.</p><p>Leaning her forehead against the side of the hospital bed, Julia must have dozed because the next thing she knew Alek was there.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been no change.\u201d</p> <p>Alek sat down next to Julia. \u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>Alek nodded and when he spoke again it was in his own language, which had a distinct beauty. Whatever he was saying seemed to please her grandmother because Ruth smiled. At first Julia was convinced she\u2019d imagined it, which would\u2019ve been easy enough to do. But there was no denying the change in Ruth\u2019s ashen features.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s midnight, my love.\u201d</p><p>Julia glanced at her watch, sure he was mistaken. She must have slept longer than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, standing behind her, his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, unwilling to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t doing her any good, and you\u2019re running yourself down, both physically and mentally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou go ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay a little longer.\u201d</p><p>She heard the frustration in his sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving without you. You\u2019re exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to leave her,\u201d she whispered brokenly. The time had come for the truth, painful though it was. Julia was surprised she\u2019d chosen to voice it to Alek and not her brother.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d her husband inquired gently.</p><p>She was glad he was standing behind her and couldn\u2019t see the tears in her eyes. \u201cIf Ruth dies, when she dies, a part of me will go with her.\u201d The best part, Julia feared. Something would perish in her own heart. Her faith in God and in herself would be shaken, and she wondered if this time the damage would be beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to bind her to this life, this pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Julia answered honestly. Yet she held on to Ruth fiercely.</p><p>A part of Julia had died with her father. It had been joy. Trust had vanished afterward when she realized everything he\u2019d told her about Roger was true. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe her father, had argued with him, fought with him. It was while they were shouting at each other that he\u2019d suffered the heart attack that had prematurely claimed his life.</p><p>Joy had faded from her soul that afternoon, replaced by guilt. In the years since, she\u2019d made a semicom-fortable life for herself. She wasn\u2019t happy, nor was she unhappy. She buried herself in her work, the desire to succeed propelling her forward, dictating her actions. Her goal was to undo the damage Roger had done to the company. First she would rebuild Conrad Industries to its former glory and then continue on the course her father had so carefully charted.</p><p>She was making progress, not only with the company, but with her life. Encouraged by Ruth, Julia was just beginning to recapture some of the enthusiasm she\u2019d lost. She could laugh occasionally, even joke every now and then.</p><p>It had seemed impossible that she\u2019d ever again feel anything but the weight of her sadness. Then, without being aware of the transformation, she realized she was feeling again, and it had started after her marriage to Alek.</p><p>Now here she was, trapped in pain and fear, and it was too soon. Much too soon.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Alek took her by the shoulders.</p><p>She followed because she didn\u2019t have the strength to resist. Leaning forward, she kissed Ruth\u2019s cheek and felt the tears run down her own.</p><p>Alek gently guided his wife from the hospital room. He kept his arm around her, wanting to lend her his strength. She would never admit she needed him, never confess she was pleased he\u2019d come to be with her. He\u2019d been at the airport that afternoon, dealing with the Immigration people, working out the final details of his sister\u2019s entry into the country. He\u2019d been torn between his duty to his sister and Julia.</p><p>Alek found he was weary of this constant battle between them. She fought him at every turn, cheated him out of her love. Yet he\u2019d begun to love her and was more determined than ever to win her heart.</p><p>He knew only bits and pieces of the past. Even Jerry seemed reluctant to discuss Julia\u2019s relationship with Roger Stanhope.</p><p>Whenever his friend mentioned the other man\u2019s name, Jerry\u2019s mouth tightened and anger flashed in his eyes. Because he was often so involved with his own work, Alek couldn\u2019t interact with other staff members as much as he would\u2019ve liked. Recently he\u2019d made a point of doing so.</p><p>Over lunch that afternoon, he\u2019d casually dropped Roger Stanhope\u2019s name and was astounded by the abrupt silence that fell over the small gathering.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to know about Roger, just ask Julia,\u201d someone suggested.</p><p>It sounded like an accusation, which puzzled Alek. From the little he was able to surmise, Roger had been blamed for the fire, although presumably nothing was proven or he\u2019d be in jail. Questions abounded. The answers, like so much else in his marriage, would come with time.</p><p>Julia was silent on the ride from the hospital to their home. Alek led her into the condo and toward the guest bedroom, where she chose to sleep.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed like a lifeless doll.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some help undressing?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He left her, but not because he wanted to.</p><p>Venturing into the kitchen, he made a pot of tea. Julia needed something hot and sweet. When the tea had finished steeping, he returned to her room and knocked lightly on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d changed clothes and was dressed in a sexless pair of cotton pajamas.</p><p>\u201cI made tea.\u201d He carried in a cup and saucer, and set them on the nightstand by her bed.</p><p>She stared at the cup as if she\u2019d never seen anything like it before.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember, but I told you yesterday that my sister was arriving this afternoon. I was at the airport meeting Anna and then drove her to my old apartment. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t come to the hospital until late. Anna will be here tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so good to me? I don\u2019t deserve it...not after the way I\u2019ve treated you. Not after the things I\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>He had no answer for her because the truth would only enhance her distress. He loved her as any husband loved his wife. In time she\u2019d recognize and accept it. But she wasn\u2019t ready yet.</p><p>Alek peeled back the covers of her bed and fluffed up the pillow. She stood behind him, her breathing labored, as if she was struggling not to weep.</p><p>\u201cAlek.\u201d His name was a mere whisper. \u201cWould you mind...would you sleep with me tonight? Just this once?\u201d</p><p>The desire that invaded his body came as a greater shock than her request. From the first night of their marriage, Alek had been waiting for her to voluntarily invite him to her bed. He hadn\u2019t imagined it would happen this way, when she was emotionally distraught.</p><p>In the same instant, Alek recognized that she wasn\u2019t offering him her body. She was seeking his comfort. It wasn\u2019t what he wanted, but it was a small step in the right direction and he\u2019d take whatever Julia was willing to give him.</p><p>He reached for her hand, kissed her fingers and then moved to the doorway where he switched off the light. Darkness filled the room. He heard the mattress squeak as she slipped beneath the sheets. Then he walked back to the bed, stripped off his clothes and joined her.</p><p>It was the sweetest torture he\u2019d ever known to have Julia move into his waiting arms. She cuddled her soft, feminine body against his, molding herself against him, her satiny smooth leg brushing his. She released one long sigh as her head nestled on his chest and was instantly asleep.</p><p>Asleep.</p><p>Alek grinned mockingly to himself and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. He listened to the even sound of her breathing and after a few moments, kissed the crown of her head.</p><p>So this was to be his lot. Comforter. Not lover or husband, but consoler. His body throbbed with wanting her. Holding her so close, yet unable to really touch her, was the purest form of torment Alek had ever endured.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sleep and was grateful he hadn\u2019t, because Julia stirred suddenly, apparently trapped in a nightmare. She thrashed around until he managed to hold her down.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sobbed and twisted away from him. Her nails dug into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwake up. It\u2019s just a dream.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head from the pillow, looked into his eyes and frowned. Rubbing a hand over her face, she looked again as though she expected him to have disappeared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he whispered soothingly. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He could feel her heart racing. Her eyes met his in the darkness and he saw her confusion. It was on the tip of his tongue to remind her she\u2019d invited him into her bed. But he didn\u2019t. Instead he plowed his fingers into the thickness of her hair and brought her mouth to his.</p><p>She welcomed his kiss without hesitation, without restraint, moaning. She flattened her palms against his chest, then sighed when they\u2019d finished kissing. A sigh that spoke of satisfaction. And confusion.</p><p>His body was on fire, but he didn\u2019t press her for more. She snuggled against him and draped her arm around him, nestling back into their original position. Her hand was restless as it leisurely roamed across his chest.</p><p>Her face angled toward his, her eyes shining in the dark. Alek couldn\u2019t resist kissing her again. He couldn\u2019t force himself to draw too far away from her. They were so close, physically and emotionally, he wanted this moment to go on forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A soft lullaby came to him. He didn\u2019t have much of a singing voice, but this was a song his mother had sung to him as a child when he was troubled. Julia wouldn\u2019t understand the words, but they would soothe her spirit as they had his.</p><p>After the first verse, she released a long, trembling sigh. A few minutes later, she was sound asleep once more.</p><p>Alek followed her shortly afterward.</p><p>Julia opened her eyes and felt the unbearable weight of her sadness crushing her. Ruth was dying. She rolled over and, despite her sadness, realized it wasn\u2019t grief that was pressing her down, but Alek.</p> <p>Alek! In a sudden panic, she vainly tried to recall the events from the night before. Oh, no, she\u2019d asked him...asked him to sleep with her. She\u2019d been distraught. She hadn\u2019t known what she was doing and now he\u2019d think, he\u2019d assume she wanted him to make love to her...that she\u2019d welcome him to her bed every night.</p><p>Scrambling to her feet, she backed away from him, her hand at her breast.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>Her heart leapt into her throat. She\u2019d hoped to slip away without waking him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Morning,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded and glanced down as the tears sprang readily to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d He reached for her hand, pulling her back to the bed. She sat on the edge and he slid his arms around her. Words weren\u2019t necessary just then. She was grieving and Alek was there to comfort her. She placed her hands over his and their fingers entwined.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered when she could form the words. She leaned back, relaxing into his warmth. He kissed her hair and she turned abruptly and flung her arms around his neck, holding him for all she was worth.</p><p>He spoke to her, and she smiled softly when she realized it was in Russian. He seemed to forget she didn\u2019t understand him. It didn\u2019t matter. She knew what he was saying from his tone\u2014that he was there, that he loved her.</p> <p>For the first time, the thought didn\u2019t terrify her.</p><p>Sometime later, Julia dressed, although she had trouble holding back the tears. She finished before Alek did and wandered into the kitchen, intent on starting a pot of coffee. She stopped short when she caught sight of a woman working in her kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d the woman said, struggling with the language. \u201cI am Anna, Alek\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cHello, Anna.\u201d Julia had forgotten Alek\u2019s sister was coming that morning. \u201cWelcome to America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Alek\u2019s sister was small and thin with brown hair woven into a braid. Her eyes were so like Alek\u2019s, it was as if Julia were staring into her husband\u2019s own dark gaze. Her smile was warm and friendly and despite this awkward beginning, Julia liked her immediately.</p><p>\u201cMy English is poor, but I\u2019m studying every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do just fine,\u201d Julia said, wondering why Anna was staring at her.</p> <p>\u201cI will cook your breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggs and toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Julia answered and hurried into the bathroom. By the time she entered the kitchen, she understood Anna\u2019s concern. There\u2019d been tears in her eyes, and Alek\u2019s sister must have assumed they\u2019d been arguing. Julia hoped to find a way to reassure her that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>Her breakfast was on the table. Generally she ate on the run, usually picking up a container of orange juice and a muffin at the local convenience store on her drive to the office. When Alek had suggested they hire his sister as a housekeeper and cook, Julia had readily agreed. It was a way of helping his family. A way of repaying her debt to him. A way of eating regular meals herself.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she sampled the fluffiest, most delicious scrambled eggs she\u2019d ever tasted that Julia realized Anna was the one doing her and Alek the favor.</p><p>She was reading over the morning paper when Alek appeared in the kitchen, smartly dressed. He poured himself a cup of coffee while his sister spoke enthusiastically in Russian.</p><p>\u201cEnglish,\u201d Julia heard him say. \u201cYou must speak English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis country is so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alek agreed, pulling out the chair across from Julia and sitting down. She ignored him, concentrating on the paper.</p><p>\u201cDid you phone the hospital?\u201d Alek asked.</p><p>\u201cYes...there\u2019s been no change. I\u2019m going into the office this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me know if you hear anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers and he smiled. Julia found herself responding, treasuring this understanding between them, this sense of trust they\u2019d stumbled upon. But it frightened her. When Alek recognized her reserve, he sighed and mumbled something she didn\u2019t catch.</p><p>Anna responded to him in Russian. Naturally Julia couldn\u2019t understand the words, but it sounded very much as if her sister-in-law was upset with him. She offered Julia a sympathetic look as she hurried out the door.</p><p>Alek returned his attention to Julia. \u201cShe thinks I caused your tears this morning. Suffice it to say, she wasn\u2019t pleased with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her about Ruth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alek leaned forward to place his finger on her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my sister. Or me.\u201d</p><p>It was a mistake to go into the office; Julia realized that almost immediately. There were several pressing matters that needed to be taken care of before she could spend any more time at the hospital. Appointments to reschedule, work to delegate. Julia resented every minute away from her grandmother. She found herself impatient to get back to the hospital. Her relationship with Alek concerned her, too.</p><p>Sitting at her desk, Julia supported her face on her hands. She\u2019d been so sure this marriage would never work. Now she wasn\u2019t sure of anything. She needed Alek, and he\u2019d come to her, held her, comforted her. She\u2019d given him plenty of reasons to turn away from her. But when the opportunity came to comfort her, he\u2019d come, willingly, unselfishly.</p><p>Each day, Julia felt herself weakening a little more, giving in to the attraction she felt for Alek. Every day he found some small way of dismantling the protective barrier around her heart. He was slowly, methodically, exposing her to the warming rays of the sun.</p><p>And yet...Julia wanted to shout that she didn\u2019t need a man in her life, didn\u2019t want a husband. Silently she did, forcing his image from her mind\u2014with only limited success.</p><p>It was while she was trying not to think of Alek, to concentrate on the tasks before her, that he casually strolled into her office.</p><p>\u201cI thought we should talk,\u201d he said, dropping into a chair as if he had every right to be there.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d She pretended to be absorbed in reading her latest batch of correspondence.</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so flippant, so glib, as if their sleeping in the same bed had all been part of his game plan from the start. She\u2019d conveniently fallen into his scheme without realizing it. His attitude infuriated her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d she informed him sharply. \u201cOne that won\u2019t be repeated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it was too much to hope you\u2019d think otherwise,\u201d he said with a beleaguered sigh. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to accept the truth, then I\u2019ll say it for you. It felt good to hold you in my arms, Julia. I\u2019m here if you need me. I\u2019ll always be here for you. If you believe nothing else about me, believe this.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her chest tighten as he stood and, without waiting for her to comment, walked out of her office. She didn\u2019t understand this man she\u2019d married, and wasn\u2019t sure she ever would. She\u2019d rewarded his kindness by cheating him out of the kind of marriage he\u2019d expected, the marriage she\u2019d agreed to. She\u2019d insulted him and hurt his pride. Not once, but time and again.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t want to love Alek. Love frightened her more than any other emotion, even pain. She pulled a little more inside herself, blocking Alek from her heart, because it was only then that she felt safe.</p><p>Removing the slim gold band from her finger, she stared at it. She put it back on her finger, wondering if she\u2019d ever understand Alek, then doubted it was possible when she had yet to understand herself.</p><p>She spent nearly two hours clearing her desk and her schedule before she was free to leave for the hospital.</p><p>Her heart grew heavy as she walked down the long corridor that led to her grandmother\u2019s room. She didn\u2019t stop at the nurses\u2019 station, didn\u2019t ask to talk to Ruth\u2019s physician. Instead she went directly to the woman who\u2019d helped her through the most difficult period of her life.</p><p>As Julia silently opened the door and stepped inside, she felt tears burn the backs of her eyes. Her grandmother appeared to be asleep. Ruth\u2019s face was pale, but she seemed more at peace now, as if the pain had passed.</p><p>Tentatively Julia stepped over to her grandmother\u2019s bed and took her hand. She held it to her own cheek and pressed it there. Slowly Julia closed her eyes.</p><p>As soon as she did, it felt as if Ruth were awake, waiting to speak with her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad,\u201d Ruth seemed to be saying. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to grieve for me. I\u2019ve lived a good, long life. You were my joy. God\u2019s special gift to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d Julia pleaded silently. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, please don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, my child. You have your whole life ahead of you. Don\u2019t cling to the past. Look instead to the future. You have a husband who adores you and children waiting to be born. Your life is just beginning. So much love awaits you, more joy than you can possibly imagine now. Your pain shall reap an abundant harvest of life\u2019s treasures. Trust me in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreasures,\u201d Julia whispered. She couldn\u2019t look past the present moment to think about the future. Not when her heart was breaking.</p><p>Tears ran unrestrained down her face and she felt her grandmother\u2019s presence reaching out to comfort her, a last farewell before she set out on the journey before her.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t know how long she stood there, holding on to Ruth\u2019s hand. She realized as she looked up at the monitor registering her grandmother\u2019s heartbeat that it had gone silent. Ruth had quietly slipped from life into death with no fuss, no ceremony, as if she\u2019d been awaiting Julia\u2019s arrival so she could leave peacefully.</p><p>Julia had known it would be impossible to prepare herself emotionally for this moment. Ruth\u2019s death wasn\u2019t a shock; she\u2019d been ill for years. Julia had been aware that each day could be her grandmother\u2019s last. She\u2019d accepted the inevitability of Ruth\u2019s passing as best she could. But nothing could have prepared her for the grief that slammed against her now. Nothing.</p><p>Collapsing into the chair, Julia cried out, the sound a low, anguished wail as she swayed back and forth.</p><p>A nurse came, so did a doctor and several other health professionals. Julia didn\u2019t move. She couldn\u2019t. The sobs racked her shoulders and she hid her face in her hands. And slowly rocked with grief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone led her from the room. She sat in the private area alone, desolate, inconsolable.</p><p>Jerry and Alek arrived together. Jerry spoke with the hospital officials while Alek wrapped Julia in his arms and held her against him as she wept until she had no more tears.</p><p>She needed him and was past pretending she didn\u2019t. Her own strength was depleted. Clinging to Alek, she buried her face in his chest, seeking what solace she could. When her father died, she\u2019d been numb with guilt and grief. The tears hadn\u2019t come until much later.</p><p>He held her close and she was grateful for his comfort, for his willingness to share her grief.</p> <p>They seemed to be at the hospital for hours. There were papers to sign and a hundred different decisions to make. Jerry went with her and Alek to the funeral home, where arrangements were made for Ruth\u2019s burial.</p><p>Julia was surprised by the calm, almost unemotional way she was able to deal with the details of the funeral. The flowers, the music, discussing the program with first the funeral home director and then the family\u2019s minister, Pastor Hall.</p><p>It was dark by the time they\u2019d finished. Jerry, solemn and downcast, walked out to the parking lot with her and Alek.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come back to the condo with us?\u201d Julia asked, not wanting to leave her brother alone. Unlike her, he\u2019d return to an empty house. Ruth\u2019s death had shaken him badly. He didn\u2019t express his grief as freely as she had.</p><p>Jerry shook his head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnna has dinner ready and waiting,\u201d Alek said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick up something on the way home,\u201d he assured them both. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Alek drove through the hilly streets that led to their condominium. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, when he opened the front door for her.</p><p>\u201cDrained.\u201d The emotions seemed to be pressing against her chest. She was mentally and physically exhausted; her fatigue was so great she could barely hold up her head.</p><p>Alek guided her into the kitchen. She hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast, hadn\u2019t thought about food even once. The smells were heavenly, but she had no appetite.</p><p>He brought two plates from the oven and set them on the table.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath.\u201d She half expected him to argue with her, to insist she needed nourishment. Instead he must have realized she knew what was best for herself right now.</p><p>One look in the bathroom mirror confirmed Julia\u2019s worst suspicions. Her eyes were red, puffy, and her cheeks were pale, her makeup long since washed away by her tears. She looked much older than her thirty years. About a hundred years older. She looked and felt as if she\u2019d been hit by a freight train.</p><p>Ruth was gone, and other than Jerry she was alone in the world. She was grateful for Alek\u2019s assistance during this traumatic day, but in time he\u2019d leave and then she\u2019d be alone again.</p><p>Running her bathwater, she added a package of peach-scented salts and stepped into the hot, soothing water. She leaned against the back of the tub and closed her eyes, letting the heat of the bath comfort her.</p><p>Children waiting to be born.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why that phrase edged its way into her mind. There would be no children because there would be no real marriage. She was more determined than ever not to cross that line, especially now, when she was most vulnerable. She\u2019d hurt Alek enough, abused his gentleness, taken advantage of his kindness.</p><p>He was standing in the hallway outside the bathroom waiting for her when she finished. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Alek,\u201d she said, wanting to reassure him, even if it wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. I turned back the sheets for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He ushered her into the bedroom as if she were a child. In other circumstances, Julia would have resented the way he\u2019d taken control of her life, but not then. She felt only gratitude.</p><p>She slid beneath the covers, nestled her head against the pillow and closed her eyes. \u201cAlek,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you sing to me again?\u201d</p><p>He complied with a haunting melody in his own language. His voice was clear and strong, and even though she couldn\u2019t understand the words, she found it beautiful and soothing. She wanted to ask him the meaning, but her thoughts drifted in another direction. Toward rest. Toward peace.</p><p>Julia woke with a start. She didn\u2019t know what had jarred her awake. The room was dark, although the hall light offered little illumination. The digital clock on the nightstand informed her it was nearly 1:00 a.m. As her eyes adjusted, she realized Alek was sitting beside her in a chair, his legs stretched out before him and his head cocked at an odd, uncomfortable angle.</p><p>\u201cAlek?\u201d she whispered, propping herself up on one elbow.</p><p>He stirred immediately and straightened. \u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to sing to you?\u201d</p><p>Hot, burning tears filled her eyes at his tenderness, his concern. She shook her head. What she needed was to be held.</p><p>\u201cJulia, my love,\u201d he whispered, moving from the chair to the edge of the bed. His hand smoothed the hair from her face, his touch as gentle as if she were a child in need of reassurance, which was exactly the way Julia felt.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so wonderful?\u201d she sobbed. \u201cWhy are you so good to me?\u201d</p><p>His lips touched her forehead, but he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a rotten wife.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t given yourself a chance yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve treated you terribly. You should hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate you?\u201d He seemed to find her words amusing. \u201cThat would be impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you lie down with me? Please?\u201d The words were out before she could censor them. It was a completely selfish request. \u201cI...need you, Alek.\u201d She added this last part for honesty\u2019s sake, to ease her conscience.</p><p>He kissed her, his mouth locating hers unerringly in the near-dark. Although his kiss was light, she knew it was his way of thanking her for admitting the truth.</p><p>He stood and stripped off his pants and shirt. Julia lifted the covers and moved over as far as she could in the narrow bed.</p><p>Despite sleeping in his embrace the night before, she felt strangely shy now. He put his arm around her shoulders and brought her close. He was warm and real and felt so alive that she trembled when she laid her head on his chest. His heart was pounding strong and steady against her ear.</p><p>\u201cCan you sleep now?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI...think so. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t answer her question, but she didn\u2019t press him. \u201cWe kissed last night, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin across her hair. \u201cYes.\u201d She heard the strain in his voice and felt unusually pleased. She tilted her head back so that she was looking into his warm, dark eyes. Only a few inches separated their mouths.</p><p>\u201cWould you...mind\u2014\u201d she hesitated and moistened her lips \u201c\u2014kissing me again?\u201d</p><p>His breathing stopped abruptly and his eyes narrowed as if he wasn\u2019t sure he should trust her. Julia didn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>Rather than waiting for his permission, she arched toward him until their lips met. Their kiss was sweet and undemanding. She was breathing hard when they finished, but so was he.</p><p>He kissed her again, a little deeper, a little more intensely. Then a lot more intensely.</p><p>Julia sighed as his mouth left hers, their bottom lips clinging momentarily. \u201cOh, Alek.\u201d She sighed, and a trembling kind of response made its way through her body.</p><p>She said his name again, more softly this time. \u201cI want to make love.\u201d</p><p>She watched him closely and noted the different emotions flashing in his eyes. He wanted her, too; there was no question of that. He wanted her and had from the beginning of their marriage. He\u2019d made certain she knew how much. Yet he hesitated.</p><p>His eyes gradually changed and told her another story. They darkened with doubt, which won over the needy, sensual look she\u2019d seen in him seconds earlier.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d He breathed her name, his tone regretful. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She knew she sounded defensive and couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019d demanded she share his bed from the first night of their marriage.</p><p>But when she finally agreed to fulfill her part of their bargain, he rejected her. It made no sense. And it angered her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d feel as if I was taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be the judge of that?\u201d she said irritably.</p><p>\u201cRight now, no.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she jerked her head away. His fingers came to her face, resting on her cheek, directing her gaze back to his.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Julia, don\u2019t ever doubt that. But I refuse to put my own needs before yours. You\u2019re confused and hurting. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like more than to\u2014\u201d He stopped. \u201cI\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>He kissed her briefly, then tucked his arm around her and brought her even closer to his side. His lips were in her hair. \u201cWhen we make love, I don\u2019t want there to be any regrets in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled and kissed his bare chest. \u201cNo one told me you were so noble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one told me, either,\u201d he muttered disparagingly.</p><p>The way he said it with a deep, shuddering sigh led her to believe that if anyone had regrets in the morning, it would be her husband.</p><p>Content now, she curled up against him and shut her eyes. She\u2019d prefer it if they made love, but being in his arms would satisfy her for now.</p><p>Alek envied Julia her ability to sleep. For weeks he\u2019d been waiting for his wife to come to him, to fulfill her wedding vows by her own choice. Yet when she invited him to her bed, held her arms softly around him, he felt compelled to do the honorable thing.</p><p>Honor. But at what price? His body throbbed with need. His heart ached with love. No woman had led him on a finer chase. No woman had challenged him as much as his wife. No woman had defied and infuriated him more than Julia.</p><p>She\u2019d been hurt and angry at his refusal, then seemed to accept the wisdom of his words. Wisdom, nothing! He was a fool.</p><p>Maybe not, he decided after a moment. Perhaps he had been wise. Only time would tell.</p><p>He felt Julia stir some time later and was surprised to realize it was morning. Slowly he opened his eyes to discover her face staring down at his, studying him. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He waited, thinking she might be angry at finding him in bed with her, but she revealed none of the outrage she had the morning before. Still, her eyes were clouded and her grief was evident.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded shyly, her gaze avoiding his. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well as can be expected.\u201d He stretched his cramped arms and yawned loudly. They were fools, the pair of them. His sister had said as much yesterday morning. They were sleeping in a single bed when there was a perfectly good king-size bed in the other room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alek didn\u2019t have a single excuse to offer his sister and finally told her to mind her own business. But Anna was right.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Alek,\u201d Julia said, climbing out of bed. Her face was turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cFor what, staying with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...well, yes, that, too, but for...you know, not...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaking love to you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Reaching inside her closet, she took out a set of clothes and held them in front of her as if to shield her body from his view. She\u2019d spent most of the night cuddling against him. He\u2019d felt every inch of her creamy smooth skin; there wasn\u2019t anything left to hide. It didn\u2019t seem right to point that out, however.</p><p>\u201cThe next few days are going to be very busy. I\u2019ll be spending a lot of my time finishing up the funeral arrangements and...and going through Ruth\u2019s things, so we probably won\u2019t see much of each other for a while.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to sound so pleased at the prospect, Alek mused.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d showered and dressed, Julia had already left the condominium. His sister was eyeing him critically, clearly displeased about something.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Julia?\u201d Anna asked in an accusatory voice. \u201cShe looks as if she was crying.\u201d</p><p>Naturally it would be his fault, Alek thought, ignoring his sister\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u201cHer grandmother died,\u201d he explained and he watched as Anna\u2019s eyes went soft with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cYou love this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my wife.\u201d He saw now that it was a mistake to have hired his sister. It was obvious that she was going to be what Jerry called \u201ca damned nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not marry her for love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted gruffly, resenting this line of questioning. He wouldn\u2019t have tolerated it from anyone else and Anna knew it.</p><p>\u201cShe knows that you did not love her. This is why she sleeps in the small bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dear Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Alek said impatiently. He grabbed a piece of toast from the plate and didn\u2019t wait for the rest of his breakfast. He turned to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cAleksandr,\u201d she said sharply, stopping him. \u201cYou\u2019ve become very American.\u201d Her face relaxed into a wide smile. \u201cI think this is good. You teach me, too, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, chuckling.</p><p>Sorting through Ruth\u2019s possessions proved to be far more difficult than Julia had expected. Her grandmother\u2019s tastes had been simple, but she\u2019d held on to many things, refusing to discard life\u2019s mementos.</p> <p>Disposing of her clothes was the easiest. Julia boxed them up and took them to a shelter for the homeless. It was the little things she found so difficult. A token from the Seattle World Fair, an empty perfume bottle that had long since faded. The photographs. She could never part with the photographs.</p><p>Julia had no idea her grandmother had collected so many snapshots. The comical photos Ruth sent Louis Conrad while he was away fighting in the Second World War made her smile.</p><p>Julia came across a packet of pictures that caused her to laugh outright. Her grandmother, so young and attractive, was poised in a modest-looking swimsuit in front of a young soldier\u2019s photograph. It had to be Julia\u2019s grandfather, but she\u2019d never seen pictures of him at that age.</p><p>The whole thing must have been rather risqu\u00e9 for the time. Julia guessed Ruth had been giving Louis a reason to come home. Heaven knew it had worked.</p><p>Julia studied the picture and sat for several minutes remembering the love story Ruth had told her. It was sweet and innocent, unlike now when sex so often dominated a relationship.</p><p>Except for her marriage, she thought defeatedly. It was difficult to believe she could\u2019ve been married to Alek this long without making love.</p><p>He\u2019d been eager for the physical side of their relationship\u2014until she\u2019d revealed the first signs of wanting him, too. How typical of a man.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alek,\u201d she breathed, holding her grandmother\u2019s picture. \u201cWill there ever be a way for us?\u201d</p><p>In her heart she heard a resounding yes. But the voice wasn\u2019t her own, nor was it Alek\u2019s. It came from Ruth.</p><p>The day of the funeral, Julia wore a black dress and an old-fashioned pillbox hat with black netting that fitted over her face.</p><p>Julia hadn\u2019t slept well the past few nights and the fatigue was beginning to show. She\u2019d made a point of coming home late, knowing Alek would be waiting for her. She\u2019d mumble something about being tired and close her bedroom door, slipping into bed alone.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the past two nights wishing Alek was there with her. She cursed her foolish pride for not approaching him. But she was afraid that once she did, she\u2019d ask him to make love to her again, and this time she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.</p><p>The limousine delivered Julia, Jerry and Alek to the Methodist church where Ruth had worshiped for a number of years. Jerry and Alek climbed out first. Alek offered her his hand as Julia stepped out of the car. A small group of mourners had formed on the sidewalk outside the church, awaiting the family\u2019s arrival. Julia\u2019s gaze quickly scanned the crowd, then stopped abruptly.</p><p>There, seeking her eyes, stood Roger Stanhope.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Julia hesitated, one foot on the curb, the other in the limousine. Crouched as she was, she felt in danger of collapsing. Roger had dared to show up at her grandmother\u2019s funeral! The man had no sense of decency, but that didn\u2019t come as any surprise.</p><p>Although Alek couldn\u2019t have known what was happening, he leaned forward, put his arm around her waist and assisted her to an upright position.</p><p>His eyes were filled with concern. Julia\u2019s heart was beating double time and her head was spinning. She was afraid she might faint.</p><p>\u201cI...I need to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d With his hand securely around her waist, Alek led her into the church vestibule. A row of wooden pews lined the wall and Alek encouraged her to take a seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t answer. \u201cWater...could you get me a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>Jerry hurried away and returned a moment later with her drink. Other friends were beginning to arrive and after taking a moment to compose herself, Julia stood.</p><p>How dare Roger come to her grandmother\u2019s funeral! He\u2019d done it to agitate her, and his unscrupulous ploy had worked. Julia had never been so close to passing out. Not even the day her father had\u2014She pushed the thought from her mind, refusing to dwell on anything that had to do with Roger.</p><p>Jerry caught sight of their former employee, and his mouth thinned with irritation. \u201cYou saw him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have him thrown out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said. Roger wasn\u2019t worth the effort. \u201cHe\u2019ll cause a scene. Besides, I think Ruth would\u2019ve gotten a kick out of it. We tried everything but a subpoena to talk to him after the fire, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would\u2019ve believed he\u2019d end up coming to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Jerry agreed.</p><p>Alek didn\u2019t say anything, but Julia was well aware of his presence at her side. She wasn\u2019t fooled; he took in every word of the exchange between her and her brother.</p><p>\u201cPoint out this man to me,\u201d Alek said to them both. \u201cI will see to his removal.\u201d</p><p>Jerry glanced at Julia, looking for her consent. She thought about it a moment, then decided she wouldn\u2019t give Roger the satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself, Julia, he\u2019s up to something,\u201d Jerry warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be a fool if I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d she returned testily. She\u2019d been duped by Roger once and it wasn\u2019t a mistake she cared to repeat. She knew his methods and wouldn\u2019t be taken in a second time.</p><p>The three of them had gathered in the back of the church and were unaware of anyone else until Pastor Hall approached them and announced they were ready for the service to begin.</p><p>Julia had known this ordeal would leave her emotionally depleted. Several times during the funeral she felt close to tears, but she held them at bay, taking in deep, even breaths. Her fingers were entwined with Alek\u2019s and she appreciated more than ever that he was with her. His presence lent her the strength she needed to get through the heartrending experience of saying goodbye to the woman she loved so dearly.</p><p>Anna sat nearby, and despite the solemnity of the occasion, Julia thought she saw Jerry cast her several interested glances.</p><p>From the church they traveled to the north end of Seattle to the cemetery where Ruth would be buried in the plot next to her beloved Louis.</p><p>Julia was surprised by how many people came. The day was bright and clear and the sky a pale shade of blue she\u2019d only seen in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>There were so many lovely bouquets of flowers. The group of mourners gathered under the canopy at the cemetery. Julia, Jerry and Alek were given seats, along with a few of Ruth\u2019s more elderly friends. Pastor Hall read from his Bible and the words were familiar ones since Julia had read them so often to Ruth herself.</p><p>Her heart felt as if it would shatter into a thousand pieces as the casket was slowly lowered into the ground. Alek must have sensed her distress because he placed his arm around her shoulders. The tears sprang from her eyes and she quietly sobbed her last farewell.</p><p>Afterward, the assembly met at Ruth\u2019s home. Charles, who\u2019d been with the family for years, had insisted on having it there, although it demanded extra work on his part. The meal was catered, but several friends brought dishes themselves. A wide variety of casseroles, as well as salads, cheeses and sliced meats, were served.</p><p>Julia and Jerry stood by the doorway and greeted their visitors, thanking each of them for their love and support. Julia received countless hugs. Anna had a felt uncomfortable about being among so many strangers and had left, with Julia\u2019s fervent thanks for attending the service.</p><p>Various family friends recounted stories involving Ruth and Louis, and before she realized it, Julia found herself smiling. Her grandmother had been a wonderful, generous, warmhearted woman. Julia didn\u2019t need others to tell her that, but their comments reaffirmed what she\u2019d always known.</p><p>The gathering broke up into small groups of mourners. Every available seat in the living room and formal dining room was taken. Julia assisted Charles in seeing to the guests\u2019 comfort.</p><p>She was filling coffee cups when Roger spoke from behind her. \u201cHello, Julia.\u201d</p><p>It was fortunate that she didn\u2019t empty the steaming coffee into someone\u2019s lap. Roger had apparently sneaked into the house through the back door, because Jerry would never have allowed him in the front.</p><p>\u201cHello, Roger,\u201d she said as unemotionally as she could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her words, if not her tone, were civil.</p><p>\u201cJulia, Julia,\u201d he said with an injured sigh, \u201cisn\u2019t it time for us to let bygones be bygones? How often do I have to tell you it was all a horrible mistake? It seems a shame to rehash something that happened so long ago, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t a mistake. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to see to my guests.\u201d</p><p>Roger surprised her by taking her arm and stopping her. Her gaze flew back to him and she wondered how she could ever have thought herself in love with him.</p><p>He was handsome, but his good looks were so transparent that she was shocked she hadn\u2019t seen through his guise sooner. She\u2019d learned a good deal about character in the past few years, and that thought, at least, comforted her.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you let go of my wife\u2019s arm,\u201d Alek said. He was angry. Julia could tell by how heavy his accent had become.</p> <p>Roger looked puzzled, as if he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cAnd I suggest you do as he says,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>Roger released her arm. He held up both hands for Alek\u2019s inspection. \u201cI heard you were married,\u201d he said, continuing to follow her as she filled yet another coffee cup. Alek came after Roger and the three of them paraded across the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy you chose to marry a Russian is beyond me. I figured you were smarter than to involve yourself with some foreigner.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t dignify that comment with a reply. Instead she introduced the two men. \u201cRoger Stanhope, meet Aleksandr Berinski.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d Roger said sarcastically, \u201cand I thought he was your bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Alek said in a less heavy accent. \u201cTouch my wife again and you\u2019ll be sorry. We foreigners have effective ways of making our point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek,\u201d Julia admonished with a grin.</p><p>Roger seemed to take the threat as some kind of joke. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about your grandmother,\u201d he went on.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The coffeepot was empty and Julia returned to the kitchen with both Roger and Alek in tow. If it hadn\u2019t been such a sad occasion, Julia would\u2019ve found the antics of the two men funny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take you to lunch sometime,\u201d Roger said, leaning against the kitchen counter as Julia prepared another pot of coffee. \u201cWe could talk over old times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019d love it. Do you mind if I bring the arson investigator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia won\u2019t be having lunch with you,\u201d Alek said before Roger could react.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Roger, I really am, but my husband is the jealous sort. You\u2019ve started off on the wrong foot with him as it is. Don\u2019t press your luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, sweetheart,\u201d Roger said meaningfully, \u201cit\u2019s time for us to clear the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe air will be much clearer once you leave,\u201d Alek muttered. \u201cPerhaps you would allow me to show you the door?\u201d He advanced one menacing step, then another.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Roger backed up, hands raised. \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d see matters my way,\u201d Alek said.</p><p>Roger cast an ugly look in his direction. He straightened the cuffs of his starched white shirt and wore an injured air as he left the house through the back door.</p> <p>Julia\u2019s gaze followed Roger. \u201cThat really wasn\u2019t necessary, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but it gave me pleasure to send him.\u201d</p><p>Her smiling eyes met his. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about this man. You loved him?\u201d</p><p>She felt her amusement drain away. She was surprised no one had ever told Alek about her fateful relationship with Roger. But she\u2019d dealt with enough grief for one day and didn\u2019t feel like delving into more.</p><p>\u201cAnother time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Alek seemed to require a moment to think over his response. \u201cSoon,\u201d he told her. \u201cA husband needs to know these things.\u201d</p><p>She agreed with an unenthusiastic nod.</p><p>Alek was leaving the kitchen when she stopped him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about Roger if you tell me about the women in your life.\u201d</p><p>This, too, seemed to give him pause. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anyone but you,\u201d he said, then grinned boyishly.</p><p>The gathering broke up an hour or so later. Julia insisted on staying to help Charles with the cleanup. Jerry and Alek were helpful, too, stacking folding chairs, straightening the living room and carrying dirty dishes into the kitchen.</p><p>By the time Alek unlocked the door to their home, Julia felt drained.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Alek said, \u201cand I\u2019ll make you a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds heavenly.\u201d She kicked off her shoes and stretched out her tired legs, resting her feet on the ottoman. Alek joined her a few minutes later, bringing a china cup and saucer.</p><p>He sat across from her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop missing her,\u201d Julia whispered, after her first sip of tea. Now that she wasn\u2019t so busy, the pain of losing Ruth returned full force. \u201cShe\u2019s left such a large void in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive yourself time,\u201d Alek said gently.</p><p>Julia looked over at her husband and her heart swelled with some emotion she couldn\u2019t quite identify. Possibly love. That frightened her half to death, but she sensed that with Alek there was the chance of feeling safe and secure again.</p><p>He\u2019d been so good to her through the difficult weeks of Ruth\u2019s illness and death, even when she\u2019d given him ample reason to be angry with her.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you ate?\u201d he asked unexpectedly.</p><p>Julia shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have anything this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d There\u2019d been so much food, it seemed impossible that she hadn\u2019t eaten something.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alek informed her. \u201cI was watching. You saw to everyone but yourself. I\u2019ll make you dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek, please,\u201d she said, trailing him into the kitchen. \u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be my pleasure.\u201d Lifting her by the waist, he sat her effortlessly on the stool next to the kitchen counter. \u201cYou can stay and observe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might even learn something.\u201d</p><p>Relaxed now, Julia smiled.</p><p>Alek looked at her for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that often enough,\u201d he said, leaning toward her and dropping a kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cSmile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much reason to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about to change, my love.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her chin on her hands. The sadness she\u2019d carried with her all these weeks seemed to slide off her back. \u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Alek, who was beating eggs, looked over at her and grinned. \u201cAnna said something to me the other morning. As her older brother I\u2019m guilty of not listening to my sister as often as I should. This time, I did\u2014and I agree with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Anna very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe feels the same way about you. She told me you were wise not to let me make love to you.\u201d</p><p>Julia lowered her gaze, uncomfortable with the topic.</p><p>\u201cWhen we married I wasn\u2019t in love with you,\u201d Alek confessed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t in love with me. This is true?\u201d</p><p>Given no option but the truth, Julia nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy heart tells me differently now.\u201d He put the bowl down and moved to her side. With one finger, he raised her chin so her eyes were level with his own. \u201cI love you, Julia, very much.\u201d</p><p>She bit her trembling lower lip. \u201cOh, Alek...\u201d Tears blurred her vision until his face swam before her.</p><p>\u201cThis makes you sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis terrifies me. I want to love you...I think I already do, but I don\u2019t trust myself when it comes to falling in love.\u201d</p><p>Alek frowned. \u201cBecause of this man you saw today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger? Yes, because of Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not like him. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Logically, intellectually, she understood, but emotionally\u2014that was harder. That was a risk....</p><p>Alek slipped his arms around her and Julia was struck not for the first time by the incredible beauty she saw in him. Not merely the physical kind. Oh, he was handsome, but that wasn\u2019t what captivated her. She saw the man who\u2019d held and comforted her when her grandmother died. The man who\u2019d sung her to sleep. The man who\u2019d refused to take advantage of her even when she\u2019d asked him to do so.</p><p>They stared at each other, and Julia knew the exact moment Alek decided to make love to her. It was the same moment she realized she wanted him to\u2014wanted it more than anything.</p><p>His mouth sought hers in a hungry kiss. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she echoed, so lost in his kiss that she couldn\u2019t speak anything but the truth. She\u2019d tried to fool herself into believing it wasn\u2019t possible to trust a man again. Alek was different; he had to be. If she couldn\u2019t trust him, there was no hope for her.</p><p>He took her by the waist as he lifted her from the stool. Her feet dangling several inches off the floor, he carried her out of the kitchen and into the bedroom, kissing her, nibbling at her lips.</p><p>Julia tipped her head back in an effort to gather her scattered wits. Her breath came in short bursts, her lungs empty of air. Feeling seemed more important than breathing. Alek\u2019s touch, which was most important of all, brought back to life the desire that had lain dormant in her for years.</p><p>He lay with her on the king-size bed, bringing his mouth to hers, revealing sensual mysteries with his lips and tongue. He was sprawled across her, pinning her to the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou make me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove me,\u201d she told him, her arms around his neck. Just as she\u2019d known she would, Julia felt safe with Alek. And she felt sure, of him and of herself.</p><p>\u201cI do love you, always.\u201d He lowered his mouth to hers again. His kiss was sweet as his hands fiddled with the zipper at the back of her dress. Growing impatient, he rolled her onto her side, turning with her in order to ease it open. He removed the dress, along with her bra and panties.</p><p>Then his own clothes came off....</p><p>Afterward, neither spoke. Alek kissed her repeatedly and Julia kissed him back, in relief and jubilation. Her season of pain had passed just as her grandmother had claimed it would. She\u2019d found her joy in Alek.</p><p>They slept, their arms around each other, their bodies cuddling spoon-fashion. Alek tucked his leg over hers and pressed close to her back.</p><p>Julia woke first, hungry and loving. She turned over so that her head was nestled beneath Alek\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now,\u201d he muttered drowsily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Do you want to order out for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Alek grinned. \u201cI was going to cook for us, remember?\u201d</p><p>Julia scooted closer, wrapping her arms around his neck, her fingers delving into his thick hair. \u201cI think you should conserve your strength for later,\u201d she advised, bringing his mouth down to hers.</p><p>Gentle flames flickered over the gas logs in Julia\u2019s fireplace while they lounged on the floor, the remains of a boxed pizza resting nearby on the plush, light gray carpeting. Alek had found a bottle of wine and poured them each a glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet,\u201d Alek commented.</p><p>Julia leaned back her head and smiled up at him. They couldn\u2019t seem to be apart from each other, even for a moment. Not just then. His touch was her reality.</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cAny regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed the side of her neck. \u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d gloat. Our making love is a real feather in your cap, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care nothing for feathers. All I want is my wife.\u201d He stroked his chin across the top of her head. \u201cAre you still hungry?\u201d</p><p>Julia patted her stomach. \u201cNot a bit. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m half-starved.\u201d</p> <p>The odd catch in his voice told her it wasn\u2019t food that interested him. He went still, as though he feared her response. Looking up at him, she stared into his eyes and smiled. \u201cI have a feeling I\u2019ve awakened a monster,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Alek pressed her down into the thick carpet, his eyes seeking hers. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, untying the sash to her silk robe. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d</p><p>Alek\u2019s mouth had just touched hers when the phone rang. He froze and so did Julia.</p><p>\u201cLet it ring,\u201d she suggested, rubbing her hands over his chest, loving the smooth feel of his skin.</p><p>\u201cIt could be important.\u201d Reluctantly his eyes moved from her to the phone.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Julia said, although she was far more interested in making love with her husband than talking on the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d He scrambled across the floor and grabbed the receiver. \u201cHello,\u201d he said impatiently.</p><p>Julia followed, kneeling beside him. Leaning forward, she caught his earlobe between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jerry,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>Julia playfully progressed from his ear to his chin, then down the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYes, Julia\u2019s right here.\u201d He seemed winded, as if he were under strain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d He handed her the phone.</p><p>Julia took it, her eyes holding his. \u201cHello, Jerry,\u201d she said in a clear, even voice. \u201cYou caught me at a bad moment. Would you mind if I called you back in say...half an hour?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh...sure.\u201d Her brother obviously wasn\u2019t pleased, but Julia didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She hung up the phone. \u201cNow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bad moment?\u201d Alek repeated, struggling to hide a smile. \u201cOr a good one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a good one,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least from my point of view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine, too...\u201d</p><p>Nearly thirty minutes passed before Julia returned her brother\u2019s call.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jerry,\u201d she said, when he answered the phone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t talk earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. We were busy.\u201d</p><p>The pause that followed was full of meaning. \u201cAh. I see. So,\u201d he said smugly, \u201chow do you like married life now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it just fine.\u201d She felt embarrassed to be discussing her love life with her brother even in the vaguest way. \u201cWhy are you calling? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is.\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice sharpened. \u201cIt\u2019s Roger.\u201d</p><p>Julia groaned inwardly. Would she never be rid of him? \u201cWhat\u2019s he up to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you he was after something when he showed up for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know he didn\u2019t come out of respect,\u201d Julia agreed.</p><p>\u201cI got a call from a friend who said he\u2019s heard Roger\u2019s been asking a lot of questions about Phoenix Paints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your friend learn?\u201d A cold chill skittered down Julia\u2019s spine. Three years ago she\u2019d handed Roger their latest fomula\u2014the biggest advance in house paint in over thirty years. A month before Conrad Industries\u2019 new line of paints was scheduled to hit the market, their plant burned to the ground. Within a matter of weeks Roger had left the company, and Ideal Paints was marketing Conrad Industries\u2019 new product.</p><p>Because of the fire, it was impossible to meet the demand for their innovation, while Ideal Paints was capable of delivering paint to every hardware store in the country.</p><p>\u201cMy friend? He couldn\u2019t find out very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s double security around the plant,\u201d Julia suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has Roger contacted?\u201d she asked, pushing the hair from her forehead. They wouldn\u2019t allow him to steal from them again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jerry sounded equally concerned.</p><p>\u201cShould we bring in a private investigator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTracking phones calls. See if he\u2019s getting information from any of our employees. We could have him watched. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. This is crazy. It\u2019s like a nightmare happening all over again. How soon did Alek say the new product would be ready for marketing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. He\u2019s been working a lot of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure we should move ahead as quickly as possible, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll see what I can do to schedule a meeting with the marketing folks. The sooner we can get our new paint on the store shelves, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let me know if you hear anything else,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Jerry promised.</p><p>They said a few words of farewell and when she replaced the receiver, she sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Alek asked.</p><p>Julia shook her head, not wanting to explain, because explaining would mean telling him about her relationship with Roger. That was something she wanted to avoid, at least for now.</p><p>\u201cThese lines,\u201d he said, tracing his finger along the creases in her brow, \u201care because of Roger Stanhope, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Tell me about him, Julia. It\u2019s time I knew.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Alek urged when she didn\u2019t immediately respond.</p><p>\u201cRoger was just a man I once knew and trusted...several years ago. He proved he wasn\u2019t trustworthy. Can we leave it at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved him?\u201d</p><p>Admitting it hurt her pride. Mixed in with all the regrets and the guilt was shame. Her only crime had been loving a man who didn\u2019t deserve it. A man who\u2019d used her and shocked her with his betrayal, so much so that she\u2019d refused to believe he was responsible for what had happened until her father had literally shoved the evidence at her. Even then she\u2019d made excuses for him, unable to accept the truth. Her father had become so exasperated with her that he\u2019d... Julia turned her thoughts from that fateful day when her life had become a living nightmare.</p><p>\u201cYes, I loved him,\u201d she answered finally. \u201cIt was a mistake. A very bad one.\u201d \u201cWhat was your mistake?\u201d Alek probed gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too complicated. But rest assured, I learned my lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...love sometimes hurts.\u201d</p><p>Alek studied her for a moment, but what he was hoping to see, Julia could only speculate.</p><p>\u201cLove doesn\u2019t always bring pain,\u201d he said. \u201cMy love will prove otherwise.\u201d He kissed her with a compassion that brought tears to her eyes. She managed to blink them back and offer him a look of gratitude.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said softly, lifting her into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s time for bed.\u201d</p><p>At dawn Alek was suddenly awake. Moonlight waltzed across the bedroom walls and the room was silent.</p><p>A chime rang the hour from the anniversary clock Julia kept on top of her bookcase. It was only 5:00 a.m. and he should be exhausted. But he was drained, sated, happy. His wife slept contentedly at his side, her slim body curled against his. He kissed her cheek, grateful Julia was married to him.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to ask her more about Stanhope, but he could see the raw anguish the man\u2019s name brought to her eyes, and even satisfying his curiosity wasn\u2019t worth causing her additional pain.</p><p>Alek knew very little of this man, but what he did know, he didn\u2019t like. He\u2019d seen the way Roger had reached for Julia, placing his hand on her arm as though he had a right to touch her, to make demands. Alek didn\u2019t like the way the other man had looked at her, either, with a leer, as if he could have her with no more than a few persuasive words.</p><p>Alek hadn\u2019t thought of himself as jealous, but the quiet rage he\u2019d felt when he found Roger Stanhope pestering Julia couldn\u2019t be denied.</p><p>The man was a weakling. Stanhope relied on his sleek good looks, his flashy smile and compelling personality instead of intelligence, honest work and business acumen.</p><p>Alek wasn\u2019t fooled. Roger Stanhope was an enemy. Not only of Julia\u2019s, but Jerry\u2019s, as well. Julia hadn\u2019t explained the telephone conversation she\u2019d had with her brother, even when he\u2019d asked.</p><p>Although she\u2019d tried to make light of Jerry\u2019s call, Alek had caught snatches of the conversation, enough to know she was worried. She\u2019d been unable to disguise her distress. Stanhope wasn\u2019t worth one iota of anxiety. As Julia\u2019s husband, it was up to Alek to make sure that the man who\u2019d betrayed her and her family wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do so again.</p><p>Alek was gone when Julia woke and she instantly experienced a surge of disappointment. One look at the clock explained Alek\u2019s absence. The last time she\u2019d slept past ten had been as a teenager.</p><p>Nevertheless, she missed him. A slow smile spread over her lips. She\u2019d married quite a man. Obviously he worked with as much energy and enthusiasm as he made love.</p><p>She climbed out of bed and threw on her robe. Since it was Saturday, and her week had been hellish, she intended to relax. There would be problems enough to deal with on Monday morning. The desire to rush into her office today was nonexistent.</p><p>She was knotting the belt on her pink silk robe as she wandered into the kitchen. Anna was there, busily whipping up something delicious, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Alek\u2019s sister stopped what she was doing and brought Julia a cup of coffee.</p><p>Being waited on was a luxury that would soon spoil her. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of myself,\u201d Julia told her, not unkindly. \u201cYou go back to whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d She walked over to the counter and on closer examination saw that the contents of Anna\u2019s bowl resembled cookie dough. A sample confirmed her guess. Oatmeal raisin, she thought.</p><p>\u201cYum.\u201d</p><p>Anna grinned at the compliment. \u201cAlek asked me to bake them this morning for your picnic.\u201d</p><p>Julia paused halfway across the kitchen floor. \u201cOur picnic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he left a note asking me to pack a basket of food. He gave me a long list of everything he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Julia asked, adding cream to her coffee. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>Anna shook her head as she resumed stirring the thick batter. \u201cNo. He had some errand. He doesn\u2019t tell me much. I\u2019m only his sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t tell me much, either,\u201d Julia added with a short laugh. \u201cI\u2019m only his wife.\u201d</p><p>Anna giggled. \u201cHe should be back soon. He said you were very tired and wanted to be sure you slept as long as you needed. I\u2019m very sorry about your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u2014I\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d Julia said, breathing in deeply at the fresh stab of pain she felt at the mention of Ruth\u2019s death. That pain would be with her for a long while. Losing her grandmother had left a wide, gaping hole in her heart. Alek\u2019s love had helped her begin to heal, but she would always miss Ruth.</p><p>Sitting down at the table with the morning paper, Julia tried to focus her attention on the headlines. Soon the words blurred and ran together. The tears came as an unwelcome surprise, and she bent her head, hoping Anna wouldn\u2019t notice.</p> <p>The sound of the front door opening announced Alek\u2019s return. Julia hurriedly wiped the tears from her cheeks and smiled up at him. She hadn\u2019t fooled him, she realized, but it didn\u2019t matter. He strolled over to her, his eyes full of love, and kissed her deeply.</p><p>Julia had trouble not losing herself in his kiss. It would have been so easy to let it lead to something more....</p><p>Alek glanced impatiently over his shoulder at his sister. \u201cI\u2019ll give her the rest of the day off,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d</p><p>The hunger in his eyes told her how serious he was. He raised her effortlessly from her chair, sat down and held her in his lap.</p> <p>\u201cYou slept late?\u201d he questioned, smoothing the hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cVery late. You should\u2019ve gotten me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was tempted. Tomorrow I will have no qualms about waking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, loving him so much it felt as if she could hardly contain it. She saw Anna watching them and could tell that Alek\u2019s sister was pleased at their closeness. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a picnic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alek said, his face brightening.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a surprise. Bring a sweater, an extra set of clothes and a...\u201d He hesitated, as if searching for a word, something he rarely did. \u201cA kite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKite...as in a flying-in-the-wind kite?\u201d</p><p>He nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cAlek,\u201d she said, studying him, \u201cAre you taking me to the ocean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love, the ocean. And,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019re leaving our cell phones and BlackBerries behind.\u201d</p><p>Julia had no problem with that directive.</p><p>Within fifteen minutes they were on their way. Anna\u2019s basket was tucked away in the backseat, along with an extra set of clothes for each of them, several beach towels, a blanket\u2014and no fewer than five different kites, all of which Alek had bought while he was out.</p><p>He drove to Ocean Shores. The sun shone brightly and the surf pounded the sand with a roar that echoed toward them. The scent of salt stung the air. Sea gulls soared overhead, looking for an opportune meal. There were plenty of people, but this was nothing like the crowded beaches along the Oregon and California coasts.</p> <p>Alek parked the car and found them an ideal spot to spread out their blanket and bask in the sunshine. Julia removed her shoes and ran barefoot in the warm sand, chasing after him.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect,\u201d she cried, throwing out her arms. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>Alek returned to the car for their picnic basket and the kites and joined her on the blanket. He looked more relaxed than she could ever remember seeing him. He sank down beside her and stretched out with a contented sigh.</p><p>The wind buffeted them and a minute later, Alek moved, positioning himself behind her. He wrapped his arms around her and inhaled slowly, drawing the salty air into his lungs. Julia did the same, breathing in the fresh clean scent of the sea.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so peaceful here,\u201d she murmured. There were a number of activities going on around them, including horseback riding, kite flying, a football-throwing contest, even a couple of volleyball games, but none of those distracted her from the serenity she experienced.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d feel this way.\u201d He kissed the side of her neck.</p><p>Julia relaxed against his strength, letting him absorb her weight.</p><p>\u201cMy mother often brought Anna and me to the Black Sea after our father was killed.\u201d</p><p>Julia knew shockingly little about her husband\u2019s life before he came to the United States. \u201cHow old were you when he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen. Anna was seven. It was 1986.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>It seemed an eternity passed before Alek spoke, and when he did his voice was low. \u201cHe was murdered. I don\u2019t think we will ever know the real reason. They came, the soldiers, in the middle of the night. We were all asleep. I woke to my mother\u2019s screams but by the time I got past the soldier guarding the door, my father was already dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alek.\u201d Julia\u2019s throat tightened with the effort to hold back tears.</p><p>\u201cWe learned from someone who risked his life to tell us that the KGB suspected my father of some illegal activity\u2014we never heard the details. It made no sense to us since my father was a loyal Communist. Like me, he worked as a chemist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alek. How terrible for all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed, \u201cand it nearly destroyed my mother. If it hadn\u2019t been for Anna and me, I believe my mother would have died, too. Not at the soldiers\u2019 hands, but from grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother had to support us. Both Anna and I did everything we could to help, but it was difficult. Because I was a good student, I was given the opportunity to attend university. It was there that I met my first Americans. I couldn\u2019t believe the freedom and prosperity those students told me about. I\u2019ve always been good with languages\u2014Anna, too. Soon afterward, I started learning English. After I met Jerry, he sent me books and CDs. He was my link to America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you surprised when he asked you to come and work for Conrad Industries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Jerry ever tell you about his beautiful younger sister?\u201d Julia prodded.</p><p>\u201cIn passing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you curious about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She poked him in the ribs and was rewarded with a mock cry of pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more curious now,\u201d he said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>His hand edged beneath her blouse.</p><p>\u201cAlek!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just wondering how fast I can make you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast enough. Now, stop. We\u2019re on a public beach.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as though her words had wounded him. \u201cMaybe we should get a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could have done that in Seattle. Since we\u2019re at the beach and the day is gorgeous, let\u2019s enjoy ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Alek said sternly, \u201ctrust me, we would enjoy ourselves in a hotel room, too.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she leaned back her head to look at him. \u201cNo one told me you were a sex fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do this to me, Julia, only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll satisfy your, uh, carnal appetite,\u201d she assured him with a grin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a woman of my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must not be so selfish,\u201d Alek said, and the teasing quality was gone from his voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring you here to make love, I brought you here to heal. After my father was killed, my mother made weekly trips to the beach with Anna and me. It was a time of solace for us, and it helped us heal. I hoped it would help you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Julia said, looking out at the pounding surf.</p><p>\u201cYou must forgive my greed for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you forgive my greed for you.\u201d The love-making was so new, they were eager to learn everything they could about each other, eager to give and to receive. Julia didn\u2019t fool herself into believing this kind of desire could continue. If it did, they might both die of sheer exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI want you to relax in my arms,\u201d Alek said, \u201cand close your eyes.\u201d He waited a moment. \u201cAre they closed?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The sounds that came at her were intense. The ocean as it slapped against the shore, the cry of the birds and the roar of scooters as they shot past her, kicking up the sand. The smells, carried on the wind, were pungent.</p><p>\u201cNow open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Julia obeyed and was overwhelmed by the richness of the colors around her. The sky was blue with huge puffy clouds. The water was a sparkling green that left a thin, white, frothy trail on the sand. Every color was vibrant, every detail. Julia\u2019s breath caught in her throat at the beauty before her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alek, it\u2019s so lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother did that with Anna and me, but I think she was doing it for herself, too. She wanted us to see that life could be good, if we looked around at the world instead of within ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Julia knew that was what she\u2019d been doing these past few years, looking at the darkness and the shortcomings within herself. Under such intense scrutiny, her faults had seemed glaring. It was little wonder that she\u2019d been so miserable.</p><p>\u201cAlek,\u201d she said, with her discovery, \u201cthank you, thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>They kissed, and it was as if his love was absolution for all that had gone before and all that would come later. She turned in his embrace and slipped her arms around his neck. When they\u2019d finished kissing, they simply held each other.</p><p>Alek knew his relationship with Julia had changed that afternoon by the ocean. Things between them were different now. More open, more trusting. They\u2019d had fun, too\u2014childish, uncomplicated fun\u2014something neither of them had done in years. They\u2019d flown kites, run through the surf, eaten Anna\u2019s sandwiches and cookies, feeding each other bites.</p><p>Sunday evening, the day after their venture to the beach, Alek needed to run down to the lab. When he told Julia, she offered to go with him, as if even an hour apart was more than she could bear.</p><p>Her willingness had taken him by surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019ll do me good to get out.\u201d</p><p>They listened to classical music on the way across town. Security had been increased at the plant, with extra guards posted; Alek gave them a friendly nod. Julia went with him into his office. He found the notes he needed and brought them home.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d she asked once they\u2019d returned.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her desire to indulge him with small pleasures was something of a surprise, too, a pleasant one.</p><p>While he read over his calculations, Julia was content to sit at his side, absorbed in a novel. He couldn\u2019t remember a time when she\u2019d voluntarily sat still. Her body always seemed to be filled with nervous energy. That was gone from her now and in its place had come a restfulness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to work in the morning,\u201d she said when Alek was finished. Leaning against him, she stretched her legs out along the sofa and heaved a giant sigh. \u201cThese past few days have been so wonderful. I don\u2019t feel ready to deal with the office again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you always work, Julia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.

Did you think I would?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen rest assured, Mr. Berinski, I want your children.\u201d</p><p>Alek felt his heart expand with eagerness. \u201cSo you\u2019d like a family,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we work on this project soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He fiddled with the buttons of her shirt. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, aware of the husky sound of his voice.</p> <p>Julia sighed that womanly sigh he\u2019d come to recognize as a signal of her eagerness for him. \u201cI think we might be able to arrange that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, my love,\u201d Alek said with a groan, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never get enough of you. What have you done to me? Are you a witch who\u2019s cast some spell over me?\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s cast a spell over anyone, it\u2019s you over me. I\u2019m lonely without you. If we can\u2019t be together, I feel lost and empty. I never thought I could love again, certainly not like this, and you\u2019ve shown me the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d He rasped her name and, folding her over his arm, bent forward to cover her soft reaching mouth with his. The kiss revealed their need for each other. He heard Julia\u2019s book fall off the sofa and hit the floor, but neither cared. His hands were busy with her shirt and once it was open, she twisted around to face him.</p><p>\u201cI vote for the bed this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bed,\u201d he said mockingly. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of adventure?\u201d</p> <p>Julia laughed softly. \u201cIt was used up in the bathtub this morning. Did you know it took me twenty minutes to clean the water off the floor?\u201d</p><p>He carried her into their bedroom, kissing her all the while.</p><p>Afterward, they lay on the bed. Julia was sprawled across him. Every now and then she kissed him, or he kissed her. Alek had never known such contentment in his life. It frightened him. Happiness had always been fleeting, and he wasn\u2019t sure he could trust what he\u2019d found with Julia. His hold on her tightened and he closed his eyes and discovered he couldn\u2019t imagine what his life would be like without her now. Bleak and empty, he decided.</p><p>When Jerry had first suggested this marriage, Alek had set his terms. He wasn\u2019t a believer in the staying power of love. It had always seemed temporary to him, ephemeral, and it came at the expense of everything else. Alek couldn\u2019t claim he\u2019d never been in love before. There\u2019d been a handful of brief relationships over the years, but each time he\u2019d grown bored and restless. He was a disappointment to his mother, who was hoping he and Anna would provide her with grandchildren to spoil.</p><p>How perceptive his sister was to realize he hadn\u2019t loved Julia in the beginning. He hadn\u2019t expected to ever truly love her. He\u2019d offered her his loyalty and his devotion, but had held his heart in reserve. She had it now, though, in her palm. His heart. His very life.</p><p>Julia lay across her husband\u2019s body and sighed deeply, completely and utterly content. She\u2019d never known a time like this with a man. A time of peace and discovery. His talk of children had unleashed long-buried dreams.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t bothered to use protection. Not even once. They each seemed to pretend it didn\u2019t matter, that what would be would be.</p><p>Pregnant.</p> <p>She said the word in her mind as though it was foreign to her, and in many ways it was. A few weeks ago she would\u2019ve sworn it was impossible; after all, she didn\u2019t intend to sleep with her husband. That had certainly changed, and now, thoughts of a family filled her mind and her heart. Perhaps it was because she\u2019d so recently lost Ruth and because one of the last things her grandmother had said was about children \u201cwaiting to be born.\u201d</p><p>After so many years of pain, Julia hardly knew how to deal with happiness. In some ways she was afraid to trust that it would last. She\u2019d been happy with Roger\u2014and then everything had blown up in her face. The crushing pain of his deception would never leave her, but she\u2019d lost the desire to punish him. Conrad Industries\u2019 success would be revenge enough. There might not have been sufficient evidence to charge him, but people in the business suspected him. They talked. That meant he wasn\u2019t likely to be hired by any other company once he left Ideal Paints\u2014or they fired him. After what had happened, no one else would trust him. Without realizing what he was doing, he\u2019d painted himself in a corner. She smiled at her own pun.</p><p>\u201cSomething amuses you?\u201d Alek asked, apparently having felt her smile.</p><p>\u201cYes...and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds rather vague to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he challenged. \u201cDo you have something...physical in mind?\u201d</p><p>Julia grinned again. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, I\u2019m sure you do. Now hush, I\u2019m trying to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest you stop making those little movements.\u201d</p><p>Julia hadn\u2019t been conscious of moving. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his hands on her hips. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Julia resumed her daydream. A baby would turn her world upside down. She\u2019d never been very domestic. If her child-rearing skills were on the level of her cooking skills, then she\u2014</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re frowning.\u201d Alek murmured. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I was just thinking I might not be a very good mother. I don\u2019t know anything about babies. I might really botch this.\u201d</p><p>He took her head between his hands and brought her mouth to his. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a wonderful mother. We\u2019ll learn about this together when the time comes. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Julia sighed loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. As a logical, practical businessperson I know it, but as a woman, I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, woman, you\u2019re making it impossible to nap. As far as I can tell, there\u2019s only one way to keep you quiet.\u201d With his arms around her waist, he turned her onto her back and nuzzled her neck until Julia cried out and promised to do whatever he said.</p><p>Monday morning, Julia arrived at the office before eight. Virginia, her assistant, appeared a few minutes after she did, looking flustered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize you were planning to be here quite so early. If I had, I would\u2019ve come in before eight myself. I\u2019ll get your coffee right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Julia said, reaching for the stack of mail in her in-basket. Her desk was neatly organized, and she was grateful Virginia had taken the time to lighten her load.</p><p>\u201cI read over the mail and your emails and answered everything I could,\u201d Virginia said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m grateful for your help.\u201d</p><p>Virginia hurried out to the lunchroom, returning a few minutes later with a steaming cup of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any cream. I\u2019ll send out for some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live without cream,\u201d Julia said absently, turning on her computer. \u201cWould you ask my brother to drop in when it\u2019s convenient? And please contact my husband and see if he could meet me for lunch.\u201d She\u2019d left while he was in the shower and had forgotten to leave him a note. \u201cI meant to ask\u2014\u201d She stopped, realizing she probably already had a luncheon appointment. \u201cThat is, if I\u2019m not tied up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scheduled to meet with Mr. Casey, but I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d feel up to dealing with him your first day back. I took the liberty of rescheduling the luncheon for Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>Virginia knew Doug Casey, their outside counsel, was one of her least favorite people, and she smiled her appreciation. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right back to you,\u201d Virginia said. True to her word, she returned a few minutes later. \u201cYour brother will be down shortly and your husband suggests you meet at noon at Freeway Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She turned back to her computer and didn\u2019t hear Virginia leave her office.</p><p>Jerry hurried into her office. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Stanhope,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cI think he\u2019s up to something. I\u2019ve got a private investigator following him. If he makes contact with any of our people, we\u2019ll know about it.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled a pen between her palms. \u201cI can\u2019t believe any of our employees would sell us out, can you?\u201d</p><p>Jerry tensed. \u201cAfter what happened last time, who\u2019s to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know the second you hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. The investigator\u2019s going to make regular reports.\u201d</p><p>Her brother left, and Julia was involved with a large stack of correspondence when she noted the time. She stopped in the middle of a dictation.</p><p>Virginia raised her head, anticipating Julia\u2019s next move.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue this after lunch,\u201d she said, standing and reaching for her purse. \u201cI won\u2019t be back until after one. Cover for me if need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Virginia was on her feet, too, and Julia felt her scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked the older woman.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Virginia said with a shy smile. \u201cSomething\u2019s very right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Julia didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you look happier.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Freeway Park was one of Seattle\u2019s many innovative ideas. A large grassy area built over a freeway. Green ivy spilled down the concrete banks, reaching toward the road far below.</p><p>At noon, many Seattle office workers converged on the park to enjoy their lunch in the opulent sunshine. Each summer the city offered a series of free concerts. Julia didn\u2019t know if there was one scheduled for that afternoon, but nothing could have made her day any more perfect than meeting her husband.</p><p>She saw Alek from across the grass and started toward him. He\u2019d obviously seen her at the same time because he grinned broadly and moved in her direction.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring anything for lunch?\u201d he asked, after they kissed briefly.</p><p>Eating was something Julia often failed to think about. \u201cOh, no, I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought as much. Luckily you have a husband who knows his wife. Come, let\u2019s find a place to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you buy?\u201d she asked, pointing at the white sack in his hand.</p><p>\u201cFish and chips. Do you approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d She was hungry, she realized, which had become a rarity. Generally she ate because it was necessary, not for any real enjoyment. Anna was sure to change that. Alek\u2019s sister cooked tempting breakfasts and left delicious three-and four-course dinners ready to be served when they got home. By the end of the year, Julia predicted she\u2019d gain weight\u2014from all the wonderful food...and because by then she\u2019d likely be pregnant. The thought produced a deep sense of excitement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alek found a spot for them on a park bench. He set the white bag between them and lifted out an order of fish-and-chips packed in a cardboard container.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to fatten me up?\u201d she teased.</p><p>His eyes twinkled. \u201cYou know me almost as well as I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I do.\u201d She laughed.</p> <p>\u201cBut the question is,\u201d Alek said, eyeing her speculatively, \u201cdo you like me?\u201d</p><p>It was an effort to pull her gaze away from his magnetic eyes. \u201cMore each day,\u201d she answered honestly.</p><p>An electric moment passed before Alek spoke. \u201cYou won\u2019t be working late tonight, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Will you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI plan to be home at five-fifteen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat early?\u201d She usually didn\u2019t leave the office until after six.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be lucky to last that long,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>There was no missing his meaning. Julia\u2019s body went into overdrive. She\u2019d never thought of herself as a highly sexual person, but in that instant she knew she had to do something to appease the overwhelming urge she had to make love with her husband.</p><p>\u201cAlek...would you mind kissing me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, then bent his head, meaning only to brush her lips, she suspected, but that wouldn\u2019t be enough to satisfy her. Not anymore. She touched his lips with her tongue, teasing and taunting him.</p><p>A deep moan came from low within his throat, which aroused her as nothing ever had before. The kiss deepened and deepened until they were completely lost in each other.</p> <p>She wrenched her mouth from his, gasping. \u201cFive-fifteen,\u201d she said when she could manage to speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Jerry was waiting in her office when Julia returned from lunch. Without greeting her, he announced, \u201cRoger\u2019s made contact with someone from the lab.\u201d</p><p>Julia was stunned into speechlessness. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked when she could. There was a cold, sinking feeling in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cRich Peck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Rich Peck?\u201d</p><p>Jerry spun around and glared at her. \u201cThe private eye I hired. Rich traced the phone numbers that came into Roger\u2019s home for the past several days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Jerry said, clearly exasperated with her, \u201cthat isn\u2019t important right now. What is important is that someone from Conrad Industries contacted Roger. They used the phone from the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point. It could\u2019ve been any number of people. The phone\u2019s used by nearly everyone on staff. What I\u2019m saying is that we\u2019ve got a traitor on our hands.\u201d</p><p>Julia found that hard to believe. Almost everyone who was employed at the lab had been with them three years earlier. Their dislike of Roger was well-known. After the fire it had taken months to rebuild, and Julia had tried to keep as many employees on the payroll as possible during that time, in order not to lose her trained and loyal help. There were at least twenty who\u2019d been with Conrad Industries fifteen years or longer. The strain on the budget crippled the company financially. And nearly every employee had hung on, counting on the promise of reimbursement once Julia could get the company back on its feet.</p><p>Julia appreciated their sacrifice. And their trust. Her father had recently died, and to say she was inexperienced would\u2019ve been an understatement. The company was on the verge of bankruptcy. It was one of the bleakest times in Julia\u2019s life and in the company\u2019s history.</p><p>Ruth\u2019s faith in her to pull the company out of financial disaster had helped Julia survive that grim period.</p><p>The idea that someone working in the lab was selling her out now\u2014it seemed impossible. She refused to believe it. Refused to accept it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d Jerry asked.</p><p>Julia walked over to the window and stared down at the street ten floors below. Cars and people looked miniature and seemed to be moving in slow motion. It was as if she was staring at another world that had no connection to her own.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cWe do nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d she demanded impatiently. \u201cAll we have is the knowledge that someone contacted Roger. Should we haul every employee in for questioning by Peck, hoping his expertise at grilling fifty-year-old men and women will flush out whoever wants to betray us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could have Alek scout around and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, interrupting him. \u201cAlek is as much a suspect as anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! Alek\u2019s poured his whole life into this project. You don\u2019t think he\u2019d betray us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed readily enough. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the facts. Roger had every reason to hope Conrad Industries would prosper, too, and look what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Alek...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek is a suspect, like everyone else. I warn you, Jerry, don\u2019t say a word to him. Not a single word.\u201d</p><p>Her brother stared at her. \u201cHe\u2019s your husband. You don\u2019t even trust your own husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t. You can thank Roger for that. I wouldn\u2019t trust my own mother after the lesson Roger taught me. If you think I\u2019m coldhearted, then fine. I\u2019d rather have you think poorly of me than hand over the fate of this company to a man who could destroy us.\u201d</p><p>Making love to his wife was probably the most fabulous sensation Alek had ever experienced. Perhaps it was because she\u2019d withheld herself from him for so long that he treasured the prize so highly. Julia was open, honest and genuine.</p><p>Alek had never lost control of himself with another woman, but he had with Julia. She was fast becoming as necessary to him as the air he breathed. He wanted her, and that need was growing at an alarming rate.</p><p>Every time they were intimate, she gave him a little more of herself. A little more of her trust. A little more of her heart and soul.</p><p>He glanced at his watch and frowned. It was well past the time they\u2019d agreed to meet. Knowing Julia, she\u2019d probably got caught up in her work and let the time slip away from her.</p><p>He waited another ten minutes before calling her office. Her assistant answered.</p><p>\u201cThis is Alek. Has Julia left the office yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Virginia sounded surprised. \u201cShe\u2019s still here. Would you like me to connect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He waited a moment before Julia came on the line.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said absently. Alek could picture her sitting behind her desk with her reading glasses at the end of her nose.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive-forty. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had an appointment, remember?\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got a deck of cards and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA deck of cards?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he heard in her voice, but it wasn\u2019t amusement. It troubled him, but he didn\u2019t have time to analyze it just then. \u201cYes, I recently heard about this American card game that I want to play with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA card game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip poker. Sounds like fun. I\u2019ve got everything ready. How much longer are you going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alek, listen, I\u2019m really sorry, but I could be at the office another hour or more. Everything from last week is piled up on my desk. I really shouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it, but he understood. \u201cMy game can wait, and it looks like I\u2019ll have to, as well.\u201d He was hoping for a little sympathy, or at least a sigh of regret, but he received neither.</p><p>Julia was keeping something from him. He heard it in her voice, felt it as clearly as if it were a tangible thing.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t arrive home until nearly nine. It would be too much to ask that Alek not be there waiting for her. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to look him in the eye.</p><p>A headache had been building from the moment Jerry had left her office. Everything in her told her Alek would be the last person who\u2019d sell them out. It would make it much easier to believe in him if she hadn\u2019t so staunchly defended Roger to her father. She\u2019d been wrong once and it had nearly cost her sanity.</p><p>Alek greeted her at the door. Without a word he drew her into his arms and hugged her. She was swallowed in his embrace, surrounded by his love, and she soaked it up, needing it so badly.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s troubling you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She had no choice but to sidestep the question. \u201cWhat makes you think anything\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband. I know you,\u201d he said, echoing his comment from that afternoon. But then he\u2019d been teasing; now his statement sounded like the simple truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a terrible headache.\u201d</p><p>He studied her as if he wasn\u2019t sure he should believe her, although it was true enough. Her temples throbbed and she was exhausted. \u201cDid you have dinner?\u201d she asked, wanting to turn the subject away from herself.</p><p>\u201cNo, I waited for you. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Her appetite was nil. \u201cI\u2019m not very hungry. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like a bath.\u201d She left him without giving him a chance to respond.</p><p>The hot water was soothing and a full thirty minutes passed before she could bring herself to leave the tub. She dressed for bed, craving the oblivion of sleep. But Alek was waiting for her when she finished. He seemed to anticipate her every need, which increased her guilt.</p><p>He followed her into the bedroom. \u201cWould you like me to rub your temples?\u201d he asked, sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>He seemed surprised by her question. \u201cOf course. There\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alek,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, sitting on their bed, his back against the headboard, his legs stretched out. \u201cRest your head on me and I\u2019ll massage your forehead. Would you like me to sing to you again?\u201d He reached for the light at the side of the bed and turned it off.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The meaning of the words he was singing was beyond her, but she loved the deep, melodic sound of his voice. As he sang, his nimble fingers gently soothed the throbbing pain in her head. She was sleepy when he finished. Lifting her head from his lap, he began to leave her. It was then that Julia realized how much she wanted him to stay.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d she pleaded softly. \u201cCome to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few minutes,\u201d he agreed with obvious reluctance. He undressed in the dark and slipped beneath the sheets, then gathered her in his arms.</p><p>Alek held her for a long time and she savored these moments of closeness as the warmth of his love stole over her. Alek alleviated the feelings of abandonment and loss she\u2019d felt since Roger\u2019s betrayal, since her father\u2019s death and now her grandmother\u2019s. He loved her as no man ever had.</p><p>Julia was restless. She didn\u2019t understand why she couldn\u2019t sit still. Then again, she could. It was only natural to be nervous, considering the phone call she\u2019d received earlier that morning. It had been a week since Jerry had hired Rich Peck and now Rich had phoned wanting to give them his first weekly report. Since Jerry was out for the afternoon, Julia had agreed to meet with the investigator herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Virginia announced his arrival and Peck entered her office. He was tall and wiry, and much younger than she\u2019d expected. Perhaps thirty, if that.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, stepping forward and shaking her hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down,\u201d Julia invited.</p><p>He took the chair on the other side of her desk. \u201cThis Stanhope fellow is an interesting character,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019ve been tailing him for nearly a week. I managed to get photos of just about everyone he\u2019s met. My guess is that whoever\u2019s leaking information to him is a woman. Once you get a look at the photographs you\u2019ll understand why. He\u2019s quite the ladies\u2019 man.\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t news to Julia.</p><p>Rich brought out a folder thick with photographs, reached for a small pad and flipped through the first couple of pages.</p><p>\u201cHe had several business lunches, as best as I can tell. Although we\u2019ve got a twenty-four-hour tail on him, there are certain periods of time we can\u2019t account for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Do you think he knows he\u2019s being followed?\u201d</p><p>Rich snickered. \u201cThe guy hasn\u2019t got a clue. He\u2019s way too arrogant. He lives on the edge, too. I talked to his landlady and learned he\u2019s two months behind on his rent. It\u2019s happened before. His credit rating\u2019s so full of holes he couldn\u2019t get a loan if his life depended on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about his position with Ideal Paints? Is that secure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? From what I\u2019ve been able to find out, he doesn\u2019t have many friends. He seems to get along all right on the job. As for what he does with his money, that isn\u2019t hard to figure out. The guy goes out with a different woman every night. He seems to get his kicks showing off what a stud he is.\u201d</p><p>This, too, didn\u2019t come as any surprise to Julia. Roger liked to refer to himself as a \u201cparty animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and look through those photos and see if there\u2019s anyone you recognize. Take your time. I\u2019ve got them stacked according to the day of the week. Thursday of this week is on top. He left his apartment about ten. He seemed to be in a hurry and got to his office around ten-fifteen. He didn\u2019t leave again until four, and then came out a side entrance. My tail noted that some girl came out the front of the building directly afterward and seemed to be looking for someone. Our guess is that he was escaping her.</p><p>\u201cHe waited around ten or fifteen minutes and then left. He went home, changed his clothes and was out again by six. He picked up some chick and they went to dinner. He spent the night with her.\u201d</p><p>That, too, was typical.</p> <p>\u201cWednesday...\u201d Rich continued as Julia flipped through the photographs. \u201cAgain he was late to the office. He arrived about ten and left again at eleven-thirty. He drove to Henshaw\u2019s, that fancy restaurant on Lake Union.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded; she knew it well. An eternity earlier it had been one of their favorite places. The food was delicious and the ambience luxurious but not overpowering.</p><p>\u201cWhoever he was supposed to meet was waiting for him outside. I assume this was a business lunch. The guy he was meeting was angry about something. The two of them exchanged words outside the restaurant. We got several excellent photos. It looked for a moment like they were going to have a fistfight. Frankly, Stanhope was smart to avoid this one. The guy would\u2019ve pulverized him in seconds.\u201d</p><p>Julia flipped to the next series of pictures. Her gaze fell on Alek\u2019s angry face and she gasped.</p><p>Rich\u2019s attention reverted from the tablet to her. \u201cYou recognize him?\u201d</p><p>Julia felt as if she was going to vomit.</p><p>\u201cMs. Conrad?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cAn employee?\u201d</p><p>Once again she nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she managed. \u201cAn employee. You can leave the rest of the photographs here and I\u2019ll go through them later. You\u2019ve done an excellent job, Mr. Peck.\u201d She stood and ushered him to the door. \u201cJerry will be in touch with you sometime later this afternoon. I believe you\u2019ve solved our mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways glad to be of service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you again.\u201d</p><p>Julia collapsed against the door the instant it was closed. Her stomach twisted into a knot of pain. This couldn\u2019t be happening. This couldn\u2019t be real. She felt nauseous and made a dash to her wastepaper basket, where she threw up her lunch. She was kneeling on the floor, her trembling hands holding her hair away from her face, when Virginia walked into the office.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Virginia said. With her hand under Julia\u2019s elbow, she raised her to her feet. \u201cYou need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould...would you see if you could find my brother for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to call your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said forcefully, \u201cget Jerry. Have him come as soon as he can.... Tell him it\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Her legs were unstable and she slumped into her chair. In the past three years Julia had received a number of lessons in pain. Roger had been her first teacher, but his tactics paled when compared to Alek\u2019s. It would\u2019ve been easier to bear if Alek had aimed a gun at her heart and pulled the trigger.</p><p>It took her brother twenty minutes to reach her office; he must\u2019ve been in the middle of something important when Virginia called. As she waited she gazed sightlessly at her desk. She should be sobbing hysterically; instead, she found herself as calm and cool as if the man who\u2019d been betraying her and her brother was barely more than an acquaintance.</p><p>Jerry rushed into her office, apparently having run at least part of the way, because his face was red and he was breathless.</p><p>\u201cVirginia said it was an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I was being a bit dramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to Virginia. She wanted to know if she should phone for an ambulance. You\u2019re pale, but otherwise you look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, and you won\u2019t be, either, once you take a look at these.\u201d She handed him the series of three photographs.</p><p>The blotchy redness faded from Jerry\u2019s face and he blanched as he studied Rich Peck\u2019s photographs.</p><p>\u201cAlek?\u201d he breathed in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIt appears so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be some explanation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there is.\u201d There always was. Something that would sound logical and persuasive. She\u2019d been through this before and knew all there was to know about betrayals of trust. When she\u2019d confronted Roger, he\u2019d worn a hurt, incredulous look of shock and dismay. He\u2019d angrily declared his innocence, told her it was all a misunderstanding that he\u2019d be able to clear up in a matter of minutes, given the opportunity. Because she loved him so desperately and because she wanted to believe him so badly, she\u2019d listened. In the end it all seemed credible to her and she\u2019d defended him because she loved and trusted him. She loved and trusted Alek, too, but she\u2019d been wrong before, so very wrong, and it had cost her and her family dearly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Jerry asked in a whisper. He hadn\u2019t recovered yet. He continued to stare at the photographs as though the pictures themselves would announce the truth if he studied them long enough.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said unevenly.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to fire him, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, for the love of heaven, Alek\u2019s your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jerry rubbed a hand over his face and inhaled deeply. \u201cWe should confront him, give him the opportunity to explain. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s got a very good reason for meeting Roger. One that has nothing to do with Phoenix Paints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, you were ten before you stopped believing in Santa Claus. Remember? There\u2019s only one reason Alek would contact Roger and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he argued. \u201cAlek has more reason for Phoenix Paints to succeed than anyone. His career hinges on the success of our new line. Why would he deliberately sabotage himself? He spent years researching these developments.\u201d His eyes pleaded with her.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to me for answers, I don\u2019t have any. Why do any of us do the things we do? My guess is that he\u2019s out for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge? Alek? Why? We\u2019ve been good to him, good to his family, and he\u2019s been good to us. He doesn\u2019t have any score to settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad was good to Roger, too, remember? He was the one who gave Roger his first job. Dad hired him directly out of college when he could\u2019ve taken on someone with far more experience. If we\u2019re looking for reasons Alek would never do this, we\u2019d be putting blindfolds over our own eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jerry watched her for several minutes. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Julia folded her arms around her waist and nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I couldn\u2019t bear it. Not again.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut and her body swayed with the pain. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it is, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I continually fall for the wrong kind of man? There must be something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>Jerry walked to her window and stared out. His shoulders moved in a deep sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Julia agreed. \u201cBut I have that ache in the pit of my stomach again. The last time it was there was when Dad forced me to face the truth about Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least we can do is listen to his explanation.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cYou listen, I...can\u2019t.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to be there when Alek made his excuses. She\u2019d let her brother handle this because she was incapable of dealing with it.</p><p>Jerry\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you so...detached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she returned sarcastically. \u201cCould it have been following my breakup with Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different. You\u2019re married to Alek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means it\u2019s a little more involved, a little more complicated than before, but it\u2019s not really so different. Until...this is resolved it would be better if Alek didn\u2019t come into work. Tell him that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him, Jerry, because I can\u2019t. Please.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cIt\u2019s just until this is settled. Alek will understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t going to listen to his explanation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You listen to what he has to say, but don\u2019t argue his case with me. I tried that with Dad, remember? I was so certain Roger was an innocent victim of circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Her brother looked older, as though he\u2019d suddenly aged ten years. Julia understood. She felt old herself. And sick. Her stomach felt decidedly queasy.</p><p>Jerry left and her stomach pitched again. Automatically she reached for the wastepaper basket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia left the office an hour later, her cell phone turned off. She wasn\u2019t sure where she intended to go, but she knew she couldn\u2019t stay at work any longer. She started walking with no destination in mind and ended up at the Pike Place Market. People were bustling about and, not wanting to be in a crowd, she headed for the waterfront. Not the tourist areas, but much farther down where the large cruise vessels docked.</p><p>She walked for hours, trying to sort through her emotions, and eventually gave up. She was in too much pain to think clearly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t cry. Not once. She figured this numbness was her body\u2019s protective device.</p><p>It was well past dark and she\u2019d wandered into an unsafe area of town. She finally realized she had to make her way home.</p> <p>When she reached her building, the security man looked surprised to find her arriving so late. He greeted her warmly and held open the heavy glass door for her.</p><p>The elevator ride up to her apartment seemed to take forever, but it wasn\u2019t long enough. Soon she\u2019d face her husband.</p><p>She\u2019d barely gotten her key into the lock when the door was wrenched open. Alek loomed above her like a bad dream.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>She saw the same signs in Alek that she\u2019d seen in Roger. The indignation. The hurt, angry look that she could believe such a terrible thing of him. As if she were the betrayer. As if she were the guilty one.</p> <p>Roger had turned the tables on her with such finesse she didn\u2019t realize what was happening until too late. Julia studied her husband and if she didn\u2019t know better would\u2019ve believed with all her heart that he\u2019d never betray her.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Alek demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor five hours?\u201d</p><p>She moved past him. \u201cI should\u2019ve phoned. I\u2019m sorry, but I needed to think.\u201d</p><p>Alek followed her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to me yourself? Instead you sent Jerry.\u201d His voice revealed his pain. \u201cI don\u2019t deny talking to Roger Stanhope, but at least give me the chance to explain why.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t deny seeing him since we have the evidence,\u201d she responded lifelessly. \u201cYou called him, too, from the lab. We know about that, as well.\u201d</p> <p>If he was surprised, he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cI called him because I wanted him to stay away from you. He wouldn\u2019t listen. Our meeting at Henshaw\u2019s was an accident, he was arriving just as I was leaving. He taunted me, said he could have you back anytime he wanted. He said other things, too, but I don\u2019t care to repeat them. Ask the man you hired to take photographs what happened that day. Stanhope and I nearly got into a fistfight.\u201d</p><p>Julia desperately wanted to believe that he was telling the truth about his motives. Her heart yearned to trust him. But this was like an old tape being played back again and the memories it brought to the surface were too compelling to ignore.</p><p>\u201cThat man Stanhope is slime. I won\u2019t have him anywhere near you,\u201d Alek said heatedly. \u201cIf you want to condemn me for protecting you, then you may. But I would rather rip out my own heart than hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He was saying everything Julia longed to hear. She pressed her hands to her head, not knowing what to do. \u201cI have to think.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, seeming to accept that, but he was hurt and she felt his pain as strongly as her own. Rather than continue a discussion that would cause them both grief, she showered and dressed for bed.</p><p>Alek appeared in the doorway to the guest bedroom when she\u2019d finished. \u201cAnna left you some dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too thin already. Eat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlek, please, I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Julia\u2019s appetite was gone. She\u2019d thrown up her lunch and hadn\u2019t eaten since. Unwilling to argue with him, she went into the kitchen, took the foil-covered dinner plate warming in the oven and sat down at the table.</p><p>His sister had cooked veal cutlets, small red potatoes and what looked like a purple cabbage stir-fry. Even after sitting in the oven for hours, the food was delicious. Julia intended to sample only a few bites to appease Alek and then dump the rest in the garbage disposal, but she ended up eating a respectable amount of food. When she\u2019d finished, she rinsed off her plate and retired to the guest room. Alone.</p><p>In the morning, Julia woke to the sound of Anna and Alek talking in the kitchen. They were speaking in Russian and it was apparent that Anna was upset.</p><p>Donning her robe, Julia wandered in and poured herself a cup of coffee. Anna eyed her with open hostility.</p><p>\u201cMy brother would not do this thing,\u201d she said forcefully.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Alek barked. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you. How can you think he would ever hurt you? He is a man of honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t as simple as it seems,\u201d Julia said in her own defense. Anna didn\u2019t understand, and she didn\u2019t expect her to.</p><p>Alek said something sharp and cold in Russian, but that didn\u2019t stop Anna from turning to Julia once more. \u201cYou do not know my brother. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t believe he could do this terrible thing.\u201d</p><p>Alek reprimanded his sister harshly. Julia didn\u2019t need to understand Russian to know what he was saying.</p><p>Anna responded by yanking the apron from her waist, throwing it on the kitchen counter and storming out of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my sister\u2019s behavior,\u201d Alek said after she\u2019d left. He was so formal, so stiff and proud. He hesitated, as if trying to find the words to express himself. \u201cThere is a meeting with the marketing people this afternoon. It is a very important discussion. I need to be there to answer questions. If you\u2019d rather I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019ll see if someone can take my place.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt incapable of making any decision, even a straightforward one like this.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you attend it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you feel I am doing or saying anything that would hurt Conrad Industries, then you can stop me. I suggest Jerry be there, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek, please try to understand how awkward this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the meeting,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Julia agreed reluctantly.</p><p>He told her the time and place, and afterward they were silent. Julia thought with a kind of sad whimsy that she could hear the sound of their heartache, like the loud ticking of a clock. She was sure Alek heard it, too. After a few minutes, he left the condo.</p><p>Rarely had Julia ever felt more alone. Her thoughts depressed her. She dressed, determined to act as if life was normal until they resolved this problem.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was at the office that she made a clear decision, her first sensible one since this whole nightmare began.</p><p>She pulled the phonebook out of her desk drawer, swallowed hard, praying she could pull this off, and then, with a bravado she didn\u2019t feel, dialed Roger Stanhope\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stanhope\u2019s office,\u201d came the efficient reply.</p><p>\u201cThis is Julia Conrad for Mr. Stanhope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p><p>A short time passed before Roger\u2019s smooth voice came over the wire. \u201cJulia, what a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you met with my husband.\u201d Preliminary greetings were unnecessary.</p><p>\u201cSo you heard about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek told me. I\u2019m calling you for your own protection. Alek meant what he said about you staying away from me. If you value your neck, I advise you not to try contacting me again.\u201d Her heart was in her throat, pounding so loudly she was sure he must be able to hear it.</p><p>\u201cI think there must be some misunderstanding,\u201d Roger said in an incredulous tone. \u201cI did meet with your husband. Actually, he\u2019s the one who contacted me, but your name didn\u2019t enter into the conversation. He wanted to talk to me about Phoenix Paints. He was hoping the two of us could strike some kind of deal. Naturally Ideal Paints is very interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood try, Roger, but it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>He laughed that slightly demented laugh of his, as though she\u2019d said something hilarious.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see, won\u2019t we?\u201d he added sarcastically.</p><p>Julia hung up the phone.</p><p>She sat there for several minutes with her hand on the receiver. When she found the strength, she stood, walked out of her office and directly past her assistant\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cMs. Conrad, are you feeling all right? You\u2019re terribly pale again.\u201d</p><p>Julia shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, more brusquely than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about seeing a doctor?\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t know any physician who specialized in treating broken hearts. Virginia frowned at her, waiting for a reply. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t...need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do. I\u2019m going to make an appointment for you and ask for the first available opening. We can\u2019t have you walking around looking as if you\u2019re going to faint at any moment.\u201d</p><p>Julia barely heard her. She walked farther into the hallway to the elevator and rode down to her brother\u2019s office.</p><p>Jerry stood when she walked in. \u201cJulia! Sit down. You look like you\u2019re about to keel over.\u201d</p><p>If her brother was commenting on her appearance, she must resemble yesterday\u2019s oatmeal. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She hadn\u2019t come to discuss her health.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you one anyway. You look dreadful.\u201d</p><p>Julia pinched her lips together to bite back a cutting commentary, and didn\u2019t succeed. \u201cHow nice of you to say so.\u201d</p><p>Jerry chuckled and left his office, returning with a paper cup of water. He insisted Julia drink it, which she did. To her surprise she felt better afterward. But then, it was probably impossible to feel any worse....</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019re here to find out what Alek said,\u201d Jerry murmured. \u201cHe claims he confronted Roger and told him to leave you alone. I wish I\u2019d done it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Roger myself.\u201d</p><p>Jerry froze and his eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cYou talked to Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Jerry demanded. \u201cNever mind, I can guess.\u201d He started pacing then as if holding still was more than he could manage. \u201cNaturally he wasn\u2019t going to tell you what Alek actually said. What did you expect him to say, anyway? That he was shaking in his boots with fear? How could you do anything so stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were smarter than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger claims Alek tried to strike a deal with our strongest competitor,\u201d Julia said, trying hard to control her temper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Neither did Julia, not really, but she was so desperately afraid. She needed Jerry to confirm her belief in Alek, needed the reassurance that she wasn\u2019t making the same tragic mistake a second time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize you\u2019re playing directly into Roger\u2019s hands? This is exactly what he was hoping would happen. He wants you to distrust Alek. You certainly made his day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...hadn\u2019t thought of it like that,\u201d Julia admitted reluctantly. She was a fool not to leave the detective work to Rich Peck.</p><p>\u201cYou contacted Roger even knowing the kind of man he is, and expected him to tell the truth. You\u2019ve done some stupid things in your time, Julia, but this one takes the cake.\u201d</p><p>Julia bristled. \u201cThe cake came three years ago, Jerry,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cComplete with frosting, don\u2019t you remember? That was when I trusted Roger, when I believed in love and loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe Alek, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes...\u201d She did, and yet she had no confidence in her own judgment.</p><p>Jerry\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThen why\u2019d you contact Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I hoped...I don\u2019t know, I thought he might let something slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did that, all right, another pile of doubts for you to deal with.\u201d He rammed his hand through his hair. \u201cWhy on earth would you do anything so asinine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d quit saying that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Now are you going to believe in Alek or aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>With all her heart, she wanted to trust her husband, but she\u2019d been badly hurt before. She\u2019d zealously defended Roger, even when faced with overwhelming proof of his betrayal. Her faith in him had nearly destroyed her family.</p><p>\u201cI take it you didn\u2019t fire him, then?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t, either. If you want him out of here, then you\u2019re going to have to do it yourself. I believe him, Julia, even if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, please, try and understand. This is like waking up to my worst nightmare. Don\u2019t you think I want to believe him? So much that it\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d He sighed. \u201cJust leave it for now, Julia. Time will tell if he\u2019s being honest with us or not. For the record, I\u2019m sure he is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t let the fate of the company ride on your instinct and your friendship with him. I can\u2019t take that kind of risk. I have no choice but to ask for his resignation.\u201d</p><p>Jerry\u2019s fists clenched at his side. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the president of this company, I can do as I please.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to get hard-nosed about this, but her first obligation was to protect their family business. Jerry was silent as he absorbed her words. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to pull rank on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. The last thing we need to do now is argue with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ask Alek to go...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, please, I have to, don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ask for Alek\u2019s resignation,\u201d he started again, \u201cyou\u2019ll receive mine, as well.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt as if her own brother had kicked her in the stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said unemotionally, \u201cI remember saying those very same words to Dad three years ago. I believed Roger, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA week,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cWe\u2019ll know more in another week. All I ask is that you give him the opportunity to prove himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, I said something along those lines to Dad, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek isn\u2019t Roger,\u201d Jerry said angrily. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take to convince you of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not,\u201d she said vehemently. \u201cMaybe it would be best if I was the one who resigned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Just give this time. If Alek sold us out, then there\u2019s nothing we can do about it now. The deed\u2019s done. It isn\u2019t going to hurt us any to sit on our doubts for the next few days. Promise me you\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Julia said. \u201cOne week, but then it\u2019s over, Jerry. Unless there\u2019s incontrovertible proof that Alek\u2019s telling the truth. If not, he goes and I can return to running this company the way it\u2019s supposed to be run.\u201d</p><p>Jerry\u2019s smile was fleeting. \u201cI promise you, it\u2019s going to be different this time.\u201d</p><p>She stood to leave, then recalled her conversation with her husband that morning. \u201cAlek mentioned an important meeting with marketing this afternoon.\u201d She gave Jerry the particulars. \u201cHe said he\u2019d like us both to be there. Can you make it?\u201d</p><p>Jerry nodded. \u201cWith a bit of juggling. You\u2019re going, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, but she wasn\u2019t looking forward to it.</p><p>Alek waited for Julia and Jerry to arrive. He watched the door anxiously, glancing repeatedly at his watch. Jerry was the first to show up; he walked into the conference room and took the chair next to Alek. Apart from them, the room was still empty.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to her?\u201d Alek didn\u2019t need to explain who he meant.</p><p>Jerry nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her like this. It\u2019s tearing her apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy on any of us. I wish I knew how to clear my name. Julia would barely listen to me. It\u2019s as though she\u2019s blocked out everything and everyone, including me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a lot easier if she were a man,\u201d Jerry muttered.</p><p>Alek arched his brows and laughed for the first time in days. \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it would. I hate to stereotype, but maybe then she\u2019d listen to reason. Sometimes I forget my sister is a woman\u2014she clouds the issues with emotion.\u201d</p><p>Personally Alek had no trouble remembering Julia was female. \u201cNot all women have been betrayed the way she was,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand her fears, but at the same time I want her to believe what I say because she loves me and knows me well enough to realize I\u2019d never do anything to hurt either of you. Until she does, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Julia believes anymore and she doesn\u2019t either,\u201d Jerry said after a moment. \u201cI talked her into giving the matter a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week,\u201d Alek repeated. \u201cNothing can happen in that short a time. The paint won\u2019t reach the market for another two to three weeks at the earliest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s more than that to consider from her point of view,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s miserable,\u201d Alek added. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t eat properly, she\u2019s working herself to death and she\u2019s sleeping poorly.\u201d In truth he wasn\u2019t in much better shape himself.</p><p>He loved Julia, but he couldn\u2019t force her to trust him, he couldn\u2019t demand that she believe him. She would have to come to those conclusions herself. In the meantime he was left feeling helpless and hopeless, and worst of all, defenseless. She was judging him solely on her experience with another man, one who\u2019d hurt and betrayed her.</p><p>\u201cI thought Stanhope was out of our lives once and for all,\u201d Jerry was saying. \u201cI should\u2019ve figured he\u2019d be back since we\u2019re on the brink of a major product breakthrough. We should\u2019ve been prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have,\u201d Jerry said, his lips thinning with annoyance. \u201cOnly this time Roger knows he doesn\u2019t have a chance of stealing anything, so he\u2019s undermining our trust in each other.\u201d</p><p>The marketing people rushed in with their displays. Most of what they\u2019d be reviewing was geared toward television and radio advertising. The magazine ads had been done a month earlier and would be coming out in the latest issues of fifteen major publications.</p><p>The advertising executive glanced at his watch. Alek sighed. Jerry did, too. Everyone in the room was waiting for Julia.</p><p>\u201cVirginia, please, I have a meeting with marketing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve got Dr. Feldon\u2019s office on the line. If you could wait just a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked pointedly at her watch while her assistant haggled for the first opening in Dr. Feldon\u2019s already full appointment schedule.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s there. Thank you for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Julia said when Virginia hung up.</p><p>\u201cFive o\u2019clock. The doctor\u2019s agreed to squeeze you in then.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded. She wished now that she\u2019d put her foot down about this appointment issue. A doctor wasn\u2019t going to be able to tell her anything she didn\u2019t already know. She was suffering from stress, which, given her circumstances, was understandable.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t forget now, will you?\u201d Virginia called after her as Julia headed for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be there. Thank you for your trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do what Dr. Feldon says, you hear? We can\u2019t have you getting sick every afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Julia grinned. The never-married Virginia was beginning to sound like a mother. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d Julia said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take an early afternoon?\u201d she suggested. \u201cYou deserve it for putting up with me.\u201d</p><p>Her assistant looked mildly surprised, then nodded. \u201cThank you, I will.\u201d</p><p>Every head turned when a breathless Julia burst into the conference room. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she muttered, sitting in the chair closest to the door.</p><p>The marketing director smiled benignly and walked over to a television set that had been brought in for the demonstration. \u201cI thought we\u2019d start with the media blitz scheduled to air a week from this Thursday,\u201d he said as he inserted a DVD.</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t help being aware of Alek. His eyes were on her from the moment she\u2019d entered the room. She expected to feel his anger; instead she felt his love. Tears clogged her throat. It would\u2019ve been less painful if she\u2019d found him with another woman than to learn he\u2019d been talking to Roger, no matter what his reason.</p><p>\u201cOur ad agency tested this twenty-second commercial and is very pleased with its effectiveness.\u201d</p><p>The figure of a man and a woman came onto the screen. The husband was on a ladder painting the side of a house. The woman was working on the lawn below, painting a patio table with four matching chairs. Two children played serenely on a swing set in the background. The music was a classical piece she recognized but couldn\u2019t immediately name. The announcer\u2019s well-modulated voice came on but Julia couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying.</p><p>The room started to spin. The light fixtures faded in and out as though someone was controlling a dimmer switch. She thought she heard a woman cry out but even that seemed to be coming from far away.</p><p>When she regained consciousness, Julia found herself on the floor. She blinked up at the ceiling. Alek was crouched over her, his arm supporting the back of her neck. His eyes were filled with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou fainted,\u201d Jerry said. He was kneeling beside her, holding her hand, patting it gently. \u201cI\u2019ll say this for you, Julia, you certainly know how to get a man\u2019s heart going. You keeled right over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had them leave. Alek and I will review the commercials later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said, struggling into a sitting position. \u201cOne moment I was perfectly fine and the next thing I knew, the room started whirling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her some water,\u201d Jerry said.</p><p>He left the room and Alek slid his arm behind her back, helped her into an upright sitting position and held her against his chest. She braced her hands against his ribs, intent on pushing herself free.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, kissing her temple. \u201cYou can mistrust and hate me later, but for right now let me hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight now, we won\u2019t speak of this again. You\u2019ve worked yourself into a state of collapse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened here, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing important. I\u2019ve just been overstressed, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Jerry returned with the water. \u201cWhy is it I\u2019m always getting you water?\u201d he joked, handing her a paper cup. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d gone to college to be a water boy instead of an attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, pressing her hand to the side of her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to create such a commotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we take her back to her office?\u201d Jerry asked, looking at Alek.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I prefer to make my own decisions,\u201d Julia stiffly informed them both. They made it sound as if she were a piece of furniture they couldn\u2019t decide where to place.</p><p>Leaning against the back of a chair, she stood. She felt a bit unstable, but that dizziness quickly passed. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You two go about your business and I\u2019ll go about mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia, for heaven\u2019s sakes, would you listen to common sense? You just fainted,\u201d Jerry informed her, as if she hadn\u2019t figured it out yet.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet Alek take you home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019d feel more comfortable if you took her,\u201d Alek suggested. \u201cI fainted,\u201d she told both men, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lobotomy. Let me assure you, I\u2019m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, and I\u2019m not leaving my office until I\u2019m finished with what I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of those decisions should be questioned,\u201d Jerry snapped.</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Alek, this is between me and my sister. She\u2019s an emotional and physical wreck because of this mess and to complicate matters she decides to play detective herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, could we discuss this another time?\u201d Julia asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Alek has a right to know. Tell him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJulia?\u201d Alek turned to face her. \u201cWhat\u2019s Jerry talking about?\u201d</p><p>She flashed her brother a scathing look. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell him. Julia had the bright idea of calling Roger Stanhope herself and playing this crazy game with him. She said she knew about the meeting between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Alek\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cAnd what did Stanhope say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can well imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe Roger,\u201d Julia said. \u201cI never did.\u201d Jerry was right, contacting Roger hadn\u2019t been the smartest thing she\u2019d ever done, but she was desperate.</p><p>\u201cWhat my sister failed to remember is that Roger isn\u2019t stupid. She was fishing for information and he knew it, so he made up this ridiculous story about you trying to strike a deal with Ideal Paints.\u201d</p><p>Alek released a one-word expletive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s driving her crazy,\u201d Jerry continued. \u201cShe looked terrible when she came to see me this morning.\u201d</p><p>Julia watched her husband. He was distancing himself from her, physically and emotionally, freezing her out.</p><p>\u201cShe must make her own decision and I must make mine.\u201d Without another word, Alek turned and left the conference room.</p><p>\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t said anything to him about my talk with Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He had a right to know.\u201d</p><p>Her lack of faith\u2014and the fact that she\u2019d acted on it\u2014had hurt Alek. She\u2019d seen it in his eyes and in the way he\u2019d stiffened and moved away from her. Covering her face with her hands, Julia slowly exhaled.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s head was pounding as she walked out of the conference room. She checked the time, wanting to know how long she had before her appointment with Dr. Feldon. The physician had been treating her family for the past fifteen years and knew Julia well.</p><p>She arrived at his office at one minute past five and was ushered directly into the exam room. His nurse asked her a series of questions.</p><p>\u201cBasically, I\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately,\u201d Julia explained. \u201cThis afternoon the craziest thing happened. I fainted. Me! I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>After taking her temperature and her blood pressure, Dr. Feldon\u2019s nurse asked for a urine sample.</p><p>Minutes later, she was joined by Dr. Feldon. His hair was grayer than the last time she\u2019d seen him and he was a little thicker around the waist.</p><p>\u201cJulia, it\u2019s good to see you, although I wish it were under different circumstances. Now tell me what the problem is.\u201d</p><p>The tears came as a surprise and an acute embarrassment. \u201cI...I\u2019m just not myself lately. There\u2019s been so much happening with the company and I\u2019ve been so stressed, and today I fainted right in the middle of a marketing meeting. I gave my husband and my brother quite a scare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard you got married. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>She smiled weakly in response.</p><p>Dr. Feldon reached for a tissue and pressed it into her hand. \u201cHow are you feeling now?\u201d</p><p>She had to stop and think about it. \u201cA little woozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd emotional?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, paused, then blew her nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say this is all normal, my dear. Most pregnant women experience these symptoms.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d Julia repeated in a shocked whisper. \u201cYou mean all this, the nausea and the fainting spell, is because I\u2019m going to have a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think the stress you\u2019ve talked about is complicating the symptoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have morning sickness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good many women don\u2019t. Some have what you might call afternoon sickness instead. My guess is that you\u2019re one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve realized....\u201d Julia began, wondering why she hadn\u2019t recognized her condition herself.</p><p>\u201cAs you probably know I stopped delivering babies several years back. I can recommend an excellent obstetrician. I\u2019ll have my receptionist make an appointment for you, if you\u2019d like. Her name is Dr. Lois Brandt and my patients who\u2019ve had babies delivered by her have been very pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that would be fine.\u201d Julia was both excited and surprised, although heaven knew she had no right to be. \u201cHow...far along do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Feldon chuckled. \u201cMy estimate is about two weeks.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, knowing it couldn\u2019t be much more than that, astonished, too, that her pregnancy could be detected so early.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to prescribe prenatal vitamins and have you start watching your diet. According to those ridiculous charts the insurance companies put out, you\u2019re about five pounds underweight. Don\u2019t skip meals, and make an effort to eat from the major food groups every day. Plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables,\u201d he emphasized.</p><p>Smiling, Julia nodded. Dr. Feldon made it sound as if she were pregnant with a rabbit instead of a baby.</p><p>She left the office a few minutes later, her step lighter. A baby. She was going to have a baby. Alek would\u2014</p><p>Alek.</p><p>Her thoughts came to a skidding halt. This complicated everything tenfold. There was far more at stake now than before. There was far more involved. They\u2019d introduced a tiny being into the equation.</p><p>Julia\u2019s steps slowed. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do or say to him, if anything. At least, not yet. He had a right to know, but Julia wasn\u2019t convinced now was the time to tell him.</p><p>She returned to her condominium and let herself in. Two steps into the entry, she nearly stumbled over a large leather suitcase.</p><p>She heard movement in the master bedroom and walked down the hallway leading to it. Alek stood inside the walk-in closet, carefully removing his clothes from their hangers. Another large leather suitcase yawned open on top of the bed.</p><p>\u201cAlek? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He continued his work without looking at her. \u201cIt should be obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving out,\u201d she whispered and the truth hit her like a slap of icy rain. Alek was leaving.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d figure it out sooner or later.\u201d He walked over to his suitcase and carefully folded his shirts and placed them inside.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any reason for us to stay in touch after I move out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about at the office? I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs of four-thirty this afternoon I am no longer an employee of Conrad Industries.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart froze at what his words implied. \u201cI see.... You\u2019re going to work for Ideal Paints.\u201d</p><p>He whirled around to face her. \u201cNo, Julia, I am not going to work for the competition. I know it means nothing to you, but the Berinski word of honor is all I have to offer you as proof. On the grave of my father, I swear I would never do anything to hurt you or Jerry. That includes betraying you to Ideal Paints or any other of your competitors.\u201d He spun back around and resumed his task, his movements abrupt and hurried as if he was eager to be on his way. Julia didn\u2019t want him to leave, but she couldn\u2019t ask him to stay, either.</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d she asked, sitting on the edge of the bed. She wasn\u2019t sure her shaky legs would support her. She felt as if she was about to burst into tears, which would have embarrassed them both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped that given time you\u2019d see the truth, but I no longer believe that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe Stanhope\u2019s word over mine, then I have to accept that you\u2019re not capable of recognizing the truth when you hear it.\u201d</p><p>Julia had no argument to give him, although her doubts and fears were beginning to mount. \u201cDo you want a divorce?\u201d</p><p>He went still for a moment, as if the question required some consideration. \u201cThat\u2019s up to you. I told you once that my religion forbids it.\u201d</p><p>Julia relaxed a little, but not much.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live with you, Julia, and I can\u2019t see ever living with you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d she said, looking for something, anything, to bring them back together, to force him to acknowledge his love for her. She was tempted to tell him her news, but if he stayed, she wanted it to be because he loved her and not because she\u2019d trapped him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Julia, living with you wasn\u2019t bad\u2014if you don\u2019t mind a porcupine for a wife.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath at the pain his words caused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His shoulders sagged and he exhaled sharply. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hurt you, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, but she knew she had hurt him. He was intent on his packing and refused to look up. He closed the suitcase, then dragged it from the bed and carried it into the other room, setting it beside the first one.</p><p>\u201cIf you forget anything, where would you like me to send it?\u201d she asked, hoping to appear helpful when she was actually looking for a means of staying in contact.</p> <p>He frowned, then said, \u201cGive it to Anna. She\u2019ll know where I am.\u201d He paused. \u201cI trust you\u2019re willing to let her go on working here? Until she gets another job? She hopes to be hired as a translator soon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Of course. But...I think you might be acting a bit hastily, don\u2019t you? Why don\u2019t you give it some thought?\u201d This was as far as she was willing to go. She wouldn\u2019t ask him to stay, wouldn\u2019t plead with him or make an issue of his going. Those choices were his.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to think about,\u201d he told her stiffly. \u201cGoodbye, Julia.\u201d He added something softly in Russian, then opened the door, reached for his suitcases and walked out of the condominium. And her life.</p><p>Julia stood for a moment, so stunned and feeling so bereft that she couldn\u2019t move. Or breathe. Or think. Those abilities returned slowly. Taking small, deliberate steps, she walked into the living room, collapsing onto the white leather sofa.</p><p>She\u2019d had the most dreadful day. Within the space of a few hours, she\u2019d fainted, learned she was pregnant and been abandoned by her husband. The prospects for the future didn\u2019t look bright. Except for the baby...</p> <p>The phone rang fifteen minutes later and Julia grabbed it, thinking, praying, it was Alek. \u201cHello,\u201d she answered quickly.</p><p>\u201cJulia, have you seen Alek? You\u2019ve got to talk some sense into him! I just got back to my office and found his letter of resignation. What do you know about this? Listen, don\u2019t answer that, just put him on the line. I\u2019ll convince him he\u2019s overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, biting her lower lip. \u201cI really wish I could, but...Alek\u2019s not living here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe moved out. He was packing when I got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Jerry said with heavy sarcasm. \u201cMaybe you could\u2019ve told him you believe in him and trust him. You might\u2019ve thanked him for working two long years on the project that\u2019s going to take this company\u2019s profit line right off the page. You could even have told him you love him and didn\u2019t want him to go.\u201d</p><p>Julia, who was crying softly by then, sniffled. \u201cYeah, I guess I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. I think I do, because not trusting him hurts too much.\u201d</p><p>Jerry swore under his breath, then sighed loudly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a really bad sense of timing. Did anyone ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, wiping the tears from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cGo to him, Julia,\u201d Jerry advised, \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s already too late,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is and he didn\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>The following morning, Julia was waiting for her sister-in-law. \u201cGood morning, Anna,\u201d she said when the woman arrived.</p><p>Alek\u2019s sister frowned and didn\u2019t respond. She walked over to the broom closet, took out her apron and tied it around her waist, all the while ignoring Julia.</p><p>\u201cI guess you heard that Alek moved out?\u201d Julia asked, following her.</p><p>Still Anna didn\u2019t acknowledge her. She opened the refrigerator and removed a carton of eggs.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He is my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can hurt him more? So you can think terrible things of him? So you can insult his honor? No, I will not tell you anything about my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him,\u201d Julia whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve just been so afraid. You see, three years ago I loved a man who betrayed my family and me. I believed him when I shouldn\u2019t have. I defended him, and my father and I got into a terrible argument and my father...while we were fighting he suffered a heart attack. He died and I felt so incredibly guilty. I blamed myself.\u201d Anna had turned to face Julia, her face white and emotionless. \u201cCan you understand why it was so difficult for me to believe Alek? Can you see why I\u2019m skeptical after all the things that have happened?\u201d Tears were very close to the surface, but she held them back, crumpling a tissue in her hand until it was a small wad.</p><p>\u201cMy brother would never betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. In a way, I\u2019ve always known that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlek isn\u2019t this other man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that, too, but...because of my experience with this...other man, I made a mistake and gave Alek reason to believe I doubted him.\u201d She stopped, because arguing her case with Alek\u2019s sister wasn\u2019t going to help.</p><p>She dressed for work with no enthusiasm. In another ten days, Phoenix Paints would be on sale to the public. Conrad Industries had developed a whole new kind of paint, several kinds, in fact, thanks to her father\u2019s dream and Alek\u2019s genius. Somehow it all seemed empty now. The purpose that had driven her all these years meant nothing without Alek at her side.</p><p>Jerry was waiting in her office. \u201cDid you find out where he\u2019s staying?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cHis sister wouldn\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t blame her. If our positions were reversed, I wouldn\u2019t tell her, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Rich on it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cLeave Alek his pride. I\u2019ve robbed him of everything else.\u201d She walked around her desk and sat down. Reaching for her desk calendar, she flipped the pages ahead eight months. \u201cI\u2019m going to need some extensive time off soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all need a vacation, Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be more than a two-week vacation, Jerry. I\u2019ll need maternity leave.\u201d</p><p>Alek sat at a table in the library, where he came to spend part of every day. He\u2019d moved into another small furnished apartment, near Anna\u2019s, and came here to read\u2014and primarily to escape his own four walls. Books were his comfort, his consolation.</p><p>Perhaps that was his problem. He knew more about books than people. He had badly bungled his marriage. It\u2019d been over a week since he\u2019d seen Julia. Two weeks since he\u2019d moved out of their condominium\u2014her condominium, he corrected.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her interviewed on a local television station the day Phoenix Paints hit the market. She\u2019d looked pale and so beautiful he hadn\u2019t been able to take his eyes off the television screen. Long after her face vanished from view, he\u2019d continued to stare at the television, not even seeing.</p><p>She\u2019d answered the reporter\u2019s questions, explained her father\u2019s vision for the paint industry and how Alek had seen it to fruition. Alek had been surprised that she\u2019d mentioned his name, credited him with the innovations. Paints that changed color, paints developed for easy removal, paints that were guaranteed to last into the next generation.</p><p>Alek thought long and hard about what she\u2019d said, wondering if she was trying to tell him something. If she was, he\u2019d missed it. He was worried about her; she looked drained, but jubilant. Jerry was with her and had responded to some of the questions.</p><p>Alek closed the book he was reading. He relied on Anna for information about Julia, but his sister had grown stubborn, refusing to give him the detailed answers he sought. She seemed to think that if he was so curious, he should talk to Julia himself.</p><p>Alek considered her suggestion. He\u2019d left because he couldn\u2019t tolerate her mistrust.</p><p>His gaze fell onto his swollen, bruised knuckles and he flexed his hand. Standing, he returned the book to the shelf and picked up his jacket. It was raining outside, a cold, persistent drizzle. His hair was drenched by the time he\u2019d gone a single block.</p><p>It was while he was passing a large parked van that he glanced at the side mirror\u2014and caught the reflection of a man in a beige raincoat behind him. He\u2019d seen this same man in the library. Alek wondered. It would be foolish to believe he was being followed. Then again, he\u2019d lived in a country where it wasn\u2019t uncommon for citizens to disappear and never be heard from again.</p><p>He stepped into an alley and waited. The man casually strolled past and continued down the walkway. Alek expelled his breath, thinking he\u2019d become fanciful. Then again, it wouldn\u2019t be beneath Stanhope to hire someone to injure him.</p><p>No, he decided, Stanhope was just the type to have someone else do his dirty work for him.</p><p>Alek walked for several blocks until he reached the Seattle waterfront, which had become one of his favorite places. The fish and chips were excellent and there was a covered eating space along the pier. It was late afternoon, and he hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast, so he purchased a double order and carried it onto the farthest end of the dock. Here he could look out over the water; he enjoyed viewing the nautical activity on Puget Sound. He claimed a picnic table and sat down to enjoy his dinner.</p><p>He was lost in thought, apparently, because he didn\u2019t notice the man in the raincoat until he was directly in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019d better sit down and introduce myself,\u201d the man said. He held out his hand. \u201cRich Peck.\u201d</p><p>Alek stood and they exchanged handshakes. \u201cHello. Alek Berinski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou figured out I was following you, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Un-invited, Peck sat down at the table, across from Alek.</p><p>Alek shrugged. \u201cI had my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Peck muttered, \u201cI must be getting sloppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a reason you\u2019ve been tracking my movements?\u201d</p><p>Peck grinned, that cocky grin Alek often saw in American men. \u201cThere generally is a reason. And it usually involves someone paying me. Rather handsomely, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Alek looked at him, confused. \u201cAre you saying Roger Stanhope paid you to follow me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStanhope? Don\u2019t bet on it. The man hasn\u2019t got two dimes to rub together. Oh, by the way, I heard about your little skirmish with him. Provoking him into taking the first swing was smart. I heard he tried to hit you from behind. The man\u2019s a sleaze. Are you pressing assault charges against him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I decided I\u2019d punished him enough. I know one thing for sure. He\u2019ll stay out of Julia\u2019s life now. He knows what will happen to him if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Stanhope\u2019s got more problems than you know,\u201d Peck went on to say. \u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to stay away from anything to do with Conrad Industries for the next fifteen years. If he lives that long, which I personally doubt. He borrowed money from the wrong kind of people, if you know what I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know a lot about this...slimeball.\u201d That was an American expression Alek found particularly fitting.</p><p>Peck shrugged. \u201cI was paid to learn what I could. The guy\u2019s an open book. You, on the other hand, weren\u2019t so easy to track down. Your sister wouldn\u2019t tell me a thing. She pretended she didn\u2019t understand English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hired you to follow me?\u201d Alek was growing bored with this detailed speech.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s privileged information.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJulia?\u201d His heart pounded hard with excitement.</p><p>\u201cNope. My lips are sealed. But I can tell you it isn\u2019t her. She doesn\u2019t know anything about this, although what I\u2019m supposed to tell you concerns her.\u201d</p><p>Alek was beginning to think he didn\u2019t like Peck as much as he initially had. \u201cThen tell me.\u201d</p><p>Peck arched his brows at Alek\u2019s less than patient tone. \u201cFirst, let me ask you a couple of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d Alek surged to his feet and stalked away. He half expected Peck to follow him, but when the investigator didn\u2019t get up, he slowed his pace.</p> <p>Alek had gone a block before he recognized his mistake. His impatience had cost him what he\u2019d wanted most, information about Julia. He turned back, walking at a fast clip. He need not have worried; Peck was sitting at the table, enjoying the fish-and-chips dinner Alek had hastily left behind.</p><p>Alek stood over him and Peck licked his fingers. \u201cI thought you might have a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. There\u2019s something Jerry thought you\u2019d like to know about his sister. She\u2019s going to be a mother. If I understand correctly, that means you\u2019re about to become a daddy.\u201d</p><p>Alek felt as if he\u2019d had his legs knocked out from under him. He literally slumped onto the picnic table. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t think she\u2019s very far along. A month, maybe two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen her? Is she healthy?\u201d</p><p>Peck shrugged. \u201cThe last time I did, she was a little green around the gills.\u201d</p><p>Another crazy American idiom, one that made no sense to him at all. \u201cGreen gills? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, a little under the weather.\u201d</p><p>Alek\u2019s confusion increased. \u201cSay it in plain English, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. She\u2019s sick every afternoon. Jerry says it\u2019s like watching Old Faithful. About three-fifteen her assistant leads her to the ladies\u2019 room so she can lose her lunch. It\u2019s perfectly normal from what I understand. Not that I know much about pregnant women.\u201d</p><p>Alek felt as if someone were sitting on his chest and the weight kept increasing. A baby. His baby. Julia was going to have his baby.</p><p>He stood up again, frowning. He had a right to know, and the news shouldn\u2019t have come from his brother-in-law, either. Julia should have told him herself.</p> <p>A low, burning anger simmered in his blood. He was angry, angrier than he\u2019d been in a long time, and he wasn\u2019t about to let this go.</p><p>\u201cYou tell Jerry something for me,\u201d Alek muttered.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He paused. He didn\u2019t have any cause to be angry with Jerry. His friend had taken the initiative and sent Peck to tell him what he should\u2019ve been told from the beginning\u2014by Julia. And he himself had been avoiding Jerry, at least for now\u2014because of Julia.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to pass something along to Jerry?\u201d Peck pressed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Alek said, feeling the beginnings of a smile. \u201cTell him I think he\u2019s going to make a very good uncle.\u201d</p><p>Julia took another bite of her celery stalk, then set it back on the plate. Her attention wavered from her book for only an instant while she reached for a slice of apple.</p><p>The manual, one she\u2019d recently picked up at a bookstore, described the stages of pregnancy week by exciting week. She kept the book hidden from Anna and brought it out in the evenings. By the time Junior was ready to be born, she\u2019d practically have the whole three hundred pages memorized.</p><p>She called the baby Junior, although she didn\u2019t know yet if it was a boy or a girl. Funny, only a couple of weeks ago she hadn\u2019t even known she was pregnant, and now it seemed as though the baby had always been a part of her.</p><p>At night, she slept with her hand on her stomach. She talked to Junior, carrying on lengthy conversations with her unborn child.</p><p>Jerry and Virginia had become ridiculously vigilant. Julia swore her assistant suffered more from her bouts of afternoon sickness than Julia did herself. And Jerry. She smiled as she thought about her brother and how solicitous he\u2019d become. He was constantly asking after her health. He\u2019d even gone so far as to contact Dr. Feldon about her daily bouts of afternoon sickness.</p><p>She had been to see Dr. Brandt and liked the young, attractive woman very much. Thanks to her and the pregnancy book she\u2019d recommended, Julia understood far better the changes that were taking place within her body.</p><p>She tried not to think about Alek, tried not to dwell on how much she missed him. Or the mistakes she\u2019d made in her brief marriage. Sooner or later she\u2019d have to get in touch with him. She needed to tell him about the baby. And to thank him. Phoenix Paints had taken the market by storm. A national television network had called today wanting to do a news piece on the ideas behind the innovative paints.</p><p>She owed Alek so much and she\u2019d treated him so poorly.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t asked Anna his whereabouts since that first morning. His sister didn\u2019t volunteer any information about Alek even when Julia asked. Julia didn\u2019t think Anna had forgiven her yet for hurting her brother.</p><p>She pressed her hand to her stomach and whispered, \u201cYour daddy is a wonderful man, Junior. He\u2019s going to love you so much.\u201d</p><p>She took another bite of the celery stalk and turned the page of her text. Labor and delivery. She\u2019d read this chapter first, the same night she\u2019d bought the book, wanting to learn everything she could on the subject.</p><p>When she did deliver Junior, she hoped Alek would be there to coach her. From what she\u2019d seen of Jerry, he wouldn\u2019t last ten minutes in a delivery room. And Virginia wouldn\u2019t be able to take watching her in pain, Julia was convinced of that.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished her snack, Julia moved into the living room to exercise. She turned on the television and inserted the low-impact prenatal aerobics DVD. Ten minutes later she was huffing and puffing and sweating enough to dampen the gray T-shirt she wore.</p><p>\u201cI hope you appreciate this,\u201d she told the baby.</p><p>After a full thirty minutes, she went into the kitchen, got a glass from the cupboard and gulped down some water. After that, she grabbed a pencil and marked the schedule posted on the refrigerator. Anna thought it was a diet sheet and it was. Sort of. Julia listed the food she ate, plus her water intake. Eight glasses a day, no excuses.</p><p>That was another interesting aspect of her condition. Her life was now ruled by how long it would take her to reach a bathroom. She\u2019d considered having one installed in her office because it was so disruptive to hurry down the hall every hour, and sometimes more often. The eight glasses of water didn\u2019t help matters.</p><p>She was feeling better, though, and for that Julia was grateful. The first couple of weeks after Alek had moved out she\u2019d felt as if she were living in a nightmare. She did what needed to be done, performed her duties, ate, worked and slept, but did it all with a low-grade sense of dejection\u2014and with an air of expectancy. She couldn\u2019t seem to let go of the idea that Alek would come into her office one day the way he used to. It was the hope of seeing him again, of telling him about the baby, that had kept her going. That and, of course, her happiness about the baby.</p><p>The doorbell rang and Julia ripped the sweatband from her forehead. It was probably Jerry, who\u2019d taken to checking up on her in the evenings.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. When she opened the door, Alek stood before her, looking more furious than she\u2019d ever seen him.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cAlek.\u201d Julia couldn\u2019t say anything more. He looked wonderful, while she must have resembled a towel that had been sitting at the bottom of the dirty-clothes hamper.</p><p>\u201cI just heard you\u2019re pregnant. Is that true?\u201d His eyes were hard as granite. He was furious with her and didn\u2019t bother to disguise it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have told me. I played an important role in this event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, it\u2019s just that...\u201d She realized she\u2019d left him standing in the hallway outside the condo. Opening the door wider, she said, \u201cCome inside, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to tell me about the baby?\u201d He was frowning.</p><p>\u201cOf course I intended to tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just answer the question.\u201d</p><p>Julia ignored the demand in his voice. \u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to yell. I was going to tell you, how could I not? This baby is as much a part of you as of me. How could I keep something this important from you?\u201d She hoped that would appease him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my question exactly.\u201d Alek\u2019s hands were knotted into fists at his sides. Julia wanted to think that meant he was restraining himself from holding her\u2014not simply expressing his frustration.</p><p>She started to walk into the kitchen. He hesitated, then followed her. She poured a glass of water for him and then one for herself and set them down on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cAnna knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t tell her. I was afraid she\u2019d say something to you.\u201d Her explanation didn\u2019t satisfy him; if anything, his scowl darkened.</p><p>Julia pulled out a chair and sat. Alek did, too. Avoiding his probing eyes, she lowered her gaze to her water glass. \u201cI\u2019m drinking two quarts of water every day now. Eight full glasses... I\u2019m keeping track of my intake on that sheet on the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby needs water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking, I guess, but actually it\u2019s me the doctor\u2019s concerned about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is the doctor concerned?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t said this to alarm Alek. It was just conversation, a way to ease the tension between them. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly healthy, Alek. Don\u2019t look so worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is your doctor concerned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her job. She keeps a close eye on my health and the baby\u2019s. So far I\u2019m having a perfectly normal pregnancy. That\u2019s what my doctor says. So does the book.\u201d She reached across the table for the manual she\u2019d read from cover to cover three times over. \u201cJunior\u2019s doing just great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJunior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I call him...or her.\u201d</p><p>The anger had faded and in its place Julia saw a love and devotion so deep it wounded her. To think she\u2019d abused that love and mistrusted his word. Her throat grew thick. Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all part of this pregnancy thing. I\u2019m very emotional. The other night I started crying over a TV ad.\u201d She didn\u2019t tell him it was the one for Phoenix Paints. The tears had come because she\u2019d realized how much she missed her husband. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alek passed her his handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She dabbed her eyes. \u201cLook on page fifty-three. It explains why a woman\u2019s more likely to cry when she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Alek flipped through the pages until he found the one she\u2019d mentioned. He scanned the text and nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been feeling?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cAll right, I guess. I don\u2019t get sick in the mornings the way most women do. I usually get nauseous around three-thirty in the afternoon. I don\u2019t know why I bother with lunch since it comes right back up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had any other problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she was quick to assure him. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve been feeling great. And the nausea should be over soon.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be proud of me. I\u2019ve been eating well, with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.\u201d She stopped when she noticed the way he was staring at her. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Alek\u2019s eyes left hers and he shook his head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me, please.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated and Julia felt a jolt of fear. She\u2019d read about this, in the very book that rested on the table between her and Alek. Some men were turned off by their wives during pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cYou are more beautiful than ever,\u201d Alek whispered.</p><p>Julia bit her lower lip and a sigh trembled through her.</p><p>\u201cThat disappoints you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not beautiful, Alek. Judging by the way Jerry and my assistant are constantly fussing over me, I must look awful.\u201d</p><p>Emotion produced a second quivering sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI wanted to tell you about the baby right away.... I learned I was pregnant the afternoon you moved out. I came home from the doctor\u2019s office to find you packing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me then?\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>\u201cWould it have changed anything if I had told you?\u201d she asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, then lowered his gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hurt you and was hurting so badly myself. If I\u2019d told you about Junior then, I was afraid it might sound like blackmail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize now that I would never betray you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it then, I always knew it...in my heart. I just did a poor job of showing you. I couldn\u2019t get past my own fears.\u201d A tear ran from the corner of her eye. \u201cNo words can ever express how sorry I am for the pain I caused you. When we got married, I didn\u2019t expect to fall in love with you. I\u2019d steeled myself against it. I\u2019d been in love once before and, as you know, the experience cost me and others dearly.</p><p>\u201cA green-card marriage seemed workable. I was determined not to involve my heart, but day after day you treated me with love and affection, chipping away at my defenses no matter how much I fortified them.</p><p>\u201cWhen Ruth died... I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve survived that time without you. Your comfort and love meant the world to me. I\u2019ll always treasure our day at the beach.\u201d</p> <p>She stopped to catch her breath and to keep her voice from cracking. \u201cThis much is a fact\u2014I love you, Alek, and I\u2019m deeply sorry for the pain I caused you. I swear I\u2019ll never doubt you again.\u201d Tears fell unheeded from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Julia.\u201d</p><p>She noticed he didn\u2019t call her my love the way he so often had in the past. Covering her face with her hands, she wiped away the moisture, expelled a sigh and forced herself to smile. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but could you ever find it in your heart to forgive me for contacting Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can forgive me for letting my pride stand in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pride? Oh, Alek, I trampled over it a hundred times, and still you loved me. I didn\u2019t know how to deal with love and I made so many mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made my own mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Anna about you countless times, but she refuses to talk about you. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s forgiven me for hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my sister,\u201d Alek said slowly. \u201cShe played the same game with me. I asked her about you so often, she finally told me that if I was so curious, I should go ask you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was right, you know. Neither of us had any business putting her in the middle, pumping her for information about the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. But I still don\u2019t like it that you didn\u2019t tell me about our baby.\u201d</p><p>Julia thought her heart would melt at the tender way he said baby. Alek was going to be a wonderful father. She hadn\u2019t gone into this marriage with any great expectations; she hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d be married long, despite her undeniable attraction to him. Falling in love with Alek had come as a delightful surprise.</p><p>His gentleness, his patience, his comfort had seen her through that bleak time surrounding Ruth\u2019s final days and the dark weeks that followed. Without him, she would have become lost and tormented. How wise of Ruth to recognize the type of man Alek was. To recognize that he would become her compass, guiding her toward happiness.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve eventually found a way of getting in touch with you,\u201d Julia said. \u201cSoon, too.... I don\u2019t know how much longer I would\u2019ve been able to keep this baby to myself.\u201d She stopped talking, realizing Alek had come to her because he\u2019d learned of her condition. Slowly she raised her eyes to his. \u201cWho told you I was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>If Jerry had known where Alek was all this time, she\u2019d have a few words to say to him.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you must know, a private detective told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hired a detective to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jerry was the one who did the hiring. A man named Peck. Your brother thought it was my right to know about the baby.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape Julia\u2019s notice that he still hadn\u2019t referred to her as his love.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now that you know, what do you expect to happen?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat depends on several matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she pressed when he didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cWhat sort of matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll expect to be a major part of our child\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded in full agreement; she was hoping he\u2019d be a major part of her life, too. \u201cI\u2019d like that. Is there anything else?\u201d she asked when he didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Alek seemed to need time to think over his response. \u201cI\u2019d very much like to be your husband,\u201d he finally said, \u201cto live with you and love you and perhaps have another child. Would this be agreeable to you?\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around his neck with such fervor that she nearly toppled the chair he was sitting on.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, my love....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay that again.\u201d She choked out the words through her tears. \u201cCall me your love. Oh, Alek, I\u2019ve missed hearing that so much. Wait, kiss me first.\u201d She had so many requests he obviously didn\u2019t know which one to comply with first. It didn\u2019t take him long, though, to direct her mouth to his.</p><p>\u201cMy love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia.\u201d</p><p>Their names were trapped between two hungry mouths. Between two eagerly beating hearts.</p><p>Their mouths strained toward each other. Julia felt the emotion rise within her. She\u2019d missed him so much, more than she dared to admit even to herself. He was speaking to her in Russian, short snatches of words between frantic kisses.</p><p>She tightened her arms around his neck.</p><p>He surprised her by standing and carrying her into the bedroom. \u201cYou are so romantic,\u201d she told him, languishing in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI plan to get a whole lot more romantic in about thirty seconds.\u201d His intentions were clear as he lovingly placed her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh, good.... Hurry, Alek, I\u2019ve needed you so much.\u201d</p><p>He stripped while she watched him, marveling at his maleness and his readiness for her. Sitting up, Julia struggled out of her T-shirt and tossed it aside. Her tennis shoes came next. \u201cI really should shower,\u201d she commented as the spandex pants flew in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cNo time now,\u201d Alek said. \u201cLater, we\u2019ll shower together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I just finished a workout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re about to start another,\u201d he said.</p><p>Long minutes later, they were exhausted, panting in each other\u2019s arms, their bodies linked, their hands and hearts entwined.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Alek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my love,\u201d he returned as their bodies thrilled, excited and satisfied each other.</p><p>Julia slept in her husband\u2019s arms afterward, her head on his chest. When she stirred into wakefulness, she found his hand pressed against her abdomen and heard him communicating in whispers to his child. Since he was speaking Russian, she could only speculate on what he was saying.</p><p>He noticed her looking at him and smiled shyly. \u201cI told him to be good to his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA daughter would please me just as well.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSomeday a young man will come to me and thank me for having fathered such a beautiful daughter. Wait, and you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday a young woman will come to me and tell me our son is totally awesome, or whatever expression is popular at the time.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cThey change every few years, you realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sometimes go crazy with the things you Americans say. Your strange idioms and slang\u2014they\u2019re constantly changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll catch on. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d he said with a mischievous grin.</p><p>They showered and Julia dressed in a thick terry-cloth robe and padded barefoot into the kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>Alek grinned again. \u201cI see your appetite has increased.\u201d</p><p>It was true. \u201cI suppose it has.\u201d She opened the refrigerator and took out a container of ice cream and served them both large bowls.</p><p>\u201cShould we call Jerry?\u201d Julia asked. \u201cWe seem to owe him a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to share you with anyone just yet. Tomorrow will be soon enough. We\u2019ll invite him and Anna,\u201d he said, and Julia nodded delightedly.</p><p>They sat in the living room, cuddled against each other, eating their ice cream. \u201cThe late news is on,\u201d Julia commented. \u201cOkay with you if I turn it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He took the empty bowl and set it aside. Then he brought her back against him. His roving hands distracted Julia from her intention and she gasped at the sensation that shot through her.</p><p>\u201cI keep up with current events as much as I can,\u201d she said, trying to get her mind off the subject at hand. \u201cI missed the earlier newscast because I had a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d</p><p>Alek\u2019s eyes widened with concern.</p><p>\u201cIt was the dentist, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She leaned forward to pick up the remote control. The screen flared to life just as the sportscaster began the latest update on the Mariners. It was heavenly to sit quietly with Alek\u2019s arms around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will take our son to baseball games,\u201d Alek announced, \u201cand the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you intend to take your daughter and your wife while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever wishes to go,\u201d he said, as though their family was already complete and they were making ordinary, everyday plans.</p><p>Julia smiled to herself.</p> <p>After the sports news, they watched the five-day weather forecast. \u201cI hope it rains every day,\u201d Alek whispered close to her ear. \u201cThat way I can keep you in the apartment, or better yet, in our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news for you,\u201d Julia whispered, kissing his lips, still cold from the ice cream. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an excuse to take me to bed. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d he said with a satisfied smile. \u201cAnd I approve.\u201d</p><p>Soon they were kissing again. They would have continued, Julia was certain, if the newscaster hadn\u2019t returned to announce the breaking news stories of the day.</p><p>\u201cIdeal Paints, a national paint manufacturer based here in Seattle, has declared bankruptcy. As many as three hundred jobs have been lost.\u201d</p> <p>Julia was stunned. \u201cI knew they were having financial difficulties,\u201d she said, breaking away from Alek. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it was that serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t hope to compete with Conrad Industries any longer,\u201d Alek told her. \u201cStanhope hurt them, but it took them three years to feel the effects. Their whole developmental program came to a halt after he sold them the formula for guaranteed twenty-five-year paint. They had the latest advance without having gone through the learning process, without the trial and error that comes with any major progress. It set them back.\u201d</p><p>Julia had never thought of it in those terms. What she did remember was something Ruth had told her years earlier, when revenge and justice had ranked high on her list. Her grandmother had insisted time had a way of correcting injustices, and she\u2019d been right.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019ll happen to Roger,\u201d she said absently, almost feeling sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s finished in the business world,\u201d Alek said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-known fact he sold out Conrad Industries. No company\u2019s going to risk hiring an employee with questionable loyalty and ethics. He\u2019ll be lucky to find any kind of job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s come full circle,\u201d Julia said, leaning into her husband\u2019s strength. He wrapped his arms around her waist and she pressed her hands over his. \u201cEverything I lost has been returned to me a hundredfold.\u201d</p> <p>Alek kissed her neck. \u201cSame for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was possible to be this happy. Only a few years ago I felt as if my whole life was over, and now it seems to get better every day.\u201d Leaning back, she reached upward for her husband\u2019s kiss.</p><p>BRIDE WANTED</p><p>For Eric, Kurt, Neal and Clay Macomber\u2014the other Macombers. Love, Aunt Debbie.</p><p>Prologue</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I\u2019ve got this right,\u201d the man behind the desk asked Chase Goodman. He spoke around the cigar in his mouth. \u201cYou want to rent a billboard and advertise for a wife.\u201d</p><p>Chase wasn\u2019t about to let a potbellied cynic talk him out of the idea. He had exactly three weeks to find himself a bride before he returned to Alaska, and that didn\u2019t leave time for a lot of romantic nonsense. This was the most direct route he could think of for getting himself a wife. He was thirty-three, relatively good-looking and lonesome as heck. He\u2019d spent his last winter alone.</p><p>Okay, he was willing to admit, his idea was unorthodox, but he was on a tight schedule. He intended to wine and dine the right woman, sweep her off her feet, but he had to meet her first. Although Seattle was full of eligible women, he wasn\u2019t fool enough to believe more than a few would want to leave the comforts of city life for the frozen north. The way Chase figured it, best to lay his cards on the table, wait and see what kind of response he got. He also figured this would get noticed by women who wouldn\u2019t necessarily look at newspaper ads or internet dating sites.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d Chase said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cYou want the billboard to read BRIDE WANTED?\u201d The fat cigar moved as if by magic from one side of his mouth to the other.</p><p>\u201cYes, with the phone number I gave you. The answering service will be screening the calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou considered what sort of women are going to be responding to that advertisement?\u201d</p><p>Chase simply nodded. He\u2019d given plenty of thought to that question. He knew what to expect. But there was bound to be one who\u2019d strike his fancy, and if everything went as he hoped, he\u2019d strike her fancy, too. That was what he was looking for, that one in a thousand.</p><p>He was well aware that it wasn\u2019t the best plan. If he had more time to get to know a woman, he could prove he\u2019d be a good husband, and God willing, a father. He wasn\u2019t like a lot of men who could blithely say the things a woman wanted to hear. He needed help and the billboard would make his intentions clear from the first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my men on it tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Chase said and grinned.</p><p>The wheels were in motion. All he had to do was sit back and wait for his bride to come to him.</p><p>One</p><p>Lesley Campbell glared at the calendar. The last Saturday in June was to have been her wedding day. Only she wasn\u2019t going to be a bride. The wedding dress hanging in the back of her closet would eventually yellow with age, unworn and neglected. Given Seattle\u2019s damp climate, the lovely silk-and-lace gown would probably mildew, as well.</p><p>Enough self-pity, Lesley decided, and with her natural flair for drama, she squared her shoulders. She wasn\u2019t going to let a little thing like a broken engagement get her down. Even losing money on the deposits for the hall and everything else didn\u2019t matter. Not really. Her life was full. She had good friends\u2014really good friends. Surely one of them would realize the significance of today and call her. Jo Ann wouldn\u2019t forget this was to have been her wedding day and neither would Lori. Lesley couldn\u2019t ask for two better friends than her fellow teachers, Jo Ann and Lori. Both would have been her bridesmaids. They\u2019d remember; no doubt they were planning something special to console her. Something unexpected. Something to chase away the blues and make her laugh.</p><p>Her mother and stepfather were traveling and probably wouldn\u2019t think of it, but that was okay. Her friends would.</p><p>The hollow feeling in the pit of her stomach seemed to yawn wider; closing her eyes, Lesley breathed in deeply until the pressure lessened. She refused to give Tony the power to hurt her. The fact that they still worked together was difficult to say the least. Thank heaven, school had been dismissed for the summer the week before and she had three months to regroup and recuperate.</p><p>Lesley opened her refrigerator and looked inside, hoping some appetizing little treat would magically appear. The same shriveled head of lettuce, two over-ripe tomatoes and a soft-looking zucchini stared back at her. Just as well; she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite anyway.</p><p>Men\u2014who needed them? Lesley shut the refrigerator door. Not her. She refused to become vulnerable to any man ever again.</p><p>Several of her friends had tested their matchmaking skills on her in the past few months, but Lesley\u2019s attitude was jaded. Whose wouldn\u2019t be?</p><p>The man she loved, the man she\u2019d dedicated five years of her life to, had announced six months before their wedding that he needed more time. More time. Lesley had been incredulous. They\u2019d dated their last year of college, gone through student teaching together. They even worked at the same elementary school, saw each other on a daily basis and then, out of the blue, Tony had insisted he needed more time.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until a week later that Lesley discovered more time meant he\u2019d fallen head over heels in love with the new first-grade teacher. Within three weeks of meeting April Packard, Tony had broken his engagement to Lesley. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Tony and April were married a month later, following a whirlwind courtship. Since she was under contract and her savings slim, Lesley couldn\u2019t just leave the school; she\u2019d been forced to endure the sight of the happy couple every day since. Every school day, anyhow.</p><p>She worked hard at not being bitter, at pretending it was all for the best. If Tony was going to fall in love with another woman, then it was better to have discovered this penchant of his before the wedding. She\u2019d heard that over and over from her friends. In fact, she\u2019d heard all the platitudes, tried to believe them, tried to console herself with them.</p><p>Except they didn\u2019t help.</p><p>She hurt. Some nights she wrestled with the loneliness until dawn; the feeling of abandonment nearly suffocated her. It didn\u2019t help to realize how happy Tony and April were.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to make it up to Lesley. He\u2019d wanted her to assuage his guilt. Because they worked in such close proximity, there was nothing she could do but repeat the platitudes others had given her. For the last months of school, she\u2019d had to make believe a broken heart didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>But it did.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d felt this empty inside had been as a six-year-old child, when her father had arranged for the family to fly to Disneyland in California. Lesley had been excited for weeks. It would\u2019ve been her first trip in an airplane, her first time away from Washington State. Then, three days before the vacation was to begin, her father had packed his bags and left. He\u2019d gone without warning, without a word of farewell to her, apparently without regret, taking the money they\u2019d saved for the family trip.</p><p>Her mother was so trapped in her shock and anger that she hadn\u2019t been able to comfort Lesley, who\u2019d felt guilty without knowing why.</p><p>As an adult she chose to forgive her father and accept that he was a weak man, the same way she\u2019d decided to absolve Tony of the pain he\u2019d caused her. It would do no good to harbor a grudge or to feed her own discontent.</p><p>Although it was easy to acknowledge this on a conscious level, it took more than logic to convince her heart. Twenty-one years had passed since that fateful summer, but the feelings were as painful and as complex now as they\u2019d been to the little girl who missed her daddy.</p><p>When neither Jo Ann nor Lori had phoned by noon, her mood sank even lower. Maybe they were thinking she\u2019d forgotten what day it was, Lesley reasoned. Or maybe they didn\u2019t feel they should drag up the whole ugly affair. But all Lesley wanted was to do something fun, something that would make her forget how isolated she felt.</p><p>Jo Ann wasn\u2019t home, so Lesley left an upbeat message. The significance of the day seemed to have slipped past Lori, as well, who was all starry-eyed over a man she\u2019d recently started dating.</p><p>\u201cAny chance you can get away for a movie tonight?\u201d Lesley asked.</p><p>Lori hemmed and hawed. \u201cNot tonight. Larry\u2019s been out of town for the last couple of days and he\u2019ll be back this evening. He mentioned dinner. Can we make it later in the week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Lesley said, as though it didn\u2019t matter one way or the other. Far be it from her to remind her best friends that she was suffering the agonies of the jilted. \u201cHave fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There must have been some telltale inflection in her voice because Lori picked up on it immediately. \u201cLesley, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It was always of course. Always some flippant remark that discounted her unhappiness. \u201cWe\u2019ll get together later in the week.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a few more minutes. When they\u2019d finished, Lesley knew it was up to her to make the best of the day. She couldn\u2019t rely on her friends, nor should she.</p><p>She mulled over that realization, trying to decide what to do. Attending a movie alone held no appeal, nor did treating herself to dinner in a fancy restaurant. She sighed, swallowing the pain as she so often had before. She was sick of pretending it didn\u2019t hurt, tired of being cheerful and glib when her heart was breaking.</p> <p>A day such as this one called for drastic measures. Nothing got more drastic than a quart of chocolate-chip cookie-dough ice cream and a rented movie.</p><p>Lesley\u2019s spirits rose. It was perfect. Drowning her sorrows in decadence made up for all that pretended indifference. Men! Who needed them? Not her, Lesley told herself again. Not her.</p><p>She reached for her purse and was out the door, filled with purpose.</p><p>It was while she was at a stoplight that Lesley saw the billboard. BRIDE WANTED. PHONE 555-1213. At first she was amused. A man advertising for a wife? On a billboard? She\u2019d never heard anything so ridiculous in her life. The guy was either a lunatic or a moron. Probably both. Then again, she reasoned, she wasn\u2019t exactly sympathetic to the male of the species these days. She\u2019d been done wrong and she wasn\u2019t going to smile and forget it! No, sir. Those days were past.</p><p>Still smiling at the billboard, Lesley parked her car at the grocery store lot and headed toward the entrance. Colorful bedding plants, small rosebushes and rhododendrons were sold in the front of the store, and she toyed with the idea of buying more geraniums for her porch planter box.</p> <p>She noticed the man pacing the front of the automatic glass doors almost immediately. He seemed agitated and impatient, apparently waiting for someone. Thinking nothing more of it, she focused her attention on the hanging baskets of bright pink fuchsia, musing how nice they\u2019d look on her porch.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d the man said when she approached. \u201cWould you happen to have the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, raising her arm to glance at her watch.</p><p>Without warning, the man grabbed her purse, jerking it from her forearm so fast that for a moment Lesley stood frozen with shock and disbelief. She\u2019d just been mugged. By the time she recovered, he\u2019d sprinted halfway across the lot.</p><p>\u201cHelp! Thief!\u201d she screamed as loudly as she could. Knowing better than to wait for someone to rescue her, she took off at a dead run, chasing the mugger.</p><p>He was fast, she\u2019d say that for him, but Lesley hadn\u2019t danced her way through all those aerobics classes for nothing. She might not be an Olympic hopeful, but she could hold her own.</p> <p>The mugger was almost at the street, ready to turn the corner, when another man flew past her. She didn\u2019t get a good look at him, other than that he was big and tall and wore a plaid shirt and blue jeans.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got my purse,\u201d she shouted after him. Knowing she\u2019d never catch the perpetrator herself, her only chance was the second man. She slowed to a trot in an effort to catch her breath.</p><p>To her relief, the second man caught the thief and tackled him to the ground. Lesley\u2019s heart leapt to her throat as the pair rolled and briefly struggled. She reached them a moment later, not knowing what to expect. Her rescuer was holding the thief down, and as Lesley watched, he easily retrieved her purse.</p><p>\u201cI believe this belongs to you,\u201d her rescuer said, handing her the bag.</p><p>The mugger kicked for all he was worth, which in Lesley\u2019s eyes wasn\u2019t much. He was cursing, too, and doing a far more effective job of that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way to talk in front of a lady,\u201d her hero said calmly, turning the thief onto his stomach and pressing his knee into the middle of his back. The man on the ground groaned and shut up.</p><p>A police siren blared in the background.</p><p>\u201cWho called the police?\u201d Lesley asked, looking around until she saw a businessman holding a cell phone. \u201cThanks,\u201d she shouted and waved.</p> <p>The black-and-white patrol car pulled into the parking lot. A patrolman stepped out. \u201cCan either of you tell me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat man,\u201d Lesley said indignantly, pointing to the thief sprawled on the asphalt, \u201cgrabbed my purse and took off running. And that man,\u201d she said, pointing to the other guy, \u201ccaught him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase Goodman,\u201d her white knight said. He stood up, but kept his foot pressed against the thief\u2019s back as he nodded formally.</p><p>Lesley clutched her handbag to her breast, astonished at how close she\u2019d come to losing everything. Her keys were in her purse, along with her identification, checkbook, money and credit cards. Had she lost all her ID, it would\u2019ve been a nightmare to replace. Nor would she have felt safe knowing someone had the keys to her home and her car, along with her address. The thought chilled her to the bone.</p><p>There seemed to be a hundred questions that needed answering before the police officer escorted the mugger to the station.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very grateful,\u201d Lesley said, studying the man who\u2019d rescued her purse. He was tall\u2014well over six feet\u2014and big. She was surprised anyone that massive could move with such speed. At first glance she guessed he was a bodybuilder, but on closer inspection she decided he wasn\u2019t the type who spent his time in a gym. He had a rugged, outdoorsy look that Lesley found strongly appealing. A big, gentle \u201cbear\u201d of a man. A gym would\u2019ve felt confining to someone like Chase. Adding to his attractiveness were dark brown eyes and a friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Miss...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesley Campbell. I go by Ms.\u201d She paused. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019m not married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ring.\u201d</p><p>Her thumb absently moved over the groove in her finger where Tony\u2019s engagement ring had once been and she nodded. He wasn\u2019t wearing one, either.</p><p>\u201cDo you do this sort of thing for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Chase smiled at her, looking a bit confused.</p><p>\u201cRun after crooks, I mean,\u201d Lesley said. \u201cAre you an off-duty policeman or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I work on the Alaska pipeline. I\u2019m visiting Seattle for the next few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d heard her. \u201cWhat I was thinking about you. That you\u2019re an open-air kind of person.\u201d She felt mildly surprised that she\u2019d read him so well. Generally she didn\u2019t consider herself especially perceptive.</p><p>Her insight appeared to please him because he smiled again. \u201cWould you like to know what I was thinking about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She probably shouldn\u2019t be so curious, but it wouldn\u2019t do any harm.</p><p>\u201cYou run well, with agility and grace, and you\u2019re the first woman I\u2019ve met in a long while who doesn\u2019t have to throw back her head to look up at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true enough.\u201d Lesley understood what it meant to be tall. She was five-eleven herself and had been the tallest girl in her high school class. Her height had been a curse and yet, in some ways, her greatest asset. Her teachers assumed that because she was taller she should be more mature, smarter, a leader, so she\u2019d been burdened with those expectations; at the same time, she now realized, they\u2019d been a blessing. She had learned to be both tactful and authoritative, which served her well as a teacher. However, buying clothes had always been a problem when she was a teenager, along with attracting boys. It was only when she entered her twenties that she decided to be proud of who and what she was. Once she refused to apologize for her height, she seemed to attract the opposite sex. Shortly after that, she\u2019d met Tony. It had never bothered her that he was an inch shorter than she was, nor had it seemed to trouble him.</p><p>She and Chase were walking back toward the grocery store. \u201cYou\u2019re a runner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no,\u201d Lesley answered, although she was flattered by the assumption.</p><p>As they were standing under the hanging fuchsia baskets, Lesley realized they had no reason to continue their discussion. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank you for your help,\u201d she said, opening her purse and taking out her wallet.</p><p>He placed his hand on hers, his touch gentle but insistent. \u201cI won\u2019t take your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never have caught him without you. It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what anyone would have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Lesley countered. The lot had been full of people and no one else had chased the mugger. No one else had been willing to get involved. She\u2019d received plenty of sympathetic looks, but no one other than Chase had helped her.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to thank me, how about a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>Lesley\u2019s gaze went to the caf\u00e9, situated next to the grocery store in the strip mall. She\u2019d just been mugged, and having coffee with a stranger didn\u2019t seem to be an especially brilliant idea.</p><p>\u201cI can understand your hesitation, but I assure you I\u2019m harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Lesley found herself agreeing. Chase smiled and his brown eyes fairly sparkled. She\u2019d hardly ever met a man with more expressive eyes.</p><p>When they took a table by the window, the waitress immediately brought menus and rhymed off the specials of the day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have coffee,\u201d Lesley said.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of pie do you have?\u201d Chase wanted to know.</p><p>The waitress listed several varieties in a monotone as if she said the same words no less than five hundred times a day.</p><p>\u201cGive me a piece of the apple pie and a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a slice of that pie, too,\u201d Lesley said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she muttered to Chase when the waitress left, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to indulge myself.\u201d She\u2019d forgo the gourmet ice cream in favor of the pie; later she\u2019d drown her blues in a 1990s Meg Ryan movie, where love seemed to work out right and everything fell neatly into place just before THE END scrolled onto the screen. If ever there was a time she needed to believe in fairy tales, it was today.</p><p>\u201cSure you should,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lesley said, straightening and looking out the window as she thought about the reason she was pampering herself. To her embarrassment, tears flooded her eyes. She managed to blink them back but not before Chase noticed.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelayed shock, I guess,\u201d she said, hoping that sounded logical, and that he\u2019d accept it without further inquiry. Funny, she could go weeks without dwelling on the pain and then the minute school was out and Tony and April weren\u2019t around anymore, she started weeping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that today was supposed to have been my wedding day,\u201d she blurted out. Lesley didn\u2019t know what had made her announce this humiliation to a complete stranger.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Chase asked softly. His hand reached for hers, his fingers folding around hers in a comforting way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, what usually happens in these situations. Tony met someone else and...well, I guess it was just one of those things. The two of them clicked, and after a whirlwind courtship, they got married. They both seem happy. It\u2019s just that...\u201d Her voice faltered and she left the rest unsaid.</p><p>The waitress delivered the pie and coffee and, grateful for the interruption, Lesley reached for her purse and took out a tissue. \u201cMy friends forgot that today was the day Tony and I\u2019d chosen for the wedding.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIn retrospect, I don\u2019t know if I miss him as much as I miss the idea of the wedding. You know, starting off our marriage with this beautiful celebration, this perfect day....\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess I became so involved in getting ready for the wedding that I didn\u2019t realize how unhappy and restless Tony had become. When he asked for time to think about everything, I was shocked. I should\u2019ve known then that something was really wrong, that it wasn\u2019t just pre-wedding jitters. As it turned out, it was good old-fashioned guilt. He\u2019d met April\u2014Oh, we all work at the same elementary school,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>\u201cTeachers?\u201d</p><p>Lesley nodded. \u201cAnyway, he was attracted to April, and she was attracted to him, and the whole thing got out of control.... I\u2019m sure you get the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. It seems to me that your friend\u2019s a fool.\u201d</p><p>Lesley laughed, but it sounded more like a hiccup. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, or at least he tries to be my friend. I don\u2019t know what I feel\u2014not anymore. It all happened months ago, but it still hurts and I can\u2019t seem to put it behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only human that you should feel hurt and betrayed, especially today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know, but it\u2019s much more than that. Tony felt terrible and with all of us working together, well, that just makes it more difficult. I asked the school district for a transfer but when Tony heard about it, he asked me not to. He didn\u2019t think I should disrupt my life and why can\u2019t we still be friends, blah, blah, blah. The problem is he feels so guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well he should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I was making a mistake, but I withdrew the request.\u201d Lesley wasn\u2019t sure why she was discussing her broken engagement, especially with a stranger. It felt better to speak of it somehow, to lift some of the weight of her unhappiness.</p><p>Lesley lowered her eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry to burden you with this,\u201d she said in a calmer tone.</p><p>\u201cNo, you needed to talk and I\u2019m honored that you told me. I mean that. Have you been seeing anyone since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lesley sliced off a bite of her pie. \u201cLately I find myself feeling cynical about relationships. I\u2019m almost convinced love, marriage and all that simply aren\u2019t worth the effort\u2014although I would like children someday,\u201d she added thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cCynical, huh? Does that mean you don\u2019t date at all? Not ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t date and I don\u2019t intend to for a long time. I\u2019m not feeling very sympathetic toward men, either. On the way to the store just now, I saw the most ridiculous billboard. Some guy\u2019s advertising for a bride, and instead of feeling sorry for him, I laughed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you feel sorry for the guy?\u201d Chase asked. He\u2019d already finished his pie and was cradling the ceramic mug of coffee with both hands.</p><p>\u201cThink about it. What kind of man advertises for a wife? One who\u2019s old and ugly and desperate, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he can\u2019t find a wife any other way, there must be something wrong with him. If that isn\u2019t cause for sympathy I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the women who respond will be old and ugly, as well?\u201d Chase asked, frowning. \u201cAnd desperate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, I wouldn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand men. I\u2019ve tried, but I seem to be missing something. Tony was the only man I ever considered marrying and...well, I\u2019ve already told you what happened to that relationship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019d never think of dating a man who advertised for a wife?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she assured him emphatically. \u201cBut my guess is that he\u2019ll get plenty of takers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old coot\u2019s probably lonely and looking for a little female companionship,\u201d Chase supplied.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she agreed, smiling as she mentally envisioned the man who was so desperate he\u2019d advertise for a wife. \u201cLike I said, I couldn\u2019t even feel a little empathy for the guy. That\u2019s how cynical I am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you told me you laughed.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou think other women will laugh, too?\u201d</p><p>Lesley shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps.\u201d Women like herself, maybe. The jaded and emotionally crippled ones.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be in town?\u201d she asked, deciding to change the subject. This conversation was becoming uncomfortable\u2014and it wasn\u2019t revealing her in the best light.</p><p>\u201cAnother two and a half weeks. I can\u2019t take city living much longer than that. The noise gets to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to Seattle before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come every year about this time. I generally visit the Pacific Northwest but I\u2019m partial to San Francisco, too. By the end of my vacation I\u2019m more than ready to return to the tundra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard Alaska is very beautiful,\u201d Lesley said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a peace there, an untouched beauty that never fails to reach me. I\u2019ve lived there all my life and it still fascinates me.\u201d</p><p>Lesley was mesmerized by his words and the serenity she sensed in him. \u201cWhat town are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little place in the northern part of the state called Twin Creeks. I doubt you\u2019ve heard of it. I won\u2019t kid you\u2014the winters are harsh, and there isn\u2019t a lot to do for entertainment. By mid-December daylight\u2019s counted in minutes, not hours. By contrast, the sun\u2019s out well past midnight at this time of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than your job, how do you occupy yourself in the dead of winter?\u201d It fascinated her that someone would actually choose to live in such an extreme environment.</p><p>\u201cRead and study mostly. I do a bit of writing now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ve got all the peace and quiet you need for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, sometimes a little too much...\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d both finished their pie and coffee and the waitress returned to offer refills. Lesley didn\u2019t entirely understand his comment, and let it pass. This was probably the reason he came to Seattle every year, to kick up his heels and party. Yet he didn\u2019t look like the party type. His idea of the urban wild life was probably drinking beer in a hot tub, Lesley thought, smiling to herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>Lesley instantly felt guilty. She was being more condescending than she\u2019d realized. Chase was a gentleman who\u2019d kindly stepped in to help when all those around her had chosen to ignore her plight.</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d Lesley said, reaching for the tab.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chase told her, removing the slip from her fingers, \u201cthank you for the pleasure of your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, picking up the cost of your pie and coffee is such a little thing to do to thank you for what you did. Don\u2019t deny me that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, giving it back to her. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>Lesley left a tip on the table, then walked over to the cash register and paid the bill before Chase could change his mind\u2014and before he could set his condition.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, dropping the change in her coin purse.</p><p>\u201cThat you have dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>Her first inclination was to refuse. She wasn\u2019t interested in dating and hadn\u2019t been in months. She\u2019d told him as much. She wasn\u2019t ready to get involved in a relationship, not even with a man who was a tourist and who\u2019d be out of her life in a few weeks. Besides, he was a stranger. Other than his name and a few other details, what did she know about him?</p><p>He must have seen the doubt in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou choose the time and place and I\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYou\u2019re wise to be cautious.\u201d</p><p>Still she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t stand you up the way Todd did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not exactly\u2014\u201d She stopped, amused and frustrated that she found herself wanting to defend Tony.</p><p>\u201cOne dinner,\u201d Chase added. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>Lesley sighed, feeling herself weakening. If she declined, she\u2019d be stuck watching Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in her sweats in front of the TV\u2014and probably gobbling ice cream straight from the container, despite the pie she\u2019d just had. The image wasn\u2019t a pretty one.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, with a decisiveness she didn\u2019t feel. \u201cSix o\u2019clock, at Salty\u2019s at Redondo Beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cNot Salty\u2019s.\u201d That had been her and Tony\u2019s restaurant. \u201cLet\u2019s try the Seattle waterfront. I\u2019ll meet you in front of the aquarium at six and we can find someplace to eat around there.\u201d</p><p>His smile touched his eyes as he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Chase Goodman stepped out of the shower and reached for a towel. He\u2019d turned on the television and was standing in the bathroom doorway listening to snippets of news while he dried his hair.</p><p>He dressed in slacks and a crisp blue shirt, hoping Lesley didn\u2019t expect him to wear a tie. Gray slacks and a decent dress shirt was as good as he got. A regular tie felt like a hangman\u2019s noose and he\u2019d look silly in a bow tie. He didn\u2019t usually worry about what a woman thought of his appearance, but he liked Lesley.</p><p>That was the problem. He liked her, really liked her. The hollow feeling hadn\u2019t left his stomach since the moment they\u2019d parted. It was the kind of sensation a man gets when he knows something\u2019s about to happen, something important. Something good.</p><p>He liked that she was tall and not the least bit apologetic about it. He preferred a woman he didn\u2019t have to worry about hurting every time he held her. His size intimidated a lot of women, but obviously not Lesley. She had grit, too; it wasn\u2019t every woman who\u2019d race after a mugger.</p><p>Objectively, he supposed, Lesley wasn\u2019t stunningly beautiful nor did she have perfect features. Her face was a little too square, and her hair a dusty blond. Not quite brown and not quite fair, but somewhere in between. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the conventional pale blond most guys went for, but it reminded him of the color of the midnight sun at dusk.</p><p>Her eyes appealed to him, too. He couldn\u2019t remember seeing a darker shade of brown, almost as dark as his own.</p><p>Chase was physically attracted to Lesley and the strength of that attraction took him by surprise. It confused and unsettled him. He\u2019d come to Seattle to find himself a wife, had gone about it in a direct and straightforward manner. You couldn\u2019t get more direct than renting a billboard! And yet he\u2019d met Lesley by complete chance. Not only that, his billboard clearly hadn\u2019t impressed her, he thought wryly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nonetheless, he wanted to develop a relationship with Lesley, but he was worried. Lesley was vulnerable and hurting just now. If he romanced her, even convinced her to marry him, he\u2019d never be certain he hadn\u2019t taken advantage of her and her battered heart. Even worse, she might feel he had. Regardless, nothing could dampen his anticipation of their evening together. That was all he wanted. One evening, and then he\u2019d be better able to judge. Afterward he could decide what he was going to do. If anything.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, Chase reached for the TV remote and turned up the volume, hoping the newscaster would take his mind off the woman who attracted him so strongly. Not that it was likely. Not with that swift emotional kick he\u2019d felt the minute he saw her.</p><p>\u201cHiya, doll,\u201d Daisy Sullivan said, letting herself into Lesley\u2019s place after knocking a couple of times. \u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d Daisy lived in the house adjacent to Lesley\u2019s rental and had become one of her best friends.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Lesley said, aiming an earring toward her left ear. \u201cDo you want some iced tea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, but I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Lesley watched as her neighbor walked into the kitchen and took two glasses from the cupboard. She poured them each some tea from the pitcher in the fridge. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re going out,\u201d Daisy said, handing Lesley one of them. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to spend this evening alone.\u201d</p><p>Lesley felt warmed at this evidence that someone had remembered today\u2019s significance. \u201cThe date slipped by Jo Ann and Lori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing? Taking yourself out to dinner?\u201d Daisy was nothing if not direct. Her neighbor didn\u2019t have time to waste being subtle. She attended computer classes during the day and worked weekends as a cocktail waitress. Lesley admired her friend for taking control of her life, for getting out of a rotten marriage and struggling to do what was right for herself and her two boys.</p><p>Her neighbor was a little rough around the edges, maybe a little too honest and direct, but she was one heck of a friend. Besides school and a job, she was a good mom to Kevin and Eric. Daisy\u2019s mother watched the boys during the daytime now that school was out, but it wasn\u2019t an ideal situation. The boys, seven and eight, were a handful. A teenage girl from the neighborhood filled in on the nights Daisy worked; Lesley occasionally helped out, as well.</p><p>\u201cHow does this dress look?\u201d Lesley asked, ignoring Daisy\u2019s question. She twirled to give Daisy a look at the simple blue-and-white-patterned dress. The skirt flared out at the knees as she spun around.</p> <p>\u201cNew?\u201d Daisy asked, helping herself to a few seedless red grapes from the fruit bowl on the table. She held one delicately between manicured nails and popped it into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cRelatively new,\u201d Lesley said, glancing away. \u201cI\u2019ve got a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I met him this afternoon. I was mugged and Chase\u2014that\u2019s his name\u2014caught the thief for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Chase chased him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She smiled at Daisy\u2019s small joke.</p> <p>\u201cYou sure you can trust this guy?\u201d</p><p>Lesley took a moment to analyze what she knew about Chase Goodman. Her impression was of strength, eyes that smiled, a gentle, fun-loving spirit. He was six-four, possibly taller, his chest was wide and his shoulders were broad. Despite his size, he ran with efficiency and speed. Her overall impression of Chase was of total, unequivocal masculinity. The type of man who worked hard, lived hard and loved hard.</p><p>Her cheeks flushed with color at the thought of Chase in bed....</p><p>\u201cI can trust him,\u201d Lesley answered. It was herself she needed to question. If she was still in love with Tony, she shouldn\u2019t be attracted to Chase, but she was. She barely knew the man, yet she felt completely safe with him, completely at ease. She must, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have blurted out the humiliating details of her broken engagement. She\u2019d never done that with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Chase at the Seattle aquarium at six,\u201d Lesley elaborated.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Sounds like he might be hero material,\u201d Daisy said, reaching for another cluster of grapes after she stood. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get dinner on for the boys. Let me know how everything goes, will you? I\u2019ll be up late studying, so if the light\u2019s on, let yourself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Lesley promised.</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Daisy said on her way out the door.</p> <p>That was something Lesley intended to do.</p><p>At 6:10, Lesley was standing outside the waterfront aquarium waiting. She checked her watch every fifteen seconds until she saw Chase coming toward her, walking down the hill, his steps hurried. When he saw her, he raised his hand and waved.</p><p>Relief flooded through Lesley. The restless sensation in the pit of her stomach subsided and her doubts fled.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d he said, after dashing across the busy intersection. \u201cI had a problem finding a place to park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Lesley said, and it didn\u2019t now that he was here. Now that he was grinning at her in a way she found irresistible.</p><p>He smiled down at her and said in a low, caressing voice, \u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA little. How about you?\u201d Pedestrian traffic was heavy and by tacit agreement, they moved to a small fountain and sat on a park bench. She didn\u2019t explain that her appetite had been practically nonexistent ever since she\u2019d lost Tony.</p><p>\u201cSome, but I\u2019ve never been to the waterfront before,\u201d Chase said. \u201cWould you mind if we played tourist for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it. Every year I make a point of bringing my class down here. They love the aquarium and the fact that some of the world\u2019s largest octopuses live in Elliott Bay. The kids are fascinated by them.\u201d</p><p>They stood and Chase reached for her hand, entwining their fingers. It felt oddly comfortable to be linked to him. They began to walk, their progress slowed by the crowds.</p><p>\u201cOther than the aquarium, my kids\u2019 favorite stop is Pier 54,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on Pier 54?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long row of tourist shops. Or in other words, one of the world\u2019s largest collections of junk and tacky souvenirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo third-graders it\u2019s heaven. Imagine what their parents think when the children come home carrying a plastic shrunken head with Seattle stamped across it. I shouldn\u2019t be so flippant\u2014it\u2019s not all like that. There\u2019s some interesting Northwest Indian and Eskimo art on display, if you want to walk there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Isn\u2019t that the ferry terminal?\u201d he asked, pointing toward a large structure beyond the souvenir shops.</p><p>\u201cYes. The Washington State Ferries terminal. Did you know we have the largest ferry system in the world? If you\u2019re looking for a little peace and some beautiful scenery, hop on a ferry. For a while after Tony told me about April, I used to come down here and take the Wins low ferry over to Bainbridge Island. There\u2019s something about being on the water that soothed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you take a ferry with me sometime?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much,\u201d she replied. His hand squeezed hers and she congratulated herself on how even she managed to keep her voice. Countless times over the past few months she\u2019d ridden the ferry, sat with a cup of coffee or stood on the deck. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what it was about being on the water that she found so peaceful, but it helped more than anything else.</p><p>They walked along the pier and in and out of several of the tourist shops, chatting as they went. It\u2019d been a long time since Lesley had laughed so easily or so often and it felt wonderful.</p><p>As they strolled past the ferry terminal, Lesley asked, \u201cHave you been to Pioneer Square? There\u2019s a fabulous restaurant close by if Italian food interests you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about Pioneer Square while we eat, then,\u201d Lesley said, leading the way. The restaurant was busy, but they were seated after a ten-minute wait.</p><p>No sooner were they handed menus than a basket of warm bread appeared, along with a relish tray, overflowing with fresh vegetables and a variety of black and green olives.</p><p>\u201cPioneer Square is actually the oldest part of Seattle,\u201d Lesley explained, somewhat conscious of sounding like a teacher in front of her class\u2014or maybe a tour guide. \u201cIt was originally an Indian village, and later a rowdy frontier settlement and gold rush town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the business about mail-order brides?\u201d Chase asked while dipping a thick slice of the bread in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.</p><p>\u201cYou heard about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have if it hadn\u2019t been for a TV documentary I saw. I only caught the end of it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brides are a historical fact. Back in the 1860s, Seattle had a severe shortage of women. To solve the problem, a well-intentioned gentleman by the name of Asa Mercer traveled East and recruited a number of New England women to come to Seattle. These weren\u2019t ladies of the night, either, but enterprising souls who were well-educated, cultured and refined. The ideal type of woman to settle the wild frontier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would Asa Mercer have said to induce these women to give up the comforts of civilization? How\u2019d he get them to agree to travel to the Wild West?\u201d Chase asked, setting aside his bread and focusing his full attention on her.</p><p>\u201cIt might surprise you to know he didn\u2019t have the least bit of difficulty convincing these women. First, there was a real shortage of marriageable men due to the Civil War. Many of these women were facing spinsterhood. Asa Mercer\u2019s proposition might well have been their only chance of finding a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Lesley didn\u2019t understand his frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he was quick to assure her. \u201cGo on, tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first women landed at the waterfront on May 16, 1864. I remember the day because May 16 is my birthday. Seattle was a riproaring town and I imagine these women must\u2019ve wondered what they were letting themselves in for. But it didn\u2019t take them long to settle in and bring touches of civilization to Seattle. They did such a good job that two years later a second group of brides was imported.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all got married, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll but one,\u201d Lesley told him. \u201cLizzie Ordway. Eventually she became the superintendent of public schools and a women\u2019s activist. It was because of her and other women like her that Washington State granted women the right to vote a full ten years ahead of the constitutional amendment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re the one who\u2019s frowning,\u201d Chase commented.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking that... I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, feeling foolish.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Chase asked gently.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to say it, didn\u2019t want to voice the fears that gnawed at her. That she was afraid she\u2019d end up like Lizzie, unmarried and alone. These few details were all Lesley knew about the woman\u2019s life. She wondered if Lizzie had found fulfillment in the women\u2019s suffrage movement. If she\u2019d found contentment as a spinster, when her friends had married one by one until she was the only one left. The only one who hadn\u2019t been able to find a husband. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLesley?\u201d Chase prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Lesley said, forcing herself to smile.</p><p>The waiter came just then, to Lesley\u2019s relief, and they ordered. Their dinner was wonderful, but she\u2019d expected nothing less from this restaurant.</p><p>Afterward, they caught the streetcar and returned to the waterfront. On the short ride, Lesley regaled Chase with the history of the vintage streetcars, which had been brought from Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Tasmanian mahogany?\u201d Chase repeated.</p><p>\u201cAnd white ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed by how well you know Seattle\u2019s history,\u201d Chase said when they climbed off the streetcar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a teacher, remember?\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned and it was a sexy, make-your-knees-weak sort of smile. \u201cI was just wondering why they didn\u2019t have anyone as beautiful as you when I was in school. I only ever seemed to have stereotypical old-maid teachers.\u201d</p> <p>Lesley laughed, although his words struck close to home. Too close for comfort.</p><p>\u201cHow about taking that ferry ride?\u201d Chase suggested next.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lesley was game as long as it meant their evening wouldn\u2019t end. She didn\u2019t want it to be over so soon, especially since she\u2019d done most of the talking. There were a number of questions she wanted to ask Chase about Alaska. Normally Lesley didn\u2019t dominate a conversation this way, but Chase had seemed genuinely interested.</p><p>As luck would have it, the Winslow Ferry was docked and they walked right on. While Lesley found them a table, Chase ordered two lattes.</p><p>He slid into the seat across from her and handed her the paper cup. Lesley carefully pried open the lid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing all the talking,\u201d she said, leaning back. \u201cWhat can you tell me about Alaska?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlenty,\u201d he murmured. \u201cDid you know Alaska has the westernmost and easternmost spots in the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lesley admitted, squinting while she tried to figure out how that was possible. She guessed it had to do with the sweep of islands that stretched nearly to the Asian coastline.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got incredible mountains, too. Seventeen of the twenty highest mountains in the entire United States are in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love mountains. When we\u2019re finished with our drinks, let\u2019s stand out on the deck. I want to show you the Olympics. They\u2019re so beautiful with their jagged peaks, especially at this time of night, just before the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>A short while later they went onto the windswept deck and walked over to the railing. The sun touched the snowcapped peaks, and a pale pink sky, filled with splashes of gold, spilled across the skyline.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night,\u201d Lesley said, holding on to the railing. The scent of the water was fresh and stimulating. The wind blew wildly around her, disarranging her hair. She tried several times to anchor it behind her ears, but the force of the wind was too strong.</p><p>Chase stood behind her in an effort to block the gusts. He slipped his arms around her shoulders and rested his jaw against the top of her head.</p><p>Lesley felt warm and protected in the shelter of his arms. There was a feeling of exquisite peace about being in this place with this man, on this day. This stranger had helped her more in the few hours they\u2019d been together than all the wisdom and counsel her family and friends had issued in months.</p> <p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Chase whispered close to her ear.</p><p>A thousand times Lesley had tried to do exactly that. More often than she cared to count, more often than she wanted to remember. It wasn\u2019t only her day-to-day life that was interwoven with Tony\u2019s, but her future, as well. Everything had been centered on their lives together. She couldn\u2019t walk into her home and not be confronted by memories of their five-year courtship.</p><p>The bookcases in her living room had been purchased with Tony. They\u2019d picked out the sofa and love seat together, and a hundred other things, as well. Even her wardrobe had been bought with him in mind. The dress she was wearing this evening had been purchased to wear to a special dinner she and Tony had shared.</p><p>\u201cI want to go back in now,\u201d she said stiffly, and wondered if Chase could hear her or if he\u2019d chosen to ignore her request. \u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly.\u201d</p><p>He released her with obvious reluctance, and in other circumstances his hesitation would have thrilled her. But not now, not when it felt as if her heart were melting inside her and she was fighting back a fresh stab of pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said when they returned to their seats.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Chase said gently. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have pressured you.\u201d</p><p>Lesley struggled for the words to explain, but she could find none. Some days her grief was like a room filled with musty shadows and darker corners. Other days it was like a long, winding path full of ruts. The worst part of traveling this road was that she\u2019d been so alone, so lost and afraid.</p><p>The ferry docked at Winslow and they walked off and waited in the terminal before boarding again. Neither seemed in the mood to talk, but it was a peaceful kind of silence. Lesley felt no compulsion to fill it with mindless conversation and apparently neither did Chase.</p><p>By the time they arrived back at the Seattle waterfront, the sun had set. Chase held her hand as they took the walkway down to street level, his mind in turmoil. He should never have asked Lesley to let go of the man she loved. It had been a mistake to pressure her, one he had no intention of repeating.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked as he led her down the pier. The crowds remained thick, the traffic along the sidewalk heavy even at this time of night. The scents of fried fish and the sea mingled.</p><p>\u201cDown there,\u201d he said, pointing to a length of deserted pier.</p><p>It was a testament to her trust that she didn\u2019t seem at all nervous. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m going to kiss you, Lesley, and I prefer to do it without half of Seattle watching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you taking a lot for granted?\u201d she asked, more amused than offended.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>Not giving her the opportunity to argue, he brought her with him and paused only when he was assured of their privacy. Without another word, he turned her toward him. He took her hands and guided her arms upward and around his neck. He felt a moment of hesitation, but it was quickly gone.</p><p>He circled her waist with his arms and pulled her to him. At the feel of her body next to his, Chase sighed, marveling when Lesley did, too. Hers was a little sigh. One that said she wasn\u2019t sure she was doing the right thing.</p><p>He smelled her faint flowery scent. It was a sensual moment, their bodies pressed against each other. It was a spiritual moment, as well, as though they were two lost souls reaching toward each other.</p><p>For long minutes, they simply held each other. Chase had never been with a woman like this. It wasn\u2019t desire that prompted him to take her into his arms, but something far stronger. Something he couldn\u2019t put words to or identify on a conscious level.</p><p>He longed to protect Lesley, shield her from more pain, and at the same time he was looking to her to end his loneliness.</p><p>Chase waged a debate on what to do next\u2014kiss her as he\u2019d claimed he would or hold her against him, comfort her and then release her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t not kiss her. Not when she felt so good in his arms.</p><p>Slowly he lowered his head, giving her ample opportunity to turn away from him. His heart felt as if it would burst wide open when she closed her eyes and brought her mouth to his.</p><p>Chase wanted this kiss, wanted it more intensely than he could remember wanting anything. That scared him and he brushed his lips briefly over hers. It was a light kiss, the kind of kiss a woman gives a man when she\u2019s teasing him. The kind a man gives a woman when he\u2019s trying to avoid kissing her.</p><p>Or when he\u2019s afraid he wants her too much.</p><p>He should\u2019ve known it wouldn\u2019t be enough to satisfy either of them. Lesley blinked uncertainly and he tried again, this time nibbling at her slightly parted lips.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t enough, either. If anything, it created a need for more. Much more.</p><p>The third time he kissed her, he opened his mouth and as the kiss deepened, Chase realized he\u2019d made another mistake. The hollow feeling in his stomach returned\u2014the feeling that fate was about to knock him for a loop.</p><p>Sensation after sensation rippled through him and his sigh was replaced with a groan. Not a groan of need or desire, but of awakening. He felt both excited and terrified. Strangely certain and yet confused.</p><p>Lesley groaned, too, and tightened her hold on him. She\u2019d felt it, too. She must have.</p><p>His hands bracketed her face as he lifted his head. This wasn\u2019t what he expected or wanted. He\u2019d feared this would happen, that he\u2019d be hungry for her, so hungry it demanded every ounce of strength he possessed not to kiss her again.</p><p>They drew apart as if they were both aware they\u2019d reached the limit, that continuing meant they\u2019d go further than either of them was prepared to deal with just then. Their bottom lips clung and they pressed their foreheads together.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of any words that adequately conveyed his feelings.</p><p>Lesley closed her eyes and he eased his lips closer to hers.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you again,\u201d Chase said once he\u2019d found his voice, once he knew he could speak without making a fool of himself.</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d came her breathless reply.</p><p>\u201cA movie?\u201d That was the first thing that came to his mind, although it was singularly unimaginative.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Waiting longer than a few hours would have been a test of his patience.</p><p>\u201cOkay. What time?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. It seemed a bit presumptuous to suggest a matinee, but waiting any longer than noon to see her again seemed impossible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you my phone number,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in the morning and we can talk then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your car.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare take hold of her hand or touch her. He\u2019d never felt this way with a woman, as if he\u2019d lose control simply brushing her lips with his. All she needed to do was to sigh that soft womanly sigh that said she wanted him and it would\u2019ve been all over, right then and there.</p><p>They didn\u2019t need to walk far. Lesley had parked in a slot beneath the viaduct across the street from the aquarium. He lingered outside her door.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cDinner was my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for dinner.\u201d She looked at him then and raised her hand, holding it against his face. Softly, unexpectedly, she pressed her mouth to his.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve made it through this day without you.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to argue with that. She was strong, far stronger than she gave herself credit for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I could help,\u201d he said finally, when he could think of no way to describe the strength he saw in her without making it sound trite. He wished he could reassure her that the man she loved had been a fool to let her go, but she didn\u2019t want to hear that, either. Those were the words he knew others had said to her, the counsel she\u2019d been given by family and friends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait to hear from you,\u201d she said, unlocking her car door.</p><p>He\u2019d be waiting, too, until a respectable amount of time had elapsed so he could phone her.</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d she said, silently communicating far more than thanks. She closed the door and started the engine. Chase stepped aside as she pulled out of the parking space and stood there until her car had disappeared into the night. Then he walked to his own.</p><p>Three</p> <p>The phone in his room rang at eight the next morning. Chase had been up for hours, had eaten breakfast and leisurely read the paper. After years of rising early, he\u2019d never learned to sleep past six.</p><p>The phone rang a second time. It couldn\u2019t possibly be Lesley\u2014he hadn\u2019t mentioned the name of his hotel\u2014yet he couldn\u2019t help hoping.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he answered crisply.</p><p>\u201cMr. Goodman, this is the answering service.\u201d The woman sounded impatient and more than a little frazzled.</p><p>\u201cSomeone responded to the ad,\u201d Chase guessed. He\u2019d nearly forgotten about the billboard.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone!\u201d the woman burst out. \u201cWe\u2019ve had nearly five hundred calls in the last twenty-four hours, including inquiries from two television stations, the Seattle Times and four radio stations. Our staff isn\u2019t equipped to deal with this kind of response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred calls.\u201d Chase was shocked. He\u2019d never dreamed his advertisement would receive such an overwhelming response.</p><p>\u201cOur operators have been bombarded with inquiries, Mr. Goodman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I possibly answer so many calls?\u201d The mere thought of being expected to contact that many women on his own was overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you hire someone to weed through the replies. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think any of us dreamed there\u2019d be such an unmanageable number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Chase was astonished himself. \u201cI\u2019ll make arrangements this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d come and collect the messages as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there directly,\u201d Chase promised.</p><p>Five hundred responses, he mused after he\u2019d replaced the receiver. It seemed incredible. Absurd. Unbelievable. He\u2019d never guessed there were that many women who\u2019d even consider such a thing. And according to the answering service, the calls hadn\u2019t stopped, either. There were more coming in every minute.</p><p>He reached for his car keys and was ready to leave when a knock sounded at the door. When he opened it, he discovered a newswoman and a man with a camera on the other side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Chase Goodman?\u201d the woman asked. She was slight and pretty and he recognized her from the newscast the night before. She was a TV reporter, and although he couldn\u2019t remember her name, her face was familiar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Chase Goodman,\u201d he answered, eyeing the man with the camera. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same Chase Goodman who rented the billboard off Denny Way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled then. \u201cI\u2019m Becky Bright from KYGNTV and this is Steve Dalton, my cameraman. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions? I promise we won\u2019t take much of your time.\u201d</p><p>Chase couldn\u2019t see any harm in that, but he didn\u2019t like the idea of someone sticking a camera in his face. He hesitated, then decided, \u201cI suppose that would be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d The reporter walked into his hotel room, pulled out a chair and instructed Chase to sit down. He did, but he didn\u2019t take his eye off the cameraman. A series of bright lights nearly blinded him.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Becky said apologetically. \u201cI should\u2019ve warned you about the glare. Now, tell me, Mr. Goodman, what prompted you to advertise for a wife?\u201d</p><p>Chase held up his hand to shield his eyes. \u201cAh...I\u2019m from Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlaska,\u201d she repeated, reaching for his arm and moving it away from his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to be in town a few weeks, so I wanted to make the most of my time,\u201d he elaborated, squinting. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a wife, and it seemed like a good idea to be as direct and straightforward as I could. I didn\u2019t want any misunderstanding about my intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had any responses?\u201d</p><p>Chase shook his head, still incredulous. \u201cI just got off the phone with the answering service and they\u2019ve been flooded with calls. They said there\u2019ve been over five hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat surprises you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure does. I figured I\u2019d be lucky to find a handful of women willing to move to Alaska. I live outside Prudhoe Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women who\u2019ve applied know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I left the pertinent details with the answering service as a sort of screening technique. Only those who were willing to accept my conditions were to leave their names and phone numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd five hundred have done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so. I was on my way to the agency just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you intend to interview five hundred or more women?\u201d</p><p>Chase rubbed the side of his jaw. This situation was quickly getting out of hand. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to hire an assistant as soon as I can. This whole thing has gone much further than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were to speak to the women who\u2019ve answered your ad, what would you say?\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t think well on his feet, especially when he was cornered by a fast-talking reporter and a cameraman who seemed intent on blinding him. \u201cI guess I\u2019d ask them to be patient. I promise to respond to every call, but it might take me a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be holding interviews yourself?\u201d</p><p>Chase hadn\u2019t thought this far ahead. His original idea had been to meet every applicant for dinner, so they could get to know each other in a nonthreatening, casual atmosphere, and then proceed, depending on how they felt about him and how he felt about them. All of that had changed now. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll be meeting them personally,\u201d he muttered reluctantly. \u201cA lot of them, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Becky stood and the lights dimmed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure talking to you, Mr. Goodman. We\u2019ll be running this on the noon news and later on the five o\u2019clock edition, if you\u2019re interested in seeing yourself on television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might even do a follow-up report after you\u2019ve selected your bride, but I\u2019ll have to wait until I talk that over with my producer. We\u2019d appreciate an exclusive. Can we count on you for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She beamed him a game-show-host smile.</p><p>\u201cBefore you go,\u201d Chase said, gathering his wits, \u201chow\u2019d you know where to find me?\u201d He\u2019d purposely made arrangements with the answering service to avoid this very thing.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Becky said, sticking her pad and pen inside her purse. \u201cI contacted the billboard company. They told me where to reach you.\u201d</p><p>Chase opened the door for the two, feeling very much like an idiot. He should never have agreed to the interview. They\u2019d caught him off guard, before he realized what he was doing. If anything, this meeting was likely to generate additional calls and he already had more than he knew how to deal with.</p><p>Chase slumped onto the bed. He\u2019d tried to be honest and fair. He wanted a wife. For thirty-three years he\u2019d been content to live and work alone, waiting until he could offer a woman a decent life. He was finished with that.</p><p>The shortage of women in Alaska was well-known, especially in the far north. When Lesley had told him the details about those Seattle brides back in the 1860s, he felt a certain kinship with Asa Mercer and the desperate, lonely men who\u2019d put up the money for such a venture.</p><p>Lesley had told him Mercer hadn\u2019t had much difficulty convincing women to move west. That had surprised him, but not as much as the response his own ad had generated.</p><p>Lesley.</p><p>He\u2019d meant to tell her about the billboard that first afternoon. But then she\u2019d mentioned it herself and implied that anyone who\u2019d advertise for a wife was crazy and pathetic. He\u2019d been afraid she\u2019d never agree to their dinner if she\u2019d known he was that man.</p><p>He reached for the phone, intending to call her right then to explain. He fumbled for her phone number inside his wallet and unfolded it, placing it on the nightstand. After punching the first four numbers in quick succession, he changed his mind and hung up. This sort of thing was best said face-to-face. He only hoped she\u2019d be more inclined to think well of him now that she knew him better.</p><p>He\u2019d wait until a decent hour and contact her, he decided. His one hope was that she wouldn\u2019t watch the noon news.</p><p>Lesley woke happy. At least she thought this feeling was happiness. All she knew was that she\u2019d slept through the entire night and when morning came, the dark cloud of despair that had hung over her the past few months had lifted. Her heart felt lighter, her head clearer, her spirit whole.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t falling in love with Chase. Not by a long shot. But he\u2019d helped her look past the pain she\u2019d been walking under; he\u2019d eased her toward the sun\u2019s warmth. With Chase she\u2019d laughed again and for that alone she\u2019d always be grateful.</p><p>She showered and twisted her hair into a French braid, then brewed a pot of coffee. While reading the paper, she decided to bake chocolate-chip cookies. Eric and Kevin, Daisy\u2019s two boys, would be thrilled.</p><p>Chase might enjoy them, too.</p><p>She smiled as she held the coffee cup in front of her lips, her elbows braced on the kitchen table. No point in kidding herself. She was baking those cookies for him. Later she\u2019d suggest an outing to Paradise on Mount Rainier.</p><p>True, Eric and Kevin would appreciate their share, but it was Chase she was hoping to impress. Chase she was looking forward to hearing from again. Chase who dominated her thoughts all morning.</p><p>The cookies were cooling on the counter when Daisy let herself in.</p><p>\u201cSay, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d she asked, helping herself to a cookie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I felt the urge to bake this morning.\u201d</p><p>Daisy pulled out a chair. \u201cIt\u2019s the nesting instinct. Mark my words, sweetie, those ol\u2019 hormones are kicking in.\u201d</p><p>Lesley paused, her hand holding a spatula that held a cookie. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re how old now? Twenty-five, twenty-six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of your friends are engaged or married. You\u2019ve probably got girlfriends with kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lesley admitted, agreeably enough, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to fool? Not me! As far as I\u2019m concerned, marriage and a family were the big attraction with Tony. He was never your type and we both know it. What you were looking forward to was settling down, getting pregnant and doing the mother thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agreed not to discuss Tony, remember?\u201d Lesley reminded her neighbor stiffly. Her former fianc\u00e9 was a subject she chose to avoid whenever possible with her friends, especially with Daisy, who\u2019d insisted from the first that Tony was all wrong for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou agreed we wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Daisy muttered, chewing the cookie, \u201cbut I\u2019ll respect your wishes as long as you fill me in on your date last night.\u201d</p><p>Lesley smiled. \u201cAh, yes, my date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve gotten back late. I didn\u2019t go into work at the bar yesterday because I had to study and I wasn\u2019t through until after midnight and I didn\u2019t hear you come home.\u201d</p><p>Lesley hadn\u2019t stopped to chat with Daisy, fearing that sharing her experience would somehow diminish it. She\u2019d gone to bed almost immediately, wanting to mull over her time with Chase, put some perspective on it, luxuriate in the memory of their kisses.</p> <p>She\u2019d intended to think about all that. Instead, she\u2019d fallen asleep almost immediately. Even now she wasn\u2019t sure how to interpret their evening together.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. We walked along the waterfront, and then went to dinner.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the ferry ride. She couldn\u2019t. It was too special to share even with Daisy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what, exactly, had happened between them, only that something had. Whatever it was, she\u2019d allowed it. Had participated in it, and in the end couldn\u2019t deny him or herself the pleasure of those kisses.</p><p>No one had ever kissed her the way Chase had, gently, with such infinite care, such tenderness. He\u2019d kissed her the way a woman dreams of being kissed, dreams of being held. Trying to explain that was beyond Lesley. She had no idea where to even begin.</p> <p>Daisy yawned with great exaggeration. \u201cSounds like a boring date if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019ve never had two men fight over me with switchblades the way you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of \u2019em were staggering drunk. Besides, I had no interest in dating either one. After being married to Brent for five years, why would I want to involve myself with another biker wannabe? Charlie had the police there so fast my head spun. Good thing, too.\u201d</p><p>Personally, Lesley believed Charlie the bartender had a crush on Daisy, but she\u2019d never said as much. He was a nice guy and he looked out for her neighbor, but in Lesley\u2019s opinion, his feelings were more than just friendship for a fellow employee.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sidetrack me,\u201d Daisy insisted. \u201cWe were talking about you and Chase. That\u2019s his name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lesley nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s not much more to say. I already told you I had a nice time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you described it as wonderful. You seeing him again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a movie...at least I think we are. He mentioned it last night, but we didn\u2019t discuss the time. And he didn\u2019t say anything about it when he phoned a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s already called again?\u201d</p><p>Lesley tried not to show how pleased she was. Chase had seemed distracted, but there was no disguising the warmth in his voice. She hoped he\u2019d tell her whatever was troubling him when he picked her up that evening. He\u2019d asked for her address and Lesley had no qualms about giving it to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Daisy asked, reaching across the table to a stack of mail and pulling out a catalog.</p><p>\u201cA knitting catalog,\u201d Lesley said, putting the cookie sheets in her sink to cool.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start knitting?\u201d Daisy asked, slowly flipping through the pages.</p><p>\u201cA couple of months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! The nesting instinct strikes again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Lesley said impatiently. She walked onto her back porch, retrieved an empty coffee can and filled it with cookies. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, thrusting the can toward her smart-mouthed neighbor. \u201cFor Eric and Kevin.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Daisy stood and reached for the cookies. \u201cI can take a hint. You don\u2019t want me talking about Tony and you don\u2019t want me saying anything about your hormones. It\u2019s downright difficult to carry on a conversation with you, girl.\u201d</p><p>After shooing Daisy out the door, Lesley made herself a sandwich and turned on the local noon news. She was chewing away when the billboard she\u2019d seen earlier that week came on the screen.</p><p>Her interest was piqued, and she put her sandwich back on the plate.</p><p>The camera left the billboard to focus on the reporter who was standing below it. Lesley liked Becky Bright and the offbeat stories she reported. It was a compliment to her professionalism, as far as Lesley was concerned, that Becky Bright could cover the billboard story and keep a straight face.</p><p>\u201cThis morning I talked with the man who\u2019s so earnestly seeking a wife,\u201d Becky announced. \u201cChase Goodman agreed to an interview and...\u201d</p><p>Chase Goodman.</p><p>Lesley didn\u2019t hear a word after that. His face appeared on the screen and he squinted into the camera and said he only had a limited time in Seattle and wanted to be as straightforward as he could.</p><p>Straightforward. He\u2019d misled her. Talk about being unethical; why, he\u2019d...he\u2019d kissed her. He\u2019d held her in his arms and... Mortified, she raised her hands to her face. She\u2019d so desperately wanted to believe in Chase, but he was like all the other men she\u2019d known. He was just like her father, who\u2019d cruelly deceived her. Just like Tony, who\u2019d broken her heart. Never again would she make herself vulnerable. Never again would she be so naive as to trust a man.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>\u201cYour next appointment is waiting,\u201d Sandra Zielger, the attractive middle-aged woman Chase had hired that morning, announced. He\u2019d been interviewing women all afternoon.</p><p>The first one who\u2019d come was a pleasant woman a few years his senior who worked as an executive assistant for a big manufacturing company. She was congenial, well-educated and professional. When Chase asked her why she wanted to marry him and move to Alaska, she said she was ready to \u201cget out of the rat race\u201d and take life at a more leisurely pace. She\u2019d been divorced twice, with no children. After ten minutes with her, Chase knew a relationship between them wouldn\u2019t work. He wasn\u2019t comfortable with her the way he was with Lesley.</p><p>The second interview turned out to be with a female plumber who\u2019d been working in construction. She\u2019d been out of work for three months and was looking for a change of scene. The first thing she asked was whether he wanted to sleep with her to sample the goods before making his decision. Even before he collected his wits enough to respond, she\u2019d unbuttoned her blouse, claiming she didn\u2019t mind a little kinky sex if that interested him, but she wasn\u2019t overly fond of whips and chains. By the time he\u2019d ushered her out the door, Chase felt shaken.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected when he\u2019d placed the ad, but it wasn\u2019t this. He was looking for a woman with a generous heart, one with pluck and spirit. A woman with depth and sensitivity. A woman like... Lesley.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck, closed his eyes and sighed.</p><p>He tried phoning Lesley just to calm his nerves, but she wasn\u2019t home. He didn\u2019t leave a message.</p><p>By four, Chase had talked with so many women that their names and faces and stories had all started to blend together. Not a single one had strongly appealed to him. He couldn\u2019t meet with these women and not compare them to Lesley. They seemed shallow by contrast, frivolous and, in some cases, reckless. There were a couple he might\u2019ve liked under other circumstances, and he\u2019d kept their names and phone numbers, but not a single woman to compare to the one he\u2019d met yesterday, quite by chance.</p><p>He glanced at his watch and knew he wasn\u2019t up to interviewing another woman. The suite he\u2019d rented at the hotel was packed with applicants. Word had gotten out that he was in the process of talking to prospective brides and they were coming in off the street now. Sandra Zielger seemed to have her hands full, and seeing that, Chase intervened, escorting the husband-seeking women from the room with promises of another day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Sandra said, pushing her hair away from her face with both hands. \u201cYou should\u2019ve brought some of your bachelor friends with you.\u201d</p><p>Chase closed his eyes and expelled a weary sigh. \u201cHow many women did we see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d He felt the panic rise. He\u2019d spent nearly an entire day meeting with women, and he\u2019d hardly made a dent in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re finished for the day?\u201d Sandra asked.</p><p>Chase nodded. He needed space to breathe and time to reflect. What he really needed was Lesley. He hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about her all day, or the kisses they\u2019d shared. Nor could he forget how she\u2019d felt in his arms. He wanted to hold her again, and soon.</p><p>He was halfway out the door when Sandra said, \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that there are a number of phone messages that need to be returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe radio stations, for one. Another TV station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget them. That last thing I need now is more publicity.\u201d</p><p>Sandra grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve had several interesting jobs working for Temp Help over the years, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, this is the most unusual. I wish you luck, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Chase answered. He had the distinct feeling he was going to need it.</p><p>Lesley had been filled with nervous energy from the moment she\u2019d seen Becky Bright stand beneath that ridiculous billboard and say Chase\u2019s name. None of her usual methods for relieving tension had worked.</p><p>She\u2019d gone shopping and fifteen minutes later left the store. She was too mad to appreciate a fifty-percent-off sale. That was an anger so out of the ordinary it surprised even her.</p><p>A long soak in the tub hadn\u2019t helped, either. By the time she\u2019d finished, she\u2019d sloshed water all over the floor and had spilled her favorite liquid bubble bath.</p><p>Even a fitness DVD didn\u2019t help, but then she\u2019d stopped five minutes into the exercises and turned it off. If she was going to do anything aerobic, Lesley decided, she\u2019d prefer to work in her yard.</p><p>She weeded the front flower beds and was watering the bright red geraniums with her hose when Daisy walked out of her town house in a pair of shorts and a Mariners T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou upset about something, honey?\u201d she called, crossing the driveway that divided their properties.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d Lesley returned in a completely reasonable voice. The fact that Daisy could easily see how upset she was fueled her already short temper.</p><p>\u201cCould be \u2019cause you\u2019re nearly drowning those poor flowers. They need to be watered like a gentle rainfall\u2014\u201d she made sprinkling motions with her hands \u201c\u2014and not with hurricane force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lesley murmured, realizing her neighbor was right.</p><p>\u201cThe boys thank you for the cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them I\u2019ve got a jarful they\u2019re welcome to, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you baked those cookies for Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d Lesley was sure she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did, maybe not in words, but it was obvious. You like this guy and you aren\u2019t going to fool me about that. All I can say is great. It\u2019s about time you got over that no-good jerk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChase isn\u2019t any better,\u201d Lesley said, continuing with her watering efforts, now concentrating on her lawn.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that billboard off Denny Way that\u2019s causing all the commotion?\u201d Lesley asked.</p><p>\u201cThe one where the guy\u2019s advertising for a bride?\u201d It must have clicked in Daisy\u2019s mind all at once because she snapped her fingers and pointed at Lesley. \u201cThat\u2019s Chase?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe very one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s insane,\u201d Lesley muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think so earlier in the day. Fact is, you were as happy as I\u2019ve seen you in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before I knew. He goes on TV and says the reason he decided on the billboard was so he could be\u2014and I quote\u2014direct and straightforward. He wasn\u2019t either one with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to trust your instincts,\u201d Daisy advised, \u201cand you had a wonderful time with him last night.\u201d</p><p>Now Lesley had heard everything. \u201cTrust my instincts? I was engaged to a man who wasn\u2019t even in love with me and I didn\u2019t figure it out until half the school knew, including the student body.\u201d It still mortified her to remember the strange, sympathetic looks she\u2019d gotten from her peers weeks prior to her broken engagement.</p><p>\u201cQuit blaming yourself for that,\u201d Daisy said, placing her hands on her hips. \u201cYou didn\u2019t suspect Tony because you shouldn\u2019t have suspected him. Believe me, honey, you got the better end of that deal. Mark my words. Two or three years down the road, he\u2019s going to start looking around again. It\u2019s a pattern with certain men. I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s not like that,\u201d Lesley insisted. Even after all this time she couldn\u2019t keep from defending him. She still wasn\u2019t over him, still wasn\u2019t over the loss of her dreams and the future she\u2019d envisioned. She wanted to forget him, but it was hard. The first ray of hope had been Chase, and now that hope was dashed by his deception.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me there\u2019s more to Chase than meets the eye,\u201d Daisy said thoughtfully. \u201cYou have to admit he\u2019s innovative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man rented a billboard and advertised for a wife,\u201d Lesley cried. \u201cThat\u2019s not innovation, it\u2019s stupidity.\u201d</p> <p>Daisy went on, undaunted. \u201cHe shows initiative, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you defend him when you haven\u2019t even met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course,\u201d Daisy agreed, \u201cbut there\u2019s something about him I like. He can\u2019t be so bad, otherwise you\u2019d never have gone out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before I knew what he really was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy\u2019s obviously got money. Did you ever stop to think about that? Billboards don\u2019t come cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney\u2019s never interested me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t unless you need it,\u201d Daisy answered with a hint of sarcasm. \u201cAnother thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always more. This guy is serious. He isn\u2019t going to string you along the way you-know-who did. Good grief, you were with the-guy-you-don\u2019t-want-me-to-mention how many years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Well, let me tell you, there\u2019s an advantage in knowing what a guy wants from you. Chase doesn\u2019t have a hidden agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you say is true, but it doesn\u2019t discount the fact that he deceived me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Daisy frowned at her. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me Chase ran after the guy who stole your purse? It isn\u2019t every man who\u2019d get involved in something like that, you know. Did you ever stop to think that mugger might\u2019ve had a gun?\u201d</p><p>Lesley had raced after him herself and that possibility had completely escaped her. Apparently it had escaped Chase, too.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t every man who\u2019s willing to put his life on the line in order to help another human being,\u201d Daisy continued.</p><p>\u201cIf the mugger had owned a gun, he would have used it to get my purse,\u201d Lesley said. That had just occurred to her. Now she was free once again to be furious with Chase. She didn\u2019t want to think of him as a hero, even if he\u2019d gotten her purse back for her. The action had been instinctive, she told herself, and nothing more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering you some advice,\u201d Daisy said.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give it to me whether I want it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fire away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so quick to judge Chase. He sounds like the decent sort to me, and more of a man than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to discuss Tony again.\u201d</p><p>Daisy shook her head as if saddened by Lesley\u2019s lack of insight into men. Her eyes brightened as she looked toward the road. \u201cWhat type of car did you say Chase drives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a great-looking guy just pulled up in a red car.\u201d</p><p>Lesley whirled around to see Chase climbing out of it. His smile was tentative as his eyes fell on her watering the lawn.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t come at a bad time, have I?\u201d he called from the driveway.</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Daisy whispered as Chase approached, \u201cthis guy is gorgeous. You don\u2019t happen to remember the phone number on that billboard, do you? I think I\u2019ll apply.\u201d</p><p>Lesley cast her neighbor a scalding look.</p><p>Daisy laughed, obviously considering herself amusing.</p><p>\u201cI take it you saw the noon news,\u201d Chase said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the story about your crazy billboard? Yes, I saw it.\u201d</p><p>Chase took a couple of steps toward her. \u201cAre you going to squirt me with that hose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should.\u201d She figured it was a credit to her upbringing that she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Angry shouts burst from Daisy\u2019s house and Eric chased Kevin out the front door. Lesley\u2019s neighbor hollered for the two boys to stop fighting. It soon became obvious that she was needed to untangle her sons.</p><p>\u201cDarn,\u201d Daisy said, \u201cand I was hoping to hear this.\u201d She stepped forward and shook hands with Chase. \u201cI\u2019m Lesley\u2019s neighbor, Daisy Sullivan. Be patient with her. She\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy!\u201d It irritated Lesley to no end that her friend was siding with Chase and worse, offering him advice on how to handle her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d Daisy said as she hurried over to her own house.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve said something yesterday,\u201d Chase told her, keeping a safe distance between them. \u201cBut you mentioned having seen the billboard yourself, remember?\u201d</p><p>Lesley lowered her eyes. She\u2019d more than mentioned the billboard, she\u2019d offered a detailed opinion of the mental state of the man who\u2019d paid for it, never guessing it was Chase.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me later, after dinner,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThat would have been the fair thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Chase advanced one step. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I should have, but it completely slipped my mind. I got so caught up in being with you that I forgot. I realize that\u2019s a poor excuse, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>Lesley felt herself weakening. She\u2019d enjoyed their evening together, too. That was what hurt so much now. For the first time in months she\u2019d been able to put aside the pain of Tony\u2019s betrayal and have fun. Playing the role of tour guide and showing Chase the city she loved had been more than a pleasant distraction, it had freed her. But after she\u2019d seen the noon news, all those reawakened emotions felt like a sham. Instead of anticipation, she\u2019d suffered regret.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d agree to see me again,\u201d Chase said enticingly. \u201cI\u2019ve been meeting with women all day and I haven\u2019t met a single one I like as much as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you like me the best,\u201d Lesley said indignantly. \u201cOnly a crazy-woman would answer that ad.\u201d</p><p>Chase buried his hands in his pants pockets. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said when you mentioned the ad, remember? You had me wondering, but, Lesley, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ve spent hours meeting with them, and that isn\u2019t the case. Most have been pleasant and sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should be dating them.\u201d Her minuscule lawn was well past the point of being watered, but she persisted, drenching it. If she continued, it\u2019d soon be swampland.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. I should be getting to know them better. But I\u2019d rather spend my free time with you. Will you have dinner with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>The temptation was strong, but Lesley refused to give in to it. \u201cI...don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s come up unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot I was meeting a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very original, Lesley. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny restaurant in town\u2014you name it.\u201d</p><p>Lesley hadn\u2019t expected him to persevere. But she could be equally stubborn. A rejection had already formed in her mind, when Chase removed the hose from her hand, putting it down. He took her by the shoulders and turned her to face him. She might\u2019ve been able to send him away if he hadn\u2019t touched her, but the moment he did, Lesley realized it was too late.</p><p>She knew the exact second she surrendered; it was the same second she knew he was going to kiss her and how badly she wanted him to.</p><p>His palms framed her face and he took her mouth greedily. Not only did Lesley allow the kiss, but she assisted him. Her hands splayed across his chest and she leaned closer. His kiss was hungry and demanding, and she clenched her fists in the fabric of his shirt as she battled against the sensations and feelings that came to life inside her. By the time it ended, Lesley knew she\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in fate?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t until I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, Chase. Please...\u201d She was fighting him for all she was worth and losing more ground every second he held her.</p><p>\u201cDinner. That\u2019s all I ask. One last time together and if you decide afterward that you don\u2019t want to see me again, I\u2019ll accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart and hope to die.\u201d</p><p>Despite her indecision, Lesley had to laugh. That sounded like something the kids next door would say.</p><p>\u201cNow, where would you like to eat? Anyplace in town, just name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Space Needle? Canlis? Il Bistro?\u201d</p><p>Lesley could suggest a better way of testing a man\u2019s character than sitting across from him in some fancy restaurant with a bevy of attentive waiters seeing to their every need.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to eat at Bobby\u2019s Burgers and then play a game of golf.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cGolf?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesley, I don\u2019t know if you realize this, but there isn\u2019t a golf course within eight hundred miles of Twin Creeks. I\u2019ve never played the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pick it up fast, I\u2019m sure. Anyway, those are my conditions. Take them or leave them.\u201d</p><p>Chase groaned. \u201cAll right, if you want to see me make a fool of myself.\u201d</p> <p>Miniature golf. That was what Lesley had in mind.</p><p>She\u2019d left him worrying all the way through their hamburgers before they drove to the golf course and he learned the truth. It was a just punishment, he decided, for what he\u2019d put her through.</p><p>He\u2019d suspected Lesley would be good at it and she was, soundly defeating him on the first nine holes. But as she\u2019d said, he was a fast learner, rallying on the last nine. When they added up their scores, Lesley won by three strokes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed so much,\u201d she said over a glass of iced tea. They were relaxing on the patio under a pink-and-orange-striped umbrella, surrounded by children and a handful of adults. \u201cYou\u2019re a good sport, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that surprise you?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. \u201cA little. Men don\u2019t like to lose, especially to a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true in all situations, just some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName one.\u201d Her challenge was there, bold and unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to a woman deciding between two men,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cNaturally, I can\u2019t speak for all men, but there\u2019s one thing that bothers me more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m forced to compete with another man for a woman\u2019s affection.\u201d</p> <p>Lesley grew quiet after that, and Chase hoped he hadn\u2019t offended her with his honesty. He couldn\u2019t apologize for speaking the truth.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the women you saw today,\u201d she said unexpectedly, sounding almost cheerful. He caught the gleam in her eye and realized she was prepared to hear horror stories.</p><p>\u201cI was really surprised by some,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cOh? Were they that awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNot at all\u2014there were some classy women in the group, with good educations. One of the first few I interviewed had her master\u2019s degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat prompted her to respond to your ad?\u201d The self-satisfied look disappeared, replaced by one of genuine curiosity.</p><p>Chase had wondered about that himself. \u201cI asked about her motives right off. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Twin Creeks is a nice, civilized town, but it\u2019s a long way from shopping centers, large libraries and cultural events. Granted, we have TV and the internet, but you aren\u2019t ever going to see any Broadway shows performed there. I explained all that to Christine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she still wanted to marry you?\u201d</p> <p>Chase nodded. \u201cAt least she said she did. She explained that she\u2019s in her late thirties and has a successful career. But now she realizes how badly she wants a husband and family. She claimed every guy she\u2019s dated in the last few years is emotionally scarred from a breakup or a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving reentered the dating scene myself, I\u2019m beginning to see how true that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristine is mainly interested in starting a family,\u201d Chase concluded.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about children?\u201d She propped her elbows on the table and rested her chin in her palms as she studied him.</p><p>\u201cI want a family, but I\u2019d prefer to wait a year or two, to give my wife the opportunity to know me better and for me to know her. In my view, it\u2019s important to be sure the marriage is going to last before we bring a child into the equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an intelligent way of looking at it.\u201d</p><p>Lesley went silent again and he saw pain in her eyes and wondered at the cause. He was about to question her when she spoke again.</p><p>\u201cOther than Christine, is there another woman who made an impression on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral. A female plumber who let me know she doesn\u2019t, uh, mind kinky sex.\u201d</p><p>The look that came over Lesley was very prim and proper. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bunny, who has four children under the age of six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was looking for someone to help her raise her kids and was honest about it. Her ex-husband abandoned them nine months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe creep.\u201d</p><p>Chase agreed with her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how a man can walk away from his responsibilities like that. What he did to Bunny is bad enough, but to leave those beautiful children...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe brought them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I asked to see a picture. They\u2019re cute as could be. I felt sorry for her.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention that he\u2019d given her enough money to fill her gas tank so she could get home and paid for a week\u2019s worth of groceries. She hadn\u2019t asked, but he could tell she was in dire financial straits.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t interested in a woman with excess baggage?\u201d she asked, almost flippantly. Though he\u2019d only known Lesley a short time, he already knew it wasn\u2019t like her to be so offhand. He suspected something else was bothering her.</p><p>\u201cBunny\u2019s a good woman who didn\u2019t deserve to be treated so badly by the man she\u2019d loved and trusted. The divorce was final less than a week ago. Bunny, and the children, too, need more love and help than I could give them. To answer your question, no, I don\u2019t object to marrying a woman with children.\u201d</p><p>Lesley was silent for a long time after that. \u201cMy dad left us,\u201d she finally said in a small voice.</p><p>Chase chose his words carefully, not knowing how to comment or if he should. \u201cIt must have been very hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only six and we were going to Disneyland. Mom had worked a second job in order to save extra money for the trip. Dad took the money when he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lesley, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The look in her eyes became distant, as if she were that six-year-old child, reliving the nightmare of being abandoned by her father all over again.</p><p>\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have blamed myself. I didn\u2019t drive my father away, but for years I was convinced that if I\u2019d been the son he wanted, he\u2019d never have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had any contact with him since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called when I was fifteen and wanted to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAfter being so bitterly hurt, I didn\u2019t have a lot of hope for our meeting. It\u2019s funny the things a child will remember about someone. I always thought of my dad as big and strong and invincible. When we met again nine years later, I realized he was weak and selfish. We had lunch together and he told me I could order anything I wanted. I remember I asked for the most expensive thing on the menu even though I didn\u2019t like steak. I barely touched the steak sandwich and took it home for our dog. I made sure he knew he\u2019d paid top dollar to feed our collie, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made him contact you after all those years?\u201d</p><p>Lesley sighed. \u201cHe seemed to want me to absolve him from his guilt. He told me how hard his life had been when he was married to my mother and had a child\u2014me\u2014with all the responsibilities that entails. He claimed he\u2019d married too young, that they\u2019d both made mistakes. He said he couldn\u2019t handle the pressures of constantly being in debt and never having money to do the kinds of things he wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I learned the truth. My dad walked out on my mother and me because he wanted to race sports cars. Imagine, driving a sports car meaning more to him than his wife and daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou might think badly of me, but I wouldn\u2019t give him the forgiveness he was seeking\u2014not then. It wasn\u2019t until later, in my early twenties, when I learned he\u2019d died of cancer, that I was able to find it in my heart to forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how any fifteen-year-old could have forgiven someone who\u2019d wounded her so deeply,\u201d Chase said, reaching for her hand. She gripped his fingers with surprising strength and intuitively Chase knew she didn\u2019t often share this painful part of her childhood.</p><p>She offered him a brief smile and picked up her drink.</p><p>\u201cDid your mother ever remarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lesley answered, \u201cto a wonderful man who\u2019s perfect for her. You\u2019d have to meet my mother to understand. She has a tendency to be something of a curmudgeon. It took her a long time to find the courage to commit herself to another relationship.</p><p>\u201cI was out of high school before she married Ken, although they\u2019d dated for years. She never told me this, but my guess is that Ken said either they marry or end the relationship. I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve followed through on the threat, but it worked.</p><p>\u201cHe and Mom are both retired. They live on a small ranch in Montana now and really love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d like a couple of grandkids to spoil someday but\u2014\u201d Lesley stopped abruptly and her face turned a soft shade of pink.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d She shrugged, looking decidedly uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s just something Daisy said to me this afternoon. And...she might be right.\u201d Her voice faded.</p><p>\u201cRight about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>Whatever the subject, it was obvious that Lesley wasn\u2019t going to discuss it with him.</p><p>\u201cWill you be meeting more women tomorrow?\u201d Lesley asked.</p><p>Chase nodded with little enthusiasm. \u201cI should never have agreed to that news story. The phones have been ringing off the hook ever since. There\u2019s no way I could possibly interview eight hundred women in two weeks\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight hundred!\u201d</p><p>Lesley sounded as shocked as he\u2019d been when he\u2019d heard the original number of five hundred. Since the story had aired, three hundred additional calls had poured in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember, I haven\u2019t met a single one I like better than you.\u201d</p><p>Lesley laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve already heard my answer to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much time in Seattle, Lesley. Less than three weeks. I need to make some decisions soon. If you\u2019d be willing to marry me, I\u2019d promise to be a good husband to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold it!\u201d she said, raising both hands. \u201cBack up. I\u2019m not in the market for a husband. Not now and possibly never again. Men have done some real damage to my heart, starting with my father and most recently Tony. I don\u2019t need a man in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but do you want one?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something to think about, then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d she answered, her voice insistent. \u201cI don\u2019t want to consider anything but having fun. That\u2019s my goal for this summer. I want to put the past behind me and get on with life in a positive way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Chase assured her, and it was true in a more profound way than she probably realized. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI baked cookies this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the first time in months I\u2019ve wanted to bake anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you saved any for me?\u201d</p><p>Lesley smiled as if she knew something he didn\u2019t. \u201cThere\u2019s a full cookie jar reserved for you.\u201d She suddenly recalled that she\u2019d said Kevin and Eric could have them. She\u2019d have to compromise. \u201cWell, half a cookie jar,\u201d she amended.</p><p>Chase couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d tasted home-baked cookies. \u201cThis calls for a picnic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cParadise.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDo I have to wait that long to try these cookies of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly. Paradise is in the national park on Mount Rainier. There\u2019s a lodge there and several trails and fields of wildflowers so abundant, they\u2019ll take your breath away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite places in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then. We\u2019ll leave first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, with a superior look.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll be interviewing a prospective wife. Eight hundred prospective wives to be exact.\u201d</p><p>Chase cursed under his breath and Lesley burst out laughing. Only then did Chase see any amusement in his predicament. What she didn\u2019t seem to understand, and what he was going to have to prove, was that he\u2019d willingly leave all eight hundred prospects behind in order to spend time with her.</p><p>The sun had barely peeked over the horizon when Chase arrived. Lesley had been up for an hour, packing their lunch and preparing for their day. Her hiking boots and a sweater were in a knapsack by the door and the picnic basket was loaded and ready for Chase to carry to his rental car.</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Morning,\u201d she greeted him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Morning,\u201d Chase returned, leaning forward to kiss her.</p><p>The kiss seemed instinctive on both their parts. A kiss, Lesley noticed, that was exchanged without doubt or hesitation.</p><p>Suddenly their smiles faded and her lungs emptied of air. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this. She was inches, seconds, from walking into his arms before she caught herself.</p><p>Chase, however, felt no such restraint and reached for her, pulling her toward him. Even with her mind crying no, she waited impatiently for his mouth to touch hers.</p><p>His lips were gentle, as if he were aware of her feelings.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you do that,\u201d he whispered, kissing her neck.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she asked, sighing deeply.</p> <p>He groaned. \u201cYou just did it again. That sigh. It tells me so much more than you\u2019d ever be willing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d She tried to ease away from him, but felt his breath warm and moist against her throat\u2014and couldn\u2019t move. His fingers loosened the top button of her blouse.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d Lesley murmured as he backed her against the door. He braced his hands on either side of her head, his eyes gazing into hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think. I want you to feel.\u201d He kissed her then with the same wicked sweetness that had broken her resolve seconds before. She sighed, the same sigh he\u2019d mentioned earlier, and regretted it immediately.</p><p>\u201cLesley, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d He leaned his forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cKiss me again.\u201d She held his face with her hands, buried her fingers in the thickness of his hair and directed his lips back to hers. By the time they drew apart, both were panting and breathless.</p><p>For a moment neither of them said anything. \u201cI think you might be right,\u201d he finally said with reluctance. \u201cThis isn\u2019t such a good idea, after all. One taste of you would never be enough. I\u2019m greedy, Lesley. I want it all. It\u2019s better not to start what we can\u2019t finish.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the picnic basket and took it outside. Lesley felt weak and shaken. She wouldn\u2019t have believed it possible for any man to evoke such an intense reaction with a few kisses.</p><p>Her knees were trembling as she grabbed her knapsack and purse and followed him out the door. Chase stored her things beside the picnic basket in the trunk. He helped her into the passenger seat and got into the car a moment later, waiting until she\u2019d adjusted her seat belt before he started the engine.</p><p>Neither of them had much to say on the long drive to Paradise. Lesley had planned to play the role of tour guide as she had previously, pointing out interesting facts along the way, but changed her mind. She was going to mention that Mount Rainier National Park was one of the first parks ever established\u2014in 1899. But it wasn\u2019t important to tell him that, not if it meant disturbing the peaceful silence they shared.</p><p>Lesley loved Mount Rainier and the way it stood guard over the Pacific Northwest. The view of the mountain from Seattle was often breathtaking. Her appreciation increased even more when she saw the look in Chase\u2019s eyes as they drove the twisting road through the forest-thick area. He surprised her with his knowledge of trees.</p><p>\u201cEveryone recognizes a Douglas fir when they see one, don\u2019t they?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They stopped at a campsite and took a break. When Lesley returned from using the facilities, she saw Chase wandering through the mossy, fern-draped valley. She joined him, feeling a sense of closeness and solemnity with Chase, as though they were standing on holy ground. The trees surrounding them were tall and massive, the forest a lush green. Breathing deeply, Lesley felt the fullness of beauty standing there with him. The air was sharp, clean, vibrant with the scent of evergreens.</p><p>Chase took her hand and entwined his fingers with hers. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lesley nodded, uncertain what she was agreeing to, and for once in her life not caring.</p><p>They got back in the car and in companionable silence traveled the rest of the way to Paradise. Since they hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast, Chase suggested they have their picnic, which they did. He finished the chocolate chip cookies she\u2019d brought for him, praising them lavishly.</p><p>Afterward, Lesley put on her boots and they walked the trails through the open, subalpine meadowlands, which were shedding their cold blankets of snow.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I love most here? The flowers, their color, the way they fight through the cold and stand proudly against the hillside as if to say they\u2019ve accomplished something important,\u201d Lesley said as they climbed up the steep path.</p><p>\u201cThe flowers respond the way most of us do, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey respond to life. To the power and force of life. I feel it here and you do, too. It\u2019s like standing on a boulder and looking out over the world and saying, \u2018Here I am. I\u2019ve done it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly have you done, Chase Goodman?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured it out yet, but this feeling is too good to waste.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>They hiked for a couple of hours, and ascended as far as the tree line. The beauty of the hills and valleys was unending, spilling out before them like an Impressionist painting, in vibrant hues of purple, rose and white.</p><p>After their hike, they explored the visitor center, then headed back to the car.</p><p>Lesley was exhausted. The day had been full and exciting. Over the years, she\u2019d visited Paradise countless times and had always enjoyed herself, but not the way she had today with Chase. With him, she\u2019d experienced a spiritual wonder, a feeling of joy, a new connection with nature. She couldn\u2019t think of a logical way to explain it any more than she could say why his kisses affected her so strongly.</p><p>When they arrived back in Seattle, Eric and Kevin, Daisy\u2019s two boys, ran out to the car to greet them.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lesley,\u201d Eric, the oldest boy, said, eyeing Chase.</p><p>\u201cHello, boys. This is Chase.\u201d</p><p>Chase cordially shook hands with the youngsters. \u201cHowdy, boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure big. Even bigger \u2019n Lesley.\u201d</p><p>Lesley wasn\u2019t sure if that was a compliment or not.</p><p>\u201cWe came to see if you had any cookies left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said you might have some more,\u201d Kevin chimed in.</p><p>\u201cYup, I saved some for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t forget she made them for me,\u201d Chase said. \u201cYou boys should make sure I\u2019m willing to share the loot before you ask Lesley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe used to make them for us. So we\u2019ve got dibs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna share or not?\u201d Kevin asked, hands on his hips, implying a showdown if necessary.</p><p>Chase rubbed the side of his jaw as if giving the matter consideration.</p><p>\u201cThose boys bothering you?\u201d Daisy shouted from the front door.</p><p>\u201cWe just want our share of Lesley\u2019s cookies before Chase eats \u2019em all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you cookies,\u201d Daisy promised, throwing an apologetic look at Lesley. For her part, Lesley was enjoying this exchange, especially the way Chase interacted with the two boys. Tony had treated Daisy\u2019s sons as pests and shooed them away whenever they came around. Although he worked with children, he had little rapport with them outside the classroom.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want any store-bought cookies,\u201d Eric argued.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and bake any, either, Mom, not after last time.\u201d He looked at Lesley, and whispered, \u201cEven my friend\u2019s dog wouldn\u2019t eat them.\u201d</p><p>Lesley smothered a giggle.</p><p>\u201cWill you or won\u2019t you give us some cookies?\u201d Eric demanded of Chase.</p><p>Chase himself was having trouble not smiling. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t have much choice. You two have a prior claim and any judge in the land would take that into account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean he will or he won\u2019t?\u201d Kevin asked his brother.</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Eric answered. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only if you help us unload the car,\u201d Chase said, giving them both a few things to haul inside.</p><p>Lesley emptied the cookie jar, setting aside a handful for Chase, and doled out the boys\u2019 well-earned reward. While Chase was dealing with the picnic basket, she absently checked her answering machine.</p><p>\u201cLesley, it\u2019s Tony. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking lately and thought we should get together to talk. April\u2019s out of town this week visiting her mother, so give me a call as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>Lesley felt as if someone had just hit her. Instinctively her hands went to her stomach, and she stood frozen in a desperate effort to catch her breath.</p><p>She turned slowly around, not knowing what to do, and discovered Chase standing there, staring at her.</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Chase said, studying Lesley closely. \u201cAre you going to call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to doubt Lesley and that upset her, possibly because she wasn\u2019t sure. Part of her wanted to speak to Tony. School had been out for more than a week now and she was starved for the sight of him. Admitting her weakness, even to herself, demanded rigorous, painful honesty. Tony was married, and it sickened her that she felt this way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she snapped, then added, \u201calthough it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his eyes guarded as though he wanted to believe her but wasn\u2019t convinced he should. \u201cAre you going to invite me in for a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>Lesley stared at him, not knowing what to say. She needed privacy in order to analyze her feelings, but at the same time, she didn\u2019t want Chase to leave, because once he did, she\u2019d be forced to confront her weakness for Tony.</p><p>Eric came into the kitchen, munching loudly on a cookie. \u201cLesley\u2019s the best cook I ever met,\u201d he announced, looking proud to be her neighbor. His jeans had large rips in the knees and his T-shirt was badly stained, but his cheerful expression was infectious.</p> <p>\u201cA better cook than Mom,\u201d Kevin agreed, rubbing his forearm over his mouth to remove any crumbs.</p><p>\u201cEven Dr. Seuss is a better cook than Mom. Remember the time she made us green eggs and ham for breakfast? Except they weren\u2019t supposed to be.\u201d Both boys laughed and grabbed another cookie.</p><p>\u201cSay, you two ever been fishing?\u201d Chase asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d They gazed up at Chase with wide, eager eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was planning to ask Lesley to go fishing tomorrow and I thought it might be fun if you two came along. You think you could talk your mom into letting you join us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask,\u201d Eric said, racing from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI want to ask,\u201d Kevin shouted, running after his brother.</p><p>Lesley made a pot of coffee. She wasn\u2019t gullible; she knew exactly why Chase had included the boys. He wanted to see her again and knew she wouldn\u2019t refuse him if it meant disappointing her ragamuffin neighbors. She said as much when she brought two mugs of coffee to the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I said I couldn\u2019t go with you?\u201d she asked, sitting across from him.</p><p>The healing calm she\u2019d experienced earlier with Chase on Mount Rainier had been shattered by Tony\u2019s call. She hadn\u2019t realized how frail that newfound peace had been or how easily it could be destroyed. She hated the fact that Tony continued to wield such power over her, especially when she felt she\u2019d made strides in letting go of her love for him.</p><p>\u201cThe boys and I\u2019d miss you,\u201d Chase said after a moment, \u201cbut I\u2019d never disappoint those two. Every boy should go fishing at some point in his life. I\u2019d like it if you\u2019d come, but I\u2019ll understand if you\u2019d prefer to stay home.\u201d He sipped his coffee and seemed to be waiting for a response from her.</p> <p>\u201cWould it be all right if I let you know in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The front door flew open and Eric and Kevin shot into the room like bullets, breathless with excitement. \u201cMom said we could go! But she needs to know how much money we need and what we should bring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her you don\u2019t need a dime and all you have to bring is an extra set of clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning?\u201d Kevin\u2019s eyes rounded with dismay. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually get up before nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to catch trout, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Eric said, elbowing his brother in the ribs. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Kevin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw. Yeah, we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll see you boys bright and early tomorrow morning.\u201d Chase ushered them to the door, while Lesley sat at the table, hiding her amusement.</p><p>When Chase returned, he surprised her by taking one last sip of his coffee and carrying the mug to her sink. He came back to the table, placed his hand on her shoulder and kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Suddenly it became vital that he stay because once he left, she feared the temptation to return Tony\u2019s call would be too strong to control, too easy to rationalize. Standing abruptly, she folded her arms and stared up at him, struggling with herself.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to go?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and finally admitted the truth. \u201cI...want you to help me understand why Tony would phone me out of the blue like this. I want you to help me figure out what I should do, but more importantly, I need you to remind me how wrong it would be to call him. I can\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t\u2014betray my own principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Chase said, sounding genuinely regretful. \u201cThose are things you\u2019ve got to figure out on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and desire was clear on his face. \u201cI\u2019d like nothing better, but I don\u2019t think I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She moved closer, so close she could feel his breath against her face, so close that all she needed to do was ease forward and her lips would meet his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a good idea just now.\u201d His voice was low.</p><p>\u201cI need you to kiss me,\u201d she said, pressing her palms against his shirt and waiting.</p><p>\u201cI wish...\u201d she continued.</p><p>His breathing was erratic, but so was her own.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d His mouth wandered to her neck and she sighed at the feel of his lips against her skin. She angled her head back, revealing her eagerness for his touch.</p><p>\u201cYou already know what I want,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He planted slow kisses on her throat, pausing to moisten the hollow with the tip of his tongue. Shivers of awareness rippled down her arms.</p><p>Her mouth sought his and he kissed her, his lips soft and undemanding. She slipped her arms around his neck and nestled into his arms, needing the security of his touch to ground her in reality.</p><p>When he kissed her again, she moaned, lifting her hand to the back of his head, urging him closer. \u201cOh, Chase,\u201d she breathed once the kiss had ended.</p><p>He raised his head and touched her forehead with his lips. \u201cA man could get used to hearing a woman say his name like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her response sounded inane, but conversation was beyond her.</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Lesley.\u201d</p><p>She risked a glance at his face and felt emotion well up in her throat. Blinking rapidly, she managed to hold the tears at bay.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this your way, in increments. Will you join the boys and me in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Lesley nodded.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cI have to leave now. Trust me, I\u2019d much rather stay, but I can\u2019t and we both know why.\u201d</p><p>Lesley did know.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair to use Chase as a shield against Tony. She would have to stand alone, make her own decisions, and Chase understood that more clearly than she had herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at six in the morning,\u201d he whispered, and released her. As if he couldn\u2019t wait that long to kiss her again, he lowered his mouth to hers, kissed her longingly, then slowly turned away.</p><p>The sound of the front door closing followed seconds later, and Lesley stood in the middle of her kitchen with the phone just inches away.</p><p>\u201cA trout can sure put up a big fight,\u201d Eric said with a satisfied look in his brother\u2019s direction after he\u2019d caught his first fish.</p><p>The four of them were standing on the banks of Green River, their lines dangling in the water. Through pure luck, Eric had managed to catch the first trout. While Chase helped the boy remove the squirming fish from the line and rebait his hook, Lesley whispered reassurances to Kevin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll snag one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I don\u2019t?\u201d Kevin asked, hanging his head. \u201cEric always gets everything first just \u2019cause he\u2019s older. It isn\u2019t fair. It just isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>No sooner were the words out of his mouth than his line dipped with such force that he nearly lost his fishing rod. His triumphant gaze flew to Lesley. \u201cI\u2019ve got one!\u201d</p><p>Chase immediately went over to the younger boy, coaxing him as he had Eric, tutoring him until the boy had reeled in the trout and Chase was able to take the good-size fish from the hook.</p><p>\u201cIs mine bigger than Eric\u2019s?\u201d Kevin demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to check that for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, mine\u2019s bigger,\u201d Kevin announced a moment later with a smug look.</p><p>Lesley found the younger boy\u2019s conviction amusing, but said nothing. To prove his point, Kevin held up both fish and asked Lesley to judge, but it was impossible to tell.</p><p>They spent most of the morning fishing, until both boys had reached their limit. Although Chase had brought Lesley a fishing rod, she didn\u2019t do much fishing herself. Twice she got a fish on the line, but both times she let the boys reel them in for her. Chase did the same, letting the boys experience the thrill.</p><p>By eleven o\u2019clock, all four were famished.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have trout for lunch,\u201d Chase suggested.</p><p>\u201cI thought Lesley made sandwiches,\u201d Kevin said, eyeing the fish suspiciously. \u201cI don\u2019t like fish, unless it\u2019s fish and chips, and then I\u2019ll eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve never had anyone cook trout the way the Indians do.\u201d Chase explained a method of slow cooking, wrapping the fish in leaves and mud and burying them in the coals, which had even Lesley\u2019s mouth watering in anticipation. He also explained the importance of never allowing the fish they\u2019d caught to go to waste. The boys nodded solemnly as if they understood the wisdom of his words. By then, Lesley guessed, they both thought Chase walked on water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need your help,\u201d he said, instructing the boys to gather kindling for the fire. \u201cThen you can help me clean the trout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need me for this, will you?\u201d Lesley asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cWomen are afraid of guts,\u201d Eric explained for Chase\u2019s benefit.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey go all weird over that kind of stuff. Mom\u2019s the same way. One time, the neighbor\u2019s cat, a black one named Midnight...you know Midnight, don\u2019t you, Lesley?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMidnight brought a dead bird into the yard and Mom started going all weird and yelling. We thought someone was trying to murder her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Dad was back,\u201d Eric inserted, and Chase\u2019s eyes connected briefly with Lesley\u2019s and for an instant fire leapt into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Mom asked Kevin and me to bury it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever forgiven Midnight, either. She gives him mean looks whenever he comes to visit and shoos him away.\u201d</p><p>While the boys were discussing a woman\u2019s aversion to the sight of blood, Lesley brought out the plastic tablecloth and spread it over a picnic table close to where they\u2019d parked the car.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d Eric said knowingly, motioning toward her. \u201cA woman wants to make everything fancy. Real men don\u2019t eat on a tablecloth. Kevin and I never would if it wasn\u2019t for Mom and Lesley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget Grandma,\u201d Kevin said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight, and Grandma, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose feminine touches can be nice, though,\u201d Chase told the boys. \u201cI live in a big log cabin up in Alaska and it gets mighty lonesome during the winters. Last January I would\u2019ve done just about anything to have a pretty face smiling at me across the dinner table, even if it meant having to eat on a tablecloth. I wouldn\u2019t have cared if she\u2019d spread out ten of them. It would\u2019ve been a small price to pay for her company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you wanted a woman with you?\u201d Eric sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cMen like having women around?\u201d Kevin asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Chase returned casually.</p><p>\u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t feel like that. He said he was glad to be rid of us. He said lots of mean things that made Mom cry and he hit her sometimes, too.\u201d</p><p>Chase crouched down in front of Eric and Kevin and talked to them for several minutes. She couldn\u2019t hear everything he said, because she was making trips back and forth to the car, but she knew whatever it was had an impact on the boys. She was touched when the three of them hugged.</p><p>After a while, the fire Chase had built had burned down to hot coals. The boys and Chase wrapped the cleaned fish in a bed of leaves and packed them in mud before burying them in the dirt, which they covered with the hot coals.</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting,\u201d Chase suggested, \u201cwe\u2019ll try those sandwiches Lesley packed and go exploring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d After collecting their sandwiches, both boys eagerly accompanied Chase on a nearby trail. Lesley chose to stay behind. Trekking into the woods, chasing after those two, was beyond her. She got a lounge chair she\u2019d packed, opened it and gratefully sank down on it.</p><p>She must have dozed off because she woke with both boys staring down at her, studying her as if she were a specimen under a microscope.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake,\u201d Eric cried.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>Lesley had the plastic plates and plastic silverware set out on the table, along with a large bag of potato chips, veggies and a cake she\u2019d baked the night before.</p><p>Chase dug up the fish, scraped away the dried mud and peeled back the leaves. The tantalizing aroma of the trout took Lesley by surprise. Until then she hadn\u2019t thought she was hungry.</p> <p>They ate until they were stuffed, until they couldn\u2019t force down another morsel. Chase and the boys conscientiously packed up the garbage and loaded the vehicle after Lesley had wrapped the leftovers\u2014not that there were many.</p><p>Eric and Kevin fell asleep in the backseat on the ride home.</p><p>\u201cThey really enjoyed themselves,\u201d Lesley whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ll remember this day all their lives. It was very sweet of you to invite them along.\u201d</p><p>She watched as his gaze briefly moved to his rearview mirror and he glanced at the boys. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet their father in a dark alley someday. I have no tolerance for a man who hits a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a drinking problem,\u201d Lesley said.</p><p>\u201cIs that an excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man should be punished for telling his sons he\u2019s glad to be rid of them. What kind of father would say such a thing?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t seem to expect an answer, which was just as well since Lesley didn\u2019t have one.</p><p>Daisy was back from her computer classes by the time they arrived at the house. The boys woke up when Chase cut the engine. As soon as they realized they were home, they darted out of the car and into the house, talking excitedly about their adventures.</p><p>Daisy came out of the house with her sons and ordered them to help unload the car for Lesley, which they did willingly.</p><p>Lesley had been neighbors and friends with Daisy for three years. She\u2019d watched this no-nonsense woman make some hard decisions in that time, but never once had she seen her friend cry. There were tears in Daisy\u2019s eyes now.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to Chase in a tremulous voice.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I was happy to have them with us. You\u2019re raising two fine boys there, Daisy. You should be proud of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darn.\u201d She held an index finger under each eye. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have me bawling here in a minute. I just wanted to thank you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy?\u201d Lesley asked gently. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course everything\u2019s all right. A woman can shed a few tears now and then, can\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m making a fool of myself. It\u2019s just that I appreciate what you did for my boys. I\u2019ve never seen them so excited and so happy.\u201d Lesley wasn\u2019t expecting to be hugged, but Daisy reached for her, nearly squeezing the breath from her lungs. \u201cI want to thank you for being my friend,\u201d she murmured, wiping her hand under her nose. Then she returned to her house.</p><p>Eric and Kevin were off, eager to relate their escapades to their neighborhood friends.</p><p>Chase followed Lesley into the kitchen. He helped her unload the picnic basket, then stopped abruptly, looking over at her.</p><p>\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve got a message on your answering machine.\u201d</p><p>Lesley\u2019s heart felt frozen in her chest. Trying to be nonchalant about it, she walked over and pushed the playback button. This time, Tony\u2019s voice didn\u2019t rip through her like the blade of a knife. In fact, hearing him again so soon felt anticlimactic.</p><p>\u201cLesley, it\u2019s Tony. When you didn\u2019t return my call, I stopped by the house. You weren\u2019t home. I need to talk to you. Call me soon. Please.\u201d</p><p>Lesley looked at Chase, wishing she could read his thoughts, wishing she could gauge her own. His eyes were darker than she\u2019d ever seen them and his jaw was stiff.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to contact him?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t any more confident than she\u2019d been earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to remind me he\u2019s a married man, don\u2019t you?\u201d she cried. \u201cI know that, Chase. I have no idea why he\u2019s calling or what he wants from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real, Lesley. You know exactly what he wants. Didn\u2019t he say April\u2019s out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s not like that.\u201d Again, she didn\u2019t understand why she felt the need to defend him. She\u2019d done it so often that it came naturally to her, she supposed. Although, she did have to wonder if Tony might be unfaithful to April, as he\u2019d been to her.</p><p>\u201cYou know him better than I do,\u201d Chase admitted grudgingly. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back,\u201d he said, as though he couldn\u2019t get away from her fast enough.</p><p>\u201cAre you interviewing more...applicants?\u201d she asked him on the way to the door, making conversation, not wanting their day to end on a sour note.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cSeveral.\u201d</p><p>His answer surprised her. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to some last night and I have more scheduled for later this afternoon and evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call me?\u201d she asked, trailing after him.</p><p>He hesitated, not looking at her. An eternity seemed to pass before he nodded. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>Lesley longed to reassure him; that was what Chase was waiting for her to do. To promise him she wouldn\u2019t call Tony. But she couldn\u2019t tell him that. She hadn\u2019t decided yet. She remembered what he\u2019d said about not wanting to compete with another man for a woman\u2019s affections. What Chase didn\u2019t understand was that she\u2019d never try to play one man against another.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to hearing from you,\u201d she said. To her own ears she sounded oddly formal. She stood on the other side of the screen door, watching him walk away from her. She had the craziest feeling that he was taking a piece of her heart with him.</p><p>She waited until his car was gone before she breathed again. She told herself she couldn\u2019t possibly know a man for such a short while and adequately judge her feelings. She was attracted to him, but any other woman with two eyes in her head would be, too.</p><p>Then there was Tony. She\u2019d loved him for so long she didn\u2019t know how to stop. He\u2019d been an integral part of her life and without him her world felt empty and meaningless.</p><p>Lesley walked back into her kitchen and listened to the message again. She thought about phoning Lori and asking for advice, but decided against it. Lori had said she\u2019d get back to her later, and she hadn\u2019t yet.</p><p>Daisy was the more logical choice, although her feelings about Tony were well-known. Lesley found her neighbor in the backyard, wearing a bikini, soaking up the sun on a chaise longue while propping an aluminum shield under her chin. Amused, Lesley stood by the fence and studied her.</p><p>\u201cWhere in heaven\u2019s name did you get that?\u201d Lesley asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get excited. It\u2019s one of those microwave pizza boxes the boys like, with those silver linings. I figured I\u2019d put it to good use now that they\u2019re finished with the pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Daisy, you crack me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only got so much time to get any sun. I\u2019ve got to make the most of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d Chase take off to?\u201d</p><p>Lesley looked away. \u201cHe had to get back to his hotel. Did I tell you eight hundred women responded to his billboard?\u201d</p><p>Daisy\u2019s eyes were closed. \u201cSeems to me it\u2019s a shame you\u2019re not one of them. What\u2019s the matter, Lesley, is it beneath your dignity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Daisy\u2019s sigh revealed how exasperated she was with Lesley. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad, sweetie, because that man\u2019s worth ten Tonys.\u201d</p><p>Lesley\u2019s fingers closed around the top of the fence. \u201cIt\u2019s funny that you should mention Tony because he\u2019s been calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that poor excuse of a man have to say for himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe claims he needs to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left two messages and Chase was here both times when I listened to them.\u201d</p><p>Daisy shook her head. \u201cChase isn\u2019t the type to stand still for that nonsense. Did he set you straight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy! I don\u2019t need a man to tell me what to do and I resent you even suggesting such a thing.\u201d She remembered, a little guiltily, that she had asked Chase to help her sort out her feelings for Tony as well as her moral obligations.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Neither of us truly needs a man for anything. I don\u2019t and you\u2019ve proved you don\u2019t, either. But you know, having one around can be a real comfort at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Lesley said, worrying her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cAbout Chase and all those women?\u201d</p><p>She was astonished by the way Daisy always brought the conversation back to Chase. \u201cNo! About Tony calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been miserable because that slimeball dumped you,\u201d Daisy went on with barely a pause. \u201cI find it ironic that when you meet up with a really decent guy, Tony comes sniffin\u2019 around. Does this guy have radar or what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lesley smiled. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t tolerate the thought of you with another man, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! He didn\u2019t want me, Daisy. You seem to be forgetting that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he wants you. For Tony it\u2019s a matter of pride to keep two women in love with him. Don\u2019t kid yourself. His ego eats it up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>Daisy snorted. \u201cWhen has that ever stopped a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Here she was defending him again although she didn\u2019t even know what he wanted from her.</p><p>\u201cListen, sweetie, you might have a college degree, but when it comes to men, you\u2019re as naive as those kids you teach. Why do you think Tony didn\u2019t want you transferring to another school? He wants to keep his eye on you. Trust me, the minute you show any interest in another man, he\u2019ll be there like stink on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the picture, Daisy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine, but do you get the message?\u201d</p><p>Lesley gnawed at her lip. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Daisy lowered the aluminum shield. She turned her head to look at Lesley. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid, aren\u2019t you? Afraid of what\u2019ll happen if you call Tony back.\u201d Lesley nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you still in love with that jerk?\u201d</p><p>Once more she nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lesley, you idiot. You don\u2019t need him, not when you\u2019ve got someone like Chase. He\u2019s crazy about you, but he isn\u2019t stupid. He\u2019s not going to ram his head against a brick wall, and who could blame him? Not me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hardly know Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy, he\u2019s looking for a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Her neighbor asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t continue to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you expecting, sweetie? This guy is manna from heaven. If you want to spend the rest of your life mooning over Tony, feel free. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that guy\u2019s going to do his best to make you miserable for as long as he can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChase is from Alaska,\u201d Lesley argued.</p><p>\u201cSo? You don\u2019t have any family here. There\u2019s nothing holding you back other than Tony, is there? Is a married man worth all that grief, Lesley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d How small her voice sounded, how uncertain.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to lose Chase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know? Sometimes I want to clobber you, Lesley. Where do you think you\u2019d ever find another man as good as Chase? But if that doesn\u2019t concern you, then far be it from me to point out the obvious.\u201d She swung her legs from the chaise longue. \u201cIf you want my advice, I\u2019d say go for it and marry the guy. I doubt that you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lesley wished she could be as sure of that, but she wasn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t even sure how she was going to get through another night without calling Tony.</p><p>Six</p><p>Chase forced himself to relax. He wasn\u2019t being fair to the women he\u2019d interviewed. He tried, heaven knew he\u2019d tried, to concentrate on what they\u2019d said, but it hadn\u2019t worked, not in a single case. And this had been going on for several days.</p><p>He\u2019d ask a question, listen intently for the first minute or two, and then his mind would drift. What irritated him most was the subject that dominated his thoughts so completely.</p><p>Lesley.</p><p>She was in love with Tony, although she was struggling to hide it. Not from him, but from herself. All the signs were there.</p><p>If he had more time, he might have a chance with Lesley. But he didn\u2019t. Even if he could afford a couple of months to court her, it might not be enough.</p><p>The best thing, the only thing, he could do was accept that whatever they\u2019d so briefly had was over, cut his losses and do what he could to make up for wasted time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last of them for this evening,\u201d Sandra said, letting herself into the room. The door clicked softly behind her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He was exhausted to the bone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got appointments starting first thing tomorrow morning. Are you sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, although he wasn\u2019t sure of anything. He could hardly keep the faces and the stories straight.</p><p>Sandra hesitated. \u201cHas anyone caught your fancy yet?\u201d</p><p>Chase chuckled, not because he found her question amusing, but because he was susceptible to one of the most basic human flaws\u2014wanting what he couldn\u2019t have. He wanted Lesley. \u201cThe woman I\u2019d like to marry is in love with someone else and won\u2019t marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the way it generally works?\u201d Sandra offered sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cIt must,\u201d he said, stretching out his legs and crossing them at the ankles. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to so much sitting and was getting restless. The city was beginning to wear on him, too, and the thought of his cabin on the tundra became more appealing by the minute.</p><p>\u201cIs there one woman who\u2019s stuck out in your mind?\u201d He motioned for Sandra to sit down and she did, taking the chair across from him.</p><p>\u201cA couple,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you remember Anna Lincoln and LaDonna Ransom?\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t, not immediately. \u201cDescribe them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaDonna\u2019s that petite blonde you saw yesterday evening, the one who\u2019s working in the King County Assessor\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Try as he might, Chase couldn\u2019t recall the woman, not when there\u2019d been so many. There\u2019d been several blondes, and countless faces and little that made one stand out over another.</p><p>\u201cBut I hesitate to recommend her. She\u2019s a fragile little thing, and I don\u2019t know how well she\u2019d adjust to winters that far north. Seattle\u2019s climate is temperate and nothing like what you experience. But...she was sweet, and I think you\u2019d grow to love her, given the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Anna Lincoln?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe chatted for a bit before the interview and she seemed to be a nice girl. Ambitious, too. Of course there was the one drawback.\u201d Sandra shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s not very pretty, at least not when you compare her to a lot of the other women who\u2019ve applied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauty doesn\u2019t count for much as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019m not exactly a movie star myself, you know.\u201d</p><p>Sandra must have felt obliged to argue with him because she made something of a fuss, contradicting him. By the time she\u2019d finished, she had him sounding like he should consider running for Mr. Universe.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate, I liked Anna and I think she\u2019d suit you. If you want I\u2019ll get her file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Sandra left and returned a couple of minutes later with the file. Chase was reading it over when she said good-night. He waved absently as he scanned the application and his few notes. There wasn\u2019t a picture enclosed, which might have jogged his memory. The details she\u2019d written down about herself described at least twenty other women he\u2019d interviewed in the past few days.</p><p>He set the file aside and relaxed, leaning back in his chair, wondering if Anna\u2019s lips were as soft and pliable as Lesley\u2019s, or if she fit in his arms as though she\u2019d been made for him. Probably not. No use trying to fool himself.</p><p>He reread the information and, exhaling sharply with defeat, set aside the file. At the rate things were going, he\u2019d return to Twin Creeks without the bride he\u2019d come to find.</p><p>\u201cLori?\u201d Lesley was so excited to find her friend at home that her voice rose unnaturally high.</p><p>\u201cLesley? Hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself. I\u2019ve been waiting to hear from you. We were going to get together this week, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were? Oh, right, I did say I\u2019d call you, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t had a chance. Oh, Les, you\u2019ll never guess what happened. Larry asked me to marry him!\u201d She let out a scream that sounded as though she were being strangled.</p><p>\u201cLori!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019ve got to stop doing that, but every time I think of Larry and me together, I get so excited I can hardly stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been dating him that long, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough. I\u2019m crazy about this guy, Lesley, and for once in my life I\u2019ve found a man who feels the same way about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Lesley put as much punch into the word as she could. She was thrilled for Lori, and wished her fellow teacher and Larry every happiness. But in the same breath, in the same heartbeat, she was so jealous she wanted to weep.</p><p>Truth demanded a price and being honest with herself had taken its toll on Lesley all week. First, she\u2019d been forced to admit she still loved Tony, despite all her efforts to put him out of her life. It was hopeless, useless and masochistic. She didn\u2019t need Daisy to tell her she was setting herself up for heartache. Not when she could see it herself.</p><p>Despite the temptation, she hadn\u2019t returned Tony\u2019s calls. However, it wasn\u2019t her sense of honor that had prompted her forbearance, nor had it been her sense of right and wrong.</p><p>Good old-fashioned fear was what kept her away from the phone. Fear of what she might do if Tony admitted he\u2019d made a mistake and wanted her back in his life. Fear of what she might become if he came to her, claiming he loved her, needed her.</p><p>On the heels of this painful insight came the news of Lori\u2019s engagement. Now she and Jo Ann were the only two single women left at the school. And Jo Ann didn\u2019t count, not technically.</p><p>Jo Ann had separated from her husband a year earlier and she\u2019d taken back her maiden name. But recently they\u2019d been talking. It wouldn\u2019t surprise Lesley if the two of them decided to make another go of their marriage.</p><p>Now Lori was engaged.</p><p>\u201cLarry wants a short engagement, which is fine with me,\u201d she was saying. \u201cI\u2019d like it if we could have the wedding before school starts this fall, and he\u2019s agreed. You\u2019ll be one of my bridesmaids, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored.\u201d That would make six times now that Lesley had stood up for friends. What was that old saying? Always a bridesmaid, never a bride. It certainly applied in her case.</p><p>In the fall she\u2019d be returning to the same school, the same classroom, the one directly down from Tony\u2019s. April\u2019s class was on the other side of the building. They\u2019d all return, enthusiastic about the new school year, eager to get started after the long break.</p><p>Tony would glance at her with that special look in his eyes and she wouldn\u2019t be able to glance away. He\u2019d know in a heartbeat that she still loved him, and worse, so would April and everyone else on staff. That humiliation far outweighed the likelihood of being the only unmarried faculty member.</p><p>Lesley knew she never should\u2019ve let Tony talk her out of transferring to another school. Perhaps she\u2019d asked for another assignment just so he\u2019d beg her to stay; she didn\u2019t know anymore, didn\u2019t trust herself or her motives.</p><p>\u201cLarry talked to my dad and formally asked for my hand in marriage,\u201d Lori was saying when Lesley pulled her thoughts back to her friend. \u201cHe\u2019s so traditional and sweet. It\u2019s funny, Les, but when it\u2019s right, it\u2019s right, and you know it in your gut. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if we\u2019d dated three months or three years.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHadn\u2019t you met Larry a while ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Apparently. He\u2019s a friend of my brother\u2019s, but I don\u2019t remember meeting him until this spring, although he claims I did. He pretends to be insulted that I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Lesley smiled. Lori\u2019s happiness sang through the wire like a melodious love song, full of spirit and joy. They spoke for a few minutes longer, of getting together with three of Lori\u2019s other friends and choosing the dresses, but it was all rather vague.</p><p>Jealous. That was how Lesley felt. Jealous of one of her best friends. She hated admitting it, but there was no other way to explain the hard knot in her stomach. It wasn\u2019t that she wished Lori and Larry anything but the best.</p> <p>But her feelings were wrapped around memories of the past, of standing alone, helpless and lost. Abandoned.</p><p>When she finished talking to Lori, Lesley called a florist friend and had a congratulatory bouquet sent to Lori and Larry with her warmest wishes.</p><p>Housework, Lesley decided. That was what a woman did when she suffered from guilt. It was either that or bury herself in a gallon of gourmet ice cream. She stripped her bed, stuffed the sheets in the washer and was hanging them on the line when Eric and Kevin found her.</p><p>\u201cIs Chase coming over today?\u201d Eric wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say,\u201d she answered as noncommittally as she could. She didn\u2019t want to disappoint them, or encourage them, either.</p> <p>\u201cCan you call him and ask?\u201d</p><p>Lesley shoved a clothespin onto a sheet, anchoring it. \u201cI don\u2019t have his phone number,\u201d she said, realizing it for the first time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be calling you, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d She\u2019d asked him to and he\u2019d said he would, but that wasn\u2019t any guarantee. He\u2019d been annoyed with her when they parted, convinced she\u2019d contact Tony despite her shaky reassurance otherwise.</p><p>Chase was an intelligent and sensitive man; he knew better than to involve himself in a dead-end relationship. It wouldn\u2019t surprise her if he never contacted her again.</p><p>The thought struck her hard and fast. The pain it produced shocked her. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d come to treasure their brief time together.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll call you again?\u201d Eric demanded. \u201cYou have to see him again because Kevin and me wrote him a letter to thank him for taking us fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom made us,\u201d Kevin volunteered. His front tooth was missing and Lesley noticed its absence for the first time.</p><p>She caught the younger boy by the chin and angled his head toward the light, although he squirmed. \u201cKevin, you lost your tooth. When did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said, releasing him. \u201cDid you leave it out for the Tooth Fairy?\u201d</p><p>The boy rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that silly stuff anymore and neither does Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect when they\u2019ve got me for a mother?\u201d Daisy said, stepping out the back porch, her hands on her hips. \u201cI never did believe in feeding kids all that garbage about Santa Claus and the Easter bunny. Life\u2019s hard enough without their own mother filling their heads with that kind of nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get gifts and candy and other stuff,\u201d Kevin felt obliged to inform Lesley, \u201cbut we know who gave them to us. Mom gave me a dollar for the tooth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe already spent it, too, on gum and candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shared, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, why don\u2019t you run along,\u201d Daisy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to Lesley and let her worry about it.\u201d With that, her neighbor returned to the house.</p><p>What Lesley had told the boys about not knowing Chase\u2019s phone number was a half-truth. There was always the number on the billboard. If she hadn\u2019t heard from him by that evening, she\u2019d leave a message for him through the answering service, although she doubted it would ever reach him.</p><p>After a polite knock, Sandra let herself into Chase\u2019s makeshift office in the suite he\u2019d rented. He\u2019d interviewed ten more women that morning and was scheduled to meet another fifteen that afternoon and evening.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t talked to or seen Lesley in two days and the temptation to call her or even drive over to see her was gaining momentum. He was trying, really trying, to meet a woman he liked as much as Lesley. Thus far he hadn\u2019t succeeded. Hadn\u2019t come anywhere close to succeeding.</p><p>\u201cDoes the name Lesley Campbell mean anything to you?\u201d Sandra asked unexpectedly.</p><p>Chase straightened as a chill shot through him. \u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left a message with the answering service. Apparently she explained that she wasn\u2019t responding to your billboard ad. She wanted it understood that the two of you know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sandra handed him the pink slip. \u201cI thought it might be a trick. Some of the applicants have tried various methods to get your attention.\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t need to be reminded of that. Flowers arrived almost daily, along with elaborately wrapped presents. A few of the gifts had shocked him. He hadn\u2019t accepted any of them. The floral bouquets he had delivered to a nearby nursing home and the gifts were dispensed with quickly. He left their disposal in Sandra\u2019s capable hands.</p><p>One woman, a day earlier, had shown up in full winter garb, carrying a long-barreled shotgun as though that would prove she was ready, willing and able to withstand the harsh winters of the Arctic. He wasn\u2019t sure what the gun was meant to signify.</p><p>Chase supposed she\u2019d rented the outfit from a costume store. She resembled Daniel Boone more than she did a prospective wife. Chase had lost patience with her and sent her on her way.</p><p>He glanced down at the message slip in his hand and tried to decide what to do. Returning Lesley\u2019s call could just prolong the inevitable. He wondered if she\u2019d spoken to Tony and what had come of their conversation. The minute he learned she had, it would be over for them. Possibly it was already over.</p><p>Objectivity was beyond him at this point. As far as he was concerned, Tony was bad news. All the man represented for Lesley was heartache and grief. If she wasn\u2019t smart enough to figure that out for herself, then he couldn\u2019t help her.</p><p>He waited until Sandra had left the room before he called Lesley. She answered on the second ring. The sound of her voice produced an empty, achy feeling that surprised him; he\u2019d been unaware she had such power to hurt him. He had no one to blame but himself. If Lesley hurt him, it was because he\u2019d allowed it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase...\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cThank you for returning my call. I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d get my message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d He\u2019d never been a brilliant conversationalist, but he was generally more adept than this.</p><p>\u201cFine. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Chase didn\u2019t know if he should break it by saying something or wait for her to do it. They hadn\u2019t fought, hadn\u2019t spoken so much as a cross word to each other. He couldn\u2019t even say they\u2019d disagreed, but there was a gap between them that had appeared after Tony\u2019s first call and widened with the second one.</p><p>\u201cEric and Kevin were asking about you,\u201d Lesley said before the silence threatened to go on forever. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wrote you a letter and asked me to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was thoughtful. They\u2019re good kids,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>The ball was in her court. If she wanted to see him, she was going to have to ask.</p><p>\u201cI could mail it.\u201d</p><p>His back straightened. \u201cFine.\u201d He rattled off his address and was about to make an excuse to get off the phone when she spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you came for it yourself.\u201d</p><p>Finally. Chase hoped she couldn\u2019t hear his sigh of relief. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever it\u2019s convenient for you.\u201d She sounded unsure of herself, as though she already regretted the invitation.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, you could leave it on your porch and I could pick it up sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her objection came fast enough to lend him hope. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she suggested. \u201cOr tonight, whichever you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to check my schedule.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why he felt it was necessary to continue this pretense but he felt obliged to do so.</p><p>\u201cI can wait.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the receiver to his chest and silently counted to ten, feeling like the biggest fool who\u2019d ever roamed the earth.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon looks like it would be the best. Say an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine. I\u2019ll look for you then.\u201d</p><p>Chase waited until he heard the click of the receiver before he tossed the phone in the air and deftly caught it with one hand behind his back. \u201cHot damn,\u201d he shouted loudly enough to send Sandra running into the room.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything, my dear Sandra, is just fine.\u201d He waltzed her across the room, planting a kiss on her cheek before hurrying out of the suite.</p><p>For the second time, Lesley fluffed up the decorator pillows at the end of her sofa. Holding one to her stomach, she exhaled slowly, praying she was doing the right thing.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and she must have leapt a good five inches off the ground. It was early, too early for Chase. She opened the door to find Daisy standing on the other side.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, how\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Daisy laughed. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dress up like that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She\u2019d carefully gone through her wardrobe, choosing beige silk pants, a cream-colored top and a soft coral blazer. Her silver earrings were crescent-shaped and the pendant dangling from her gold chain was a gold-edged magnifying glass.</p><p>\u201cYou look fabulous, darling,\u201d Daisy commented in a lazy drawl. \u201cJust fab-u-lous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I being too obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, compared to me, you\u2019re extremely subtle. Just be yourself and you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d She walked around the coffee table and eyed the cheese-and-cracker tray.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Daisy shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got wine cooling in the kitchen. I don\u2019t look too eager, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Lesley had never been less certain of anything. Her nerves were shattered, her composure crumbling and her self-confidence was at its lowest ebb.</p><p>\u201cThere must be something in the air,\u201d Daisy said, reaching for a cracker. She was about to dip it in the nut-rolled cheddar cheese ball when Lesley slapped her hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d But Daisy ate the cracker anyway. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me your friend Lori is getting married?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daisy relaxed on the sofa and crossed her legs, swinging one foot dangerously close to the cheese. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s been calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie Glenn. He asked me out on a date. Charlie and me? He shocked me so bad I said yes without even thinking. It\u2019s been so long since someone who wasn\u2019t half bombed asked me out that I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought for weeks that Charlie\u2019s interested in you.\u201d</p> <p>Daisy flapped her hand at Lesley. \u201cGet outta here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Lesley insisted.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I think there must be something in the air. First you meet Chase, then Lori and Larry decide to tie the knot and then Charlie asks me out.\u201d</p><p>Lesley smiled. Since her divorce, Daisy had sworn off men. To the best of Lesley\u2019s knowledge, her neighbor hadn\u2019t dated since she\u2019d separated from her ex.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Charlie taking you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTaking us. He included the boys. We\u2019re going to Wild Waves. Eric and Kevin are ecstatic. Did you know Charlie\u2019s been married before? I didn\u2019t, and it came as a total shock to me. He never mentioned he had a kid, either. His son\u2019s a couple of years older than Eric and he wants the five of us to get together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I do, too, but you know, I\u2019m a little surprised. I\u2019d never thought about Charlie in a romantic way, but I\u2019m beginning to think I might be able to. I\u2019m not rushing into anything, mind you, and neither is he. We\u2019ve both been burned and neither of us is willing to walk through fire a second time.\u201d Daisy grabbed a second cracker. \u201cHere I am jabbering away as though Charlie asked me to marry him or something. It\u2019s just a date. I have to keep telling myself that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Charlie\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a soft spot where his heart\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>Lesley recalled how the bartender had given her a drink on the house the night Tony broke their engagement. She\u2019d walked the streets for hours and finally landed in the cocktail lounge where Daisy worked weekends as a waitress and Charlie tended bar. Because she hadn\u2019t eaten and so rarely drank hard liquor, one stiff whiskey had Lesley feeling more than a little inebriated. Charlie had half carried her to Daisy\u2019s car, she remembered. His touch was gentle and his words soothing, although for the life of her she couldn\u2019t recall a word he\u2019d said.</p> <p>\u201cLet me know what happens,\u201d Daisy said, uncrossing her legs and bounding off the sofa. She walked to the door and opened it, then turned around. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried. She wasn\u2019t sure of anything at the moment except the knot in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to keep the boys out of your hair but they\u2019re anxious to see Chase again. He certainly made an impression on those two,\u201d she said with a smile. She left, closing the door quietly behind her.</p><p>Lesley didn\u2019t blame them. Chase had treated them with compassion and kindness; not only that, he knew how to entertain them.</p><p>The phone rang then, and Lesley glared at it. She let the answering machine take the calls most of the time now, since there was always a chance the caller could be Tony. She needed to invest in call display, she told herself. It had been pure luck that she\u2019d picked up when Chase phoned. Her reaction had been instinctive, but she was pleased she\u2019d answered because the caller had been Chase.</p><p>The phone rang again and the machine automatically went on after the third ring. Whoever was calling didn\u2019t listen to her message and disconnected.</p><p>A moment later, she heard the doorbell. It had to be Chase. She inhaled a calming breath, squared her shoulders and crossed the room.</p><p>With a smile firmly in place, she opened the door.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Lesley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, stepping aside for Chase to enter. \u201cCome in, please.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off her, which was both reassuring and disconcerting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you could come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting me.\u201d</p><p>How stiff they were with each other, how awkward, like polite strangers. \u201cSit down,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the sofa.</p><p>Chase took a seat and looked appreciatively at the cheese and crackers.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have a bottle of pinot grigio, if you\u2019d care for that. There\u2019s a pot of coffee, too, if you\u2019d prefer something hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too,\u201d she said eagerly, smiling. She moved into the kitchen, and Chase followed her.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any help opening the wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d A smaller, daintier woman might have trouble removing a cork, but she was perfectly capable of handling it. He watched her expertly open the bottle and fill two wineglasses.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned the boys\u2019 letter,\u201d Chase said. Their thank-you note had been an excuse to contact him and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it for you,\u201d she said, leaving him briefly while she retrieved the note. \u201cThey really are grateful for the time you spent with them.\u201d</p><p>He read it over, grinning, and handed it to her to read. Eric had written the short but enthusiastic message, and Kevin had decorated the handmade card with different colored fish in odd shapes and sizes.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lesley said, leading the way back into the living room. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He sat next to her on the sofa. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d</p><p>Chase studied her. \u201cAre you going to tell me what Tony wanted or are you going to make me guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered, sipping her wine. She hoped he didn\u2019t detect the slight shake in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to tell me or if you\u2019re going to make me guess?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know what he wanted. I didn\u2019t return his call.\u201d</p><p>This seemed to surprise Chase. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lesley raised one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see that it would do either of us any good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were afraid to, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted in a husky murmur. \u201cI was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you contacted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wanted his proverbial pound of flesh, she realized, and at the same moment knew she\u2019d give it to him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t love you, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit difficult to care for someone like me when your heart belongs to another man.\u201d After a significant pause, he added, \u201cA married man.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound so cold, so...ugly.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t married when I fell in love with him,\u201d she said, defending herself.</p><p>\u201cHe is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to remind me of that,\u201d she cried, raising her voice for the first time.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said brusquely.</p><p>\u201cHow are the interviews going?\u201d she asked, hoping to make light conversation and gain the information she needed.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He set the wineglass aside as if preparing to leave.</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to look at another application?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d He stood and shoved his hands deep in his pants pockets. \u201cI\u2019ve got more than I can deal with now. Are you going to recommend a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lesley closed her eyes and forced herself to continue. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d consider marrying me.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Chase repeated slowly, unsure he\u2019d heard her correctly. It seemed too good to be true, something he dared not believe.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lesley was standing now, too, her steady gaze nearly level with his own. She studied him as closely as he was studying her. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Fool that he was, he had to ask, although he was confident he knew her answer. He wondered if she\u2019d be honest enough to admit it.</p><p>\u201cI like you very much,\u201d she said, obviously choosing her words with care. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a physical attraction between us. I don\u2019t usually respond to a man the way I have to you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her no reassurances nor did he discourage her. She seemed nervous, understandably so. \u201cThose are the only reasons?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was irritated with him now and he felt relieved. The more emotion she revealed the better. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in Seattle any longer.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d disappointed him. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you want, isn\u2019t marrying a man you don\u2019t love a little drastic? All you need to do is apply for a teaching position elsewhere. I\u2019m not up on these things, but I seem to remember hearing that teachers were in high demand in a number of states. Try Montana. That\u2019s where your mother\u2019s living, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to move to Montana. I\u2019d rather be in Alaska with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me say it, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019d like to see me humiliate myself, but I\u2019m not going to. Now, do you want to marry me or not?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d never been a single doubt in Chase\u2019s mind. He knew exactly what he wanted and he had from the beginning. He wanted Lesley. He\u2019d always wanted Lesley, and that wasn\u2019t going to change.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tony, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, as unemotionally as he could. Funny, he\u2019d never met the man but he despised him for what he\u2019d done to Lesley and for the way he was treating his wife. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid he has the power to reduce you to something you find abhorrent. He wants you, doesn\u2019t he? But he\u2019s married and that means you\u2019d be his mistress and you\u2019re scared out of your wits that you\u2019ll do it because you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes!\u201d Angry tears glistened in her eyes and her hands were clenched into tight fists at her sides.</p><p>\u201cYou think marrying me and moving to Alaska is the answer to all your problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried again. \u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, Chase, not even when it would\u2019ve been convenient. You know exactly what you\u2019re getting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d he answered softly.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked with an indignant tilt of her chin. \u201cAre you going to marry me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a take-it-or-leave-it proposition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, walking away from her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be married Wednesday evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week!\u201d She sounded as if that was impossible. Unthinkable. \u201cI can\u2019t put together a wedding in that amount of time. My mother and Ken are traveling in their trailer this summer and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want them at the ceremony?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...not if it means ruining their vacation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen we won\u2019t tell them until they\u2019re home.\u201d If Lesley was looking for solutions, he\u2019d willingly supply them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to try calling them. And I want to invite a few friends and have a small reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me. The hotel can arrange whatever you want with twenty-four hours\u2019 notice. We\u2019ll talk to them on Monday.\u201d Chase didn\u2019t intend to give her any more time than that or she might well talk herself out of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the invitations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s always email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want real invitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a messenger service hand-deliver them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ll need to be printed, and...oh, Chase, there are so many things to do. I have a dress, but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d want me to wear it since I bought it for another man, but it\u2019s so beautiful and\u2014no, I couldn\u2019t possibly wear it, and that means I\u2019ll have to buy another one. But it took me weeks to find the first one.\u201d</p><p>Chase held his breath until his chest ached with the effort. \u201cIt seems to me you\u2019re looking for excuses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not! I swear I\u2019m not. It\u2019s just that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe very sure, Lesley, because once we say those vows we\u2019re married, and I take that very seriously. I assume you do, too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cWhat about all my things? What will I do with them? I can\u2019t cram everything I own in a couple of suitcases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack what you want and I\u2019ll have the rest shipped. You won\u2019t need the furniture, so either sell it or give it away\u2014whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to apply for the wedding license tomorrow morning. I\u2019ll be here by ten to pick you up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She nodded again and he started for the door.</p><p>\u201cChase.\u201d</p><p>He turned around, impatient now and not understanding why. Lesley had agreed to marry him, which was more than he\u2019d expected. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind kissing me?\u201d Her voice was small and uncertain. He purposely hadn\u2019t made this easy on her for the simple reason that he wanted her to know her own mind. To be satisfied that marriage to him was the right decision. He would\u2019ve liked to kiss her, and use their mutual attraction to convince her, but he couldn\u2019t. That would have felt unethical to him.</p><p>He saw that Lesley had taken several steps toward him; the least he could do was meet her halfway. She needed reassurance and he should have given it to her long before now.</p><p>He walked back to her, held her face in his hands and kissed her. The kiss deepened and deepened until Chase\u2019s control teetered precariously.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten exactly how good she felt in his arms. It shouldn\u2019t be like this. His experience might not have been as extensive as that of some men, but with other women he\u2019d always been composed and in control. His response to Lesley worried him. The fact that he found her so desirable was important, but that he could so easily lose his head over her was a negative.</p><p>Lesley exhaled, that soft womanly sigh that drove him to distraction. He lifted his mouth from hers and concentrated on the nape of her neck, scattering kisses there while struggling with his own composure.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. The beauty of her words and the sweetness of her mouth were fatal to his control.</p><p>\u201cThis will be a real marriage, Lesley,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d She sounded slightly offended, but Chase refused to leave any room for doubt.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow morning, then.\u201d</p><p>Lesley nodded and Chase felt a sense of victory, hollow though it was. She\u2019d agreed to marry him, but for none of the reasons he would\u2019ve liked. She was running away from a painful situation that could only bring her heartache.</p><p>He was the lesser of two evils.</p><p>Not the most solid foundation for a marriage. But time and patience and love were the mortar that would strengthen it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married!\u201d Lori and Jo Ann repeated together in stunned disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t offer to buy you lunch in a fancy restaurant for nothing,\u201d Lesley commented brightly, forking up a slice of chicken in her chicken-and-spinach salad. \u201cWhat are you two doing Wednesday evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...nothing,\u201d Lori murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Jo Ann said.</p><p>\u201cGreat, I\u2019d like you both to stand up for me at my wedding. Chase and I are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d Jo Ann broke in. \u201cWho on earth is Chase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were dating anyone,\u201d Lori said, sounding more surprised than upset.</p><p>Neither of her friends had touched their seafood salads. They sat like mannequins, staring at Lesley as if she\u2019d announced she was an escaped convict.</p><p>\u201cChase Goodman,\u201d Lesley repeated casually between bites. \u201cThat\u2019s the man I\u2019m marrying.\u201d</p><p>Lori, small and fawnlike, with large dark eyes, gnawed on her lower lip. \u201cWhy does that name sound familiar? Do I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. Chase\u2019s from Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlaska.\u201d Jo Ann said the name of the state in a low voice, as if trying to remember something. She picked up her fork. \u201cSpeaking of Alaska... Did either of you see the news story last week about this guy who came down from Alaska and advertised for a\u2014\u201d She stopped, her eyes widening. She made a few odd sounds, but nothing that resembled intelligible words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying the guy who advertised for a wife?\u201d Lori looked from Lesley to Jo Ann and back again.</p><p>\u201cLesley, have you lost your mind?\u201d Jo Ann finally sputtered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to argue with her two best friends. A week earlier she\u2019d thought the whole idea of marrying a stranger was crazy. She\u2019d said as much to Chase, belittled the women who\u2019d applied, even made derogatory remarks about the type of man who\u2019d defy convention in such an outlandish manner.</p><p>One week later, she\u2019d agreed to be his bride.</p><p>\u201cYou will be my bridesmaids, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. The wedding\u2019s on Wednesday. I don\u2019t have time for arguments, and please, don\u2019t try to talk me out of this because you can\u2019t. Chase and I are leaving for our honeymoon after the wedding.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThe location\u2019s a surprise. After that, we\u2019re heading to Twin Creeks where Chase lives. He has to be on the job in eight days and that doesn\u2019t leave us much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPinch me,\u201d Lori said to Jo Ann, \u201cbecause this doesn\u2019t seem real. We\u2019re not actually hearing this, are we? Lesley, this isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>Jo Ann shook her head and added, \u201cIt\u2019s because of Tony, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re far too sensible to do something like this otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything.\u201d Lori looked down, rearranging the salt and pepper shakers on the cream-colored tablecloth. \u201cBut...Tony phoned me. He\u2019s worried about you, Les. He said he\u2019s been trying to get in touch with you, but you weren\u2019t returning his calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s been calling you?\u201d Jo Ann sounded outraged. \u201cDoes April know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat creep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew when he married April that it wouldn\u2019t last,\u201d Lori said with a hint of self-righteousness.</p><p>Lesley laughed, grateful for her friends\u2019 loyalty. \u201cYou suspected it wouldn\u2019t last because Tony wasn\u2019t marrying me. If he had, you would both have been singing his praises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think Daisy might be right about him,\u201d Jo Ann said, stabbing her fork into some crabmeat. \u201cHow could she see through him so quickly? The three of us work with the guy nine months out of the year and we have to be hit over the head before it dawns on us that Tony isn\u2019t playing fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell Tony about me?\u201d Lesley inquired casually, although her interest was anything but casual.</p><p>\u201cNothing much, just that I\u2019d talked to you recently and you sounded happy.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed surprised to hear that and said he was afraid you were depressed and avoiding people. He acted concerned and guilty about the way he\u2019d hurt you. I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Lesley prompted.</p><p>\u201cI felt sorry for him by the time we hung up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for him?\u201d Jo Ann asked, incredulous. \u201cWhy would you feel sorry for Tony? He\u2019s the one who broke Lesley\u2019s heart and married someone else.\u201d</p><p>Lori shrugged, looking mildly guilty herself. \u201cHe didn\u2019t actually say so, but I had the feeling he regrets marrying April.\u201d Lori paused, frowning. \u201cShe\u2019s never been very friendly toward the three of us, has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can blame her for being unfriendly?\u201d Lesley was the first one to defend April.</p><p>\u201cTony made her situation impossible at school,\u201d Lori agreed. \u201cWe did our best to make her feel welcome, but we\u2019d all worked with Lesley and April knew that. She attended hardly any faculty functions after the wedding. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s really a nice person, and we\u2019d find that out if she ever gave anyone the chance to know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave Tony plenty of chances,\u201d Jo Ann muttered, unwilling even now to forget the upheaval the new first-grade teacher had brought into their lives.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to Tony yourself?\u201d Lori asked, ignoring Jo Ann\u2019s pettiness. For that, Lesley was grateful.</p><p>\u201cNot since school got out.\u201d She felt good about resisting the temptation to phone him, but it had exacted a high emotional price. \u201cI won\u2019t, either,\u201d she said, her resolve growing stronger.</p><p>Jo Ann nodded vigorously. Lori looked uncertain.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about what he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lori. What do you think Tony wants?\u201d Jo Ann asked.</p><p>Lori studied her for a disbelieving moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori, wake up!\u201d Jo Ann said sarcastically and snapped her fingers. \u201cWhen a married man phones another woman\u2014his ex-fianc\u00e9e, no less\u2014while his wife\u2019s out of town, there\u2019s only one reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to think Tony would do that.\u201d</p><p>Lesley felt the same way, but she couldn\u2019t allow her tenderness for Tony to mislead her.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Jo Ann raised both hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve strayed from the real subject here and that\u2019s Lesley\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Lesley\u2019s wedding,\u2019\u201d Lori echoed, sending a dismayed glance at Jo Ann. \u201cAre you in love with Chase?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lesley refused to be anything but honest with her friends. When she\u2019d told her mother and Ken she\u2019d stretched the truth, subtly of course, but she\u2019d never be able to fool her friends. Her mother was another story; she believed Lesley was in love because that was what she wanted to believe.</p><p>Lori\u2019s jaw fell open. \u201cYou don\u2019t even love him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve only known the man for a little more than one week. It\u2019s a bit difficult to develop a deep, emotional attachment in that length of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re willing to marry him anyway,\u201d Jo Ann murmured thoughtfully. \u201cThat tells me a lot. He\u2019s obviously got something going for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good with kids, and he\u2019s kind. And brave,\u201d she said, remembering his pursuit of her mugger. Those were only three of Chase\u2019s character traits that appealed to her. Honesty was another.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he look like?\u201d Lori was eager to know.</p> <p>\u201cKind of like you\u2019d expect someone from Alaska to look. He\u2019s tall and muscular and his eyes are a lovely deep brown. He\u2019s a comfortable sort of person to be with, entertaining and funny. When he laughs it comes from his belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying a man because of the way he laughs?\u201d</p><p>It sounded absurd, but in part she was. Chase had a wonderful sense of humor and Lesley found that quality important in any relationship, but vital in a marriage.</p><p>\u201cYou really like this guy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lesley nodded. It surprised her how much she did.</p> <p>\u201cWould you guys have time to shop with me this afternoon?\u201d Lesley asked, ending her introspection. She hadn\u2019t said a word about the way Chase kissed. He should win awards for his style. She\u2019d never known a man could arouse such a heated reaction with a few kisses.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going through with this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Even now Lori didn\u2019t quite seem to believe it.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d She turned to Jo Ann, expecting an argument, unsought advice or words of caution.</p><p>\u201cI almost envy you,\u201d Jo Ann remarked instead. \u201cThis is going to be an incredible adventure. You\u2019ll email us and let us know what happens, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lesley laughed, astonished when she felt tears gather in her eyes. Through all the pain and difficulties of the past year, she\u2019d been blessed with truly good friends.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what Alaska will be like,\u201d Lori said dreamily. \u201cDo you think Twin Creeks will have a friendly moose wandering through town like in the opening of that old TV show?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d Lesley said, letting herself into the house. Chase had spent the afternoon at her rented home, supervising the packers so her personal things would be ready for shipping.</p><p>He tossed aside the magazine he was reading and smiled up at her with that roguish gleam in his eyes. Her heart reacted with a surprising surge of warmth.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d your meeting with your friends go?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cReally well.\u201d It was ridiculous to be shy with him now.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t try to talk you out of the wedding?\u201d</p><p>Lesley grinned as she sat down on the sofa that would soon belong to Daisy and her boys. \u201cI\u2019ll admit they were shocked, but once I told them what a fabulous kisser you are, they were green with envy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to change your mind, are you?\u201d</p><p>Lori and Jo Ann had asked her that question, too, and she gave him the same answer. \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was gruff and he reached for her, kissing her hungrily.</p><p>Lesley could find no will to resist him. He\u2019d only kissed her once since she\u2019d agreed to be his wife and she needed his touch, longed for it. She leaned forward and braced her hand against his chest. The strong, even feel of his pulse reassured her that he enjoyed their kisses as much as she did. At least she wasn\u2019t alone in this.</p><p>Chase took hold of her waist and pulled her closer. His kiss was slow, deep and thorough. And not nearly enough.</p><p>Chase started to pull away and she protested. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>His mouth came back to hers once more. By the time Chase pulled away from her, she was weak and dizzy and breathless.</p><p>\u201cLesley, listen,\u201d he whispered, pressing his forehead to hers.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cJust hold me for a few minutes. Please.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to talk, not then, nor was she interested in thinking because if she analyzed what she was doing, she might change her mind, after all.</p><p>All Lesley wanted was to feel. When she was in Chase\u2019s arms she could feel again. For months she\u2019d been trapped in a kind of numbness. Sometimes the pain surged up to inundate her but most of the time she\u2019d felt nothing. No laughter. No tears. Just a lethargy that sapped away her energy and destroyed her dreams.</p><p>Then she\u2019d met Chase and suddenly she was laughing again, dreaming again. Whenever he kissed her, a cascade of feelings flooded her body\u2014and her heart. She needed to experience that excitement, those emotions.</p><p>For reasons of his own, Chase needed her, too. She would reciprocate generously and without reserve because she wanted him as badly as he wanted her.</p><p>As she luxuriated in the shelter of his arms, he buried his face in her neck, his breathing heavy.</p><p>Then, without warning, he broke away from her, leaving her breathless. Stunned. Before she could analyze what was happening, he was on his feet and moving toward the door. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo? But why?\u201d</p><p>He paused, his back to her. \u201cBecause if I stay we\u2019re going to end up in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you don\u2019t want to be with me?\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t answer. Although Lesley thought she knew why he\u2019d resisted the temptation to make love to her, she still felt hurt. She suspected that he feared she might not go through with the marriage. His lack of trust offended her, and his rejection was more than insulting, it was painful in a way that echoed past anguish. She\u2019d lowered her guard, offered him everything she had to give and he was walking away from her. The six-year-old child whose father had abandoned her was back, chanting her fears.</p><p>\u201cGo, then,\u201d she said furiously, trying to silence the sounds of grief only she could hear.</p><p>He paused at the front door, his shoulders slumped forward. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d</p><p>He turned back and walked over to the sofa, sitting down next to her. He pulled her into his arms, disregarding her token objections, and held her. She let him, although the little girl in her wanted to push him away, hurt him for hurting her. But the womanly part of her needed his comfort.</p><p>As Chase kissed the crown of her head, she sighed and nestled in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou tempt me, Lesley Campbell, more than any woman I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou tempt me, too.\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile and was glad he was there with her.</p><p>\u201cBecky Bright, the reporter who did that interview with me, phoned earlier this afternoon,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to do an interview with the two of us right after the wedding. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but it\u2019s the only way I can think of to stop the phone calls. According to the answering service, they\u2019re still coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the billboard taken down and asked Sandra to cancel all the remaining appointments, but there are more women phoning now than ever. I\u2019m sure some called before and were discouraged when they didn\u2019t hear back right away. Several were phoning to see if I\u2019d made a decision and others wanted to know it if was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been an...interesting experiment, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it isn\u2019t one I care to repeat.\u201d</p><p>Lesley jabbed him with her elbow. \u201cI should hope not!\u201d</p><p>Chase laughed, slid his arms around her waist and nuzzled her neck. \u201cI\u2019m going to have my hands full with one wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the applicants you\u2019ve already seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Sandra write up a form letter and send it out to everyone, including them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo eight hundred women.\u201d</p><p>Lesley felt his smile against her skin. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got eight hundred calls, yes\u2014well, maybe a thousand in total if we add the recent ones\u2014but not all of them were from women who wanted to be my wife. I found that at least a hundred were from mothers planning to introduce me to their daughters.\u201d</p><p>Lesley stared at him. \u201cI hope you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. And there were more crank calls than I care to mention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lesley said, feeling a bit cocky. \u201cWhen you come right down to it, exactly how many serious applications did you receive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne? But you said... I heard on the news\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours was the only one I took seriously.\u201d</p><p>His words were sweet and soft and precisely what she needed. She rewarded him by throwing her arms around his neck and directing his mouth to hers. Their kisses were slow and lazy and pleasurable.</p><p>Chase wasn\u2019t ready to leave for another hour. He needed to finish up some last-minute details with the answering service and the billboard company. After that, she lingered with him on the front porch for ten minutes, neither of them eager to separate even for a few hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he promised. \u201cWhere would you like to have dinner?\u201d</p><p>Lesley smiled. \u201cAre you in the mood for another hamburger and a rematch at the golf course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>Lesley stood on the porch until his car was out of sight. She glanced at her watch and realized that in twenty-four hours they\u2019d be married.</p><p>The house felt empty without Chase. In fact, not just her house but her whole life felt different now that she was marrying him.</p><p>She showered and changed clothes, and was packing her suitcase when the doorbell chimed. Her steps were eager as she ran across the living room. Chase could come in without the formality of waiting for her to answer the door. She should have said as much.</p><p>Her smile bright, she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lesley.\u201d</p><p>Her heart, which had seemed light only seconds before, plummeted like a deadweight to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHello, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cLesley, oh, Lesley.\u201d Tony\u2019s hands reached for hers, gripping them tightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea how good it is to see you again. I\u2019ve been desperate to talk to you. Why didn\u2019t you return my calls?\u201d</p><p>The immediate attraction was there, the way it had always been. That shouldn\u2019t have surprised her, but it did. Lesley had hoped that when she saw Tony again, she wouldn\u2019t experience this terrible need.</p><p>She jerked her hands free.</p><p>\u201cLesley.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes widened with hurt disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t return your calls for a reason. We don\u2019t have anything to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Lesley, my love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are,\u201d he said in a hurt-little-boy manner. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my love...you always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married to April.\u201d He obviously needed to be reminded of that, and so did she. The strength of her love for him, despite his marital status, was nearly over-whelming. All the feelings she\u2019d struggled to vanquish threatened her now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know...I know.\u201d He sounded sad and uncertain, a combination that never failed to touch her heart. Part of her longed to invite him into her home and listen to his troubles, but she dared not and knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a new life for myself,\u201d she insisted, steeling herself against the pleading in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve given notice to the school and to my landlord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new life? One without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please, Tony, just leave.\u201d She stepped back, intending to close the door, but he placed his foot over the threshold, blocking her attempt.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNot until I\u2019ve talked to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, please.\u201d This was so much harder than she\u2019d imagined it would be. He must have sensed that because he edged closer.</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Her voice shook with the force of her desperation. \u201cWe have nothing to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesley.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s voice sounded like an angel\u2019s harp. She was so grateful he\u2019d arrived that she nearly burst into tears.</p> <p>\u201cChase,\u201d she said, breaking away from Tony and rushing forward. She must have appeared desperate, but she didn\u2019t care. Chase was her one link to sanity and she held on to him with both hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Tony demanded. \u201cWho is this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was about to ask you the same thing,\u201d Chase said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tony Field.\u201d</p><p>Lesley felt Chase stiffen as soon as he recognized the name. He reacted by placing his arm possessively around Lesley\u2019s shoulders and pulling her closer to his side.</p><p>\u201cWho is this man?\u201d Tony asked again.</p> <p>Lesley opened her mouth to explain, but before she could utter a single word, Chase spoke.</p><p>\u201cLesley and I are going to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Tony laughed as if he\u2019d just heard a good joke. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dead serious,\u201d Chase responded.</p><p>\u201cLesley?\u201d Tony looked at her, clearly expecting her to deny it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said with as much conviction as she could manage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019ve never mentioned anyone named Chase and I know for a fact that you weren\u2019t dating him before school was out. Isn\u2019t this rather sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least,\u201d Chase said as if they\u2019d been involved for years.</p> <p>\u201cLesley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Chase said, smiling down at her.</p><p>It was all Lesley could do not to tell them both to stop playing these ridiculous games. Tony regarded her with a tormented expression, as though he was the loyal one and she\u2019d betrayed him. Chase wasn\u2019t any better. The full plumage of his male pride was fanned out in opulent display.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly be marrying this man,\u201d Tony said, ignoring Chase and concentrating on her instead.</p><p>\u201cI already said I was.\u201d She hated the way her voice quavered. Chase didn\u2019t seem pleased with the lack of enthusiasm in her trembling response, but that couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>\u201cThe ceremony\u2019s tomorrow evening,\u201d Chase added.</p><p>\u201cLesley, you don\u2019t love this man,\u201d Tony continued, his gaze burning into hers.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Chase challenged.</p><p>\u201cI do know it. Lesley loves me. Tell him, sweetheart. You\u2019d be doing us both a grave disservice if you didn\u2019t tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>Lesley could see no reason to confess the obvious. \u201cI\u2019m marrying Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love me,\u201d Tony insisted, his voice agitated. She noticed that he clenched his fists at his sides as if his temper was about to explode. He\u2019d fight for her if necessary, he seemed to be saying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already married,\u201d Chase told Tony with evident delight.</p><p>Tony turned to Lesley once more, ignoring Chase. \u201cMarrying April was a mistake. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you. If only you\u2019d returned my calls... I love you, Lesley. I have for years. I don\u2019t know what came over me.... I can see now that April and I were never right for each other. I\u2019ve been miserable without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to listen to this,\u201d Chase hissed in her ear. He tried to steer her past Tony and toward the front door, but she was rooted to the spot and unable to move.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to listen,\u201d Tony pleaded, \u201cbefore you ruin both our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s April now?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cShe left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Chase\u2019s voice was tight with barely restrained anger. \u201cYou said she was visiting her mother for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe phoned and told me she\u2019s not coming back. She knows I love Lesley and she can\u2019t live with that anymore. It\u2019s a blessing to us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe him,\u201d Chase said to Lesley, \u201cthere\u2019s a bridge in Brooklyn you might be interested in buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d Tony insisted. \u201cI should never have married April. It was a mistake on both our parts. April knows how I feel about you. She\u2019s always known. I can\u2019t go on pretending anymore. April can\u2019t, either. That\u2019s why she went to visit her mother and why she\u2019s decided not to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m marrying Chase.\u201d Her voice wavered, but not her certainty. She couldn\u2019t trust Tony, couldn\u2019t believe him. Chase was right about that. He\u2019d lied to her before, and the experience had taught her painful but valuable lessons.</p><p>\u201cLesley, don\u2019t,\u201d Tony cried. \u201cI\u2019m pleading with you. Don\u2019t do something you\u2019ll regret the rest of our lives. I made a terrible mistake. Don\u2019t compound it by making another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t believe you any more than I do,\u201d Chase said calmly.</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is have the decency to give us some privacy,\u201d Tony shouted, frustrated and short-tempered.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tony shouted. \u201cBecause Lesley loves me and you know it. You think if you can keep her from listening to me, she\u2019ll go through with the wedding, but you\u2019re wrong. She doesn\u2019t need you, not when she\u2019s got me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she hasn\u2019t got you. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, I\u2019ll remind you again\u2014you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>As he was talking, Tony stepped closer to Chase, his stance challenging.</p><p>Chase dropped his arm from Lesley\u2019s shoulders and moved toward Tony. The two men were practically chest to chest. It wouldn\u2019t take much for the situation to erupt into a brawl.</p><p>\u201cStop it, both of you!\u201d Lesley yelled. She was surprised none of the neighbors were out yet to watch the show. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou can\u2019t marry this...this barbarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust watch her,\u201d Chase returned with a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything until both of you stop behaving like six-year-olds,\u201d Lesley said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe either one of you would resort to this childish behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll divorce April,\u201d Tony promised. \u201cI swear by everything I hold dear that I\u2019ll get her out of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think a husband would hold his wife dear,\u201d Chase said. \u201cApparently that isn\u2019t so. Your vows meant nothing the first time. What makes you so sure they\u2019ll mean any more on a second go-round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be as civil as I can,\u201d Tony muttered, \u201cbut if you want to fight this out, fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d Chase said, grinning broadly as if he welcomed the confrontation, \u201canyplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>They were chest to chest once more.</p><p>Lesley managed to wedge herself between them and braced a hand against each of their chests. \u201cI think you should go,\u201d she said to Tony. It was useless to try to discuss anything now. She wanted to believe him, but Chase was right. The first message Tony had left claimed that April was away for a week visiting her mother. He hadn\u2019t said a word about his marriage being a mistake or that he still cared for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you, not when you\u2019re making the biggest mistake of your life,\u201d Tony told her. \u201cI already said I\u2019d divorce April. What more do you want me to do? The marriage was a mistake from the first! What else can I do? Tell me, Lesley, tell me and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make amends to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the lady asked you to leave,\u201d Chase said with the same easy grace. \u201cThat\u2019s all she wants from you. Get out of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll give me a good deal of pleasure to assist you.\u201d</p><p>The next thing she knew, Chase had grabbed Tony\u2019s arm and steered him toward his parked car.</p><p>Lesley stood on the porch, her teeth sinking into her lower lip as she watched the unpleasant scene. She was furious and didn\u2019t know who with\u2014Chase or Tony. Both had behaved like children fighting on the playground. Neither of them had shown any maturity in dealing with an awkward situation.</p><p>The two men exchanged a few words at Tony\u2019s vehicle and it looked for a moment as if a fistfight was about to erupt. In the end, Tony climbed inside his car and drove away.</p><p>Lesley was pacing her living room when Chase entered the house. \u201cHow could you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow could I what? Treat lover boy the way he deserved, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t any better than he was! I expected more from you, Chase. The least you could\u2019ve done was...was be civil about the whole thing. Instead you acted like a jealous lover.\u201d She continued pacing. Her anger had created an energy within her that couldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to talk to him alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething different than strong-arming him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you wanted to invite him in for tea and then sit around discussing this like civilized adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been better than a shouting match on my front porch. The two of you behaved as though I was a prize baseball card you both wanted. Tony had traded me away and now he wants me back and you weren\u2019t about to see that happen.\u201d</p><p>Chase went still. \u201cIs that what you wanted?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo be handed back to Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course it isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t stand the thought of losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who ended the relationship, not me. It\u2019s over, Chase.\u201d</p><p>Chase walked to the window and stared outside. He didn\u2019t speak for a long time and seemed to be weighing his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou...you told me once that you had a problem with a woman playing one man against another,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that, Chase. I wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re the man I\u2019m marrying, not Tony.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou love him,\u201d Chase said, turning to face her, \u201calthough he doesn\u2019t deserve your devotion. You could have lied to me about your feelings, but you haven\u2019t and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust Tony,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not trust him, but you want to believe him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter if I do, does it? I\u2019ve already agreed to marry you, and I\u2019m not backing out.\u201d She refused to do to Chase what Tony had done to her. She wouldn\u2019t push him aside in favor of Tony\u2019s promises. Chase was right; Tony had always been a sore loser, no matter what the stakes.</p> <p>Chase said nothing for several minutes. \u201cThe choice is yours,\u201d he finally said, \u201cand I\u2019ll abide by whatever you decide. I want you, Lesley. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. I\u2019m surprised by how much I desire you. If you agree to marry me, I promise you I\u2019ll do my best to be a good husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I haven\u2019t made up my mind. I\u2019ve already told you\u2014and Tony\u2014that I have. I\u2019m going through with the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late to call it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d she asked, forcing a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re in love with Tony,\u201d Chase answered with dark, sober eyes focused on her. \u201cThink about this very carefully,\u201d he advised and walked to her door.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d She was afraid Tony would return and she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if Chase wasn\u2019t there to buffer his effect on her.</p><p>\u201cWill you call me in the morning?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t need to explain what he expected to hear. That was obvious. If she was willing to go through with the ceremony, she needed to let him know.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you that right now,\u201d she said, folding her hands in an effort to keep from reaching for him.</p><p>\u201cYou might feel differently later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise you I won\u2019t.\u201d The desperate quality of her voice was all the answer he seemed to need.</p><p>He came over to her, placed his hands on her shoulders and drew her into his arms. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t touch you, but I can\u2019t make myself leave without kissing you goodbye. Forgive me for that, Lesley.\u201d His last words were whispered as he lowered his mouth to hers. The kiss was filled with a longing and a hunger that left her breathless and yearning for more.</p> <p>He expelled his breath, then turned and walked away.</p><p>Lesley watched him go and had the feeling she might never see him again.</p><p>Her knees were trembling and she sank onto the sofa and hid her face in her hands.</p><p>He\u2019d lost her, Chase told himself as he unlocked the door to his hotel suite. He could\u2019ve taken the advantage and run with it. At first he thought he\u2019d do exactly that. Tony wasn\u2019t right for Lesley\u2014anyone could see it.</p><p>Okay, he believed it so strongly because he wanted her for himself. Maybe the jerk was good for Lesley, although Chase couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>Chase suspected Tony would string her along for years. He\u2019d promise to divorce April but there\u2019d be complications. There were always complications in cases like this, and Lesley would be completely disheartened by the time Tony was free. If he ever followed through on his promises. Chase knew exactly whose interests Tony was serving, and those were his own.</p><p>Tony might have some genuine affection for Lesley, but he didn\u2019t really love her. He couldn\u2019t possibly, otherwise he\u2019d never put her through this agony.</p><p>Then again, Chase\u2019s own intentions weren\u2019t exactly pure, either. He needed a wife and he wanted Lesley. It didn\u2019t matter to him that she was in love with another man; all that mattered was her willingness to marry him and live with him in Alaska.</p> <p>If there was a law against selfishness, he\u2019d be swinging by his neck, right next to Tony.</p><p>So he\u2019d done the only thing he could and still live with himself in the weeks to come. This business of being honorable was hard, much harder than he\u2019d realized.</p><p>He\u2019d given Lesley both the freedom and the privacy to make whatever choice she wanted. He wouldn\u2019t stand in her way, judge or condemn her if she decided not to go through with their marriage.</p><p>He was about to lose the wife he wanted, and nobility didn\u2019t offer much compensation.</p><p>All he had to do was wait until she\u2019d made up her mind. He had the distinct feeling that this was going to be a long night.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this hard,\u201d Lesley wailed to her no-nonsense neighbor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Daisy agreed. She stood next to Lesley\u2019s refrigerator, one hand on her hip. \u201cLook at it this way. You could let Chase go back to Alaska alone and spend the next year or two being lied to, manipulated and emotionally abused by a jerk. Or,\u201d she added with a lazy smile, \u201cyou could marry a terrific man who adores you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase doesn\u2019t adore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but he is crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you got eyes in your head?\u201d Daisy asked sarcastically. \u201cHe chose you out of hundreds of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if you want to argue with someone, let me bring in the boys. They\u2019re much better at it than either of us. I don\u2019t have time to play silly games with you. I\u2019m calling this the way I see it. If you want to mess up your life, that\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Lesley insisted.</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you phone Chase? You said he was waiting to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there always going to be a but with you?\u201d Daisy demanded impatiently. \u201cNow, call the man before I get really mad.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Lesley reached for the phone. She prayed she was doing the right thing. After wrestling all night with the decision, she got up and tearfully called Daisy, sobbing out her sorry tale. Daisy, who was already late for her classes, had listened intently. She seemed to know exactly what Lesley should do. She made it all sound so straightforward, so easy. It should\u2019ve been, but it wasn\u2019t, even now with the phone pressed to her ear.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase, it\u2019s Lesley. I\u2019m sorry to phone so early, but I thought you\u2019d want to know as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>There was a slight hesitation before he spoke. \u201cIt would simplify matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...want to go through with the marriage this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>He had to ask. Why couldn\u2019t he just have left it alone? \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Her voice shook as if she was on the verge of tears.</p><p>Daisy took the receiver from her hand. \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing, Chase. Now don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll have her to the church on time.\u201d Whatever Chase said made Daisy laugh. After a couple of minutes, she replaced the receiver. \u201cYou going to make it through the day without changing your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t have any choice, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. If you stand that man up at the altar, I\u2019m going to murder you and marry him myself. The boys would be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Lesley laughed. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see you back here at four. Don\u2019t be late, Daisy, I\u2019m going to need all the support I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Tony calls you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably will, but fortunately I don\u2019t plan on being here. I\u2019ve got a million things to do and I don\u2019t intend to waste a single moment on Tony Field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Daisy beamed her a bright smile and was out the door a moment later.</p><p>Being nervous came as a surprise to Chase. He\u2019d expected to stand before the preacher he\u2019d hired and repeat his vows without a qualm. He had no doubts, no regrets about making Lesley his bride. Just nerves.</p><p>When she and her close friends, including Daisy and sons, arrived at the hotel for the simple wedding ceremony, Chase hadn\u2019t been able to take his eyes off her. He\u2019d never seen a more beautiful woman. He\u2019d rented a tuxedo, although what had prompted that was beyond his comprehension. The tie felt like it was strangling him and the cummerbund reminded him of the time he\u2019d broken his ribs. He knew Lesley would be pleased, though, and when she smiled at him, he was glad he\u2019d made the effort.</p><p>She\u2019d chosen a soft peach dress, overlaid with white lace. She didn\u2019t wear a veil but a pretty pearl headpiece with white silk flowers. The bouquet of white baby roses was clutched in her hands.</p><p>Lesley had tried to call her mother and stepfather, wherever they were, but their cell phone wasn\u2019t on. Apparently that was typical. Chase reassured her again that they\u2019d tell them later, perhaps arrange to see them in the fall. He, too, was without family\u2014he\u2019d told her only that his parents had died, nothing more\u2014so their guests were mostly Lesley\u2019s friends.</p><p>It was all rather informal. She introduced Chase to Lori and Jo Ann and a number of others, and he shook hands with each one. Minutes later, it was time for the ceremony.</p><p>They stood with everyone gathered around them in the middle of the room. The minister said a few words about marriage and its significance, then asked them to repeat their vows.</p><p>It was at that moment that Chase fully comprehended what was happening between Lesley and him. He pledged before God that he would love Lesley and meet her needs, both physical and emotional.</p><p>The responsibility weighed on his mind. He\u2019d given Lesley time to weigh the decision before agreeing to be his bride, never dreaming he needed to think about it, as well.</p><p>He looked at Lesley as she said her vows. Her steady gaze met his and her voice was strong and clear, without hesitation. When it came time, he slipped the gold band on her finger. He noticed tears brightening her eyes, but her smile reassured him. He could only hope these were tears of joy and not regret.</p><p>When he received permission to kiss his bride, Chase gently took her in his arms and kissed her. With everyone watching them, he made sure it was a short but intense kiss. A kiss that went on longer than he\u2019d planned...</p><p>Lesley\u2019s eyes were laughing when they broke apart. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that later, Chase Goodman,\u201d she promised in a fervent whisper.</p><p>Chase could hardly wait.</p><p>There was enough food to feed twice as many people as their fifty or so guests. He wasn\u2019t sure how many would be there, so he\u2019d had the hotel staff handle everything. Lesley had given him the names of her friends and he\u2019d invited several people, as well, including Sandra and her husband.</p><p>Becky Bright was there, along with her cameraman. Lesley was wonderful during the interview, answering Becky\u2019s questions without a hint of nervousness. He suspected it was because of her training as a teacher. Personally he was grateful she\u2019d dealt with the reporter because he was at a loss for words.</p><p>He\u2019d considered the ceremony itself a mere formality, something that was necessary, a legal requirement, and that was all.</p><p>Now he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>The vows had gotten to him. He hadn\u2019t truly taken the seriousness of his commitment to heart until he realized that these promises were more, much more, than a few mumbled words. They were vows, a soul-deep contract made between Lesley and himself. A contract that affected every single part of his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a more beautiful bride,\u201d he told her while they were going through the buffet line. They hadn\u2019t had a moment alone all evening. His heart was crammed full with all the things he wanted to say to her, and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a handsomer groom,\u201d she whispered back and when she looked at him, her eyes softened.</p><p>Chase filled his plate. \u201cI meant what I said.\u201d He knew that sounded melodramatic and a little trite, but he couldn\u2019t keep it to himself any longer.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Lesley added a cherry tomato to her plate.</p> <p>\u201cThe vows. I wasn\u2019t just repeating a bunch of meaningless phrases, I meant them, Lesley. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to be the right kind of husband to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him, didn\u2019t move, and he wondered, briefly, if he\u2019d frightened her with his intensity, or perhaps shocked her. \u201cLesley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered brokenly, staring down at the bowl of pasta salad.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you that.\u201d She was suffering from pangs of guilt, he reasoned. The ceremony obviously hadn\u2019t affected her the way it had him.</p><p>\u201cNo... Oh, Chase, that was the most beautiful thing you could\u2019ve said.\u201d She raised her eyes to his and he saw she was struggling to hold back tears. \u201cI meant it, too, every word. I\u2019m eager to show you how good a wife I intend to be.\u201d</p> <p>Until the moment Lesley had walked into the hotel that afternoon, Chase wasn\u2019t entirely convinced she\u2019d show up for the wedding. All day he\u2019d tried to brace himself in case she didn\u2019t. Now she was his wife, and there was no turning back for either of them.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going for your honeymoon?\u201d Daisy asked, filling her plate on the opposite side of the buffet table. \u201cI meant to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d Chase answered. He hadn\u2019t said anything to Lesley, wanting to surprise her. That didn\u2019t seem important now.</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d she repeated. \u201cOh, Chase, what a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine you\u2019re going to do much sight seeing, though,\u201d Daisy added with a suggestive chuckle.</p><p>\u201cDaisy!\u201d Lesley said as she blushed becomingly.</p> <p>Their honeymoon. The words floated through his mind. Not knowing if Lesley would even be there for the wedding, he\u2019d put off all thoughts as to what would follow.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to make love with Lesley almost from the moment they\u2019d met. But he was determined not to enter into the physical side of their relationship until they were both prepared to deal with it. To accept the emotional repercussions of that aspect of their lives\u2014of their life together. He didn\u2019t know about Lesley, but he was more than ready. He only hoped she was, too.</p><p>Their guests didn\u2019t seem in any hurry to leave. The champagne flowed freely, but Chase drank only a small amount. He needed a clear head.</p><p>They left, under a spray of rice and birdseed. He placed Lesley\u2019s suitcase in the back of his rental car and ran around to the front of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked, smiling over at his wife. His wife. The word still felt awkward in his mind. Awkward, but very right. He\u2019d accomplished what he\u2019d set out to do. He\u2019d gotten himself a bride.</p><p>The one bride he\u2019d wanted above all.</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cThe honeymoon suite,\u201d Lesley whispered as the bellman carried in their suitcases. \u201cYou booked us the honeymoon suite?\u201d</p> <p>Chase gave the bellman a generous tip and let him out the door. \u201cWhy are you so surprised? We\u2019re on our honeymoon, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, oh, I don\u2019t know...\u201d She walked around the room and ran her hand over the plush bedspread on the king-size bed. \u201cOh, Chase, look,\u201d she said after she\u2019d walked into the bathroom. \u201cThe tub\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine wasting all that water,\u201d he teased, enjoying her excitement.</p><p>\u201cThey left champagne and chocolates, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll file a complaint. How are any two people supposed to survive on that? A man needs real food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always room service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Chase, this is so lovely.\u201d She seemed shy about touching him, stopping just short of his arms. He was a bit embarrassed himself, although he didn\u2019t understand why. Lesley was his wife and he was her husband.</p><p>\u201cI...I think I\u2019ll unpack,\u201d she said, reaching for her suitcase.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d There was definitely something wrong with him. Lesley should be in his arms by now, begging him to make love to her. Instead, they were standing back to back emptying their suitcases, as though they had every intention of wearing all those clothes.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked, just to make conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo, but if you want to order something, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d No, he wasn\u2019t. His temperature was rising by the minute.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take a bath,\u201d she said next.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d He realized after he spoke that she might find his enthusiasm a bit insulting, but by the time he thought to say something she was in the bathroom.</p><p>The sound of running water filled the suite. He noted that she\u2019d left the door ajar, but he wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d done it on purpose.</p><p>Focusing his attention on unpacking, Chase opened and closed several drawers, but his mind wasn\u2019t on putting his clothes in any order. It was on Lesley in the other room.</p><p>Lesley removing her clothes.</p><p>Lesley stepping naked into the big tub.</p><p>Lesley sighing that soft, womanly sigh of hers as she slipped into the steaming water.</p><p>The image was so powerful that Chase sagged onto the edge of the bed. He didn\u2019t know what was the matter with him. They were married, and he was acting like a choirboy.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to wash your back?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s spirits lifted. That sounded encouraging. He smoothed back his hair and rolled up his sleeves before advancing into the bathroom.</p><p>Lesley was exactly as he\u2019d pictured her. She was lying in the tub, surrounded by frothy bubbles.</p><p>The scent of blooming roses wafted up to him, and her pink toes were perched against the far end. The welcome he saw in her eyes made his heart beat so furiously that for a moment he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cHow\u2019s the water?\u201d he asked, shoving his hands in his pants pockets.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve added a bunch of women\u2019s stuff to that water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen\u2019s stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBubble bath or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d It was driving him slowly insane, but that didn\u2019t bother him nearly as much as the view he had of her body. She raised one knee and the bubbles slid down her leg in a slow, tantalizing pattern.</p><p>Her leg was pink from the steamy water and for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t stop staring at it. For the life of him he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that same leg wrapped around his waist....</p><p>\u201cThe, uh, water looks inviting.\u201d His tongue nearly stuck to the roof of his mouth, he was so excited.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to join me?\u201d</p><p>His heart was doing that crazy pounding again. \u201cYou sure? I mean...\u201d Darned if he knew what he meant. \u201cShould I bring the champagne and chocolates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the champagne. Let\u2019s save the chocolates for later.\u201d</p><p>He nearly stumbled out of the room in his eagerness to get her what she wanted. He opened the bottle and the popping sound echoed like a small explosion. His hands trembled as he poured them each a flute of champagne. He carried them into the other room, then handed her the glass and sipped from his own, badly needing the temporary courage it offered. Then he realized Lesley hadn\u2019t tasted hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re in the bath with me,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was when it occurred to him that he\u2019d need to undress. He did his best not to be self-conscious, but didn\u2019t know how well he succeeded. He wasn\u2019t normally shy, but he\u2019d lived alone for a lot of years and when he undressed there usually wasn\u2019t someone watching his every move.</p><p>He stepped into the tub and she moved forward to make room for him. He eased himself into the hot water, positioning himself behind her. She was slippery in his embrace and he tucked his arms around her waist and brought her up against him. He brushed his mouth over her hair and relaxed, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou feel good,\u201d he whispered. That had to be the understatement of the century.</p><p>Lesley had gone still and so had he. It was as though they\u2019d both lost the need to breathe. He cupped her breasts and she sighed as if this was what she\u2019d been waiting for, as if she wondered what had taken him so long.</p><p>Darned if he knew.</p><p>He smiled, not with amusement, but with male pride and satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like silk,\u201d he whispered, rubbing his hand down her smooth abdomen. She turned her head toward him, inviting his kiss.</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t disappoint her. He bent forward and kissed her slowly, seducing her mouth with his own. Soon he didn\u2019t know who was seducing whom. They were both breathless by the time he lifted his head.</p><p>They kissed again, the urgency of their need centered on their mouths as she buckled beneath him, gasping and moaning.</p><p>Chase broke off the kiss. In one swift motion he stood, taking her with him. Water sloshed over the sides of the tub, but Chase hardly noticed. He carried Lesley to the bed and placed her on it, not caring if they were soaking wet or that they\u2019d left a watery trail.</p><p>When the loving was over, he rested his forehead against hers, his breath uneven. He could find no words to explain what had happened. No experience had ever been this intense. No woman had ever satisfied him so completely or brought him to the point of no return the way Lesley had.</p><p>Whatever was between them, be it commitment or love or something he couldn\u2019t define, it was out of his control.</p><p>Everything with Lesley was beyond his experience. Everything with her was going to be brand-new.</p><p>Butchart Gardens was breathtakingly beautiful. Chase and Lesley spent their first morning as husband and wife walking hand in hand along the meandering paths, over the footbridges and through the secret corners of the gardens. Lesley couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing any place as beautiful, with a profusion of so many varieties of flowers that she soon lost count.</p><p>By the time they stopped for lunch, Lesley was famished. Chase was, too, gauging by the amount of food he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to build my strength up,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Lesley didn\u2019t know she was still capable of blushing, not after the wondrous night they\u2019d spent. She hadn\u2019t known it was possible for any two people to make love so fervently or so frequently. Just when she was convinced she\u2019d never survive another burst of pleasure, he\u2019d convince her that she could. And she did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing.\u201d Chase sounded shocked.</p><p>\u201cThank you for calling attention to it,\u201d she chided. \u201cIf one of us is blushing, it should be you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She leaned across the table, not wanting anyone to overhear. \u201cAfter last night,\u201d she whispered heatedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about last night?\u201d His voice boomed like a cannon shot, or so it seemed to Lesley.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, sorry now for having introduced the subject.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. You\u2019d better tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...a superman.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>\u201cChase!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we finish lunch, let\u2019s go back to the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only seen half of the gardens,\u201d she protested, but not too strenuously.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...early.\u201d The excuse was token at best. She couldn\u2019t fool him, nor could she fool herself. She wanted him as badly as he wanted her. It was crazy, outrageous, wonderful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d Chase said with a groan.</p> <p>She gave herself a mental shake. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you can\u2019t wait a minute longer.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes, embarrassed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>He swore under his breath, stood abruptly and slapped some bills down on the table. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came on the tour bus, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get a taxi back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase\u2014\u201d she laughed \u201c\u2014that\u2019ll cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it costs. If we don\u2019t leave now we could be arrested. There are laws against people doing in public what I intend to do with you.\u201d</p> <p>Lesley was sure her face turned five shades of red as they hurried out of Butchart Gardens. They located a taxi, and the second after Chase gave the driver the name of their hotel, he pulled her into his arms. His kiss was wet and wild and thorough. Thorough enough to hold them until they got back to the hotel.</p><p>Chase paid the driver and they raced hand in hand into the hotel and through the lobby, not stopping until they reached their room.</p><p>Chase\u2019s fingers shook when he inserted the key and Lesley\u2019s heart was touched by his eagerness.</p><p>\u201cThis is the most insane thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d she said, trying not to laugh.</p><p>The door swung open and Chase drew her inside, closing the door and backing her against it.</p><p>\u201cI was going to go berserk if I couldn\u2019t touch you the way I wanted,\u201d he whispered, kissing her with a hunger that echoed her own.</p><p>\u201cChase...\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted, only that she wanted.</p><p>Apparently he knew, because he scooped her into his arms and carried her to the bed.</p><p>An hour later, Lesley smiled to herself and buried her face in her husband\u2019s neck. With Chase she\u2019d never be alone again. With Chase she felt whole, complete. Was this an illusion? She wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>But right now she needed the feel of him, needed the reality of this man, this moment. She pressed her hands to his face and with tears she couldn\u2019t explain blurring her vision, she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her, his touch gentle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to us?\u201d she asked, thinking he could help her understand.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this just good sex or is it more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d was his immediate response.</p><p>\u201cDo I love you?\u201d It obviously wasn\u2019t the question he\u2019d expected her to ask, which was fine since it astonished even her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with me?\u201d</p><p>His brow creased as if that required serious consideration. \u201cI know I\u2019ve never felt like this about any woman. What\u2019s happening between us, this physical thing, is as much of a surprise to me as it is you.\u201d He leaned forward and kissed the tip of her nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to marry me,\u201d Chase continued, \u201calthough if this goes on much longer, I may be dead within a year.\u201d</p><p>Lesley laughed and, wrapping her arms around his neck, lifted her head just enough to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pure magic,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>She answered him with a grin of her own. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Chase nuzzled her nose with his. \u201cLet\u2019s not take any chances this time and order room service. It\u2019s ridiculous to pay for meals I never have a chance to eat.\u201d</p><p>After a leisurely lunch, they played tourist for the rest of the day, but didn\u2019t wander far from the hotel. They\u2019d learned their lesson. They had high tea at the Empress Hotel, toured the museum, explored the undersea gardens.</p><p>They crammed as much as they could into the afternoon and returned, exhausted, to their hotel early that evening.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go for dinner?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d Lesley repeated. \u201cI\u2019m still full from lunch. And tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoak in a long, hot bath and take a nap. You kept me up half the night, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bath?\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Despite her exhaustion, Lesley smiled. \u201cLater,\u201d she said and kissed him sweetly. \u201cGive me an hour or two to regroup, okay?\u201d</p><p>His face fell in mock disappointment.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, holding her hand out to him. \u201cYou can nap with me, if you promise to sleep.\u201d She yawned loudly and pulled back the covers. The bath would come later. Right now it would only bring temptation for them both.</p><p>\u201cI hoped we\u2019d be in bed by five o\u2019clock,\u201d Chase muttered, \u201cbut I never thought it would be to sleep. Some honeymoon this is turning out to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome honeymoon,\u201d Lesley agreed, smiling. She laid her head against the thick feather pillow and closed her eyes. Within seconds she could feel herself drift off.</p><p>The phone beside the bed rang, startling her badly. Before she could assimilate what was happening, Chase grabbed the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he answered gruffly. Whoever was calling made him laugh. He placed his hand over the mouthpiece as he handed Lesley the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy?\u201d Lesley said, surprised to hear from her neighbor. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I wouldn\u2019t be calling you at the hotel if it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You weren\u2019t interrupting anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d Chase said loudly enough to be heard at the other end.</p><p>\u201cListen, Lesley, this isn\u2019t my idea of a fun call, but I figured you\u2019d better know. Tony\u2019s been pestering me for information about you and Chase.\u201d</p><p>Lesley sat up in bed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him anything, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the movers arrived while he was here and I saw him talking to the driver. He might\u2019ve been able to get information out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d she said, gnawing on her lower lip. \u201cThose men are professionals. They know better than to give out information about their clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat segment about you and Chase on television tonight didn\u2019t help. Tony phoned two seconds after the piece aired.\u201d</p><p>Lesley groaned. She\u2019d forgotten about that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDaisy didn\u2019t call for no reason,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later,\u201d she said, although it wasn\u2019t a task she relished.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tony, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he grumbled, but he wasn\u2019t happy and didn\u2019t bother to disguise it. He climbed out of bed and reached for his clothes, dressing with an urgency she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m back,\u201d she told Daisy.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s looking to make trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so worried,\u201d Daisy muttered. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like he could do anything. You\u2019re already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you think he\u2019s going to do?\u201d</p><p>She noticed Daisy\u2019s hesitation. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I wanted to warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Lesley said, genuinely grateful. Tony seemed light-years away. Only a couple of days earlier she\u2019d been convinced she loved him. That wasn\u2019t true anymore. Any feeling she still had was a memory, a ghost of the love she\u2019d once felt.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Daisy said, her voice dipping suggestively. \u201cHow\u2019s the honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>Lesley closed her eyes and sagged against the velvet headboard. \u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two having fun with each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant sightseeing and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you trying to be coy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you must know, we\u2019re having a very good time. There\u2014are you satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. I\u2019ve got to tell you, Lesley, I could be jealous. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been with a man, I feel like a virgin all over again.\u201d</p><p>Lesley laughed. \u201cIf Tony gives you any more trouble, let me know and I\u2019ll get a restraining order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Daisy sounded relieved.</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Chase stood on the other side of the room, his back to her. Lesley watched him for a moment and said to her neighbor, \u201cListen, we\u2019ll talk as soon as we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow, but we\u2019ll be flying up to Alaska almost immediately. You have my cell number. Keep in touch, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Daisy promised and ended the conversation.</p><p>Lesley replaced the receiver. Her hand still on the phone, she mentally composed what she was going to say to Chase. \u201cSo it was Tony,\u201d he commented, turning back to her.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s making a pest of himself.\u201d Chase\u2019s hands were in his pockets and he looked unsure. Of her and their marriage. It seemed a bit soon to be having doubts, and she said as much.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I married you.\u201d Her words didn\u2019t seem to reassure him. He stood there apparently deep in thought.</p><p>Kneeling on the bed, Lesley murmured, \u201cI feel like having those chocolates and a hot bath. How about you?\u201d</p><p>That got his attention. His eyes locked with hers and she started laughing. \u201cCome here,\u201d she said, holding her arms out to Chase. \u201cIt\u2019s time you understood that neither of us has anything to fear from Tony. I\u2019ve made my decision and chosen to be your wife. A jealous ex-fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>Chase remained where he was, as if he didn\u2019t quite believe her.</p><p>Lesley got up from the bed and was halfway across the room before she realized she was nearly naked. It didn\u2019t bother her\u2014she was proud of her body. Chase had made her feel that way. She was focused on the man in front of her, not on herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rising onto her toes, she kissed him lightly.</p><p>\u201cLesley...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d</p><p>He stood perfectly still, and with his eyes closed, allowed her to continue kissing him. When she was satisfied with his lips, she kissed the underside of his jaw, moving her mouth down his neck, then up to his ear. After what seemed like the longest moment of her life, he threaded his fingers through her hair and raised her face to his.</p> <p>\u201cI want you to be very sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI am sure.\u201d</p><p>He looked into her eyes. \u201cA hot bath and chocolate sounds like an excellent suggestion,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lesley smiled contentedly. Marriage was far better than she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Lesley asked. They\u2019d left Victoria that afternoon and had traveled down the Kitsap Peninsula, boarding the ferry from Bremerton to Seattle. Lesley had assumed they\u2019d be heading directly back to her house. If so, Chase was taking an interesting route.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want you to see.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch and swallowed her impatience. They\u2019d gotten a later start than they\u2019d expected. Their morning had begun with a hot bath. At least the water had initially been hot, but by the time they finished, it had cooled considerably. Because their schedule was off, they\u2019d been forced to wait for a later ferry.</p><p>Their flight to Alaska was leaving early the next morning, and Lesley had a hundred details she needed to take care of before then.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Chase said, pulling into an asphalt parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d She didn\u2019t see anything.</p><p>\u201cThe billboard,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Looking up, she saw the original billboard Chase had used to advertise for a wife. The sign had been changed and now read, in huge black letters, THANK YOU, LESLEY, FOR SHARING MY LIFE.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked, waiting for her to respond.</p><p>\u201cI... Oh, Chase, that\u2019s so sweet and so romantic. I think I\u2019m going to cry.\u201d She was struggling to hold back the tears.</p><p>\u201cI want to make you happy, Lesley, for the rest of our lives.\u201d He brought her into his arms and kissed her.</p><p>Happiness frightened her. Every time she was truly content, truly at peace, something would go wrong, her happiness ruined. The first time it happened, she was a child. A six-year-old. She\u2019d never been happier than the week before they were supposed to leave for Disneyland. Not only had the trip been canceled, but she\u2019d lost her father.</p><p>She\u2019d been excited about her wedding to Tony, planning the event, shopping for her wedding dress, choosing her clothes. But he\u2019d broken their engagement, plunging her into depression and then numbness.</p><p>Lesley was happy now, and she couldn\u2019t help wondering what it would cost her this time.</p><p>Ten</p> <p>Lesley\u2019s hand reached for Chase\u2019s as the airplane circled Fairbanks, Alaska, before descending. She\u2019d found the view of Alaska\u2019s Mount McKinley, in Denali National Park, awe-inspiring. After living in Seattle, between the Cascade and Olympic mountain ranges, she thought being impressed by Denali was saying something. The tallest peak in North America rose from the land far below, crowned by a halo of clouds.</p><p>\u201cIs it all so beautiful?\u201d she asked as the plane made its final approach.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s beauty in every part of Alaska,\u201d Chase told her, \u201cbut some of it\u2019s more difficult to see. More subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to love Twin Creeks,\u201d she said, knowing it would be impossible not to, if the area was anything like the landscape she\u2019d seen from the plane.</p><p>Chase\u2019s fingers tightened around hers. \u201cI hope you do.\u201d</p><p>They landed and were met by a tall, burly man with a beard so thick it hid most of his face. Beneath his wool cap, she caught a glimpse of twinkling blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cPete Stone,\u201d Chase said casually, placing his arm around Lesley\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThis is Lesley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou done it? You actually done it?\u201d Pete asked, briefly removing his wool cap and scratching his head. His hair was shoulder-length and as thick as his beard. \u201cYou got yourself a wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Lesley said formally, holding out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Lesley Goodman.\u201d Pete ignored her proffered hand and reached for her instead, hauling her against him and hugging her so tightly, he lifted her three feet off the ground. Lesley wasn\u2019t offended so much as surprised. She cast a pleading glance at her husband, who didn\u2019t look any too pleased with this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d Chase said stiffly. \u201cPut her down. Lesley\u2019s not accustomed to being manhandled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jealous?\u201d Pete said, slowly releasing her. His grin would\u2019ve been impossible to see beneath the mask of his beard, but his eyes sparkled with delight. \u201cThat tells me you care about this little slip of a girl.\u201d</p><p>Being nearly six feet tall, Lesley didn\u2019t think of herself as a little slip of anything. She couldn\u2019t help liking Pete despite his bear-hugging enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cOf course I care about her. I married her, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure did, but then you said you was coming back with a wife if you had to marry yourself up with a polecat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesley\u2019s no polecat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got eyes in my head,\u201d Pete said. \u201cI can see that for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, is the plane ready or not?\u201d Chase asked, picking up two of their suitcases. He didn\u2019t look at Lesley and she sensed that Chase was annoyed by Pete\u2019s remark about his determination to find a wife. She hadn\u2019t accepted his proposal under any misconception. If she\u2019d turned him down, he would\u2019ve found someone else. She\u2019d known that from the first.</p><p>Pete grabbed the two additional pieces of luggage and winked at Lesley. \u201cThe plane\u2019s been ready since yesterday. I flew down a day early and raised some heck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Chase muttered. He turned to Lesley. \u201cDo you mind leaving right away?\u201d he asked as they approached the four-passenger plane.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him with a smile. She was eager to reach her new home, and she knew Chase was just as eager to get back. It would\u2019ve been nice to spend some time in Fairbanks, but they\u2019d have plenty of opportunity for that later.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Pete said to Chase after they\u2019d boarded the plane, \u201care you going to tell me how you did it?\u201d The two men occupied the front seats, with Chase as the pilot, while Lesley sat in the back.</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot someone as beautiful as Lesley to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Chase was preoccupied, flipping a series of switches. \u201cI asked her.\u201d</p><p>Lesley was mildly insulted that he\u2019d condensed the story of their courtship into a simple three-word sentence.</p><p>\u201cThat was all it took?\u201d Pete seemed astounded. He twisted around and looked at Lesley. \u201cYou got any single friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy,\u201d she answered automatically, already missing her neighbor.</p><p>\u201cDaisy,\u201d Pete repeated as if the sound of her name conjured up the image of a movie star. \u201cI bet she\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s divorced with two boys,\u201d Chase said, \u201cand she recently started dating a guy she works with, so don\u2019t get your mind set on her.\u201d</p><p>Pete was quiet for a few minutes; silence was a rare commodity with this man, Lesley suspected. \u201cI figured you\u2019d get yourself a woman with a couple kids, liking the little rascals the way you do,\u201d he told Chase.</p><p>\u201cLesley suits me just fine.\u201d Chase reached for the small hand mike and spoke with the air traffic controller, awaiting his instructions. Within minutes they were in the air.</p><p>Chase hadn\u2019t told her he was a pilot; Lesley was impressed but not surprised. There was something so capable about him. So skilled and confident. She guessed that he was the kind of man who\u2019d be equal to any challenge, who could solve any problem. Maybe that was typical of Alaskans.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it be dark by the time we arrive?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Pete laughed as if she\u2019d told a good joke.</p><p>\u201cThe sun\u2019s out until midnight this time of year,\u201d Chase explained. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>Pete twisted around again. \u201cDid Chase tell you much about Twin Creeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d Very little, she realized with a start. All she knew was that Twin Creeks was near the pipeline and that Chase was employed by one of the major oil companies. The town was small, but there weren\u2019t any exceptionally large cities in Alaska. The population of Fairbanks, according to some information she\u2019d read on the plane, was less than forty thousand.</p><p>\u201cYou tell her about the mosquitoes?\u201d Pete asked Chase, his voice low and conspiratorial.</p><p>\u201cMosquitoes?\u201d Lesley repeated. She\u2019d considered them more of a tropical pest. There were plenty in the Seattle area, but the air was moist and vegetation abundant. She\u2019d never thought there\u2019d be mosquitoes in the Arctic.</p><p>\u201cMosquitoes are the Alaska state bird,\u201d Pete teased, smiling broadly. \u201cYou ain\u2019t never seen \u2019em as big as we get \u2019em. But don\u2019t worry, they only stick around in June and July. Otherwise they leave us be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of repellant at the cabin,\u201d Chase assured her, frowning.</p><p>\u201cTwin Creeks is near the Gates of the Arctic wilderness park. Chase told you that, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Lesley couldn\u2019t remember if he had or not.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the base of the Brooks range, which is part of the Endicott mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does it take to drive to Fairbanks?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Pete admitted, rubbing his beard as he considered her question. \u201cI\u2019ve always flown. We don\u2019t have a road that\u2019s open year-round, so not many folks drive that way. Mostly we fly. Folks in Twin Creeks mainly rely on planes for transportation. It\u2019s easier that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...see.\u201d Lesley was beginning to do just that. Twin Creeks wasn\u2019t a thriving community as she\u2019d originally assumed. It was a station town with probably a handful of people. All right, she could live with that. She could adjust her thinking.</p><p>\u201cTwin Creeks is on the edge of the Arctic wilderness,\u201d Chase said absently, responding to Pete\u2019s earlier remark about the town\u2019s location.</p><p>It was difficult to read his tone, but Lesley heard something she hadn\u2019t before. A hesitation, a reluctance, as if he feared that once she learned the truth about living in Alaska, she\u2019d regret having married him. But she didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t possible, not anymore. Their honeymoon had seen to that.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the wildlife?\u201d she asked, curious now.</p><p>\u201cWe got everything you can imagine,\u201d Pete answered enthusiastically. \u201cThere\u2019s caribou, Dall sheep, bears\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBears?\u201d She refused to listen beyond that.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a nuisance if you ask me,\u201d Pete continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why most of us have caches so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a cache?\u201d Lesley interrupted.</p><p>\u201cA cache,\u201d he repeated as if he was sure she must know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a small log cabin built on stilts,\u201d Chase explained. \u201cIt\u2019s spelled c-a-c-h-e, but pronounced cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBears and the like can\u2019t climb ladders,\u201d Pete added. \u201cBut they do climb poles, so we wrap tin around the beams to keep \u2019em off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you store there that the bears find so attractive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a primitive freezer for meat in the winter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI keep extra fuel and bedding in mine,\u201d Pete said. \u201cAnd anything else I don\u2019t want the wildlife gettin\u2019. You\u2019ve got to be careful what you put outside your door, but Chase will tell you all about that, so don\u2019t worry. We haven\u2019t lost anyone to bears in two, three years now.\u201d He laughed, and Lesley didn\u2019t know if he was teasing or not.</p><p>She swallowed uncomfortably and pushed the thought out of her mind. \u201cI think moose are interesting creatures,\u201d she said conversationally, remembering Lori\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cWe get \u2019em every now and then, but not often.\u201d Once more it was Pete who answered.</p><p>By the time they landed, ninety minutes later, Lesley was both exhausted and worried. After they\u2019d parked the plane in a hangar and unloaded their luggage, Pete drove them to a cabin nestled in a valley of alder, willow and birch trees. Lesley didn\u2019t see any other cabins along the way, but then she wasn\u2019t expecting Chase to live on a suburban street. Neighbors would have been welcome, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any within walking distance.</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d Pete said, delivering two of the suitcases to the porch. He left immediately, after slapping Chase on the back and making a comment Lesley couldn\u2019t hear. She figured Pete was issuing some unsolicited marital advice.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re meeting him in the morning?\u201d Lesley asked. Chase had told her he needed to be back at work. But she\u2019d assumed he wouldn\u2019t have to go in right away, that he\u2019d be able to recover from his travels first.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s picking me up,\u201d Chase said. \u201cI have to check in. I won\u2019t stay long, I promise.\u201d They were standing on the porch and Lesley was eager to get a look at her new home. The outside didn\u2019t really tell her much. She\u2019d seen vacation homes that were larger than this.</p><p>Chase unlocked the door and turned to her, sweeping her off her feet as if she weighed no more than the suitcase. His actions took her by surprise and she gasped with pleasure when she realized he was following tradition by carrying her over the threshold.</p><p>Lesley closed her eyes and reveled in the splendor of being in his arms. They kissed briefly, then Chase carried her into the bedroom and they sat on the edge of the bed together.</p><p>\u201cThis has been the longest day of my life,\u201d Lesley said with a yawn. \u201cI could kill for a hot bath and room service, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d stay awake long enough for either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of having you in this bed with me,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p> <p>Lesley cupped his face and tenderly kissed his lips. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll help you bring in the luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Chase countered. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>Lesley didn\u2019t object. While Chase dealt with their suitcases, she could explore their home. The bedroom was cozy and masculine-looking. The walls were made of a light wood\u2014pine, she guessed\u2014with a double closet that had two drawers below each door.</p><p>A picture was the only thing on the dresser and Lesley knew in an instant that the couple staring back at her from the brass frame were Chase\u2019s parents. The bed was large, too big for the room, but that didn\u2019t bother her. The floor was wood, too, with several thick, braided throw rugs.</p><p>There was a small guest room across the hall, simply furnished with an iron bedstead and a chest of drawers.</p><p>Moving into the living room, Lesley admired the huge rock fireplace. It took up nearly all of one wall. He had a television, DVD player and music system. She\u2019d known there was electricity; she\u2019d made a point of asking.</p><p>The furniture was homey and inviting. A recliner and an overstuffed sofa, plus a rocking chair. Chase loved books, if the overflowing bookcases were any indication. Between two of them stood a rough-hewn desk that held a laptop computer.</p><p>A microwave caught her eye from the kitchen counter, which was a faded red linoleum, and she moved in that direction. The huge refrigerator and freezer stood side by side and looked new, dominating one wall. Everything else, including the dishwasher and stove, were ancient-looking. She\u2019d make the best of it, Lesley decided, but she was putting her word in early. The kitchen was often the heart of a home and she intended to make theirs as modern and comfortable as possible. From the looks of it, she had her work cut out for her.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Chase asked from behind her. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she said, turning and hugging him around the middle, \u201cthat I could get used to living here with you.\u201d</p><p>Chase sighed as if she\u2019d just removed a giant weight from his shoulders. \u201cGood. I realized as soon as I saw Pete that I hadn\u2019t really prepared you for Twin Creeks. It\u2019s not what you\u2019d call a thriving metropolis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed. Are there neighbors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d he answered cryptically. He held her close, and she couldn\u2019t read his expression.</p><p>\u201cNearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. So, are you ready for bed?\u201d he asked, changing the subject, but not smoothly enough for her not to notice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019ll have a bath, after all.\u201d She planned to soak out the stiffness of all those hours cooped up inside planes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one problem,\u201d he said, sounding chagrined. \u201cI don\u2019t have a tub.\u201d</p><p>Lesley stared at him. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only a shower. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever needed. At some point we can install a bathtub, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll manage.\u201d A shower instead of a bath was a minor inconvenience. She\u2019d adjust.</p><p>Chase needed to make a couple of calls and while he was busy, Lesley showered and readied for bed. Her husband of four days undressed, showered and climbed into bed with her.</p><p>The sheets were cold and instinctively Lesley nestled close to Chase. He brought her into the warm alcove of his arms, gently kissing her hair.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Lesley whispered when he turned off the light.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d The light was off, but the room was still bright. She\u2019d adjust to sunlight in the middle of the night, too, Lesley reasoned. But it now seemed that she was going to have to make more adjustments than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>She rolled onto her side and positioned the pillow to cradle her head. She was too tired to care, too tired to do anything but sleep.</p><p>Chase, however, had other ideas....</p><p>Lesley smiled softly to herself as he whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She slipped onto her back and lifted her arms to him in welcome. She did know what he wanted. And tired or not, she wanted the same thing.</p><p>Chase was awakened by the alarm. His eyes burned and he felt as if he were fighting his way out of a fog before he realized what he needed to do to end the irritating noise.</p><p>Lesley didn\u2019t so much as stir. He was pleased that the buzzer hadn\u2019t woken her. He\u2019d like nothing better than to stay in bed and wake his wife and linger there with her.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t possible, though. Not this morning. There\u2019d be plenty of other mornings when they could. He looked forward to those times with pleasure.</p><p>Chase slipped out of bed and reached for his jeans and shirt. Wandering into the bathroom, he splashed cold water onto his face in a desperate effort to wake up. He\u2019d report in to work, do what needed to be done and leave again. It shouldn\u2019t take more than thirty minutes, an hour at the most. There was a chance he\u2019d be home before Lesley even woke up.</p><p>He smiled the whole time he made himself a cup of coffee. He sat in the recliner and laced his boots, put on a light jacket and let himself out the door.</p><p>Pete was just pulling into his yard when Chase walked down the two front steps. He sipped from his coffee in its travel mug and walked toward his friend.</p><p>\u201cTrouble,\u201d Pete greeted him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to take long, is it?\u201d Chase knew the answer to that already. Nothing was ever easy around the pump station.</p><p>\u201cI gotta tell you,\u201d Pete said to him good-naturedly, \u201cyour arrival back couldn\u2019t have been more timely.\u201d</p><p>Chase released a four-letter word beneath his breath. He\u2019d wait an hour or so, call Lesley and explain. This certainly wasn\u2019t the way he wanted their lives together to begin, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. Too bad she\u2019d learn the truth so soon.</p><p>Lesley woke to blazing sunshine. That was how she\u2019d gone to sleep, too. She turned her head toward Chase, surprised to find the other half of the bed empty. Swallowing her disappointment, she tossed aside the covers and sat on the edge of the mattress.</p><p>Chase had parked their suitcases by the bedroom door. Lesley decided to unpack first, and by the time she was through, she hoped Chase would be back.</p><p>She dressed, then looked in the cupboard for something to eat. As soon as Chase returned, they\u2019d need to do some grocery shopping. Since he\u2019d been gone for several weeks, they needed to restock the essentials.</p><p>The phone rang while she was munching on dry cereal.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered enthusiastically, knowing it was likely to be Chase; she was right.</p><p>\u201cLesley, I\u2019ve run into some problems here at the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you think you can manage without me for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can send Pete if you\u2019d rather not be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, and I certainly don\u2019t need a baby-sitter.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cDon\u2019t go wandering off by yourself, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. With bears and wolves roaming around, I won\u2019t be taking any strolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this,\u201d he said regretfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase, stop worrying, I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just answer one thing. We need groceries. Would you mind if I took your truck and drove into town and picked up a few items?\u201d She eyed her bowl of cereal. \u201cWe need milk, eggs and so on.\u201d</p><p>She heard him curse under his breath. \u201cGroceries. I didn\u2019t think of that. Hold off, would you, for a little while? I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She was lonely for him already, but determined to be a helpmate and not a problem.</p><p>Another hour passed and she\u2019d completely reorganized their bedroom. She consolidated the things in Chase\u2019s dresser to make room for hers and hung what she could in his cramped closet. When Chase had a few minutes to spare, she needed him to weed out anything he didn\u2019t need. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound of an approaching car was a welcome distraction. Hoping it was Chase, she hurried onto the front porch\u2014to see Pete driving toward the house in his four-wheel-drive vehicle.</p><p>\u201cHowdy,\u201d he called, waving as he climbed out of the truck. \u201cChase sent me to check up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had me pick up a few things on the way.\u201d He reached inside the cab and lifted out two bags of groceries and carried them into the house.</p> <p>\u201cI could\u2019ve gone myself.\u201d She was disappointed that Chase didn\u2019t trust her enough to find her way around. Just how lost could she get?</p><p>\u201cChase wanted to introduce you around town himself,\u201d Pete explained. He seemed to have read her thoughts. He set the bags on the kitchen counter and Lesley investigated their contents. For a bachelor, Pete had done a good job.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Chase\u2019s friend responded, helping himself to a cup of coffee. \u201cChase took care of it. He\u2019s got an account at the store and they bill him monthly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...quaint.\u201d</p> <p>Pete added two teaspoons of sugar, stirring vigorously. \u201cChase said you like to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she responded. Since he didn\u2019t show any signs of leaving, she poured herself a cup of coffee and joined him at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of deer meat in the freezer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never cooked deer before? What about caribou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one.\u201d Didn\u2019t anyone dine on good old-fashioned beef in Alaska?</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It cooks up like beef and doesn\u2019t taste all that different. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Lesley appreciated his confidence even if she didn\u2019t share it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Pete said, relaxing in his chair, hands encircling the mug, \u201cwhat do you think of the cabin?\u201d</p><p>Lesley wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. It was certainly livable, but nothing like she\u2019d expected. However, as she\u2019d said to herself countless times, she\u2019d adjust. \u201cIt\u2019s homey,\u201d she said, trying to be diplomatic about it.</p><p>\u201cChase bought it \u2019specially for you.\u201d</p><p>Lesley lowered her eyes. That couldn\u2019t possibly be true. He hadn\u2019t known her long enough to have chosen this cabin for her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only been living here a few months,\u201d Pete went on. \u201cHe decided back in March that he wasn\u2019t going through another winter without a wife, so he started getting ready for one. The first thing he did was buy this place and move off the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live at the station?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. I bought myself a cabin, too, year or so ago.</p><p>\u201cChase has lots of plans to remodel, but he wanted to wait until he found the right woman so they could plan the changes together.\u201d</p><p>Lesley looked around, the ideas already beginning to form. If they knocked out the wall between the living room and kitchen, they could get rid of the cramped feeling.</p><p>\u201cChase did all right for himself,\u201d Pete said, sounding proud of his friend. \u201cI gotta tell you, I laughed when he told me he was going to Seattle and bringing himself back a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he marry someone from around here?\u201d Lesley asked. She already knew the answer but wanted to see what he\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, there aren\u2019t any available women in Twin Creeks. He might\u2019ve met a woman in Fairbanks\u2014used to go out with a couple different ones\u2014but he figured his chances were better in Seattle. And he was right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he did go to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems pleased about it. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen Chase smile in a year, ever since his father died. He took it hard, you know.\u201d</p><p>Lesley pretended she did. Although she\u2019d told him about her own parents, Chase hadn\u2019t said much about his, just that they were both dead.</p><p>\u201cSo soon after his mother\u2014that darn near killed him. He\u2019s all alone now, no brothers or sisters, and he needed someone to belong to the way we all do. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s ever said that, but it\u2019s the reason he was so keen on marryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Lesley asked. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did once, about ten years back, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d Pain flickered in his eyes. \u201cPamela didn\u2019t last the winter. I hope for Chase\u2019s sake you\u2019re different. He\u2019s already crazy about you, and if you left him, it\u2019d probably break his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d It would take a lot more than a harsh winter to change her mind about her commitment to Chase. She\u2019d never taken duty lightly and she\u2019d pledged before her friends and God to stand by Chase as his wife, his lover, his partner.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Pete\u2019s twinkling blue eyes were back.</p><p>\u201cChase sent you out to babysit me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Pete laughed. \u201cNot exactly. He was a little afraid you were gonna get curious and do some exploring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after the conversation we had about the bears.\u201d Lesley shuddered dramatically.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t gonna hurt you. You leave \u2019em alone and they\u2019ll leave you alone. You might want to ask Chase to take you to the dump and that way you\u2019ll get to see \u2019em firsthand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hang around the dump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure do, sorting through the garbage lookin\u2019 for goodies. We\u2019ve tried plenty of ways to keep \u2019em away, but nothing seems to work and we finally gave up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lesley wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cHas anyone thought to bury the garbage?\u201d The solution seemed simple to her.</p><p>\u201cObviously you\u2019ve never tried to dig tundra. It\u2019s like cement an inch below the surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong at the station?\u201d Lesley asked, looking at her watch. It was well past noon.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t rightly say, but whatever it is will have to be fixed before Chase can come home. Trust me, he isn\u2019t any happier about this than you. Chase isn\u2019t normally a swearing man, but he was cursin\u2019 a blue streak this morning. He\u2019ll give you a call the minute he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see the town,\u201d Lesley said. She was eager to meet the other women and become a part of the community. It was too late in the year to apply for a full-time teaching position, but she could make arrangements to get her certificate and sign up as a substitute.</p><p>\u201cChase will take you around himself,\u201d Pete said again. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right for me to be introducin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighed. \u201cTell me about Twin Creeks, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...there\u2019s not much to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about stores?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe order most everything through the catalog and on the internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, but it\u2019s small.\u201d</p><p>Well, she wasn\u2019t expecting one with a deli and valet parking.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the population of Twin Creeks?\u201d</p><p>Pete wasn\u2019t one who could easily disguise his feelings, and she could see from the way his eyes darted past hers that he\u2019d prefer to avoid answering. \u201cWe\u2019ve had, uh, something of a population boom since the last census.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the official total?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to talk to Chase about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you,\u201d she pressed, growing impatient. \u201cA thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess \u2019n that,\u201d he said, drinking what remained of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cHow many less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA, uh, few hundred less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, five hundred people, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>Lesley pinched her lips together. \u201cJust tell me. I hate guessing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty,\u201d Pete mumbled into the empty mug.</p><p>\u201cAdults?\u201d Her heart felt as if it\u2019d stopped.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s counting everyone, including Mrs. Davis\u2019s cat.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cHow many women live in Twin Creeks?\u201d Lesley demanded.</p><p>\u201cIncluding you?\u201d Pete asked, looking decidedly uncomfortable by this time. He clutched his coffee mug with both hands and sat staring into it, as though he expected the answer to appear there.</p><p>\u201cOf course I mean including me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes a grand total of five then.\u201d He continued to hold on to his mug as if it were the Holy Grail.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me there\u2019re only five women in the entire town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive women within five hundred miles, I suspect, when you get right down to it.\u201d If his face got much closer to the mug, his nose would disappear inside it.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the other women,\u201d Lesley insisted. She was pacing in her agitation. Chase had purposely withheld this information about Twin Creeks from her. Fool that she was, she hadn\u2019t even thought to ask, assuming that when he mentioned the town there actually was one!</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Thelma Davis,\u201d Pete said enthusiastically. \u201cShe\u2019s married to Milton and they\u2019re both in their sixties. Thelma runs the grocery store and she loves to gossip. You\u2019ll get along with her just fine. Gladys Thornton might be kind of a problem, though. She\u2019s a little crabby and not the sociable sort, so most folks just leave her be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone close to my age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather\u2019s twelve,\u201d Pete replied, looking up for the first time. \u201cShe lives with Thelma Davis. I never did understand the connection. Heather isn\u2019t her granddaughter, but they\u2019re related in some way.\u201d</p><p>The woman closest to her in age was a twelve-year-old girl! Lesley\u2019s heart plummeted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like Margaret, though. She\u2019s a real social butterfly. The minute she hears Chase brought himself back a wife, she\u2019ll be by to introduce herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is Margaret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarned if I know. In her fifties, I guess. She doesn\u2019t like to discuss her age and tries to pretend she\u2019s younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d best be heading back,\u201d Pete said, obviously eager to leave. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but would you mind not tellin\u2019 Chase that I was the one who told you? We\u2019ve been friends for a long time and I\u2019d hate for him to take this personally. Me spillin\u2019 the beans to you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any promises.\u201d</p><p>Pete left as if he couldn\u2019t get away fast enough.</p><p>An hour later, Lesley still hadn\u2019t decided what to do, if anything. Chase had misled her, true enough, but she wasn\u2019t convinced it mattered. She probably would\u2019ve married him anyway.</p><p>No wonder he\u2019d been so interested in Seattle\u2019s history and the Mercer brides. Although more than a hundred years had passed since that time, she was doing basically the same thing as those women, moving to a frontier wilderness and marrying a man she barely knew.</p><p>Chase arrived shortly after one o\u2019clock, looking discouraged. Lesley met him at the front door and waited, wondering what to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without a word of greeting, Chase pulled her into his arms and his mouth came down on hers. The familiar taste of him offered comfort and reassurance.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he whispered into her hair, his arms wrapped around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete brought the groceries? Did he get enough of everything?\u201d</p> <p>Lesley nodded. \u201cPlenty.\u201d She broke away from him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know your parents died so recently,\u201d she said. She slipped her arm around him and led him into the kitchen. He had to be hungry so she opened a can of chili and began heating that for him. Keeping her hands occupied helped; she didn\u2019t want him to guess how much Pete\u2019s information had disturbed her.</p><p>Chase stood with his back against the counter. \u201cMy mom passed away less than two years ago. She died of a heart attack. It was sudden and so much of a shock that my father followed last year. They say people don\u2019t die of broken hearts, but I swear that isn\u2019t true. My dad was lost without Mom, and I believe he willed himself to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chase, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was after their deaths that you decided to marry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, watching her closely. \u201cDoes that upset you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her reasons for accepting his proposal hadn\u2019t been exactly flawless. She\u2019d been escaping her love for Tony, running because she feared she was too weak to withstand her attraction to him. Recently those reasons had blurred in her mind, thanks to her doubts and the unexpected happiness she\u2019d found with Chase. They\u2019d bonded much sooner than she\u2019d anticipated. They belonged together now and if it was Tony\u2019s craziness that had brought them to this point, that didn\u2019t matter. What did was her life with Chase.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything at the station?\u201d she asked, placing the steaming bowl of chili on the table and taking out a box of soda crackers.</p><p>\u201cNot good. We\u2019re going to need a part.\u201d He wiped his face with one hand, ignoring the lunch she\u2019d prepared for him. \u201cI hate doing this to you so soon, but it looks like I\u2019ll have to go after the motor myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d She felt as though she\u2019d been punched by the unexpectedness of it. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. A day, possibly two.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the end of the world, but she felt isolated and alone as it was. Without Chase she might as well be off floating on an iceberg.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you have to go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSoon. Listen, sweetheart, I don\u2019t want this any more than you do, but it can\u2019t be avoided.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. He\u2019d never used affectionate terms with her before. He was genuinely worried, as well he should be. He was going to have to introduce her to the people of Twin Creeks sooner or later, and she knew he\u2019d prefer to do that personally, rather than have her discover the truth on her own while he was away. Of course, he had no idea Pete had already \u201cspilled the beans,\u201d as he\u2019d put it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pack an overnight bag for you,\u201d she offered, half waiting for him to stop her right then and explain.</p><p>\u201cLesley.\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself, relieved at the hesitation she heard in his voice. He was going to tell her.</p><p>He moved behind her, wrapped his arms around her waist and slipped his hand inside her light sweater. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to sleep together tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Her voice sounded thick even to her own ears.</p><p>He caught her earlobe between his teeth. \u201cOne night can feel like a very long time,\u201d he said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Brilliant conversation was beyond her when he touched her this way.</p><p>His lips nibbled at her ear and hot sensation spread though her. \u201cI was thinking you might want to give me something to send me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Not that she didn\u2019t know exactly what he meant, but she was annoyed with him because he was so casual about letting her learn the truth.</p><p>\u201cI was in a foul mood all morning,\u201d Chase continued, \u201churrying because I wanted to get home.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWanting to rush home was a new experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the big hurry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly need me to say?\u201d He gave another throaty chuckle. \u201cI can\u2019t get enough of you. We make love and instead of glorying in the satisfaction, I immediately start wondering when I can have you again. Have you put a spell on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d If anything she was the one who\u2019d been enchanted.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cPete will be here in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, turning her head away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d he said with a frown. He held her face gently, brushing the hair from her brow, using his thumbs to wipe away the moisture on her cheeks.</p><p>She gazed up at him, blinking hard, hardly able to see him through her tears. Closing her eyes, she shook her head. \u201cGo, or you\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete\u2019s coming.\u201d She pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll wait. Lesley, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d He reached for an overnight bag, stuffing it with the essentials he\u2019d need as he waited for her response.</p><p>She didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, respond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset because I have to leave you so soon,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, sweetheart, I told you. It can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>She was so furious by this time that she clenched her fists at her sides. \u201cPete told me his wife didn\u2019t last the winter. My sympathy was with Pete because of the weak woman he married. I was making all sorts of judgmental statements in my head, automatically blaming her. I blamed her, without the benefit of the doubt. I considered her weak and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Pete\u2019s marriage have to do with us?\u201d Chase took her by the arms, studying her intensely. A horn honked outside and he cast an irritated look over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said again, freeing herself from his hold. \u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Lesley, not with you feeling like this.\u201d</p><p>She swiped impatiently at her tears. \u201cIt might\u2019ve helped if you\u2019d let me know Twin Creeks is nothing more than...than a hole in the road. There are only five women here. Three of them are years older than I am, the fourth is a twelve-year-old girl and the other one is...me.\u201d</p><p>The honking went on longer and more urgently this time.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she said, squaring her shoulders. \u201cPete\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>Chase wavered, took one step toward the door, but then returned to her. \u201cWill you be here when I get back?\u201d</p><p>She had to think about that for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>He briefly closed his eyes. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d He left without kissing her. Without touching her. And without saying goodbye.</p><p>Lesley ended up throwing out the chili she\u2019d prepared for Chase. She\u2019d never been fond of it herself, although Chase certainly seemed to be if his cupboard was any indication. There was an entire shelf filled with nothing but cans of chili.</p><p>She moved from one room to the next, feeling sorry for herself. She\u2019d let the opportunity to really talk about their situation slip through her fingers.</p><p>Her cheeks burned at the memory. They\u2019d kissed\u2014and then fought. But their physical longing for each other hadn\u2019t diminished.</p><p>Their relationship hadn\u2019t started out that way. This was a new development. One that had taken them both by storm.</p><p>Lesley delighted in how frequently Chase wanted her. Her joy was made complete by the ready response he evoked in her. But their mutual passion meant she not only needed him, she\u2019d become dependent on him. This was the very thing she\u2019d come to fear with Tony\u2014this total giving of herself. Yet it was what she\u2019d done with Chase. He ruled her head and her heart, as thoroughly as Tony once had. No, even more so.</p><p>Was this love? She didn\u2019t know. All she knew was that she couldn\u2019t be without her husband, but didn\u2019t want to lose herself in him.</p><p>Tucking her arms around her waist, she wondered how she\u2019d ever manage to fill up the time without Chase.</p><p>Chase impatiently filled out the registration forms at the Fairbanks hotel. The sooner he finished, the sooner he could call Lesley.</p><p>He wanted to kick himself. He\u2019d known from the moment he arrived home that something was bothering her. He\u2019d seen it in her eyes and in the way she preoccupied herself with making him lunch. He should have settled things between them right then.</p><p>Once he had the key to his room, he glanced longingly at the coffee shop. He hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast and that had been a quick cup of coffee and a blueberry muffin.</p><p>He\u2019d eat later, he decided, after he\u2019d spoken to Lesley, after he\u2019d explained, if that was possible. He couldn\u2019t stand it if she left. She already meant too much to him.</p><p>He let himself into the stark hotel room and after dumping his overnight bag on the bed, sat on the edge of it and reached for the room phone. His hand was eager as he punched out the number.</p><p>She answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cLesley, hello.\u201d Now that he could talk to her, he didn\u2019t know what to say. The need to explain had burned in him the entire flight into Fairbanks, and now he was speechless.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you? Did you have a good flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so. How are you?\u201d He needed to know that before he proceeded.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>The way she said it told him she wasn\u2019t. \u201cI realize it\u2019s probably not a good idea to have this conversation over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d she said, but Chase was afraid that might be too late.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want this misunderstanding to ruin what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do we have, Chase?\u201d she asked, her voice a mere whisper.</p><p>\u201cA marriage,\u201d he returned without hesitation. \u201cA fledgling marriage, which means we need to learn to communicate with each other. I\u2019m going to need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll learn,\u201d she said, and there was a new strength in the words that reassured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you more about Twin Creeks. There always seemed to be other things to discuss and...it didn\u2019t seem all that important.\u201d</p><p>Lesley had no comment.</p><p>Chase pressed his hand to his forehead. \u201cThat isn\u2019t true,\u201d he said in a voice so low, he wondered if she could hear him. \u201cI was afraid that if you did know you\u2019d change your mind about marrying me.\u201d He was taking one of the biggest risks of his life admitting it, but that was what made honesty of such high value. It was often expensive. But Lesley deserved nothing less.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll never be a teaching position for me here, will there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Once more the truth stabbed at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect me to do with my time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want. You can take correspondence courses, teach them if you\u2019d like. Sometime you might want to start a business. The internet\u2019s created a lot of possibilities. Whatever you choose will have my full emotional and monetary support. More than anything else, I want you to be happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat all sounds good in theory, but I don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll work in practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime will show us.\u201d He felt as though he was fighting for his marriage. Either he convinced her here and now that he was serious or he\u2019d lose her. Maybe not now but later, sometime down the road.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bear to think of his life without her. It seemed impossible that she could own his heart after so short a time. \u201cGive us a chance\u2014that\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed in a whisper.</p> <p>Chase scowled at the phone. He didn\u2019t know if what he\u2019d said had made a difference or not. All he could do was hope that it had.</p><p>Chase had told her there was beauty in every part of Alaska but that some of it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious. The beauty around Twin Creeks was dark\u2014that was how she\u2019d describe it. Lesley stood outside his four-wheel-drive vehicle. She couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that life was very fragile in this part of the world.</p><p>The colors she saw thrilled her. Wild splashes of vibrant orange, purple and red covered the grassy and lichened meadows. Pencil-thin waterfalls traced delicate vertical slopes, pooling into a clear lake. The valley wasn\u2019t like the rain forest of western Washington, but it was filled with life.</p><p>A moose grazed in the distance and she wondered if the great beast was plagued by mosquitoes the same way she\u2019d been. Pete wasn\u2019t teasing when he\u2019d warned her. These were the most irritating and persistent variety she\u2019d ever encountered.</p><p>She\u2019d found the keys to Chase\u2019s truck in a kitchen drawer. After less than twenty-four hours on her own, she was going stir-crazy. Chase had been adamant about not exploring on her own, but she didn\u2019t have much choice. If she had to stay inside the cabin one more minute, Lesley was convinced she\u2019d go mad. Her books and other things hadn\u2019t arrived, and she didn\u2019t feel like emailing any of her friends. Not yet.</p> <p>Anyway, it was time she introduced herself to the ladies of Twin Creeks, she\u2019d decided, but she\u2019d gotten sidetracked on her way into town.</p><p>The sight of the moose had captivated her and she\u2019d parked on the side of the road to watch.</p><p>She\u2019d soon become engrossed in the landscape. She lingered there, enjoying the beauty but aware of the dangers. After a while, she climbed back inside the truck and drove to town.</p><p>Twin Creeks itself didn\u2019t amount to much. She\u2019d visited rest stops that were bigger than this town. She counted three buildings\u2014a combination grocery store and gas station, a tavern and a tiny post office. There wasn\u2019t even a church.</p><p>The sidewalks, if she could call them that, were made of wooden boards that linked the three main structures. She saw a handful of houses in the distance.</p><p>Lesley parked and turned off the engine. A face peered out from behind the tattered curtains in the tavern. She pretended she hadn\u2019t noticed and got out of the truck, walking toward the grocery. If she remembered correctly, Thelma Davis ran the store.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d Lesley said to the middle-aged woman behind the counter, determined to be friendly. \u201cI\u2019m Lesley Goodman, Chase\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThelma Davis.\u201d</p><p>Lesley glanced around. Thelma\u2019s business must be prospering. She not only carried food and cleaning supplies, but rented DVDs, sold yarn and other craft supplies, in addition to a smattering of just about everything else.</p><p>\u201cHeard this morning that Chase got married,\u201d Thelma said, coming around the counter. \u201cWelcome to Twin Creeks. Everyone around here is fond of Chase and we hope you\u2019ll be real happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver been to Alaska before? Don\u2019t answer that. I can see you haven\u2019t. You\u2019ll never be colder in your life, that much I can promise you. Some say this is really what hell will be like. Personally, I don\u2019t intend on finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d Lesley asked.</p><p>Thelma squinted. \u201cWe were one of the first ones to move up this way when word came that the pipeline was going through. I was just a young married. That\u2019s, oh, more than forty years now. We love it, but the winters take some getting used to.\u201d</p> <p>That Lesley could believe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll want to have a party for you two. I hope you don\u2019t mind us throwing a get-together in your honor. There isn\u2019t a lot of entertainment here, but we do our best to have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love parties.\u201d</p><p>Thelma\u2019s hands rested on her hips. \u201cWe\u2019ll have it at our house, since we\u2019ve got the biggest living room in town. Are you and Chase thinking of starting a family soon? It\u2019s been years since we had a baby born in Twin Creeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Lesley wasn\u2019t sure how to answer that.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Lesley, I shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you about babies. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re so happy to have another woman, especially a young one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have a minute I\u2019ll call Margaret and get Heather and we\u2019ll have coffee and talk. Do you have time for that? Everyone\u2019s dying to meet you, even Gladys. We\u2019re eager to do whatever we can to make you feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to meet everyone.\u201d The sooner the better. If Chase was going to be away often, her link with the others would be vital to her sanity.</p><p>\u201cI knew I was going to like you.\u201d Thelma grinned. \u201cThe minute Pete mentioned Chase had brought back a wife and described you, I knew we\u2019d be good friends. I think Pete\u2019s half smitten with you himself, which to my way of thinking is good. It\u2019s about time the men in this community thought about getting married and starting families. That\u2019s what Twin Creeks really needs.\u201d</p><p>Lesley couldn\u2019t agree more.</p><p>She stayed to meet the other women and by the time she left they\u2019d talked for two hours. Rarely had Lesley been more impressed with anyone. They were like frontier women\u2014resourceful, independent, with a strong sense of community. After the first half hour with the others, Lesley felt as if she\u2019d known them all her life. The genuine warmth of her welcome was exactly what she needed. When she returned to the house, she felt excited to be part of this small but thriving community.</p><p>Lesley wasn\u2019t home more than five minutes when the phone rang. She answered it eagerly, thinking it would be Chase. There was so much she wanted to tell him.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesley, it\u2019s your mother.\u201d Their conversations invariably started with June Campbell-Sterne announcing her parental status as if Lesley had forgotten.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d She couldn\u2019t have been more shocked if Daisy had arrived on her doorstep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true then, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re married and living with some crazy man in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds.\u201d She should\u2019ve tried phoning them again, had planned to, but she\u2019d been too involved in becoming familiar with her new environment.</p><p>\u201cWhen Tony contacted us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Lesley said, fuming. Daisy had warned her that her former fianc\u00e9 was up to no good, but she\u2019d never dreamed he\u2019d resort to contacting her family to make trouble.</p><p>\u201cTony was kind enough to call us and let us know you\u2019d gotten married, which is more than I can say for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Mom, Tony did not have my best interests at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being jealous and spiteful.\u201d</p><p>Her mother breathed in deeply as if she was trying to control her temper. \u201cIs it true that you married a man who advertised for a wife on a Seattle billboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t answer his ad, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. I know you\u2019re hurt,\u201d she said, trying to diffuse her mother\u2019s disappointment and anger, \u201cand I apologize for not letting you know, but Chase only had a few days left in Seattle and you and Ken were traveling and I tried to call your cell and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happened, we returned early, but you didn\u2019t know that because you just assumed we were gone. You\u2019re my only child. Didn\u2019t you stop to think that I\u2019d want to be at your wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony says you don\u2019t even know the man you married. That you weren\u2019t in your right mind. He sounded very worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that\u2019s true. I\u2019m very happy with Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t believe that until I see you for myself and meet this man you\u2019ve married. Ken\u2019s already made the flight arrangements for me. I\u2019ll be leaving first thing tomorrow morning and landing in Fairbanks at some horrible hour. I have no idea how to reach Twin Creeks from there, but I\u2019ll manage if I have to go by dogsled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fly down and meet you in Fairbanks,\u201d Lesley said, thinking quickly. \u201cThen we\u2019ll fly back together.\u201d She wanted Chase to meet her mother, but she would rather have waited until they\u2019d settled into their lives together.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Some of the defensiveness was gone from her mother\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like to talk to someone about me and Chase, I suggest you contact Daisy instead of Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt broke my heart when you ended your engagement to Tony,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cMother, he married someone else! I didn\u2019t end the engagement\u2014he did. Despite the claims he\u2019s making now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what\u2019s happened to you. Just look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother! I\u2019m married to a wonderful man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019ll judge that for myself. See you tomorrow.\u201d She gave her arrival time and Lesley wrote it down on a pad by the phone. Now all she needed to do was find a way of reaching Fairbanks and meeting her mother\u2019s plane.</p><p>Chase clutched his cell phone so hard, he was afraid he might break it. \u201cWhat do you mean she isn\u2019t at the house?\u201d he demanded, scowling at Pete\u2019s unsatisfactory response. He\u2019d spent the most frustrating day of his life, first having to deal with the motor company and then attempting to contact Lesley. He\u2019d tried repeatedly that afternoon with no answer.</p><p>There were any number of reasons she might not have answered the phone, but he\u2019d started to worry. Two hours of no response, and he was beside himself. He\u2019d called Pete and had his friend drive over and check out the cabin for himself.</p><p>\u201cThe door was locked,\u201d Pete explained, \u201cso I couldn\u2019t get inside. What did she lock it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesley\u2019s from the city\u2014they lock everything there,\u201d Chase said, trying to figure out where she could\u2019ve gone.</p><p>\u201cWhen she heard how small Twin Creeks was, she seemed upset,\u201d Pete said, sounding guilty.</p><p>\u201cWe already settled that,\u201d Chase said irritably. \u201cWhere could she be?\u201d The dangers she could encounter raced through his mind. \u201cDo you think she might have wandered away from the cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Chase stiffened. \u201cWhat makes you so certain?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe truck\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truck! Well, why didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d</p><p>He felt Pete\u2019s hesitation. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase, you\u2019re my best friend. I don\u2019t want to be the one to tell you your wife walked out on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? She left?\u201d The constriction in his chest produced a sharp pain. \u201cShe drove?\u201d His heart did a wild tumble as he calculated how long it would take him to rent a car and catch up with her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Pete said, \u201cshe went out to the field and parked the car there. She paid Jim Perkins to fly her into Fairbanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a word to anyone, she just...up and left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chase, I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time will she be landing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot sure. All I know is what I heard from Johnny at the field. He only heard part of the conversation. What are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Chase was in shock. His wife of less than a week had deserted him.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna let her go, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d find Lesley, somehow, someway, and convince her to give their marriage another chance.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Lesley ran forward and hugged her mother as June Campbell-Sterne entered the arrivals lounge. Unexpected tears sprang to Lesley\u2019s eyes and she blinked them back, surprised by the emotion.</p> <p>The tears were most likely due to the restless night she\u2019d spent in a hotel close to the airport. Apparently Chase hadn\u2019t returned to Twin Creeks the way he\u2019d assumed, otherwise he would\u2019ve seen her message or answered her calls. She\u2019d tried the home phone and his cell, with no results. He must be someplace here in Fairbanks. Unfortunately Lesley hadn\u2019t asked him for the name of his hotel, since he\u2019d originally planned to be in town only one night.</p><p>It seemed ridiculous to contact every hotel in town and ask for Chase. She\u2019d probably be back in Twin Creeks before her husband.</p><p>\u201cLet me get a good look at you,\u201d June insisted, taking a step back while holding Lesley\u2019s shoulders. Her mother had tears in her eyes, as well. \u201cOh, sweetie, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel wonderful. See! Married life agrees with me.\u201d She slipped an arm around her mother\u2019s waist and together they strolled toward the luggage carousels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit to being curious about your husband. Honestly, Lesley, what kind of man advertises for a wife?\u201d</p><p>Lesley laughed, remembering that her own response had been similar. \u201cHe\u2019s not crazy\u2014just resourceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, this whole thing has both Ken and me concerned. It just isn\u2019t like you to marry a virtual stranger and take off to the ends of the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t as bad as it seems.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother sighed expressively. She was exhausted, as Lesley could well understand. \u201cWhen will I meet Chase?\u201d was June\u2019s next question.</p><p>Lesley wasn\u2019t entirely sure. \u201cSoon,\u201d she promised. \u201cListen, I got us a hotel room. You\u2019re going to need to catch your breath before we fly to Twin Creeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, this felt like the longest flight of my life. I had to fly from Helena to Seattle, then wait for hours before I could get this flight.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t see you living in Alaska and liking it. You\u2019ve lived in a big city all your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love Montana, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s different. Ken and I are retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t different at all. I\u2019ve only been in Alaska for a short while and I love it already.\u201d</p><p>Her mother pinched her lips together as if to keep from saying something argumentative. \u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, Lesley, I\u2019d prefer to push on. I\u2019ll rest once we reach your home and I meet this man you\u2019ve married. Then and only then will I truly relax.\u201d</p><p>That posed a problem. \u201cWe can\u2019t, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do what? Meet Chase? I wondered why he wasn\u2019t here to greet me. One would think he\u2019d be eager to meet your family. I don\u2019t imagine you\u2019ve met his, either, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lesley said impatiently. She was troubled by the way her mother was so willing to find fault with Chase and her marriage. No doubt that was Tony\u2019s doing. Even now, he was haunting her life. More and more she\u2019d come to realize that Tony had never really loved her. Even more enlightening was the realization that she no longer loved him. She couldn\u2019t feel as strongly as she did for Chase if she loved Tony. She missed Chase terribly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d June snapped.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to make Chase into some fiend. He\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me why he sent you to the airport by yourself,\u201d she said, in that superior way that had driven Lesley to the brink of hysteria as a teenager.</p><p>\u201cMother, Chase has a job. He was away on business when you called. And the reason we can\u2019t leave yet is that we can\u2019t get a flight until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be meeting him later then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Lesley just wasn\u2019t sure exactly when.</p><p>They stood at the luggage carousel for several minutes until June collected her one large suitcase and her cosmetic case. Lesley took the larger of the two bags and carried it outside to the taxi line.</p><p>Her mother was worn out, and by the time they arrived at the hotel room, Lesley was glad that Jim couldn\u2019t get them until the following morning. She was supposed to call this afternoon to confirm it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to order you something to eat?\u201d Lesley asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d June politely covered her mouth for a loud yawn. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll lie back and just close my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind. Relax, Mom.\u201d Her mother curled up on the bed and was asleep seconds later. Lesley silently placed a sweater over June\u2019s shoulders and tiptoed to the other bed. Her intention was to read until her mother woke, but she must have fallen asleep, too, because the next thing she heard was the sound of running water.</p><p>Lesley stirred, opened her eyes and realized her mother was showering. With June occupied, Lesley reached for the phone and called Chase at both numbers. Again there was no answer at either. Discouraged, she replaced the receiver. Where could he possibly be?</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly did she say?\u201d Chase asked Jim Perkins. He found it frustrating to have this conversation by phone. Especially frustrating when he was sitting in a hotel room in Fairbanks. It would\u2019ve been easier to read Jim in person. He spoke in a slow drawl and had never been one to reveal much, with either words or actions. If Chase could\u2019ve talked to Jim in person, he might\u2019ve been able to persuade him of the urgency of this situation.</p><p>Jim took his own sweet time answering. \u201cShe really didn\u2019t have a lot to say.\u201d</p><p>Jim was in his early forties and possessed a calm low-key attitude that had never bothered Chase before. But now he was desperate to learn everything he could about Lesley\u2019s departure from Twin Creeks.</p><p>\u201cSurely you chatted during the flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s the congenial sort. Personally I didn\u2019t think much of this scheme of yours of advertising for a wife, but I was wrong. Half the men in town are talking about doing something like that themselves, seeing the kind of woman you brought back with you.\u201d He paused. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it would work with me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you and Lesley talk about?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d Jim said. \u201cMostly she asked about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to need time to consider this question. \u201cNothin\u2019 in particular. Just how long you\u2019ve lived in Twin Creeks. Things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she mention she was staying in a hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might have.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI don\u2019t recall her saying she was, now that I think about it.\u201d</p><p>Chase had difficulty not letting his distress show. It was bad enough that Lesley had left him so soon after her arrival in Twin Creeks. But he wasn\u2019t ready to announce to the entire community that his bride of one week had deserted him. If that was true, it would come out soon enough.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your help, Jim. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry about her,\u201d Jim added in that lethargic drawl of his. \u201cLesley\u2019s got a good head on her shoulders. She can take care of herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d That, however, didn\u2019t ease his mind in the least.</p><p>No sooner had he finished with the call than the phone rang. Chase grabbed it so fast, he nearly jerked the telephone off the end table. \u201cYes?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesley\u2019s staying at the Gold Creek Hotel by the airport,\u201d came Pete\u2019s reply. \u201cRoom 204.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you learn that?\u201d Sometimes it was better not to know where Pete got his information, but Chase couldn\u2019t help being curious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my sources. And listen, she may be having second thoughts because she hasn\u2019t bought an airline ticket to Seattle yet. Or anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d There was doubt in his voice. \u201cDid you get any sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>Chase closed his burning eyes. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. You know, Chase, if she insists on leaving, you can\u2019t make her stay.\u201d</p><p>This had been the subject of an ongoing internal debate. He didn\u2019t want to lose Lesley, but he couldn\u2019t hold her prisoner, either. If she\u2019d decided she wanted out of his life and out of their marriage, then he couldn\u2019t stop her. Even if it meant she\u2019d decided to return to Seattle and Tony. But he was determined to have his say before he\u2019d let her run out on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019ll probably go to the hotel and see if I can talk some sense into her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good idea to me. I suppose you want to do this on your own, but if you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll come along for moral support and wait outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, but I appreciate the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. That\u2019s what friends do.\u201d Pete hesitated as if there was something more he wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Again Pete hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t make a practice of giving advice, especially when it comes to women. My history with the opposite sex leaves a lot to be desired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d Chase didn\u2019t generally seek other people\u2019s wisdom; he lived and learned by his own mistakes. This was different, though, and he was worried. He\u2019d assumed everything was fine between them. That he could be so blind to her feelings was a shock.</p><p>\u201cI wish now that I\u2019d gone after Pamela,\u201d Pete said. It was the first time Chase had heard his friend say this. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered a thousand times over what would\u2019ve happened if I\u2019d taken the trouble to let her know how much I loved her, how much I needed her. If I had, she might\u2019ve stayed and I wouldn\u2019t be regretting all the time that I didn\u2019t do everything I could to convince her. Don\u2019t make the same mistake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Pete cleared his throat. \u201cYou love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Chase wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. The physical desire they shared had overwhelmed them both. But their relationship had quickly become so much more.</p><p>When he\u2019d first considered finding himself a wife, it had been to ease his loneliness. He was searching for a companion. A lover. A woman to keep him company during the long, dark winter months. He wanted a wife so he could bond closely with another human being. Since his parents\u2019 deaths, he\u2019d felt detached and isolated from life.</p> <p>Love had never entered into the equation. He\u2019d never expected to fall in love this fast. Passion, yes, he\u2019d expected that but not this kind of love.</p><p>This had been his error, Chase realized with a start. Marriage to Lesley had altered everything. Because love had come to them\u2014or at least to him\u2014with everything she did, everything she said. Whenever he went to bed with her, he offered her a little more of his heart. A little more of his soul. Lovemaking had become more than a physical mating, it had a spiritual aspect. He didn\u2019t know how else to describe it.</p><p>He thought about Lesley lying in bed waiting for him. She was so incredibly lovely, with her hair spilling out over the pillow...</p><p>It felt like a knife in his belly to think that she\u2019d walk out on him without so much as a word.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Chase said, answering Pete\u2019s question after a profound moment. \u201cI do love her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen do whatever you have to in order to keep her,\u201d Pete advised sagely. \u201cEven if it means leaving Twin Creeks. You can always find another job, but you may never find another Lesley.\u201d</p><p>His friend was right and Chase knew it. Now all he had to do was come up with a way of convincing Lesley to give their lives together a fighting chance.</p><p>He showered and changed clothes, flipped through the Fairbanks phone directory for the address of the Gold Creek Hotel and ordered a cab.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been better if he\u2019d been able to work out what he wanted to say, but he dared not delay a confrontation for fear he\u2019d miss her.</p><p>Chase was grateful to Pete. His friend had said he could find Lesley through his various connections faster than Chase would be able to do it. Chase hated sitting back and letting someone else do the footwork, but in the end it had proven beneficial. Pete had located her within twelve hours.</p><p>The taxi let him off in front of the hotel. His heart was beating so hard he could hardly hear his own thoughts. Even now he didn\u2019t know what he what he was going to say.</p> <p>That, however, didn\u2019t stop him from pounding at the door of room 204. When she didn\u2019t immediately answer, he knocked again, louder this time, so loud that the lady across the hall stuck her head out to see who was causing such a commotion. She threw him an irritated look and went back inside.</p><p>The door opened and Lesley stood in front of him. Suitcases sat like accusations in the background, and suddenly he was angry. He\u2019d considered Lesley decent and honorable, not the kind of woman who\u2019d walk out on her husband without warning.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he demanded, pushing his way into the room. Lesley was so startled that she stumbled two steps back before regaining her balance.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d She closed the door and leaned against it, her eyes wide. The perfume she wore wafted toward him. He needed every ounce of willpower not to haul her into his arms and beg her to stay with him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, staring at him, her eyes so innocent that the struggle not to kiss her seemed to drain his strength.</p><p>\u201cI may have made a few mistakes along the way, but I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d have the decency to talk to me instead of running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning away? I just flew down to Fairbanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a word to me,\u201d he reminded her in clipped tones.</p> <p>\u201cI left you a note.\u201d Her voice was raised now, as well. She rested her hands on her hips and scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cA note,\u201d he said as though he found that humorous. \u201cWhat good is that when I\u2019m here in Fairbanks?\u201d</p><p>Lesley dropped her hands, clenching them tightly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me the name of the hotel where you were staying. And you didn\u2019t answer your cell. How was I supposed to contact you?\u201d</p><p>Chase was embarrassed to admit that he\u2019d left his cell phone charging and hadn\u2019t bothered to check for a message from her\u2014because he hadn\u2019t expected one.</p><p>\u201cSo now it\u2019s my fault.\u201d Chase knew why he was arguing with her, because if he didn\u2019t, he was going to reach for her and hold her, kiss her.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s your fault,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cLesley, who is this man?\u201d</p><p>Chase whirled around to see an older woman in a bright red housecoat with matching red slippers. Her hair was wrapped in a towel.</p><p>\u201cMother...\u201d Lesley sounded as though she was about to burst into tears. She gestured weakly toward him, before her hand fell lifelessly to her side. \u201cThis is Chase Goodman, my husband.\u201d</p><p>The woman glared at him as if he were living proof of every dreaded suspicion she\u2019d harbored. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Campbell-Sterne...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you talk to Lesley like this! Have you no manners?\u201d</p><p>Chase gave what he figured was an excellent imitation of a salmon, his mouth opening and closing soundlessly. He looked at Lesley, desperate for her to explain, but she\u2019d turned her back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAs well you should be. I can tell you I had my concerns about the kind of man Lesley married. Now I can see that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I spoke to my wife alone for a moment?\u201d Chase interrupted. Lesley\u2019s arms were cradling her middle and she was staring out the window. She gave no indication that she\u2019d heard him.</p><p>\u201cI...I suppose not.\u201d Mrs. Campbell-Sterne flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll go and dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Chase said. He waited until his mother-in-law had gone into the bathroom and closed the door before he approached Lesley.</p><p>He stepped behind her and went to rest his hands on her shoulders, stopping just short. He closed his eyes briefly, then dropped his hands to his sides. \u201cI just made a world-class jerk of myself, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Lesley nodded, still refusing to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou left a note at the house?\u201d</p><p>She answered him with another sharp nod. \u201cAnd messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat my mother had phoned and was worried about me and our sudden marriage. She was hurt that I\u2019d gone through with the ceremony without trying harder to contact her. She decided to fly up immediately to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d He didn\u2019t know what had possessed him to think she\u2019d leave without some kind of explanation.</p><p>\u201cTony called Mom and Ken,\u201d Lesley went on. \u201cHe claimed I\u2019d married on the rebound and that I\u2019d made a terrible mistake. He was hoping to undermine our relationship.\u201d The way Lesley said it made Chase wonder if Tony had succeeded.</p><p>After the stunt he\u2019d just pulled, he couldn\u2019t blame Lesley for believing she had made a mistake. Apologies seemed grossly inadequate.</p><p>\u201cYou flew down to meet your mother.\u201d Once again he wanted to kick himself for being so stupid. No doubt her mother thought Lesley had married a madman and he\u2019d quickly gone about proving her right.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, charging in here like a bull moose?\u201d Lesley demanded, finally turning to face him.</p><p>His salmon imitation returned, and he couldn\u2019t manage a word, let alone a coherent sentence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for an answer,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI...I thought you left me,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious, are you?\u201d Her eyes, which he\u2019d always found so bright and beautiful, were filled with disdain.</p><p>It sounded so weak. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Now was the perfect opportunity to confess how much he loved her, how his heart wouldn\u2019t survive without her, but he couldn\u2019t make himself say it, not with her looking at him as if he should be arrested.</p><p>\u201cWhat else was I supposed to think?\u201d he flared. \u201cYou up and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left, too, and didn\u2019t return when you said you would, but I didn\u2019t immediately leap to some outrageous conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Chase argued, although he knew that made no sense. He disliked the turn their conversation had taken. He didn\u2019t want to quarrel; what he yearned to do was pull her into his arms, bury his face in her neck and breathe in her scent.</p><p>\u201cCan I come out now?\u201d June asked from the bathroom doorway. She\u2019d changed into blue-and-green-plaid slacks and a pale blue sweater. She was nearly as tall as Lesley, with the same clear, dark, intelligent eyes. And like Lesley, her thoughts were easy to read. Chase didn\u2019t have to guess what his mother-in-law was thinking. He hadn\u2019t impressed her, nor had he done anything to reassure her that Lesley had made a wise choice in marrying him.</p><p>The worst of it was that he couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mom. You can come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d She said it as though she was ready to contact the police and have Chase removed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve made a mistake,\u201d Chase said, hoping he could explain what had happened and at the same time address her concerns about his and Lesley\u2019s relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d June returned crisply.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could discuss this over lunch.\u201d Feeding them both sounded like an excellent plan and once they were relaxed, he\u2019d be able to smooth things over.</p><p>Lesley\u2019s mother didn\u2019t look too pleased about stepping outside the hotel room with him. She cast a guarded look in Lesley\u2019s direction. \u201cWhat do you think, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Lesley said, reaching for a white sweater, neatly folded at the foot of the bed. Chase moved to help her put it on, then changed his mind. Now wasn\u2019t the time to be solicitous. Lesley wouldn\u2019t appreciate it.</p><p>Chase chose the hotel restaurant. Conversation over lunch was stilted at best. June asked him several questions, but his attention was focused on his wife. He answered June, but his gaze didn\u2019t waver from Lesley. He was hoping she\u2019d say or do something, anything to ease his conscience.</p><p>He\u2019d blown it. The door had been left wide open for him to explain why he\u2019d reacted so badly. He\u2019d been out of his mind, thinking he\u2019d lost her.</p><p>Chase loved her. It didn\u2019t get any simpler than that. All he had to do was say it. How difficult could that be? Apparently more than he\u2019d realized because he let the opportunity slip past.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you plan to visit?\u201d Chase asked June, thinking ahead. He supposed he shouldn\u2019t have been so obvious, but he was already counting down the days, the hours and minutes, until he could be alone with Lesley.</p><p>\u201cFive days,\u201d June returned stiffly. She glanced at Lesley as though to suggest that purchasing another plane ticket south would be highly advisable\u2014for both of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was able to get the new motor this morning,\u201d Chase said to Lesley. \u201cWe can leave for Twin Creeks as soon as you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. I\u2019m anxious to see your home, although heaven knows you haven\u2019t had much time to settle in, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lesley eyed Chase wearily.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you here and be back within the hour to get you,\u201d he said, reaching for the lunch tab. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d care to come with me?\u201d he asked Lesley. He tried to appear nonchalant about it, but his heart was in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should leave Mother,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>Chase\u2019s shoulders fell. Her feelings couldn\u2019t have been more obvious.</p><p>Lesley couldn\u2019t remember being more furious with anyone in her life. Chase was a fool. She\u2019d agreed to marry him, agreed to leave the life she\u2019d made for herself, leave her friends, her career and most of her possessions, and he still didn\u2019t trust her. He assumed she\u2019d walk out on him the minute his back was turned. That was what hurt so much. His lack of faith in her.</p><p>Lesley had spent the morning listing Chase\u2019s many fine qualities to her mother. By the time she\u2019d finished, it sounded as if he were a candidate for sainthood.</p> <p>Fat chance of that after the way he\u2019d barged into their hotel room. He couldn\u2019t have shown himself in a worse light had he tried.</p><p>After Chase left, her mother was strangely silent. They sat on their beds, staring straight ahead. Every time Lesley thought of something to say, she changed her mind. Her mother would see through her efforts to make small talk in a second.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t always like this,\u201d she finally murmured.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase is honest and hardworking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d her mother asked stiffly.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like him, do you?\u201d</p><p>June paused. \u201cI don\u2019t have much reason to, do I? I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve been blinded, Lesley. How can you possibly love this man? You don\u2019t really know him... You couldn\u2019t. Tony said Chase disguised the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t trust Tony!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? At least he called us when my own daughter hadn\u2019t bothered to let me know she was getting married. Now that I\u2019ve met your husband, I can appreciate Tony\u2019s concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out, please. I\u2019ve bitten my tongue for the last hour, trying not to say what I should have earlier and didn\u2019t. You have nothing in common with Chase. You might have convinced yourself that you\u2019re happy now, and that you\u2019re going to make this ridiculous marriage work, but it isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please, don\u2019t.\u201d It hurt that her mother thought her marriage ridiculous. Lesley was angry with Chase all over again for having put her in this impossible situation.</p><p>\u201cI have to speak my piece or I\u2019ll regret it the rest of my life. I made the same mistake with your father.\u201d Her voice faltered slightly. \u201cI knew the marriage wasn\u2019t going to work, almost from the first, but I was too stubborn to admit it. I convinced myself that I was deeply in love with him. I worked hard at making the best of the situation, giving more and more of myself until there wasn\u2019t anything left to give.</p> <p>\u201cAfter all that, after everything I did to hold that marriage together, he walked out. To see you repeat my mistakes would be the most tragic thing that could happen to me.\u201d</p><p>Lesley felt as if she was going to break into tears. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like that with Chase and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that, not after talking to Tony and meeting Chase for myself. He isn\u2019t right for you. Anyone with a brain can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed as though relieved. \u201cCome back to Montana with me,\u201d June pleaded. \u201cIf you want to start over, do it there. There\u2019s always a need for good teachers. Don\u2019t make the mistakes I did, Lesley. Leave Chase now\u2014before it\u2019s too late\u2014and come back with me.\u201d</p><p>Lesley was so intent on listening to her mother that she didn\u2019t hear the door open. But she felt Chase\u2019s presence before she heard his words. He was studying her without emotion, without revealing a hint of his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he said. \u201cMake up your mind, Lesley. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Lesley\u2019s mother was staring at her, too, pleading with her to cut her losses now.</p><p>\u201cI...I thought we\u2019d already decided to return to Twin Creeks,\u201d Lesley stammered.</p><p>June\u2019s shoulders sagged with dismay. Chase hurriedly reached for their suitcases, as though he expected Lesley to change her mind. That irritated her, too. Her mother was about to burst into tears and Chase was ignoring June completely.</p><p>The flight into Twin Creeks seemed to take twice as long as before. Chase flew the four-seater, concentrating as hard as if he were flying an F-14 under siege. Lesley made several attempts to carry the conversation, but it became painfully obvious that neither her mother nor Chase was interested in small talk.</p><p>When they landed at the tiny airfield, Pete and Jim were there to greet them. She knew Chase had let Jim know he\u2019d be flying them home. But she didn\u2019t understand what was going on between Pete and her husband. The minute Pete saw her, he grinned broadly and gave Chase a thumbs-up. Chase, however, didn\u2019t seem to share his friend\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you live?\u201d June asked, scowling, staring at the tundra that surrounded the town. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s...it\u2019s like stepping back a hundred years.\u201d The words were more accusation than comment. Lesley saw Chase\u2019s jaw tense, but he didn\u2019t say anything, which was just as well. Lesley doubted her mother would be receptive, anyway.</p><p>When they arrived at the cabin, Lesley waited curiously for her mother\u2019s reaction. June asked several questions, nodding now and then as Chase told her about his and Lesley\u2019s life in Twin Creeks. Lesley was pleased with his honest responses. She added what little information she could.</p><p>\u201cThe guest room is down the hall,\u201d Chase explained, leading them into the house. There seemed to be a d\u00e9tente between him and her mother, much to Lesley\u2019s relief.</p><p>June paused in the living room, staring curiously at the fireplace and the bookshelves and the desk in much the same way Lesley had earlier. Before leaving, Lesley had added several feminine touches to the house. A homemade quilt that had been her grandmother\u2019s was draped across the back of the rocking chair. A picture of her mother and Ken rested on the television and a small figurine of a harbor seal made of ash from the 1980 Mount Saint Helens eruption was propped against a Sue Grafton mystery in one of the built-in bookcases.</p><p>\u201cThis has a homey feel to it,\u201d June said grudgingly before following Chase down the narrow hallway.</p><p>Lesley bit her tongue and trailed after her mother. Already she could see that this was going to be the longest five days of her life.</p><p>Chase was forced to wait until after dinner before he had a chance to speak to his mother-in-law privately. While Lesley was busy with the dinner dishes, Chase casually suggested a drive into town.</p><p>June hesitated, but it appeared she had things she wanted to say to him, too, and she agreed with a nod of her head.</p><p>Chase walked into the kitchen. Under normal circumstances, he would\u2019ve slipped his arms around Lesley\u2019s waist. But these weren\u2019t normal conditions. He was afraid of touching her for fear of being charged with not behaving in a circumspect fashion. He swore his mother-in-law had the eyes of an eagle and the temperament of a polar bear.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I are going for a drive,\u201d he said as casually as he could, hoping Lesley would leave it at that. He should\u2019ve known better.</p><p>She hurriedly finished rinsing the pan she\u2019d used to bake biscuits and reached for a hand towel. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be offended, but we\u2019d both rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lesley blinked and leaned against the sink. \u201cI don\u2019t know if talking to my mother when she\u2019s in this frame of mind is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe either clear the air here and now, or all three of us are going to spend a miserable five days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Chase...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, listen.\u201d He paused and glanced over his shoulder. June had gone for a sweater, but would return at any moment. \u201cYou and I need to talk, too. I\u2019m sorry about starting off on the wrong foot with your mother. I promise I\u2019ll do my best to make things right. I owe you that much\u2014and a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p>Lesley lowered her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI realize June\u2019s not the only one I offended,\u201d he said gruffly, walking toward her. If he didn\u2019t kiss her soon, he was going to go stark raving mad. Lesley must have felt the same way because she moved toward him, her steps as eager as his own. His heart reacted immediately, gladdened that she wanted to end this terrible tension between them.</p><p>He clasped his hands about her waist and caught her, drawing her into the shelter of his arms.</p><p>The sound of June clearing her throat behind him was like a bucket of cold water tossed over his head. He released Lesley and stepped away from her.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be long,\u201d he said, as evenly as he could.</p><p>June was fussing with her sweater when he turned around, smoothing out the sleeves. Her back was straight with unspoken disapproval. She looked prim and proper and determined to save her daughter from his nasty clutches. Chase sighed inwardly and prayed for patience.</p><p>Lesley followed them out to the front porch and watched as Chase opened the passenger door and held out his hand to help June inside. His mother-in-law ignored him and hoisted herself into the front seat.</p><p>So that was how it was going to be.</p><p>Knowing what to expect, Chase threw a look over his shoulder at Lesley and shrugged. He\u2019d do his best, but he wasn\u2019t a miracle worker. He couldn\u2019t force Lesley\u2019s mother to accept him as her son-in-law, nor could he demand she give her approval to their marriage.</p><p>He climbed into the seat beside her, and started the engine. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Lesley had a chance to tell you, but Twin Creeks is a small town,\u201d he said, as he pulled onto the dirt and gravel road. \u201cThe population is around forty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty,\u201d June repeated, sounding shocked. \u201cDid Lesley tell you she was born and raised in Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were almost that many students in her kindergarten class. What makes you think a woman who\u2019s lived in a large populated area all her life will adjust to a place like this?\u201d</p><p>Chase was ready for this one. \u201cLesley knew Twin Creeks was small when she agreed to marry me.\u201d True, she hadn\u2019t known how small, but she\u2019d had the general idea.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question,\u201d June said primly, her hands tightly clasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping love will do that,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you asking a good deal of a woman you\u2019ve only known a few weeks?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d Lesley\u2019s mother interrupted, \u201cthat neither of you has given the matter much thought. Lesley won\u2019t last a month in this primitive lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>Chase was fast losing his patience. \u201cIt seems to me that you don\u2019t know your daughter as well as you think you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she snapped. \u201cDo you suppose I don\u2019t realize what you did? You seduced my daughter, convinced her to marry you and then practically kidnapped her to get her to move north with you.\u201d</p> <p>Chase pulled over to the side of the road. He couldn\u2019t concentrate on driving and hold on to his temper at the same time.</p><p>\u201cLesley mentioned that you\u2019d spoken to Tony. I gather you\u2019re repeating what he said. Unfortunately you and I don\u2019t know each other well enough to be good judges of the other\u2019s character. You see me as some psychopath who\u2019s tricked your daughter into marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for that, after you charged into our hotel room, acting like a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>Chase closed his eyes with mounting frustration. When he collected himself, he continued in a calm, clear voice. \u201cArguing isn\u2019t going to settle anything. You believe what you must and I\u2019ll do my best to stay out of your way.\u201d He started the engine, intent on turning the vehicle around and heading back to the house. He\u2019d tried, but hadn\u2019t lasted five minutes with June hurling accusations at him.</p><p>\u201cListen here, young man\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe last person who called me \u2018young man\u2019 was my junior high teacher,\u201d Chase retorted. \u201cI\u2019m a long way from junior high, so I suggest you either call me by name or keep quiet.\u201d</p><p>She gasped indignantly, and Chase wondered how it was possible to love Lesley so much, yet feel so negative toward her mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat you fail to understand,\u201d he said, after a lengthy pause, \u201cis that we have something in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sincerely doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both love Lesley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any qualifiers as far as I can see,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cShe\u2019s your daughter, the woman you\u2019ve raised and nurtured and loved all these years. I don\u2019t have the same history with Lesley, but I love her. Right now those may be only words to you, but I\u2019d rather die than hurt her. If your main concern is that she won\u2019t adjust to life here in Alaska, then let me assure you, we\u2019ll move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis all sounds very convenient. You\u2019re telling me what I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth.\u201d His anger flared briefly, then died down just as quickly. \u201cWe were wrong not to make more of an effort to contact you about the wedding. If you want to blame someone for that, then I\u2019ll accept the guilt. I was in a hurry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rushed her into making a decision.\u201d</p><p>Chase had another argument poised and ready, but he\u2019d recognized early on that there was nothing he could say that would alter June\u2019s opinion of him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to talk this out,\u201d he said, not bothering to disguise his disappointment. \u201cI\u2019d never keep Lesley here against her will, that much I promise you. You\u2019ve raised a wonderful woman and I love her more than my own life. I can\u2019t offer you any greater reassurance than that.\u201d</p><p>His words were greeted with silence.</p><p>\u201cYou and your husband will always be welcome here, especially after we start our family.\u201d</p> <p>She turned and glared at him as if he\u2019d said something offensive, but Chase was tired of trying to decipher this woman\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIf Lesley wants to visit you and your husband in Montana, she can go with my blessing,\u201d he added. It went without saying that he wouldn\u2019t be welcome. \u201cI apologize for making an idiot of myself earlier. I don\u2019t blame you for thinking ill of me, but I\u2019d hoped we\u2019d be able to put that behind us and start again. Perhaps before you leave, we\u2019ll be able to do that.\u201d He switched gears, turned the vehicle around and drove back to the house.</p><p>Lesley was knitting in the rocking chair when he walked inside. She glanced up anxiously, but must have read the defeat in his eyes, and the disdain in her mother\u2019s, because she sagged against the back of the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you knitting?\u201d June asked, revealing some enthusiasm for the first time in hours.</p><p>\u201cA sweater for Chase. One of the ladies in town sells yarn, so while I was there I picked up a pattern and everything else I was going to need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met Thelma?\u201d Chase asked, claiming the recliner next to his wife.</p><p>\u201cI had tea with all the ladies,\u201d Lesley informed him. She was trying not to smile. Her mouth quivered and the need to kiss her felt nearly overwhelming.</p><p>So she\u2019d gone into town on her own. Chase should\u2019ve realized she was too anxious to meet the others to wait for him to introduce her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stuffy in here,\u201d June announced.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chair on the porch,\u201d Chase suggested. If his curmudgeon of a mother-in-law wasn\u2019t standing guard over them, he might be able to steal a few minutes alone with his wife.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll sit out there for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Chase said with just a smidgen of glee. To his credit, he didn\u2019t lock the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lesley asked in a breathy whisper the instant her mother was out the door.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I seduced you into moving up here with me.\u201d</p><p>Lesley batted her long lashes at him. \u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d certainly like the opportunity to do so again,\u201d he said, waggling his brows suggestively. \u201cI\u2019m not going to last another five days without making love to you. Maybe not even another five minutes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase!\u201d Lesley whispered, as he moved toward her. \u201cMy mother\u2019s right outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already thinks I\u2019m a sex fiend as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are!\u201d</p><p>Chase chuckled, but his humor was cut short by a piercing scream from the front porch. Never in his life had Chase moved faster. Lesley reacted just as quickly. Her knitting needles and yarn flew toward the ceiling as they both raced out the front door.</p><p>June was backed against the front of the house, her hands flattened over her heart. Even from several feet away, Chase could see she was trembling.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>June closed her eyes and shook her head. Luckily Lesley was there to comfort her. She wrapped her arms around her mother and gently guided her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cSomething must have frightened her,\u201d Chase said. He debated going for his hunting rifle, then decided against it. Whatever the danger had been, it\u2019d passed.</p><p>\u201cIt was...huge.\u201d The words were strangled-sounding.</p><p>\u201cA bear, Mom. Did you see a bear?\u201d Lesley\u2019s eyes widened with fear, but her mother shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve been a moose,\u201d Chase speculated. He recalled the first time he\u2019d come nose to nose with one. It was an experience he\u2019d rather not repeat.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d June shook her head again.</p><p>\u201cA wolf?\u201d Lesley pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his mother-in-law moaned. Lesley led her into the house and urged her down in the rocker while Chase went for a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cIt was a...a spider,\u201d June said, gripping the glass with both hands. \u201cA black one with long legs. I...I\u2019ve never liked spiders.\u201d</p><p>Judging by June\u2019s reaction, that was an understatement.</p><p>\u201cA spider?\u201d Chase whispered. The woman had sounded as though she\u2019d barely escaped with her life.</p><p>His wife shrugged and rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSuggest she go to bed and rest,\u201d he said in hushed tones.</p><p>Lesley\u2019s lips quivered with the effort it took to suppress a smile.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better lie down,\u201d Lesley said in a soothing voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d June murmured, clearly shaken by the encounter. \u201cI don\u2019t usually overreact like this. It\u2019s just that this spider was so big. I didn\u2019t expect there to be spiders here in Alaska, of all places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have a tendency to overreact under certain circumstances,\u201d Chase said, using the opportunity to defend his own behavior earlier in the day. \u201cLater we realize how foolish we must have looked to everyone else. People generally understand and forgive that sort of thing.\u201d As far as sermons went, he felt he\u2019d done well. He was no TV evangelist, but he figured he\u2019d got his point across. He only hoped June had picked up on his message.</p><p>\u201cI do feel like I should rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check out the room first,\u201d Chase offered, \u201cand make sure there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d All he needed was for June to interrupt him and Lesley. He didn\u2019t know how well his heart would stand up to another bloodcurdling scream.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d June whispered as he hurried out.</p><p>When he came back to signal that all was clear, Lesley accompanied her mother to the bedroom. After five minutes Chase was glancing at his watch, wondering how long this was going to take.</p><p>Another ten minutes passed before Lesley returned to the living room. \u201cMom\u2019s resting comfortably. I gave her a couple of aspirin to settle her nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need something to settle my nerves, too,\u201d Chase said, reaching for her and pulling her onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cChase.\u201d She put up a token struggle.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering what I really want, a kiss seems darn little. Don\u2019t be stingy, Lesley, I need you.\u201d If they\u2019d been alone, he\u2019d have had her in bed fifteen seconds after they got home. As it was, he\u2019d been forced to sit through an uncomfortable dinner and then deal with her dragon of a mother before and after the spider attack. A kiss was small compensation.</p><p>He nibbled at her ear. He\u2019d settle for kissing her. It was all he wanted right now, just enough to satisfy him until he could tell her all that was in his heart.</p><p>He could feel her resistance, the little there was, melt away.</p><p>She turned her head until their lips met. The kiss was slow and deep. It demanded every shred of stamina he had to drag his mouth away from hers. By then, Lesley\u2019s arms had circled his neck and she was sighing softly. She laid her head on his shoulder and worked her fingers into his hair.</p><p>Now was the time to tell her. He forced his mind from the warmth of her body pressing against his, her moist breath fanning his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhen I spoke to your mother...\u201d The words wouldn\u2019t come. Maybe this would be easier after they\u2019d made love.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Lesley lifted her head, curiosity brightening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI told her something I\u2019ve never told you.\u201d Their eyes met and her mouth widened with an enticing smile.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lesley.\u201d There it was, out in the open for her to accept or reject. His heart was there, too, along with his dreams for their future. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lesley tensed, her hands on his shoulders. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Her voice was barely audible.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d It sounded so naked, saying it like that. \u201cI realize blurting it out might make you uncomfortable, but I didn\u2019t think it was fair if I told your mother how I felt and said nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>She was off his lap in a flash. Tears glazed her eyes as she backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cI was sure of it when I thought you\u2019d left me,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019d tried to reach you by phone and when I couldn\u2019t, I had Pete go to the cabin. He told me the truck was gone and that Jim had flown you into Fairbanks. I didn\u2019t know what to think. Now it seems ludicrous to leap to the conclusions I did, but at the time it made perfect sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d One tear escaped the corner of her eye and rolled down the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d he pleaded. His heart was precariously perched at the end of his sleeve. The least she could do was let him know if she was about to pluck it off and crush it beneath her feet.</p><p>\u201cI knew when we got married that you didn\u2019t love me,\u201d she said, without looking at him. \u201cWhen we were in Victoria\u2014I knew you didn\u2019t love me then, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d he returned, frowning. He understood the problem, had always understood it. Tony. She was in love with her former fianc\u00e9 and that wasn\u2019t likely to change for a long time.</p><p>Her head snapped up. \u201cYou were in love with me on our honeymoon?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, unwilling to reveal everything quite so soon. He wished she\u2019d express her feelings for him.</p><p>\u201cWere you?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>Chase stood and rubbed his hand along the back of his neck, walking away from her. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAs near as I can figure, I loved you when we got married. It just took me a while to...put everything together.\u201d He shoved his hands inside his pockets. This wasn\u2019t going as well as he\u2019d hoped.</p><p>\u201cI tried to reassure your mother, but that didn\u2019t work,\u201d he continued. \u201cTony\u2019s got her convinced you married me on the rebound and that it was a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Chase\u2019s turn to go still. He was afraid to believe what he thought she was saying. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in love with Tony?\u201d he asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cThat would be impossible when I\u2019m crazy in love with you.\u201d She smiled then, the soft womanly smile that never failed to stir him. Her love shone like a beacon.</p><p>Chase closed his eyes to savor her words, to wrap them around his heart and hold on to the feeling. It happened then, a physical need, a craving for her that was so powerful it nearly doubled him over.</p><p>They moved toward each other, their kisses fuel to the flames of their desire.</p><p>\u201cChase,\u201d Lesley groaned between kisses, unbuttoning his shirt as she spoke. \u201cWe can\u2019t.... Mother\u2019s room is directly down the hall from us. She\u2019ll hear.\u201d</p><p>Chase kissed her while trying to decide what to do.</p><p>\u201cThe cache,\u201d he said, grateful for the inspiration. It wasn\u2019t the ideal solution, but it would serve their purpose.</p> <p>Lesley\u2019s legs seemed to have given out on her and he lifted her into his arms, pausing only long enough to grab the quilt from the rocking chair.</p><p>He gathered her in his arms, holding her close with a fierce possessiveness.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Each time he said it, the words came more easily.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She spread a slow series of kisses along his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYour mother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Mom. She\u2019ll come around, especially when she\u2019s got grandchildren to spoil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Chase said softly.</p><p>\u201cIs this a new concept to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely.\u201d He grinned and she smiled back.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her teeth caught his lower lip. \u201cSoon I hope,\u201d she said a moment later. \u201cHow soon?\u201d</p><p>Lesley raised her head and her beautiful dark eyes gazed down at him. \u201cNo time like the present, is there?\u201d</p><p>Chase sucked in his breath. He\u2019d thought they\u2019d wait a year, possibly longer, to start their family, but he couldn\u2019t refuse Lesley anything.</p><p>\u201cWill I ever grow tired of you?\u201d he wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Chase instinctively knew it was true.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cGrandma, Grandma.\u201d Three-year-old Justin Goodman tore out of Lesley\u2019s grasp as they stepped into the small airport and he ran into the waiting arms of June Campbell-Sterne.</p><p>June hugged her grandson and lifted him from the ground. \u201cOh, my, you\u2019ve gotten so big.\u201d</p><p>Justin\u2019s chubby arms circled his grandmother\u2019s neck and he squeezed tightly.</p><p>\u201cJustin\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s grown,\u201d Chase said, slipping his arm around Lesley\u2019s thickened waist.</p><p>\u201cYou would have, too, if you were about to have a baby,\u201d Lesley reminded her husband.</p><p>Chase chuckled and shook hands with Ken Sterne.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Ken said. \u201cJune\u2019s been cooking for three days. You\u2019d think an army was about to descend on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush now,\u201d June chastised her husband. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Lesley sighed. How did any woman feel two months before her delivery date? Anxious. Nervous. Eager. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>June put down her grandson and kissed Chase on the cheek.</p><p>His eyes met Lesley\u2019s and he gave her a know-it-all look. It had taken time, but Lesley had been right about the effect grandchildren would have on the relationship between her mother and her husband. When they\u2019d first met, four years earlier, her mother had been convinced Chase was some kind of demon. These days he was much closer to sainthood.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Twin Creeks?\u201d Ken asked, steering the small party toward the baggage area.</p><p>\u201cThe population has doubled,\u201d Lesley informed him proudly. It had started soon after her arrival. Pete had gotten married the following spring and he and his wife already had two children and another on the way. Even Jim had married, which surprised them all. A widow with four children had found a place in all their hearts.</p><p>It seemed there was a baby being born every few months. The community was thriving. Lesley believed Chase was the one who\u2019d put everything in motion; his venture into Seattle to find himself a wife was what had started the process. Soon the other men working at the pump station were willing to open their lives.</p><p>Chase, however, was convinced that once the other men saw what a wonderful woman he\u2019d found, they\u2019d decided to take their chances, as well.</p><p>Whatever the reason, there were fifteen more women residing in Twin Creeks. Ten of them had apparently made it a personal goal to populate Alaska.</p><p>She placed one arm around her husband and smiled softly to herself. How different her life would have been without him. Each and every day she thanked God for that crazy billboard she\u2019d seen on her way to the store. </p> </body></html>"]
