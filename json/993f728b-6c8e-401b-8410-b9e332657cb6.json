Ty Grady threw up his arms, signaling a touchdown as the paper skidded across his desk and into his lap.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, Grady, in my office,\u201d McCoy called from his door. He disappeared inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you guys do now?\u201d Alston asked.</p> <p>Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cWasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time,\u201d Clancy chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI hope it was me,\u201d Ty said with relish. He stood and buttoned his suit, leaving a half-finished firearms discharge form open on his computer.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder how far you\u2019d go to get out of paperwork,\u201d Alston said.</p><p>\u201cWatch old episodes of Pinky and the Brain and you might get close,\u201d Zane muttered, drawing snorts of laughter from their other two teammates.</p> <p>\u201cBefore everything went digital, I had the Bureau docs convinced I was allergic to paper pulp,\u201d Ty told them, dead serious. His hazel eyes were shining. \u201cIt was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allergic to everything else,\u201d Zane said as he pushed out of his chair. \u201cCome on. You know what he did to us the last time we made him wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalon appointments,\u201d Lassiter mused.</p><p>\u201cPR lectures,\u201d Alston said.</p><p>\u201cEnforced vacation?\u201d Clancy added.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I don\u2019t know which of those is worse,\u201d Zane said. It was all part and parcel of being Ty Grady\u2019s partner. And, Zane had to be honest, some of it was his own fault too.</p> <p>Ty pointed around at each of his teammates, playfully threatening them as he trailed after Zane. He knocked on the doorjamb, peering into the Special Agent in Charge\u2019s office. McCoy looked up from his computer screen and smirked.</p><p>A cold chill ran through Zane\u2019s body. \u201cOh hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Ty blurted. They both knew that the look on McCoy\u2019s face was a harbinger of doom.</p><p>McCoy shook his head and motioned for them to come in and close the door. Once Ty had pushed it shut, McCoy waved two sheets of paper at them. \u201cSeveral weeks ago, we had a request put in. An unusual one, but it\u2019s a reasonable step toward keeping our noses clean in the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this more PR bullshit?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit,\u201d McCoy had the gall to say with a straight face.</p><p>Zane sat with a deep sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got me giving a community lecture once a month as it is. The last one? The deputy mayor asked me if I\u2019d speak to the Chamber of Commerce. How am I supposed to be a discreet, undercover criminal investigator when everyone knows who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good point,\u201d Ty said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I need to speak to you both about. Individually. Later,\u201d McCoy added with a more somber cast to his face. \u201cBut for now we\u2019ll deal with this one\u2014very reasonable\u2014request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fundraising calendar being put together by a local first responder organization.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood up, holding his hand out toward McCoy as if to ward off evil. \u201cHell no!\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked. \u201cA calendar?\u201d</p><p>McCoy nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re using people from state, federal, and municipal organizations, and all proceeds are going to a fund set up to aid first responders injured in the line of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmirable,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve both been requested as . . . models,\u201d McCoy managed to say without cracking a smile.</p><p>Zane looked from his partner back to McCoy. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d Ty was shaking his head, thumbing through numbers on the cell phone in his hand. Zane hadn\u2019t even seen him pull it out.</p><p>\u201cI never joke,\u201d McCoy said with a hint of mischief. He looked to Ty. \u201cIf you\u2019re intending to call Richard Burns to get you out of this, I won\u2019t have it. The Bureau needs this and you\u2019re the ones they want.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes at McCoy, then turned his phone off and curled his lip at Zane. There was also a hint of apprehension in his expression, but he hid it quickly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been assured the photographs will be tastefully done,\u201d McCoy said.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Zane said, pointing at Ty. \u201cSend him. But why me?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and gestured toward Zane while raising one eyebrow at McCoy. \u201cI think the real question is: Why do they need me when they have such a fine specimen right here?\u201d he said, sounding like a used car salesman trying to sell a Pinto.</p><p>Zane reached out and whapped Ty on the back of the head.</p><p>Ty laughed and ducked away, still trying to sell Zane. \u201cLittle bit of eyeliner, some spray tan, I mean, come on! He\u2019s beautiful!\u201d</p><p>McCoy smiled, though he looked as if he was trying not to. \u201cAm I to assume the two of you will agree to representing the Bureau in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think \u2018agree\u2019 is too strong a term,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThis is a bad idea. Remember when we were on TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Grady got fan mail for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe burned it, as you should all evil things,\u201d McCoy answered.</p><p>From Ty\u2019s expression, he was trying to figure out if McCoy was being facetious or serious.</p><p>Zane laughed and wiped his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to force you, Garrett. But I am going to force Grady because he owes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>McCoy ignored him. \u201cBut I need an answer from you right now.\u201d</p><p>Zane was still laughing over the absurdity of the idea as he glanced at Ty, weighing his options and wondering just what the punishment would be if he bowed out. Because there would be retribution from his partner. For sure. Of course, if he went along of his own free will, there might be a reward involved. A hot, naked, angry reward. Not that McCoy needed to know anything about that.</p><p>Ty flopped his hands. \u201cI mean, hell, I have about as much say in it as I usually do, so why not? I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll never hear the end of it if I say no, will I?\u201d Ty jerked his head to the side, raising an eyebrow higher in warning. He was a handsome man when he was annoyed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought. Fine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d McCoy stood and clapped his hands together once. \u201cGo now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cThe crew is in the lobby to take you to a hotel for the photo shoot. Go. Now.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood staring at him, head cocked, apparently immobilized by the prospect.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known about this, and you\u2019re just now telling us?\u201d Zane asked. It was classic McCoy to sit on this for a week and then spring it on them at the last minute so they couldn\u2019t wiggle out of it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the lobby waiting for you.\u201d McCoy sat back down and waved his hand in dismissal, even picking up his pen and pretending to study a report.</p><p>Zane pushed out of his chair with an aggrieved sigh. It took two tugs to get Ty moving. As he pushed Ty out the door, Zane turned back to McCoy. \u201cOne of these days, Mac, one of these stunts is going to backfire on you in spectacular fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not today,\u201d McCoy said, smug and smiling.</p><p>Zane growled and turned, only to bump into Ty, who had stopped right where Zane had left him. \u201cGrady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d Zane gave Ty a gentle shove toward the elevator.</p><p>Ty gave the emergency stairs a glance. He had always been an odd mix of cocksure and shy; part showman, part recluse. He loved a crowd, playing class clown or alpha dog or whatever the situation called for like a chameleon. Zane had seen videos of him from when he had been in service, dancing with other Marines, making fools of themselves to pass the time or entertain wounded companions. He was also willing to play up the sexy in person, using his good looks and charisma for any purpose he deemed fit. But as soon as someone tried to record it for posterity, Ty would freeze like he was hiding from a T. rex. He would much rather be shot at than shot with a camera.</p><p>Zane ignored the glances from their curious coworkers, focusing instead on getting Ty into the elevator. Once the doors shut, he groaned and covered his face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cA calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not my fault,\u201d Ty muttered as the elevator whisked them toward the lobby.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s your fault, Ty. Look at you.\u201d Zane dropped his hands with a huff. \u201cAnd what was he talking about with the \u2018talk to you individually\u2019 thing?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged his broad shoulders, shaking his head and then peering at his hands like he was examining his fingernails. He definitely knew something.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane rumbled.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he insisted. His eyes were wide and sincere, but he couldn\u2019t fool Zane. Not after a year of living together.</p><p>Zane took a step, intending to pin his partner to the wall to get some answers, but then the elevator pinged to signal their arrival at the first floor, forcing him to halt.</p><p>\u201cWe will be discussing this later,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips twitched and his eyes danced, but he didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I might not have minded this with a little forewarning,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cHow I became anyone\u2019s idea of a goddamn pinup, I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Ty just looked back at him, blinking innocuously. As the doors began to grind open, he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re my idea of a pinup,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane snorted, amused by how easily Ty could still charm him. He brushed his fingertips over Ty\u2019s lips before turning to lead the way out into the lobby.</p><p>They didn\u2019t even get around the corner before three women in various styles of business attire stood and hurried over to them. \u201cAgents Garrett and Grady, thank you so much for agreeing to support our little project!\u201d</p><p>Ty gave them a charming smile, even though his discomfort was still obvious to Zane. \u201cWe can\u2019t really take the credit,\u201d he said, voice smooth as honey.</p><p>A slim blonde in her mid-thirties, with every hair on her head perfectly in place, shook both their hands, lingering over Ty. \u201cIf you\u2019ll come with us, we have a van waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA van?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cTo take us to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Zane slid his hands into his trouser pockets and gave an uncomfortable fake smile of his own. He and Ty fell into step as they trailed after the women.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Special Agent Garrett,\u201d asked a rather matronly looking woman with a smile on her round cheeks. \u201cDid you happen to ride your motorcycle to work today?\u201d</p><p>Zane steps stuttered as they reached the lobby doors. Ty stifled a snicker by pretending to cough.</p><p>\u201cAh, no, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Zane lied through his teeth. It\u2019d just gotten warm enough to start riding the Valkyrie again, so of course he had.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>The other woman, dressed in a dark blue pantsuit, just laughed. \u201cOh, come on, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather chew on a lightbulb,\u201d Ty said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cThat motorcycle was my favorite idea,\u201d the short woman said from the backseat of the van as soon as they\u2019d all piled in.</p><p>\u201cOh Violet, forget the bike. We want the men, after all,\u201d the lady in blue said. \u201cI\u2019m Cynthia, by the way.\u201d She reached over the seat and shook Zane\u2019s hand, then Ty\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Susan,\u201d the blonde added, her voice low and pleasant. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we should have introduced ourselves before. We\u2019re just so excited you agreed to do this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan\u2019s the one who saw you both on the news,\u201d Cynthia said.</p><p>Zane smirked. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember watching that newscast and getting shivers,\u201d she confided, smiling at Zane and then turning her long lashes on Ty again. \u201cThe presence you both had in front of the camera? I just knew I had to have you.\u201d</p><p>Zane could see Ty tensing, growing more uncomfortable with the situation. Flirting was like Ty\u2019s natural mode of communication, but recently he had grown less likely to engage in it.</p><p>\u201cThat newscast wasn\u2019t representative of us at work,\u201d Ty finally said.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it was! You were at work!\u201d Violet leaned over the backseat. \u201cAnd it\u2019s exactly what everyone thinks. That\u2019s what we want on the calendar. Something dashing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaring,\u201d Susan drawled.</p><p>\u201cDangerous,\u201d Cynthia added with relish.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Ty shifted closer to Zane, nodding and clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cSince we did the BPD officers in the jail cell, maybe we could use the cuffs in this one?\u201d Cynthia suggested.</p><p>Zane glanced at her, wondering if he should be scandalized.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we have that CIA analyst in the suit already, sort of spy style,\u201d Violet said, pulling out a notebook. \u201cThe bare-chested firemen. The two uniformed police officers in lockup. The EMT in the back of the ambulance. We need something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to go with a roughed-up, \u2018not afraid to get a suit dirty in the line of duty\u2019 look. With the guns, of course, since we\u2019ve not used any actual weapons in a picture yet.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked down at his suit, his favorite Tom Ford suit, and visibly balked at the mention of getting it dirty. \u201cMaybe you could put us in civvies and have us undercover,\u201d he suggested as he smoothed a protective hand over his lapel.</p><p>Susan gasped and grabbed his arm. \u201cUnder covers!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. What? No!\u201d Ty blurted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant!\u201d Cynthia exclaimed.</p><p>Zane felt a real flash of panic. \u201cI really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I like this even more than the motorcycle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll do the motorcycle,\u201d Ty tried, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is perfect. I\u2019ll call ahead and have them set up a bed.\u201d Susan pulled out a cell phone as the ladies in the backseat chattered and jotted down notes.</p><p>Zane leaned in and hissed at Ty. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged helplessly. \u201cI . . . I\u2019m . . . this is not my fault!\u201d</p> <p>Ty didn\u2019t blame Zane for the glares he received as they rode to the penthouse suite together. He gave himself the same glares in the mirror as two makeup artists scruffed his hair. He had a napkin tucked into his collar to keep the hair product from touching the white V-neck T-shirt he was wearing. They weren\u2019t putting makeup on him, thank God. Something about natural close-ups. Ty was trying to block it all out.</p><p>He stood when the man told him he was done, and the woman yanked the napkin out of his collar and nodded. Ty turned and headed for the other room in the suite where they\u2019d set up all the cameras and flashing things and umbrellas and what the hell ever they were. In that room was also an artfully tousled bed dressed with charcoal-colored sheets, representing the gray world of undercover work.</p><p>Ty looked down at himself. It was close to what he would normally wear: tattered stonewashed jeans, thin T-shirt that stuck close to his frame, bare feet. They\u2019d even left his accessories on him, deeming them stylish enough. A black rubber bracelet and brown leather string on one wrist, his black-banded silver dive watch on the other, his Marine Corps signet ring, and the compass rose on its leather cord. He still felt wildly out of place.</p><p>Then Zane walked in, shaking his head. He was dressed the same as Ty, only his T-shirt was black, and his dark jeans were even more threadbare. They\u2019d mussed his hair, too, slicking it back and letting it curl around his ears.</p><p>Ty tried to fight down the gut reaction to seeing Zane like that, but it was impossible not to stare.</p><p>\u201cYou both look incredible!\u201d Susan crooned as she came over and looked them up and down. She flipped her fingers through Zane\u2019s hair, then turned to Ty and nodded approval. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll both just climb into the bed, we\u2019ll get this going!\u201d</p> <p>Ty fought back a nervous flutter and moved toward the bed, trying to relax his shoulders as he rolled onto it. Zane followed, not bothering to suppress a chuckle as he sprawled back against the headboard.</p><p>They sat side by side, long legs extended, arms crossed. Ty glanced sideways at Zane, unable to suppress the smirk. There was no denying they\u2019d be laughing about this later. When Zane turned to meet Ty\u2019s eyes, the camera popped and flashed. Zane shook his head, but he was smiling and his dark eyes reflected a spark when the flash went off.</p><p>\u201cIt appears you\u2019re the good guy in this scenario,\u201d Zane said, reaching out to pluck at the front of Ty\u2019s white shirt.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re in this one together.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s jaw jumped as he fought a smile. Ty grinned and the camera went off again.</p><p>\u201cGet it? Good and evil in bed together?\u201d His words drew laughter, just not from Zane. \u201cCome on, that\u2019s funny!\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pun!\u201d</p> <p>The cameras clicked away as they were instructed to move into various positions. Under the covers, on top of the covers, sitting up, stretched out flat, doing the same thing, doing different things. They were both repeatedly told to stop smiling, stop laughing, stop looking at each other. After a while, Ty began to feel disconcertingly okay with the whole thing, lying in bed with his partner in front of a dozen or so people who were snapping off pictures left and right. It was absurd.</p><p>\u201cOkay, boys, time for something different,\u201d Susan announced after a good half hour of them posing.</p><p>\u201cGive us some last shots to finish, and we\u2019ll have everything we need,\u201d Susan requested. \u201cFeel free to remove the shirts.\u201d</p><p>Zane tipped his head to one side and shrugged, then gripped the hem of his shirt. Several people in the room tried hard not to stare.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t blame them; Zane\u2019s bare chest and muscular shoulders were definitely something to write home about. The camera continued taking pictures as Ty watched Zane strip the shirt off. Not to be outdone, Ty gave Zane a small wink and pulled his T-shirt off as well. When he tossed it toward one of the cameras on the periphery of the staged scene, Susan told the cameraman to zoom as close as he could to the scars that covered both men\u2019s torsos.</p><p>Ty met Zane\u2019s gaze. Zane\u2019s eyes were drawn to Ty\u2019s lips, and when he looked up again there was a new heat in his gaze. It stole Ty\u2019s breath and he couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, keep looking at each other like that, please; these shots are incredible,\u201d Susan told them.</p><p>Flashes continued to pop and the camera clicked away. It all faded as Ty stared at Zane.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think that will certainly do it,\u201d Violet finally said. Ty had to tear his eyes away before he was compelled to lean over and kiss his lover in front of all those cameras.</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d Susan agreed. \u201cAgent Grady, come and take a look.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled out of bed and bent to pick up his discarded T-shirt, careful not to look back at Zane. He leaned next to her to look at the laptop. The photos taken were displayed in a grid on the screen, and Susan had the photographer go through them one by one, critiquing angles and posture, marking some as \u201cno,\u201d narrowing down the choices, all the while commenting on how photogenic Ty and Zane were.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll have to use one of the ones with the handcuffs,\u201d Cynthia said, hesitance in her voice. \u201cThey\u2019re cute and fit the tone of the rest of the calendar.\u201d</p><p>Susan nodded. She pulled up one of the favorites. The picture showed Zane stretched out on the bed in the background, hands behind his head as he leaned against the headboard. He was smirking, an almost mischievous expression that was accented by smile lines and the streaks of gray hair at his temples, bare feet crossed at the ankles, biceps displayed prominently. Ty sat at the end of the bed in the foreground, leaning toward the camera, knees apart, elbows resting on them. He held a pair of handcuffs with one finger, letting them dangle. One eyebrow was arched, a sardonic expression on his face. It would probably end up being the photo used for the calendar\u2014for the month of July, apparently, because it rhymed with FBI.</p><p>Cynthia sighed as she flipped through the rest of the shots. \u201cThese last ones . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThose are something special though.\u201d</p><p>Susan hummed as she looked at the last series of pictures. Ty leaned closer. They were more somber than he had thought they\u2019d be, all black and white and gray. Zane looked pensive and melancholy, and even Ty\u2019s playful smile seemed world-weary through the lens of the camera. The light highlighted the white slashes of scars on both their bodies. It seemed the only color in the entire canvas was the shock of Ty\u2019s washed-out tattoo. There was nothing erotic about the picture. The sheets were barely in the frame, and it left nothing but the starkness of two warriors sharing something infinitely beyond the reach of the camera.</p><p>Ty swallowed hard, struck by the image in a way he couldn\u2019t quite explain. \u201cCan I get a few copies of one of those?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Susan was already nodding before his words were out. \u201cOf course,\u201d she answered, eyes glued to the screen. \u201cIf you\u2019ll just, um . . . sign the usage waivers and . . .\u201d she waved toward a pile of papers, her eyes still on the screen.</p><p>Zane walked up to the other side of the makeshift desk, shirt back on, weapons back in hand already. \u201cAre we done?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at him, mouth gone dry. He nodded and met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cCome look at these,\u201d he requested, voice hoarse.</p><p>Zane rounded the pile of equipment as the photographer walked over to the camera. Susan followed him, still talking. Cynthia and Violet chattered off to the side. Zane stopped at Ty\u2019s side and looked down at the screen. Ty heard his sharp inhalation.</p><p>\u201cGood, right?\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane breathed. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to use . . . are they?\u201d He pointed at the last few photos.</p><p>Ty looked over at Susan, the lines furrowing her clean brow, the look in her eyes. \u201cNo. They\u2019re going for feel-good, not . . . not that.\u201d</p><p>He studied the photos again, wondering what people would see in them. There was nothing sexual or even romantic there. But there was something.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us,\u201d Zane said quietly. \u201cReally us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked for a copy,\u201d Ty told him, watching him closely.</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d The corner of Zane\u2019s mouth quirked. Then he looked up from the photo, and Ty could read Zane loud and clear. He wanted that photo, but more importantly, he wanted Ty, and he wanted him now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share,\u201d Ty told him under his breath. He cleared his throat, needing to look away from the expression on Zane\u2019s face before they really gave those cameras something to shoot. He picked up one of the waivers and signed it without reading over it, then handed the clipboard to Zane. \u201cDid you get everything you needed from us?\u201d he called to Susan.</p><p>They came over to fawn over Ty and Zane a little more, thanking them and praising the pictures they\u2019d taken. One of the assistants took down some information and gave them both a card. Ty\u2019s had Susan\u2019s number handwritten on it. Then they were left alone to go change back into their suits.</p><p>\u201cThat was kind of fun,\u201d Ty admitted as he stripped off the jeans in the little dressing area.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad, I guess. Depends on how cheesy of a photo they end up choosing.\u201d Zane changed jeans for suit pants and pulled his T-shirt off again. \u201cI might have been less out of sorts with more warning. It was just . . . weird.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded as he stepped into his trousers. He glanced toward the outer room, seeing that everyone out there was occupied, and advanced on Zane even as he buttoned up his pants. He grabbed Zane\u2019s face without warning and kissed him. Zane grunted in surprise but was quick on the uptake, hands gripping Ty\u2019s upper arms as he joined in the kiss for the few intense seconds.</p><p>\u201cMcCoy never has to know we got done early,\u201d Ty whispered as his hands dropped to Zane\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about Mac. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and stooped to gather the rest of his clothes, tossing his tie around his neck and picking up his shoes and socks. Zane pulled his dress shirt on and did up three buttons, tucked it in haphazardly, just enough to get by, and gathered up the rest.</p><p>Ty jerked his head toward the door and headed for it. They weren\u2019t far from the house, but they would have to get a cab. He\u2019d rather walk than deal with the photographers and their kidnapper van again.</p><p>As soon as the door to the hotel room closed behind them, Ty looked up and down the hallway and then back at Zane with a grin.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a room.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and shrugged. \u201cOkay? You missing hotel bathrooms that much?\u201d</p><p>The memory of their first time together flashed through Ty\u2019s mind, and he nodded. Zane must have seen the hunger streaking through Ty\u2019s eyes, because he started hurrying Ty down the hall toward the bank of elevators. Ty grinned, not even worrying about the shoes he carried or the fact that they both looked like they\u2019d already been at it in a janitor\u2019s closet somewhere.</p><p>Once in the elevator, everything hit the floor anyway, except for Ty, who hit the wall, pinned there by Zane\u2019s firm body and demanding mouth. Ty could do nothing but moan and wrap his arms around Zane\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>If someone had told him this morning that a surprise FBI photo shoot would end up with them making out in a hotel elevator, Ty probably wouldn\u2019t have been shocked. He found it funny, anyway.</p><p>Zane pulled back for breath and set one palm flat on Ty\u2019s chest, holding him in place while stepping backward. \u201cStay,\u201d Zane ordered, pulling his hand away but still pointing at Ty.</p><p>Ty nodded wordlessly, wide-eyed and unashamed. Zane did up his buttons, smoothed his sleeves, and shrugged into his jacket, somehow managing to look mostly put together, even if his face was flushed and his hair was still mussed from the shoot. He had just shoved his feet into his dress shoes when the elevator door pinged and opened. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said, looking Ty up and down deliberately before growling and striding out of the elevator.</p><p>Even after all this time, the prospect of what Zane intended to do to him made Ty\u2019s chest flutter.</p><p>The phone in his jacket began to ring. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d He fished it out anyway, checking he caller ID. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He looked up. Several people were backing away from the doors to find an alternate way up as he stood in the elevator shouting at his phone.</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d he growled when he answered the call.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready here,\u201d Dan McCoy said without further greeting.</p><p>Ty sighed. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>He hung up just as Zane returned.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said when he saw the look on Ty\u2019s face and the phone in his hand. \u201cNo! How urgent is it?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cIt was Burns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Grady!\u201d</p><p>Traffic was minimal as they made their way toward the Bureau office. Ty either wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t fill Zane in on why they were needed, and he wouldn\u2019t speculate as they walked together toward the elevators. Zane wasn\u2019t surprised. Burns was pretty closed mouthed with everything he did. It was odd that they\u2019d come here when Burns had called them. Burns worked in DC, not Baltimore. But nothing Richard Burns did was normal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty punched the button for their floor and then leaned against the elevator wall, watching Zane with sidelong glances. Zane gave him a small smile. Hopefully they\u2019d be able to get back to that hotel suite before the night was over.</p><p>The elevator lurched to a stop and the doors shivered open. Ty didn\u2019t move. Zane stepped out of the elevator first. He looked over his shoulder at Ty, frowning.</p><p>As soon as he turned, roughly three dozen coworkers and friends jumped out of their various hiding places amidst the desks and file cabinets and cubicle dividers, all of them yelling some version of \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p> <p>Zane\u2019s hand went to his gun, but Ty grabbed his wrist before he could pull it. Everyone was laughing and blowing on noisemakers, and for a long moment Zane just didn\u2019t understand what was going on. \u201cWhat the hell? This is what the damn calendar thing was for?\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed and wrapped his arm around Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJust an unfortunate necessity we managed to take advantage of. Happy twenty years with the Bureau, partner.\u201d</p><p>Zane groaned and rolled his eyes as people all around them started whistling and applauding. \u201cThe first eighteen were easy,\u201d he said, deadpan, drawing laughter as he jabbed Ty in the ribs with an elbow.</p><p>\u201cBut the last two were fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur definitions of \u2018fun\u2019 clearly vary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever, Zane. There\u2019s cake.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cYou realize last month was actually twenty-one years, right?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged, smiling crookedly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have been a surprise if we\u2019d done it at the right time.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes, fighting the huge grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Garrett,\u201d Clancy said as she approached them.</p><p>Others began surrounding him, offering him words of admiration, some bringing him cake, a drink, or a present. Probably thirty minutes had passed before Zane looked up and realized Ty was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Grady?\u201d he asked, looking over at Perrimore.</p><p>Perrimore shrugged. \u201cSkipped out about fifteen minutes after you got here.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned and scanned the room. Why would Ty leave in the middle of a party he\u2019d obviously helped plan? Zane shrugged it off. Lassiter gained his attention by approaching to shake his hand and ask for advice on how to be old. He was distracted by more laughter and light ribbing, and he lost track of time again, surrounded by the men and women he\u2019d come to call his friends.</p><p>It was Good Friday, though, so the party cleared out quickly. Some left to spend the holiday with their families. Others wandered with every intention of heading to one of the local bars to continue what they\u2019d started here. Zane sat at his desk looking at his twenty-year certificate, which had been stolen and framed while he was gone and then presented as a gift from the rest of his team. The back of the frame was signed by everyone he worked with. In the very middle, Ty\u2019s signature stood out. Under it was written a simple note: \u201cYou\u2019re the best partner I could have asked for.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled as he read it. It was so like Ty. Short, sweet, and with a meaning that was innocuous and yet so meaningful. He turned it over and ran his thumb across the glass. Twenty years.</p><p>He was so intent on the certificate and what it meant that he didn\u2019t realize he had company until Ty sat on the edge of his desk.</p><p>Zane smiled and gazed up at his partner. \u201cWhere\u2019d you run off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was here,\u201d Ty told him. \u201cWanted you to enjoy your day in the sun so I made myself scarce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould\u2019ve been just fine with you next to me,\u201d Zane said, but he smiled and shrugged. It was a sweet thought on Ty\u2019s part, and they\u2019d been making a point not to hover over each other at work functions. \u201cMaybe you could have kept them from ragging on me about my age. Apparently I\u2019m the old man of the department, which I find hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure you are.\u201d Ty\u2019s voice was teasing, but there wasn\u2019t much heart behind the effort. He reached behind himself and picked something up he\u2019d been hiding with his body, setting it in front of Zane with a wistful smile.</p><p>Zane stared at the row of delicate white flowers stemming from a sleek black pot, nonplussed until he realized what it was.</p><p>\u201cAn orchid.\u201d He laughed, remembering the day Ty had suggested they cut and run to start a flower shop together and sell black-market orchids out of the back. He glanced up at Ty as warmth spread through him. Anyone who knew Ty may have said differently, but Zane knew he had a knack for sentimental gestures. Of the two of them, Ty was the real romantic.</p><p>Ty was smiling, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. He was fidgeting, messing with the USMC signet ring on his finger.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s that about?\u201d Zane asked, keeping his voice low as he nudged Ty\u2019s knee.</p><p>Ty looked up at the ceiling and inhaled deeply. \u201cI think you could call it melancholy,\u201d he admitted. He didn\u2019t even try to deflect it with a joke or a denial.</p><p>\u201cAbout . . . me being older than you?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty shook his head and looked back down at the ring. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . what am I going to do when you retire?\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked. \u201cRetire? I . . . can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever thought about it.\u201d The words grew more painful as they came out, as it sunk in what Ty was thinking about. Them, apart. Or not together, anyway. No longer partners.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think about it all the time.\u201d Ty reached out and ran his hand down Zane\u2019s face. \u201cYou ready to go home?\u201d</p><p>The intimacy of both Ty\u2019s comment and touch stopped Zane\u2019s immediate reply, and he considered his lover for a long moment before nodding. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Ty slid off the desk. He reached across it to gather his keys and coat. Zane\u2019s mind flashed back to the photograph of them in bed together and suddenly it was important for him to say something. He stood up and stepped around the desk to stand close, catching Ty\u2019s elbow with one hand. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>They were close enough that Ty couldn\u2019t even turn to face Zane. He tried to, brushing his cheek against Zane\u2019s nose. Zane whispered in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. Not without you.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled, crow\u2019s feet appearing briefly. He was staring at Zane\u2019s hand on his arm. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zane said, even though it didn\u2019t feel like the subject was resolved at all. He watched Ty for a moment, wondering if it was something they\u2019d need to bring up later or if the melancholy Ty had admitted to would pass naturally. That\u2019s how Ty usually handled these things.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. I\u2019ve got a hotel room all lined up for something dirty. I also have cake,\u201d Zane growled as he stepped back to pick up the napkin-covered plate Alston had given him when he\u2019d cleaned up. He dropped his voice to a near-whisper and grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll feed it to you.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed breathily and turned toward the elevators, shaking his head.</p><p>Zane glanced at the framed certificate and decided to leave it on his desk. It wasn\u2019t something he wanted to think about at home. In the reflection, he caught sight of a figure moving down the hallway. They weren\u2019t alone, after all. He turned to look over his shoulder and saw Richard Burns stepping into the stairwell. The door shut behind him, not making a sound. Zane stared for a moment, then hurried to catch up with Ty.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see Director Burns here during the party, did you?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and pushed the button on the elevator. \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned and glanced past Zane at the empty floor. \u201cPretty sure he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he was. I just saw him,\u201d Zane said with another look at the stairwell. \u201cWe can probably catch him if the elevator hurries.\u201d</p><p>But Ty shook his head. \u201cWhy would Dick be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said he called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just used his name \u2019cause I knew you wouldn\u2019t argue when I said we had to come here.\u201d</p><p>Zane searched Ty\u2019s eyes for any hint of a lie, but saw nothing to indicate one. He gave the stairwell door another hard glare. He knew what he\u2019d seen. Why the hell was Richard Burns in Baltimore on a Friday night? And why wouldn\u2019t he come say hello? What was brewing? The elevator dinged and Ty stepped in, holding the door.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, eyes still on the stairwell as an uneasiness began to settle in his chest.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Ty began to laugh when the Valkyrie turned toward the waterfront instead of the row house.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually going back to the hotel,\u201d Ty muttered, following in his old Mustang.</p><p>By the time Ty found a spot for the car, Zane had already disappeared inside. Ty gave the front of the car a pat as he walked by. He\u2019d intended to spend the Easter weekend working on her, since he\u2019d only managed to restore the mechanical and interior parts so far, but he had a feeling Zane had other plans. Ty strolled into the lobby, expecting Zane to be waiting for him, but he didn\u2019t catch sight of his partner anywhere.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady?\u201d a woman asked from the front desk.</p><p>Ty walked over, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cYour partner said to give this to you,\u201d the young woman said with a polite smile. She handed him a room key.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ty turned toward the elevators as he searched for the room number on the envelope. He\u2019d gotten a suite. \u201cJesus, Zane. You go all out, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even gotten through the door of the suite when he was grabbed and shoved against the wall. Hands found their way under his tailored suit and lips pressed against his.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou better hope it is,\u201d Zane growled. \u201cYou ready to be fed cake?\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned, looking into Zane\u2019s nearly black eyes. He dragged his fingers over Zane\u2019s shoulder, tugging at his dress shirt, enjoying the way Zane\u2019s eyes were drawn to his lips when he licked them.</p><p>Zane\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cAnd some cream too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad pun penalty,\u201d Ty announced in the deep tones of a sportscaster as he held up an imaginary red card.</p><p>Zane grabbed his wrist and pressed it against the wall. \u201cOh, punish me,\u201d he said as he started unbuttoning his shirt with his other hand.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the one being punished.\u201d They both laughed.</p><p>Ty tugged Zane\u2019s shirt out of his pants and ran his hand up Zane\u2019s belly. Zane pressed against him and dragged his lips over Ty\u2019s. His grip tightened on Ty\u2019s wrist and Ty\u2019s heart sped up. This first round was going to be hard and messy, he could tell that much.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the bed,\u201d he managed to grumble. \u201cLast time we did this against a wall, my calves cramped for a week. And my back has been killing me the last couple days.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled and nodded. He put his lips against Ty\u2019s ear, then cupped Ty through his trousers. \u201cTell me where you disappeared to tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ty huffed against Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou think you can torture me for information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I do.\u201d He nipped at Ty\u2019s ear, and a shiver ran all the way to Ty\u2019s toes.</p><p>Ty tried to laugh, but it came out as a gasp as Zane squeezed him again. \u201cI had to get your orchid from the car.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned his head to brush his nose against Ty\u2019s cheek. He was humming, as if trying to decide whether to accept Ty\u2019s explanation. He finally chuckled, then ran his hand up and down Ty\u2019s torso and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Zane\u2019s harsh whisper broke the kiss. Ty groaned. \u201cWhat were you up to?\u201d</p><p>Ty slung his free arm over Zane\u2019s shoulder, holding on tight. \u201cYou always know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a tell.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed, then sighed. \u201cIf I tell you now, you promise to still fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>\u201cMac pulled me aside. He said we\u2019re going to have to start looking at options that don\u2019t involve undercover work soon.\u201d</p><p>Zane took a small step back, his grip on Ty\u2019s wrist loosening. \u201cWell, we knew that\u2019d be coming soon. We\u2019ve had too much exposure.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cHe said we have until November when those calendars hit the shelves. Then we\u2019re off UC work and into strictly investigative stuff.\u201d</p><p>Zane chewed on his lower lip, a frown creasing his brow briefly before it passed and his fingers tightened against Ty\u2019s wrist again. \u201cMaybe we can start talking about the afterlife then.\u201d</p><p>A grin stole over Ty\u2019s lips and he nodded. The afterlife. Their plans for when work no longer called them, for when they could come out and truly build a life together. That familiar warmth began to seep through Ty as he stared into Zane\u2019s eyes. It wasn\u2019t the blinding flare of consuming heat it had once been. The flash and bang were gone, but the desire had grown into something less glitzy and more intense. Ty would never get tired of feeling that way when Zane was close.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Ty said, a hint of longing in his voice that he was surprised to hear. He didn\u2019t want to have to wait for that afterlife; he wanted it now.</p><p>Zane took Ty\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s stomach flipped at the mere thought, but he nodded.</p><p>Zane huffed, then he was against Ty again, kissing his neck, holding him against the wall and murmuring into his ear. \u201cI have something for you. Something I need to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Zane wrapped an arm around him. Ty could feel him trembling. His hand delved into his pocket, searching for something as he gave Ty a slow, sensual kiss. The moment held a sudden weight, something intense enough to push aside Ty\u2019s odd sense of impending trouble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His instincts were proven right when his phone began to ring.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer it this time,\u201d Zane murmured. His lips dragged against Ty\u2019s. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. They both knew he had to. He always answered his phone, no matter the time of day or what he was doing. Deuce was constantly complaining about Ty answering his calls during sex.</p> <p>Zane stepped away with a growl. His hand was still in his pocket. \u201cBetter not be work.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes stayed on Zane as he stalked toward the large window of the suite. \u201cGrady,\u201d he answered, voice still hoarse.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Nick O\u2019Flaherty said in a low voice, small and distorted over the phone.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d Ty cleared his throat. It hadn\u2019t been one of the ring tones Ty associated with the man.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p> <p>The simple phrase hit Ty hard, and his stomach tumbled. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s wrong? Where are you?\u201d Ty demanded as he trailed after Zane. Zane returned to his side and placed his hand on the small of Ty\u2019s back, leaning close to listen in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in New Orleans,\u201d Nick answered, his voice still pitched low. \u201cI need you to come down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been arrested. They\u2019re going to charge me with murder, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood in stunned silence for a few moments before looking up and turning to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Zane gestured for him to hit the speaker button, and Ty did.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in jail in New Orleans,\u201d Nick said slowly, as if speaking to a child. \u201cThey think I killed somebody, Ty. You\u2019ve got to help me, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, come bust you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, you were assigned here for almost two years!\u201d Someone yelled something unintelligible in the background, and when Nick spoke again his voice was lower. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to come get me out of jail. I\u2019m asking you to come down here and find the real killer!\u201d</p><p>Ty looked down at the phone and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not looking for anyone else,\u201d Nick insisted.</p><p>\u201cWho did you kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody!\u201d</p><p>Ty winced. \u201cI mean, who do they think you killed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know. But Digger and I have been together since I landed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Digger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the fucking cell next to me, Grady!\u201d Nick shouted. He regained control and whispered his next words. \u201cTy, please. They find out I\u2019m a cop, I\u2019m as good as dead down here.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes. \u201cIs this like the time you called me from Panama and said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the \u2018I\u2019ve been arrested for murder\u2019 gag only flies so many times,\u201d Ty warned.</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, one day I\u2019m going to stop coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d Nick shouted, attempting to be calm and serious but clearly losing his patience. Another shout in the background caused him to hesitate. \u201cPlease. You\u2019re the only person we know to call.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed with difficulty and frowned at Zane. Zane nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on the next flight out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Six,\u201d Nick whispered, and the nickname caused the hairs on Ty\u2019s arms to rise.</p><p>Another voice told Nick that his time was up and the call ended abruptly, leaving Ty staring at his phone.</p><p>Zane had to say his name twice before Ty looked up at him. \u201cLet\u2019s get moving. I\u2019ll go book the tickets. Should we call Mac?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to fix this before we go back Tuesday. Maybe we won\u2019t miss work.\u201d</p><p>Better to ask forgiveness than permission. That had become their motto.</p><p>Zane grimaced as he turned to get his phone.</p><p>\u201cHey, what did you want to ask me?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged and gave him a small smile as they headed for the door. \u201cIt\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>It was well past midnight when Ty and Zane walked through Louis Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans. The shops and restaurants were all closed and barred up, and very few people were walking the concourses.</p><p>Ty kept his head down, not speaking at all. He\u2019d said maybe ten words the entire flight from Baltimore, and his barely controlled need to fidget during the 45-minute layover in Charlotte had been like watching a chimpanzee trying to figure out how to pick the lock on its cage. Zane knew all the things that had to be swirling through his partner\u2019s mind. Nick and Digger\u2014two of his oldest, dearest friends, brothers in arms\u2014were in trouble down here. Trouble that Ty might not be able to help them out of.</p><p>Zane also knew Ty was concerned about showing his face in New Orleans. He\u2019d spent almost two years in a deep undercover operation down here, and he hadn\u2019t left on his own terms. Simply being seen by someone he\u2019d known then could put him in a bad spot.</p><p>It spoke to Ty\u2019s loyalty and love of his friends that he was braving the city at all. Zane couldn\u2019t think of many people he\u2019d head back into Miami for.</p><p>Ty was holding all of that in, though, keeping his worries to himself and storing them in the tightness of his jaw and shoulders.</p><p>They retrieved their one checked bag, which held a few changes of clothing and two hard cases with their service weapons in them, but Ty was too eager to get to the police station to take the time to get the guns out and strap them on.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get them out in the cab,\u201d Ty reasoned. Zane trailed after him, pulling the suitcase along.</p><p>When they stepped out of the glass doors and headed for the line of black and white United taxis awaiting fares, the humidity and warmth hit Zane like a physical blow after the long winter in Baltimore.</p><p>Ty mumbled under his breath as they walked toward the curb. \u201cUgh, late April. Never come here after May,\u201d he told Zane. \u201cOctober to April. Place is uninhabitable otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>The sound of screeching tires drew their attention to the end of the roadway, and a white van came tearing up the loading zone lane. The few people in the crosswalk leaped out of its way as it screamed past the line of taxis.</p><p>Ty took a step toward the curb, reaching under his suit coat where his gun usually was as the van\u2019s brakes squealed. It rocked to a halt right in front of them.</p><p>Someone hit Zane from behind, wrapping his head up in a black cloth and restraining his arms as he was shoved forward. He could hear Ty shouting as he struggled with his attackers, but they were both overpowered and shoved into the back of the unmarked van.</p><p>The van pulled away from the curb as the sliding door slammed shut.</p><p>\u201cStop struggling,\u201d a voice ordered Zane as his hands and feet were held down against a seat that smelled like Febreze. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d the kidnapper promised with a sadistic laugh.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, don\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d Ty muttered from another row seat. He sounded calm, and Zane forced himself not to thrash and struggle. They\u2019d have a better chance of escape once the van stopped moving.</p><p>Roughly fifteen minutes and a lot of traffic later, the van came to a jarring stop. The door opened, and Zane was dragged out and put on his feet. The hood was yanked off, and Zane blinked a few times as he found himself standing in what was unmistakably the French Quarter. He saw a lamppost with black street signs for Bourbon and St. Philip. The building in front of them was ancient, with timbers and stacked brick showing through the cracking plaster. The second story had no balcony or gallery like most of the French Quarter architecture, just a few dormer windows with light shining through their shutters.</p><p>An old wooden plank sign that said Lafitte\u2019s Blacksmith Shop was hanging over one of the many open doors. And there were people everywhere. The van pulled away, leaving them standing in the middle of St. Philip with their kidnappers and dozens of drunk revelers staring at them.</p><p>The men who\u2019d snatched them were laughing and patting him on the shoulder. He glared at them, recognizing one of the four as he finally got a good look.</p><p>Nick O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cYou fall for it every time, man,\u201d he said to Ty, a hand on his shoulder as Ty glared at him. If Nick was here, then Zane could only assume the identities of the other three. Their faces matched those of the photos on Ty\u2019s walls. Sidewinder.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Ty said, voice flat.</p><p>Nick grinned and pulled Ty into a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole too,\u201d Ty said to Digger, who gave Ty\u2019s back a pat and stepped away.</p><p>Ty was smiling, though he was trying not to, as each of the other men greeted him in turn. Kelly Abbott was there, and Zane was surprised to see Owen Johns present. The last time he\u2019d heard anything about Owen was after Ty had come out to his recon team and Owen had stormed off.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Nick greeted. He held his hand out to Zane. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d he added, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an incredible asshole,\u201d Zane said. \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him and shook his head, starting to grin wider. \u201cI can only assume this is a birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a psychopath?\u201d</p><p>Ty gave him a sad smile and nodded.</p><p>\u201cElias Sanchez,\u201d Nick answered, and with the name, the five Marines grew more somber.</p><p>Zane inclined his head. Sanchez had lost his life not in battle, but to a serial killer in New York City. The same killer who\u2019d almost taken Ty from them as well, the same one Zane had killed.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow would have been his fortieth birthday,\u201d Kelly offered.</p><p>\u201cNo it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cBut tomorrow\u2019s his birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly, man, he was the same age as me and Nick,\u201d Ty said with an exasperated wave of his hand. Nick covered his mouth.</p><p>Kelly frowned and glanced around. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-seven.\u201d</p><p>Digger pursed his lips. \u201cAnyway. Tomorrow\u2019s Sanchez\u2019s birthday. Ty\u2019s always refused to come party in NOLA, so we knew we\u2019d have to bait-and-switch you down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Zane grunted. He had a feeling the Recon boys had no idea why Ty refused to come to New Orleans. They didn\u2019t know luring him here could have put him in danger, and knowing Ty, he wouldn\u2019t tell them now. Zane decided to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>Digger leaned toward Ty, raising his eyebrows. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t celebrate anywhere else because why?\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and looked at his feet, shuffling. \u201cBecause Digger isn\u2019t allowed to leave the state for another year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we sent a CIA kill team to his bayou and he almost blew them up.\u201d</p><p>They all snickered, little boys in the schoolyard talking about a frog they\u2019d stuck in the teacher\u2019s drawer.</p><p>Zane looked around, his mouth hanging open. \u201cYou\u2019re all insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Recon, baby!\u201d Digger said with a slap to Zane\u2019s back that almost knocked him over. The man gave a boisterous laugh and headed off toward a group of women who stood drinking near the entrance to Lafitte\u2019s. Owen drifted away with him, having said nothing to Zane and barely greeting Ty with a nod.</p><p>Zane looked around, still stunned by the turn of events. They weren\u2019t here for a rescue. They were here for a party.</p><p>\u201cLife with Ty, huh?\u201d Kelly said to him. He was smiling, his hands in his pockets, just as relaxed and laid back as he had sounded the first time Zane had met him. He was an unremarkable-looking man, with hair a shade between brown and blond and eyes that may or may not have been gray. Or blue. Or green. But Zane remembered Ty talking about how capable the team\u2019s medic had been.</p><p>Zane nodded, trying to return the smile. \u201cYou never know, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Nick were in the middle of the street bickering again. Or rather, Ty had his finger in Nick\u2019s face and Nick was laughing at him.</p><p>\u201cLast time I fall for it, O\u2019Flaherty, I swear to God! Next time you call and need help, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell that to my boat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shot the holes in it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrategically! It still floats!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI coughed up glitter for a week after Panama, you prick!\u201d</p><p>Nick put up both hands to fend off Ty\u2019s ranting, but he was laughing too hard to respond again.</p><p>\u201cEvery fucking time!\u201d Ty shouted before he smacked Nick on the side of the head and stormed off.</p><p>Nick doubled over laughing.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . how many times has he fallen for that gag?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick gasped and held up his hand, displaying all five fingers. \u201cThis makes five!\u201d</p><p>Zane began to chuckle. It was Ty\u2019s one true weakness they could exploit, his loyalty to them. He had come every time they\u2019d called, and would continue to do so no matter what.</p><p>Kelly chuckled at Zane\u2019s side as they watched Ty disappear into the bar. They followed after him, and Zane\u2019s mind immediately went to the last time he\u2019d been in New Orleans, to the last time he\u2019d followed someone he loved down one of these streets.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking us?\u201d Zane asked as his wife led him down a series of alleys in the French Quarter that looked like they should be filled with vampires. Or prostitutes.</p><p>She looked back at him, her eyes sparkling and her hair cascading down her back in waves.</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and followed, willing to give anything a chance if it got her this excited. New Orleans was their treat to themselves for their tenth anniversary, and Becky had been looking forward to this for months.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this little dive I heard about. They do a sort of comedy burlesque act. It\u2019s supposed to be one of the hidden gems of the French Quarter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate to break it to you honey, but we\u2019re not even in the French Quarter anymore.\u201d</p><p>After another thirty yards, Becky paused at a weathered, wooden door set into a stone wall. They were close to the river, heading past the Market and toward the outskirts of the French Quarter. The carved wooden sign that hung perpendicular from the wall named the pitiful little establishment as La F\u00e9e Verte.</p><p>\u201cI think this is it.\u201d</p> <p>Zane glanced around and smiled weakly. They were well off the beaten path, the noise of the main thoroughfares dulled by the thick walls and crumbling plaster. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t it, we\u2019re going to end the night in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, hush,\u201d Becky muttered as she pushed through the door.</p><p>Within was a surprisingly large room. It was ill lit and crowded with scarred chairs and tables, most of which were full. The walls were brick stained by age, with patches covered haphazardly by aging plaster and thick baroque fabric. A long bar lined the far wall, and opposite that was a stage with a single microphone stand and heavy, wine-colored curtains.</p><p>There were no windows, and the light in the bar came from antique string lights overhead and sconces along the walls that held real candles flickering within hurricane lamps. Wax dripped onto the tables from many nights of lit candles that had never been cleaned up.</p><p>Zane let his eyes adjust to the dim light. He\u2019d seen worse. Better too. But also worse. \u201cWow, sweetie, you take me to the nicest places,\u201d he drawled.</p> <p>Becky laughed and led him to a table near the middle of the room. There was a folded card with the name Garrett written on it in beautiful calligraphy.</p><p>Zane pulled her chair out for her, then unbuttoned his suit coat and sat.</p><p>She leaned toward him, the firelight flickering in her eyes. \u201cI heard the two performers are incredible. And the rumor is that every Friday and Saturday night, they pick out people from the audience to join them afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, join them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh!\u201d Zane laughed and looked around as Becky giggled. \u201cWhat have you gotten us into?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh come on, it\u2019s just a rumor. It\u2019ll be fun,\u201d she said as she slid her hand into his and scooted her chair closer so she could settle against his shoulder.</p><p>A woman came to take their drink order just as a man stepped up onto the stage and took the old-fashioned microphone in his hand. The people around them began to applaud, some of them even whistling and hooting.</p><p>Zane smiled and sat back, willing to try to enjoy the evening for his wife\u2019s sake. The man on stage wore an old-fashioned suit and eyeliner, and his long hair was slicked back to the point that the candlelight reflected off it. He held a bowler hat in his hand, pressed to his chest. Zane cocked his head as he admired the man. He had wide shoulders and compact, hard muscles that showed through the thin, ruffled shirt he wore.</p><p>Becky whistled and began to laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>Zane clucked his tongue, mentally echoing her.</p><p>The man welcomed them to a night of debauchery and decadence, and almost immediately he began to pick people out of the crowd and insult them. Zane was surprised at first, but the packed audience was eating it up.</p><p>The man turned his attention on them with an appreciative whistle. \u201cWell hello, beautiful,\u201d he said in a deep voice as he took a few steps toward their table. \u201cWhere have you been all my life? Where are you from, gorgeous?\u201d</p><p>Becky laughed and sat forward. \u201cAustin, Texas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, wait your turn, honey, I\u2019m talking to your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Becky cackled and covered her mouth with her hands, looking at Zane as the audience laughed.</p><p>Zane felt himself blushing. He laughed and shook his head, meeting the man\u2019s eyes with a strange rush of excitement. He realized he was enjoying the attention.</p><p>The man on stage gave him a rakish once over. \u201cCongratulations on your face, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said, and then moved on, addressing a few other couples.</p><p>Zane watched him, his mouth ajar. He\u2019d rarely experienced even a passing interest in anyone but his wife. What was it about this guy that had caught his eye?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before a woman joined the man on stage. They made an attractive couple, with talent and chemistry. Their voices battled for supremacy at times, other times melding together smooth as silk. They sang, told jokes, and even performed some physical gags, almost like skits. And some of the sexiest costumes Zane had ever seen. He wasn\u2019t watching the sensuous curves of the woman in her corset, though, but rather the solid lines of the man\u2019s shoulders as he moved. When he offered his rendition of \u201cHouse of the Rising Sun,\u201d it raised the hairs on Zane\u2019s arms. He couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>For the last act of the show, the woman sang a rousing patriotic burlesque number as the man weaved his way through the crowd with his bowler hat, collecting tips from the tables. He would clap along with the music as he moved from table to table, egging people on and getting the crowd involved. Zane\u2019s eyes followed his movements. Over the last hour of watching him, Zane had decided that he was definitely attracted to the man. It didn\u2019t strike him as odd, but it was distracting enough that he had to sit and dwell on it.</p><p>When the performer approached their table, Zane\u2019s heart rate sped up. The man grinned at them, showing perfect teeth to go with his handsome face. He held his hat out, and Zane dug out a hundred dollar bill and tossed it in, trying to get a look at the guy\u2019s eyes. He decided they were green.</p><p>The guy watched the bill flutter into his hat, then twirled the hat around his hand and displayed the empty inside of it to them, his expression scandalized as he discovered the seemingly disappearing bill. Becky laughed and Zane grinned, impressed with the man\u2019s nimble fingers. The bill was nowhere to be found.</p><p>He bowed, then plopped the hat on his head and gave Zane a wink as he turned away.</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart gave a skip and he cleared his throat, growing more flustered and confused by his reaction.</p><p>Becky leaned closer, biting her lip on a smile. \u201cI just want you to know that if you ever wanted to hit that, I\u2019d totally be behind it if I could watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Zane muttered, but he couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing!\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed harder. \u201cLet\u2019s just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019d be fun,\u201d she said as she grabbed for her coat.</p><p>They were standing from their table when the woman who\u2019d been performing came up behind them and put her hands on each of their shoulders to keep them in their seats.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy the show?\u201d she purred.</p><p>Becky beamed up at her. \u201cOh, it was so much fun.\u201d</p><p>The woman gave her a gracious nod. \u201cWould the two of you be interested in joining us for an after-party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Becky murmured, and Zane could see the blush creeping up her face now. She looked at Zane, her eyes wide.</p><p>Zane smiled at her, but underneath the amusement, he realized he was curious. Not necessarily tempted, but certainly curious. He shook his head though, chalking it up to too many hurricanes and too much debauched revelry for the night.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but . . . we\u2019ll have to pass,\u201d he said to the woman.</p><p>\u201cShame. Y\u2019all come back any time.\u201d</p><p>Becky held her breath until the woman was gone, and then she gasped and hit Zane in the chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened!\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and took her elbow, helping her to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back to the hotel so I can take advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>They were still laughing as they pushed through the heavy wooden door into the alley. Zane glanced to his right to see a dark figure leaning against the wall further down, a halo of blue smoke rising from his lips. His back was against the wall, his hips jutting out, one foot propped up against the brick. He made an enticing, sensual silhouette.</p><p>Zane nodded at him, recognizing the outline of the bowler hat. The man reached up to the bill of his hat, tipping it to them. Zane stared for another moment before he tore his eyes away and followed his wife out of the alley.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never told me that story,\u201d Ty said with a frown.</p><p>Zane shrugged. He\u2019d never had occasion to tell it, he supposed. They were huddled around a tiny bar table in one of the quieter establishments, far away from Bourbon Street. The memories had surfaced clearer than he\u2019d expected, but he was frustrated to realize that he couldn\u2019t describe the man in the bowler hat. He only recalled the impression he\u2019d left so many years ago, but Zane supposed that was enough.</p><p>He played with the ice in his glass of Coke, fighting the desire to pick up Kelly\u2019s drink and throw it back. His one year sober chip was heavy in his pocket. Ty wasn\u2019t drinking, putting up a united front with Zane so it wouldn\u2019t be quite so hard to fight the urge to indulge. Zane appreciated the gesture, but he hated to tell Ty that no matter what he did, Zane still suffered.</p><p>\u201cWhat year was it?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201c2003. Our tenth anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t remember what he looked like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t pick him out of a lineup.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, looking almost relieved. Zane studied him for a moment, wondering why. Was it possible Ty knew the man he was talking about?</p><p>\u201cSo that was your first foray into the gay, huh?\u201d Digger asked. They were far enough into the night that Ty and Zane were the only ones who were sober.</p><p>Zane laughed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a foray, but yeah, I guess. I didn\u2019t often notice anyone other than my wife, actually. The first actual foray didn\u2019t come until I was in Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was after your wife passed away, right?\u201d Owen asked. Zane nodded. The man had been making an effort, Zane would give him that. He looked supremely uncomfortable whenever Ty and Zane displayed any kind of affection, but he was keeping his mouth shut.</p><p>The conversation drifted into an awkward lull. Zane glanced at Ty and patted his back pocket. He\u2019d stopped at one point in the night and bought a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. Ty hadn\u2019t said anything, seeming to know that giving in to this one vice would help him fight the rest.</p><p>Zane excused himself and headed outside to light up. He leaned against the old brick in an alcove off the sidewalk, trying to clear his head and enjoying the cigarette just a little too much. He could tell Ty was feeling guilty that they were here, and part of that was knowing what the atmosphere would do to Zane. Ty hadn\u2019t known what they were getting into down here, though, and none of the others knew Zane was an alcoholic. It was no one\u2019s fault, but Zane was still growing annoyed by it all.</p><p>The longer he fought the pull of all that alcohol, the meaner he would get.</p><p>A man strolling along the sidewalk bumped into him as he leaned against the wall. Zane peered around the corner of the alcove as the stranger turned. His hand reached for Zane\u2019s waist as if to steady himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. I didn\u2019t see you there,\u201d he said, patting Zane\u2019s side in an overly friendly gesture. His British accent was pleasant, and it immediately reminded Zane of Ty and the Christmas cruise they\u2019d shared. He was handsome, with blue eyes that Zane could just barely see in the dim light, scruffy blond hair, and a smattering of rakish stubble. He had full lips that Zane\u2019s eyes were immediately drawn to, and though he was half a foot shorter than Zane, he was fit and muscular.</p><p>Zane gave him a second look over, appreciating the view. He nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>The man was patting his pockets, an unlit cigarette between his lips. He grinned. \u201cI see you suffer the same vice.\u201d</p><p>Zane held up his cigarette. \u201cGuilty. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m suffering though.\u201d</p><p>The stranger laughed. \u201cFilthy habit, I\u2019m told. And the company is often lacking. I can\u2019t say that\u2019s true tonight.\u201d He stuck out his hand. \u201cMy name\u2019s Liam. Liam Bell.\u201d</p><p>Zane offered his hand and his name, finding himself growing warmer with the overt flirtation. Liam\u2019s hand was rough and strong, and Zane liked the feel of it as he gripped it.</p><p>Liam continued to pat his pockets, a frown creasing his brow. \u201cI seem to have misplaced my lighter; you wouldn\u2019t mind if I nicked yours, would you?\u201d</p><p>Zane placed his cigarette in his mouth and searched his pockets for his new lighter, but all he found was the pack of cigarettes and his wallet. He glanced around the brick wall to see if he\u2019d set it down on a ledge, but it was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cSlippery buggers, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t just lit up, I\u2019d say my boyfriend stole it like he usually does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear, that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is? That he disapproves of smoking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo say the least, yes. That you have a boyfriend at all is distressing.\u201d</p><p>Zane choked on a laugh, growing warmer still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forget you Yanks are more coy than I\u2019m accustomed to.\u201d</p><p>Zane dismissed the apology with a wave. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just sorry I don\u2019t have a light now.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked down at the cigarette in his hand and sighed. \u201cWell. I suppose it won\u2019t hurt me to miss one.\u201d</p><p>Zane had a free pass for the weekend; he sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to miss any. He was going to have to buy another lighter. He glanced over the crestfallen look on Liam\u2019s face and shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>Liam arched an eyebrow, his lips curving into a smirk. He placed his cigarette in his mouth and stepped closer to Zane. Zane had to duck his head to place the tips of both cigarettes together, and Liam\u2019s hand came up to cup them, brushing Zane\u2019s face. Zane put a hand on Liam\u2019s shoulder, holding him still. He had to close his eyes, because being that close to the man made his stomach flutter, and no one had done that to him since the last time he\u2019d kissed Ty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sucked on the cigarette, stoking it enough to heat Liam\u2019s and start it burning. Liam stepped away, nodding his thanks as Zane\u2019s hand dragged across his shoulder. He blew smoke away from Zane\u2019s face and winked. \u201cBest chance encounter I\u2019ve had tonight.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed uncomfortably and licked his lips, putting the cigarette in his mouth again so he wouldn\u2019t have to say anything.</p><p>They stood together, enjoying their cigarettes and the warm night, watching the different sorts of people passing. A man in a top hat and cape strolled by, clicking a walking stick on the pavement. A woman rode the other way on a bike, fairy wings and ribbons fluttering behind her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an odd sort of place, yeah?\u201d Liam commented. Zane laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a big son of a bitch right there,\u201d Liam added. He nodded toward the intersection as a man walked across the street. Zane\u2019s eyes followed. It was unusual to encounter people that made Zane feel small.</p><p>\u201cHey Zane!\u201d Ty called from the pool of light around the door of the tavern.</p><p>Zane glanced toward him and waved. \u201cBe there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>Liam glanced toward the light. Ty was joined by the others and they stood around talking and laughing, waiting for Zane. It was dark enough in Zane\u2019s alcove for Liam and Zane to stare without fear of being seen ogling them.</p><p>Liam looked Zane up and down one last time. \u201cLucky him,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Zane glanced at him, surprised. Typically when people saw Ty, the response Zane expected was \u201clucky you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll see you around again. Without your boyfriend,\u201d Liam added, giving Zane another wink before he turned and made his way down the darkened sidewalk, away from the tavern.</p><p>Zane took a step to watch him walk away. He had no intention of ever being with someone else again, but he could see why Ty enjoyed a harmless flirtation now and then. It was quite the ego booster. And kind of a turn-on. He wanted to get Ty back to the hotel and into a bed now. Thank you, stranger. He pursed his lips, turning his back on Liam Bell\u2019s retreating form and strolling toward Ty and the others.</p><p>Ty put a hand around his waist when he joined them. \u201cMaking friends?\u201d</p> <p>Zane shook his head. \u201cArranging a tryst for later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Ty asked, his tone as casual as Zane\u2019s had been. \u201cWell, what happens in NOLA . . . goes home with an STD.\u201d</p><p>A scream tore through the night and interrupted their laughter. Zane wasn\u2019t the first to push through the door of the bar, but he could see the commotion over the shoulders of the men in front of him. A woman was in hysterics, being held in place by two men who were trying to ascertain what had frightened her so much. She finally gave up on words and pointed to the tiny bathrooms at the back of the bar.</p><p>A red stiletto sat in the doorway, blocking the door open. Beyond, Zane could see one bare foot on the floor.</p><p>Nick forced his way through the crowd, reaching the bathrooms first. \u201cI\u2019m a cop, I\u2019m a cop, move aside,\u201d he kept repeating, until he\u2019d almost cleared out the area. One look into the bathroom was all he needed. He didn\u2019t even try to step in to check the girl. He turned to them and gave a curt nod. \u201cCall it in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t let anybody leave.\u201d</p><p>Owen and Digger had stayed near the entrance, and they closed in to block the doors, preventing anyone inside from exiting. The patrons began to protest, panic building as they realized they were trapped.</p><p>\u201cEveryone stay calm,\u201d Zane called out, raising his badge so people could see it. \u201cRemain calm until the police arrive and we\u2019ll get this sorted out. We\u2019re containing the scene and material witnesses, that\u2019s all this is. We thank you for your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>The crowd began to calm with his words. Nick nodded to him and smiled gamely. None of them were armed because neither Ty nor Zane had been given the chance to get their weapons before they\u2019d been kidnapped. And it was merely luck that Zane still had his badge on him. He was surprised Ty hadn\u2019t flashed his as well to help him calm people. Zane took a moment to glance around the bar for his partner. But Ty was gone.</p> <p>Nick knelt at the door to the tiny bathroom and peered through the crack left by the shoe wedged in it. He had no jurisdiction down here, but it was ingrained to try to preserve a crime scene and that\u2019s what he\u2019d done. He felt someone kneel beside him, and was surprised to find Zane instead of Ty there.</p><p>Zane gave him a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll have to do for your sidekick this time. Ty\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Where\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. He was right beside me one second, then he was gone. He had to have slipped out before you said to block the exits. Fire hazard, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cops can arrest me when they get here,\u201d Nick muttered.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cIs this a murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say so, but I\u2019m sure as hell not touching anything to find out. I\u2019ll fake getting pegged for a murder all day, but I don\u2019t want to do it in real life. You got a pen or something?\u201d</p><p>Zane dug around in his pockets and pulled out a Bic. Nick took it and nudged the door open wider. It was mostly out of habit and curiosity that he was looking at the scene, because the FBI didn\u2019t have jurisdiction here, and the Boston Police Department sure as hell didn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cLigature marks,\u201d he whispered to Zane. \u201cDefinitely a crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that in her hand?\u201d Zane asked. He glanced over his shoulder at the people around them trying to peer in.</p><p>Nick waved for Kelly, and the man came over to usher people away. Nick smiled. Sidewinder had never been used to investigate crimes, but Nick had to give the boys credit for being able to handle crowd control. Except for Ty, who had bailed on them.</p><p>With a bit more privacy to work with, Nick gently lifted the girl\u2019s fingers with the tip of the pen. She was holding a small white bag in her palm. Its contents had spilled open: dried herbs of some sort. Probably drugs, but not the kind Nick usually saw at murder scenes. The fact that they were still there meant they weren\u2019t anything to write home about. In her other hand was a small strip of paper. Nick was careful not to touch it as he pushed her fingers aside.</p><p>Zane crowded closer to him, and Nick shifted to let him see. Zane reached his phone over the girl\u2019s hand and snapped a picture. They could hear the sirens drawing near, so they both stood and backed away from the door. They helped Kelly keep people away from it until the police took over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the FBI and Boston PD doing here?\u201d one of the officers asked Zane, his shoulders squaring like he was preparing for a fight.</p><p>\u201cJust on vacation,\u201d Zane said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t touch a thing, just tried to lock it down until you got here,\u201d Nick assured the man. \u201cAll we want to do is give our statements and move along.\u201d</p><p>The cop eyed him suspiciously, but he finally gave a nod and took down their accounts. Nick didn\u2019t have to tell the others not to mention Ty being there. They all knew he\u2019d spent a few years undercover in the city. Whatever his reasons for disappearing, they were probably good ones.</p><p>It was nearly an hour after the discovery of the body before they were allowed to leave.</p><p>\u201cLeast they could have done was thank us for helping,\u201d Owen muttered as they trudged across the street into a crowd of curious onlookers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky they didn\u2019t arrest Nick for poking the dead girl,\u201d Digger said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t poke her. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooked like you poked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed ahead of them, and slowed to let Nick catch up. He glanced at Nick, smiling wryly. \u201cI forget how much you and Ty have in common sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, until O starts taking it up the ass, they\u2019re not as alike as you think,\u201d Owen mumbled from behind them.</p><p>Nick turned and held up his hand, stopping the group in the middle of the road. \u201cEnough with that bullshit, hear me?\u201d He tried to catch his breath to add more, to tell Owen that he did in fact enjoy such things, to finally put up the united front Ty deserved, but a hand on his arm stopped him. He turned to find Ty there, looking sheepish.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you go, man?\u201d Kelly demanded. \u201cLeft us there to do the dirty work.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around guiltily. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the locals catching sight of me. And all those people with cameras in their phones, I had to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Owen asked. He was still scowling, transferring his irritation from Nick to Ty.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly friendly with the locals when I was undercover, okay? I don\u2019t want to spend my weekend in lockup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Digger added.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Ty snapped. He nodded at Nick. \u201cWas it a murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Looked like it might be drug related.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. She was strangled. Pretty efficient. The scene wasn\u2019t messy and the drugs were still there. If that\u2019s even what they were. Drug deal gone wrong would have been more spontaneous. And the bag in her hand didn\u2019t look like any drug I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, she had a bag in her hand? What kind?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>Zane and Nick shared a glance, then both shrugged. \u201cIt was just a little white bag,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Ty held up his hand, making a circle out of his thumb and forefinger. \u201cAbout this big? Full of herbs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cI saw you take a picture. What was that of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw me? How? Where were you?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cAround. Did you get a picture of the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She had a slip of paper in her other hand,\u201d Zane said, glancing at the others as he dug out his phone. \u201cI took a picture of it to see if we could read what was on it, but I couldn\u2019t get a good angle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see?\u201d Ty held his hand out for the phone. Zane handed it to him. Ty\u2019s frown deepened as he looked it over, then he glanced up to meet Digger\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt looks like a strip of parchment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have had her name on it then. It was a gris-gris bag,\u201d Digger said. Ty nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is a gris-gris bag?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cVoodoo,\u201d Zane said. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded again and gave him his phone back. \u201cThey\u2019re usually used for good things. Luck, love, safe travel, protection. All kinds of stuff. But sometimes they can be used to bind or hex. It\u2019s rare; most voodoo practitioners don\u2019t mess with the negative outcomes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo dangerous,\u201d Digger explained.</p><p>\u201cDangerous? What does that mean?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>Ty looked around the crowd that had formed. He took a deep breath, beginning to edge toward the nearest side street as he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s like a boomerang. The evil comes back at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreefold.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted. Between Ty, Digger, and Sanchez on missions, all the superstitions had almost killed them all. It was contagious, though, because Nick had carried his own good luck charms with him. So many that other Marines had taken to calling him Lucky. After all he\u2019d seen and been through, he was willing to put some stock in the reality of magic.</p><p>But Zane gaped at Ty. \u201cYou actually believe in that stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo an extent, yeah. Yeah, I do.\u201d Ty shrugged. \u201cAnd you can bet people around here believe it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stronger you believe, the stronger the power of the spells,\u201d Digger added.</p><p>\u201cWow, D. Wow,\u201d Kelly said. He was keeping a straight face, but his mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cWell, the bag the girl had was white,\u201d Nick said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d</p><p>Ty ran a finger over his lower lip, wincing. He walked further into the shadows, like a magnet being repelled by the crowd. \u201cI think it\u2019s for protection. Something about protecting your home, maybe. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for any kind of protection,\u201d Digger said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it didn\u2019t work for her,\u201d Owen muttered.</p><p>They all stared at him for a second before Nick cleared his throat. \u201cAnyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we investigating a murder while we\u2019re here, or are we actually going to get to be normal tourists this time?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Zane glanced at the scowls they all gave Kelly and he laughed. \u201cThis time, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Nick muttered. His theory was that it was because they were all trained to help, but even he had to admit they stumbled over crimes more often than your average bear.</p><p>Digger shrugged. \u201cSounds like a hoodoo thing. Turf wars. The locals can handle the weird ones like that.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked relieved.</p><p>Nick wondered just how much trouble Ty would be in if someone recognized him down here. He knew Ty would never tell them until trouble reared its ugly head, but he supposed he should have expected Ty to have left New Orleans with enemies. He was suddenly very conscious of the fact that they might have put Ty in danger by luring him here.</p><p>\u201cNot our jurisdiction. Not our problem, right?\u201d Ty said.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed, but he remained silent.</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>Kelly continued on down the street. \u201cKind of a buzzkill though.\u201d</p><p>The grisly crime in the middle of their revelry had indeed cast a pall over the night, but they only had the weekend to enjoy each other, so they continued on. They hopped from bar to bar for another hour, and after a quiet talk with Zane about the alcohol, Ty finally ordered himself a few oddly colored drinks to toast the memory of their fallen brother. They told stories, sharing them with Zane so he wouldn\u2019t feel left out, and reminisced about the good days they\u2019d spent together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most of the tales had to do with Elias Sanchez, and Ty had to force himself to relax and enjoy it. It wasn\u2019t hard to push the murder out of mind; that was what they dealt with every day and he\u2019d learned to compartmentalize. He ignored the fact that Owen was ignoring him. He battled the guilt that came with every sip someone took in Zane\u2019s line of sight. He tried to forget that he might be recognized by the wrong person and bring all kinds of trouble down on them.</p><p>The ambiance and good company were finally enough to filter through the worries, and the night wound down as a success. As they were strolling toward the hotel, Ty slipped his arm around Zane\u2019s shoulders. New Orleans was still one of the most romantic places Ty had ever been. He couldn\u2019t wait to get Zane alone and finish what they\u2019d started back in Baltimore.</p><p>Nick had booked them all into the Bourbon Orleans, making a point of giving Ty and Zane their own room for the weekend. The rooms weren\u2019t together, so they said good night to the Recon boys in the elevator at the third floor, and then rode up two more to their own room.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice of him to do this,\u201d Zane said. He was working the key card to the room as Ty leaned against the wall beside the door.</p><p>\u201cMore like self-preservation. Nobody wanted to share a room with us.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at him with a smirk. \u201cHow drunk are you?\u201d</p><p>Ty bit his lip against a smile. He reached out for Zane, hooking him by his belt to pull him closer, and Zane left the key in the door and reached for Ty\u2019s hips with both hands. He pressed Ty hard against the wall as they shared a languorous kiss. Ty was ever conscious of the taste of liquor on his tongue, but he supposed the cigarette taste in Zane\u2019s mouth would combat it.</p><p>Zane broke away and opened the door, shoving Ty in ahead of him. Ty chuckled as he entered the room.</p><p>Zane gave him a smack on the ass, then shrugged out of his jacket and tossed it at the chair in the corner as he headed for the balcony doors to peer at the view. Ty hung back, enjoying the roll of Zane\u2019s shoulders and the way his long body leaned to the left without him realizing it. Ty had decided it was a cowboy lean, something he\u2019d never actually noticed until after he\u2019d seen Zane in Texas over the summer. It probably had more to do with the gunshot he\u2019d taken to his thigh than anything, but something about it hit Ty the right way.</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear a word I just said, did you?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked into Zane\u2019s eyes and began to smile, shaking his head. Zane huffed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking about how odd it is that we keep stumbling over these murders. It\u2019s like someone has it out for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, Zane, don\u2019t think too hard about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m too tired to shower and too dirty to go to bed,\u201d Zane said. He was stripping off the rest of his clothing, tossing them toward the chair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes, looking Ty up and down. \u201cYou coming to bed?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, but he made no move to undress. \u201cWill you tell me a story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA story? What are you, five?\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned. He began pulling at his buttons. \u201cTell me about the guy in Miami.\u201d</p> <p>Zane snorted. He reached to help Ty out of his shirt. \u201cWhy? Does it turn you on to hear about my past conquests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, yeah,\u201d Ty admitted.</p><p>Zane arched an eyebrow. \u201cReally?\u201d He tossed Ty\u2019s shirt away and pulled him closer. \u201cTake that shower with me first?\u201d</p><p>Ty nudged his nose against Zane\u2019s cheek, grinning.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take much to convince Ty to shuck his clothing and climb into the shower with Zane. They went about it slowly as they let the water heat up, standing in the middle of the bathroom and kissing. Zane could see them in the mirror over Ty\u2019s shoulder. He watched his hands drag across Ty\u2019s skin, leaving red streaks behind that soon disappeared. He watched the muscles of Ty\u2019s back slide, the biceps with the bulldog on it flex.</p><p>He grabbed Ty\u2019s arm and dragged his teeth over the tattoo. \u201cThis might be my favorite part of you.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head to press a kiss to Zane\u2019s chin. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s who you are.\u201d He kissed Ty again, holding him tighter. \u201cIt\u2019s you in meta form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d Ty\u2019s voice was harsh in his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t speak geek to me when you\u2019re naked. It shatters the illusion.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and grabbed Ty\u2019s ass, squeezing hard enough to force Ty to stand on the tips of his toes. He dragged him into the bathtub, kissing him messily as the water beat down on them both.</p><p>\u201cI like seeing you with your team,\u201d Zane said against Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hot.\u201d</p><p>Zane inhaled through his nose as he was thoroughly kissed, and he slid his arms around Ty\u2019s waist to pull his lover against his body.</p><p>When Ty ended the kiss and pressed his nose to Zane\u2019s cheek, his fingers were digging in harder, giving him an almost desperate edge.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder who I\u2019d be if it weren\u2019t for them,\u201d Ty said, his voice a whisper that barely rose above the sound of the water.</p><p>Zane swallowed hard. He\u2019d played that game, and all too often it resembled Russian roulette. What if he hadn\u2019t broken with his family? What if he hadn\u2019t joined the Bureau? What if Becky hadn\u2019t died? What if he hadn\u2019t gone to Miami? But all those things had put him on the road that had led him to Ty.</p><p>And Ty\u2019s road had been just as rocky, but it had led him here.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Zane said, his voice thick. \u201cYou\u2019d still be you.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head in a stubborn denial, but he kissed Zane again without offering any evidence to support his belief.</p><p>When they broke apart, the bare honesty of what Zane wanted to say hurt him all over. But it was high time these things started being said. \u201cThings have happened to us, to both of us, horrible things that changed us. If you want to tell me, I\u2019ll listen, or if . . .\u201d Zane swallowed hard. He knew that Ty had endured worse than he had, but there were dark spots in Zane\u2019s past that he didn\u2019t want to relive, much less tell anyone about. \u201cIf you want to know, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands slid over Zane\u2019s hair and he patted him before kissing him again. The water was still pounding down on Ty\u2019s back, running in rivulets down his face. \u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and slid his hands down Ty\u2019s back to cup his ass, then slid one hand between them.</p><p>Ty\u2019s breath stuttered. He relaxed against Zane and kissed him again.</p><p>Zane wrapped his hand around Ty\u2019s cock, warm and wet and firm under his fingers. Zane had been hard since Ty had touched him, and he pushed against Ty\u2019s thigh, moaning as he dipped his head for another kiss.</p><p>Ty\u2019s breaths came hard against Zane\u2019s skin, gusting over his lips and warming his cheek as Ty pushed closer. Then his hands were gripping Zane\u2019s arms hard and they separated, Ty holding him at bay in the bathtub. There was a familiar light in Ty\u2019s eyes as he pushed him against the tile.</p><p>Zane lifted his chin as he hit the cool, slick wall with a muffled thump. \u201cGod I love it when you drink.\u201d</p><p>Ty took one more rough kiss before letting his hands drag down Zane\u2019s body. He sank to his knees at Zane\u2019s feet. Zane\u2019s head thudded back against the wall. His breath came out with a shudder as he watched.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t waste time. He rarely did, not when Zane was already hard and begging for it. He gripped one of Zane\u2019s hips with one hand, taking Zane\u2019s cock in the other and pumping him as he let his lips bump against the head. He looked up, giving a teasing lick. Zane narrowed his eyes and reached for him, cupping his palm around the back of Ty\u2019s head, tugging. Ty didn\u2019t make him wait any longer, but he did force Zane to be patient as he slid his lips over Zane\u2019s cock with agonizing slowness. Ty never did anything that slow unless he was trying to drive Zane insane.</p><p>It was working.</p><p>Zane curled the fingers of his free hand into a fist and tried to breathe evenly.</p><p>Ty\u2019s free hand splayed against Zane\u2019s hip, and he finally, mercifully, dipped his head to take Zane all the way into his mouth. Zane bit his lip and squeezed his eyes shut, concentrating on Ty\u2019s tongue and the warm slide of his cock into Ty\u2019s mouth. A clicking noise from the outer room filtered through his pleasure, like someone trying to use a key that wasn\u2019t working. Zane glanced at the door to the bathroom, which they\u2019d left wide open. Ty didn\u2019t seem to care about any noises as he worked, trying to make Zane come as quickly and messily as possible\u2014something he was singularly good at.</p><p>Zane groaned and closed his eyes, forgetting the sounds. There was something too debauched about Ty on his knees, water streaming over hard muscle and smooth skin, Zane\u2019s hard cock sliding between his lips, forcing them apart to find his flickering tongue. To top it all off, Ty met his eyes, then ducked his head forward, taking Zane into the back of his throat, burying his nose against Zane\u2019s groin and pulling him close as if he couldn\u2019t get Zane deep enough.</p><p>Zane smothered a curse, and his gut clenched. He had no control around Ty; never had, never would. He took Ty\u2019s head in both hands and pumped his hips, feeling the head of his cock forcing its way past Ty\u2019s tongue to hit the back of his throat. He gave a plaintive grunt as Ty pulled back, tugging on Ty\u2019s head until Ty let him thrust in again. How the hell he did that without gagging, Zane would never know. He\u2019d been practicing, but he still couldn\u2019t manage. What he did know was there was very little he enjoyed more than shooting a load into Ty\u2019s mouth and watching him swallow it down. Ty always hummed when he blew him, and he moaned when he swallowed.</p><p>He half bent over in reaction as the trembling started, and he grabbed at Ty\u2019s shoulder as he started to come, teeth gritted.</p><p>But Ty didn\u2019t swallow this time. He pulled back just enough, holding Zane\u2019s hip against the shower wall with one hand so Zane couldn\u2019t chase his mouth, and he pumped Zane dry with the other hand, letting cum spurt all over his chin and neck. It hit Ty\u2019s skin, and Zane could see it dripping down Ty\u2019s throat, sliding off his lower lip. It just made Zane\u2019s climax more intense, like he was marking his territory. He choked off a curse as the heat flooding him left him dizzy.</p><p>Ty kept at it until there was nothing left but Zane\u2019s whimpers, then he let Zane slide out of his hand and looked up at him, licking his lips and wiping his palm across his chin. Zane dragged his fingers along those lips before tapping under Ty\u2019s chin, wanting him to stand.</p><p>Ty climbed to his feet, diving into the kiss Zane had ordered with alarming obedience. He pressed against Zane, hips flexing as he delved into another, more demanding kiss. Zane could taste his cum on Ty\u2019s lips. Ty was hard against him.</p><p>\u201cYou are too fucking hot for your own good,\u201d Zane gritted out.</p><p>Ty made a frustrated sound into Zane\u2019s mouth. \u201cGod, the things I want to do to you right now.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, biting at Ty\u2019s full lower lip. \u201cDo them.\u201d He reached for Ty\u2019s cock and squeezed.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands found their way into Zane\u2019s hair, and he continued to kiss him, holding him there by his wet curls as Zane stroked him. \u201cNext time we do this, I\u2019m bending you over that balcony,\u201d Ty said. His voice was just as strained and taut as his body.</p><p>Ty bit Zane\u2019s lip, not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough that Zane knew he was getting worked up.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Ty. Let me see you come. So fucking gorgeous when you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Zane, stop talking,\u201d Ty gritted out.</p><p>Zane laughed. He heard another sound from the room and turned his head to glance out the door. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><p>Ty growled low in his throat. \u201cNo.\u201d He swiped at Zane\u2019s cum, still sliding down his neck and chest, gathered it all into his palm, and replaced Zane\u2019s hand on his cock with his own. Zane leaned back, expecting the kind of show that Ty was so good at, but then Ty tugged at his shoulder and turned him around. Zane\u2019s chest hit the tile as Ty pressed against him from behind.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Ty,\u201d Zane gasped out as he realized what he was really going to get. \u201cGod, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s cock was already pushing at him, Ty\u2019s lips on his neck, his body hard and wet against Zane\u2019s. Then the head of his cock, slicked with Zane\u2019s cum, pressed against the tight muscles of Zane\u2019s ass. Zane pushed his hips back and Ty thrust up against him, the slick head sliding between Zane\u2019s legs. He didn\u2019t enter him, though he came close.</p><p>Ty smacked a hand over Zane\u2019s mouth and buried his face against Zane\u2019s shoulder. His other hand wrapped around Zane\u2019s chest. He drove his hips against Zane\u2019s ass, using Zane\u2019s own cum to slick the way, using Zane\u2019s body for the friction he needed.</p><p>Ty grunted against Zane\u2019s shoulder and dragged his teeth over Zane\u2019s skin, tightening his hold as he came. Zane could feel Ty\u2019s cum sliding over his ass even as Ty continued to thrust against him. He was making a messy job of it as the water ran over them. It stole Zane\u2019s breath and made his knees weak.</p><p>Zane reached behind him, dragging his hands along Ty\u2019s ribs. When Ty finally stopped moving, he let his hand slide from Zane\u2019s mouth and pulled Zane\u2019s head around into a slow, languid kiss.</p><p>\u201cNow go see what the hell that noise was,\u201d Zane mumbled as soon as he was able.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly Casanova, are you?\u201d Ty kissed him again, licking at his lips. \u201cBut if you insist.\u201d</p><p>He pushed away and left Zane in the shower to clean up. When Zane finally joined him, he found Ty standing at the foot of the bed, still dripping wet, looking at a stack of folded towels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a maid?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks like. Way to ruin the post-orgasm buzz with paranoia, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. He stepped behind Ty and wrapped him up in the towel he had around his shoulders, pressing against Ty\u2019s back. He kissed his neck. \u201cLet me make it up to you then.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>Zane hadn\u2019t heard his real name spoken in almost six months. Two weeks after his wife\u2019s funeral, Zane had begged for a new assignment, part of him hoping a change of scenery would make him want to kill himself less, and the other part hoping for an assignment so dangerous he wouldn\u2019t have to do it himself. He\u2019d been undercover in Miami ever since, nothing but pure luck and an overdeveloped sense of justice keeping him alive. He wanted to see these bastards go down, and he\u2019d do whatever it took.</p><p>He\u2019d found it hard to sleep when he\u2019d first arrived in Miami, a combination of on-the-job jitters and missing his wife so much it felt like his soul was dying. He\u2019d begun drinking to combat the dreams.</p><p>A few weeks after that, he\u2019d started popping uppers to combat the hangovers, and sometimes even in a bid to mimic sobriety. He found that it worked for his cover, and it simultaneously dulled and sharpened his mind to the point that all he thought of was the case at hand, like a pen light for his brain. He would do anything to get the wife he\u2019d lost, the life he\u2019d lost, off his mind.</p><p>His life had become a high-wire act, and every breath brought him closer to death. He had begun to place bets on what would kill him first: the drinking, the drugs, or the cartel. Tonight was a soiree, held to celebrate the success of a deal Zane had been active on closing. He\u2019d also been active on sending the details to his handler, and he lived in fear of being found out.</p> <p>The rooftop garden in downtown Miami had been commandeered by the Miami boss, and no expense had been spared to entertain their new partners from Colombia. Alcohol and heroin flowed freely, mixed with multicolored designer drugs and neon blue drinks that looked like antifreeze and kind of tasted like it too. Expensive escorts, both male and female, roamed the crowd, offering their services.</p><p>\u201cXander,\u201d a man said as he approached Zane. Zane smiled and turned toward his boss, accustomed to the fake name. His boss had a woman on each arm, both smiling and beautiful, eyes raking up and down Zane\u2019s frame. \u201cI have your yearly bonus,\u201d el Jefe said with a sideways leer at one of the women.</p><p>Zane glanced at her, and his stomach turned at the thought of taking another woman to bed.</p><p>\u201cGracias, Jefe. But no thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d el Jefe asked. \u201cHer tits are perfect and her ass is sublime!\u201d He smacked the escort\u2019s ass to prove his point.</p><p>Zane laughed and nodded, though his mind was still desperately churning.</p> <p>\u201cJefe, I think maybe I\u2019m not his type,\u201d the woman said with a pout.</p><p>Zane was nodding before he could think twice, latching on to that excuse like a lifeline.</p><p>El Jefe began laughing and slapped Zane\u2019s shoulder. He dragged Zane along with him, taking him toward a corner where people sat drinking and laughing, some sprawled on the plush couches, others perched on the furniture, showing off their wares for anyone interested.</p><p>\u201cYou pick your own prize, Xander! Have fun tonight, you deserve it!\u201d el Jefe said as he left Zane there and returned to the two women he would be taking for himself.</p><p>Zane watched him go, one eyebrow raised as he realized that nobody cared who he took to bed tonight as long as he didn\u2019t rain on anyone else\u2019s parade. He glanced toward the open bar, fully intending to drink himself into a stupor and pass out on one of the deck chairs around the pool.</p><p>He caught a man\u2019s profile in his peripheral vision and quickly looked back to find him. For a brief moment he would have sworn it was the man he\u2019d seen in New Orleans all those months ago. When he caught sight of him again, he realized his mistake. The resemblance was striking, though, and as Zane stared, the escort caught his eye and gave him a slow smile.</p><p>For the first time in months, that smile stirred something in Zane. He swallowed hard, recognizing the same feeling he\u2019d noticed in New Orleans when the singer in the bowler hat had winked at him.</p><p>The man was making his way through the crowd, eyes on Zane, smile still soft and inviting. Zane licked his lips as he drew closer, noticing the way he moved through the crowd, appreciating the roll of his muscular shoulders. Yeah, Zane was definitely attracted to him.</p> <p>The man stopped in front of him, and Zane stared, unable to get his mind to push past the drugs and alcohol clouding his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d Zane finally asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. The man reached out and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cWait, so you picked out the guy in Miami because a dude in New Orleans winked at you the year before?\u201d Ty asked, incredulous and almost offended by Zane\u2019s story. They were sprawled sideways in the king-size bed, feet hanging off the edge.</p><p>Zane draped his knee over Ty\u2019s thighs, his fingers idly running through the fuzz on Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cYou have your type, I have mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy type is dark hair!\u201d</p><p>Zane barked a laugh. \u201cYour type is a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Zane.\u201d Ty slid his arm under Zane\u2019s neck and stretched, then pulled Zane closer to rest his head on Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Zane grinned, running his finger down the center of Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cYou remind me of him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, the escort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yeah. A little. But I mean you kind of remind me of the guy in the bowler hat. Just about every guy I\u2019ve ever been with has reminded me of him in some way.\u201d</p><p>Ty propped himself on his elbow and looked down at Zane, eyes narrowed. He seemed concerned. \u201cDid you fuck me the first time because I reminded you of some random in a bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d Zane muttered. He reached to drag his hand up Ty\u2019s arm, appreciating the slide of his muscles. Ty frowned harder. \u201cDo you think you knew him?\u201d</p><p>Ty jerked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re obsessing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not obsessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a little bit. You know who it was, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty claimed as he pushed up.</p><p>Zane grabbed for him, laughing. \u201cOkay, fine, no need to get defensive. Did you fuck me the first time because I had a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ty leaned over and kissed him, then slid his leg between Zane\u2019s, shifting his weight just enough to be on top of Zane again. \u201cYou had a gun. And knives. That\u2019s a better reason than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Zane pulled his knee up to knock it against Ty\u2019s hip. \u201cBecause mostly it was that you were hard and wet and begging me to.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted in protest, but Zane grabbed him and pulled him closer before he could turn away. He rolled him, pinning Ty beneath him to look down into his changeable eyes. \u201cMy type is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ty finally said with a small smile. \u201cI guess I owe the dude from New Orleans a thank-you if he was the one that convinced you to like dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d see it my way.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his hips and pulled his knee up higher, pushing his hard body against Zane\u2019s. They\u2019d already used up what little energy they had left tonight, though, and no matter how Ty moved, he wasn\u2019t going to convince Zane\u2019s cock to join the party.</p><p>Neither of them cared. They\u2019d settled into a level of comfort with each other where simply curling up together and enjoying the warmth and familiarity was pleasurable.</p><p>Zane rested his body on Ty\u2019s. He could feel Ty relaxing under him, feel his attention wavering. He propped himself on his elbows and gazed down into Ty\u2019s eyes with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we\u2019re done here, you\u2019re going to go sit out on the balcony and smoke a cigar, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him. \u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>Zane lowered himself and cupped Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cBecause it\u2019s how you mourn,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd I have a feeling that tonight you need to mourn.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked rapidly and seemed to be fighting to swallow past a lump in his throat. \u201cI never did say good-bye to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Zane gave him a chaste kiss and then rolled off him. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a smoke with you. Then I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, but he reached out to grab Zane\u2019s arm and stop him. He pushed up onto his elbow. \u201cZane.\u201d His voice was hushed and pensive. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m not capable of expressing how grateful I am for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Ty put a hand to his own chest, visibly struggling to find the right words. \u201cFor your . . . So few people have ever understood the way I work. In here.\u201d He tapped his chest. \u201cThank you for . . . your insight.\u201d</p><p>The words were sincere, but so unlike anything Ty usually said. Zane was struck dumb by the notion. He could only nod.</p><p>Ty rolled out of bed, breaking the spell of the moment. Zane lay stunned for another few seconds as Ty pulled on a pair of sweatpants. Then he sat on the end of the bed, watching Ty, letting his words settle somewhere deep. His fingers rested on the pile of fresh towels, and his eyes were drawn to one of them. He didn\u2019t know why it bothered him, but they were folded wrong, different from the others in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispered. Ty\u2019s OCD was starting to rub off on him. He forced himself to get up and pull on his boxers and follow Ty to the balcony.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a story, you know,\u201d he said as soon as he stepped out.</p><p>\u201cA story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I told you one of mine, you have to tell me one of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of mine are quite as lascivious as yours,\u201d Ty mumbled as he settled into one of the chairs.</p><p>\u201cHumor me. Tell me about the Marine you said you got involved with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, nope, nope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on! Please?\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across Ty\u2019s face and he glanced sideways at Zane. He was teasing him, the bastard.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Ty drawled, amused.</p><p>Zane brought out his pack of cigarettes, but Ty reached and placed a hand over them. Zane met his eyes, prepared to argue for his right to smoke while they were here, but then Ty pulled one of his cigars out and handed it to Zane instead.</p><p>\u201cCuban?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re not a Fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your lighter?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cI lost it.\u201d</p><p>Ty flopped his hands dramatically. \u201cThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things, Zane!\u201d</p><p>The scuff of a boot heel below drew Zane\u2019s attention before he could respond. They both sat up straighter, peering at the edge of the balcony. Zane jumped when a hand reached up and grabbed onto the bottom of the railing. They were five stories high.</p><p>A second later, Nick\u2019s head appeared over the edge. All Zane could do was blink at him.</p><p>Nick grinned and pulled himself up, rolling over the railing and landing with ease and silence. The man was an impressive specimen, Zane would give him that.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cMaid parked a housekeeping cart in front of our room. We couldn\u2019t get it to budge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo climbing the building was easier than climbing over the cart?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, then turned to peer over the railing. \u201cCome on, son, you\u2019re getting slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t had occasion to climb buildings in the last couple years, okay?\u201d a voice said from over the edge. \u201cWhy do you know how to do this so easily?\u201d</p><p>Nick reached down and helped Kelly climb onto the balcony. Kelly leaned against the railing and took a deep breath as Nick clapped him on the shoulder. They both looked at Ty and Zane, grinning.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane, not even trying to explain.</p><p>Nick pulled two bottles out of his pockets and offered them to Ty and Zane. The one he handed Zane was water. Zane glanced up at him, surprised. How the hell did Nick know he wouldn\u2019t drink a beer? Nick merely gave him a gentle smile. He took another beer out of somewhere and sat in the chair beside Ty, kicking his feet onto the railing. Kelly did the same, settling in the chair on Zane\u2019s other side and producing more bottles, setting them on the ground for later.</p><p>Nick took a long drink as Zane stared at his profile.</p><p>Nick smiled, not looking at them. \u201cWe knew you\u2019d be out here eventually. After you got the knocking boots out of the way. The housekeeping around here is kind of aggressive, huh? They tried to get in our room twice after we got in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we got extra towels while we were in the . . . shower,\u201d Zane said before he could think better of it.</p><p>\u201cYou dirty little bunnies,\u201d Kelly mumbled, smiling.</p><p>Ty shook his head and looked at Nick. \u201cHow many floors did you just climb up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly two, why?\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed and touched his beer bottle to Nick\u2019s, and then Kelly\u2019s, and then Zane\u2019s water bottle before taking a drink.</p><p>\u201cWere we interrupting?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ty was just getting ready to tell me about the Marine he was fucking back in the day,\u201d Zane answered.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Nick asked, voice breaking. \u201cJesus, did everyone know you were queer but me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>Zane tossed his head back and laughed.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear it,\u201d Kelly said with obvious relish. He sat forward. \u201cWas it someone we were stationed with?\u201d</p><p>Nick muttered and jerked his head, but he didn\u2019t comment further. Ty just rolled his eyes. He gave the other two men a wary glance. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any shit for this if you two listen in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick solemnly held up a hand, but Kelly shook his head. \u201cNo promises.

He reached out and slid his fingers into Ty\u2019s hand, squeezing.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said with a deep inhalation. \u201cYou asked for it.\u201d</p><p>Corporal Tyler Grady sat in his rack, reading the letter for perhaps the tenth time. He had known he\u2019d get news like this one day, but it still hit him hard. His eyes traced over the handwriting again.</p><p>David Whitlock had written to congratulate him on making Force Recon. He\u2019d ended the letter by telling Ty that he\u2019d met someone in college. He was happy, and he thought he might be in love. But David was asking Ty\u2019s permission to proceed, saying that he would wait if Ty asked it, just like he\u2019d promised when Ty left.</p><p>Ty shook his head as he read it. He wouldn\u2019t stand for that. David deserved so much more than Ty could ever have given him.</p><p>He pressed the letter to his bare chest and fell back onto his rack to stare at the canvas top of the tent above his head. After a moment he threw his arm over his eyes. He\u2019d left for this very reason, to give David the freedom to move, to give himself options that didn\u2019t involve sharing his life with someone he couldn\u2019t commit himself to completely.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t make it feel any less like heartbreak.</p><p>The rack beside him creaked as someone sat down. Ty peered out from under his arm to see dark blond hair, compelling eyes that changed from blue to gray and back, and a smirk that always looked like it needed to be slapped.</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><p>Captain Chas Turner pursed his lips. \u201cOh, I know, it\u2019s the intelligence officer, bury your head in the sand.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat up. \u201cGood afternoon, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Corporal.\u201d His eyes drifted to the letter Ty held in his hand. \u201cI came to discuss the new policy I\u2019ve instituted with the mail.\u201d</p> <p>Ty inclined his head as a sinking feeling started in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cEvery batch, we open a letter or two at random, just to make sure nothing important is being leaked. Yours happened to be that random letter this week.\u201d</p><p>Ty held his breath and waited for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>Turner clucked his tongue and looked behind him to make sure they were alone in the barracks. The rest of the boys were outside, blowing off steam. When Ty had left them, they\u2019d been creating a scarecrow out of munitions debris and dressing it in someone\u2019s pilfered salty cammies. Ty had received his letters before the real fun could start and chosen to retreat to read them in peace, missing the culmination of the exercise.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition for you,\u201d Turner said when he looked back at Ty.</p><p>Ty continued to stare at him, wary of the man no one in the group trusted. He was the very epitome of what they called a Secret Squirrel. Always running dark, always skittering here and there. He ran too many cloak-and-dagger missions, and it was like he\u2019d forgotten how to be straightforward.</p><p>\u201cI wish you to meet with me, privately, once or twice a week.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s back stiffened. \u201cIs that an order, Captain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet. And I\u2019ll make sure your mail never gets read again. So you can write back to your . . . friend and tell him what\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blackmailing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yes. But I\u2019m proposing a mutually beneficial arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would be what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Turner leaned forward, propping his elbows on his knees. Ty narrowed his eyes. \u201cI keep your secrets. You keep mine. And we both get to blow off a little steam in a way far more interesting than creating scrap metal targets for the rocket launchers.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around the racks, feeling himself growing warm. He met Turner\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re blackmailing me to have sex with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put it that way, it sounds so crass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly would you like me to call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrass works, I guess.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other as Ty mulled it over, his stomach tumbling end over end. He really didn\u2019t have much choice if he didn\u2019t want to be exposed. Ty clenched his jaw. \u201cFuck off, Captain.\u201d</p><p>Turner clucked his tongue, then grinned. \u201cI was hoping you might react that way.\u201d</p><p>Ty tried not to frown, but his confusion was clear.</p><p>\u201cYou have backbone, I\u2019ll give you that. Not afraid to tell an officer to go fuck himself. Good. I have a real proposition for you now. One I think you\u2019ll want to give consideration to.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and stood, growing angry enough to forget the man\u2019s rank. Turner stood with him, both of them in the tight space between the racks.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Corporal. There are matters we need to discuss.\u201d Turner moved away, but Ty remained rooted to the spot. Turner looked over his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not a request.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood by his rack for another few seconds, stunned. This would probably end with one of them throwing a punch, or at least filing some sort of complaint, but Ty\u2019s survival instincts told him to follow and see what exactly Turner was up to. He stuffed the letter under his pillow and grabbed his shirt to pull it on as he followed Turner across the camp to the officer\u2019s quarters.</p><p>Turner glanced around as he ushered him inside, making sure no one had seen Ty go in, then latched the door behind him. Ty struggled not to fidget, feeling off-balance and a little cornered.</p><p>\u201cThere are benefits to having a private rack,\u201d Turner murmured as he circled Ty and stood to face him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s jaw clenched hard, and he had to fight not to turn around and leave.</p><p>Turner snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that. Have a seat.\u201d He went to a trunk in the corner.</p><p>Ty finally moved to sit in the field chair Turner had indicated, beside a small table made out of a metal water barrel with a bullet hole in it. The rack on the other side served as a second seat.</p><p>Ty watched out of the corner of his eye as Turner muttered to himself and rummaged through the trunk. He pulled out a wooden box and set it on the barrel between them. A fan in the corner chugged as it rotated, working to cool off the quarters. It was the only sound.</p><p>Turner sat on the end of his rack and met Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty\u2019s shoulders stiffened.</p><p>\u201cYou play chess?\u201d Turner asked.</p><p>Ty looked down at the box. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Turner pulled the lid off it, unfolding it to reveal a portable chess set. \u201cThinking man\u2019s checkers. I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me in here to beat me at chess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ty. But I\u2019m not going to force you to have sex with me, either, if that\u2019s what you came in here thinking.\u201d He looked up and raised an eyebrow, smirking.</p><p>Ty glared at him. The man played mind games, and Ty had never been anything but a straight shooter. He didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cYou see, by the time I\u2019m done with you, you\u2019re going to be making the first move. And after that, we\u2019ll be looking at quite a few sessions of what is no doubt going to be very athletic, very angry sex.\u201d</p><p>Ty gaped, but he couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself.</p><p>\u201cYou see? You\u2019re already intrigued.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cLook, we just got back from a five-day hump in the desert, and all I wanted was a cool drink and an hour in my rack to sleep. If you want to play games, there are other intelligence officers around camp to play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the thing, Ty,\u201d Turner whispered. He leaned closer. \u201cYou offer far more to me than they do.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed hard and ran his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you join the Marines and leave this David kid behind? He obviously loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSense of duty? Adventure? Fear of commitment? Fear of taking it up the ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your plan to make me beg for sex just to shut you up? Because it\u2019s kind of working.\u201d</p><p>Turner laughed and shook his head. \u201cI want you. But not just because I want to see what you look like on top of me.\u201d He paused, obviously knowing that the visual had hit home with Ty. Then he continued. \u201cI\u2019m building a team. And I want you on it.\u201d</p><p>That brought Ty up short. He met Turner\u2019s eyes for a long minute. \u201cWhat kind of team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve seen your scores and I\u2019ve seen your evals. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re fit, you\u2019re loyal and motivated. You\u2019ve got instincts most kids don\u2019t come out here with, you\u2019re already fluent in Farsi, and I understand you\u2019ve been teaching yourself Dari on the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you interest me, Grady. You\u2019re clever, you\u2019re adaptive. You\u2019ve got balls the size of coconuts. Figuratively speaking, of course. And you\u2019re pretty as hell, which actually gets you farther in these kinds of things than you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about making a difference. I\u2019m talking about files so redacted they print them on black paper. I\u2019m talking about things you could never spill to that Boy Scout O\u2019Flaherty unless he\u2019s in on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy Scout.\u201d</p><p>Turner nodded. \u201cYou two are joined at the hip. I know he dragged you off the ground when you fell out of a PT run to make Recon, and I know you carried him to the end of a course when he nearly broke his ankle, giving up the course record in the process, all so you could stay together.\u201d</p><p>Ty grew warmer, realizing how much homework Turner had done on him. It was flattering, in a way.</p><p>\u201cFor a while I thought you two were an item, but seeing that letter I realized my mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does any of this have to do with your team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say yes, you\u2019ll have to bring him with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pulling O\u2019Flaherty into anything unless I vet it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Which is why you\u2019re here now and he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted, growing more frustrated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an answer right now,\u201d Turner said with a smirk. \u201cTo either proposition. And one is not dependent on the other. You should think it over.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, dazed.</p><p>\u201cThink over it hard. Once you go down my road, you don\u2019t go back. You\u2019ll come out the other end someone else. Someone . . . you might not like. Someone this David of yours definitely won\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked him up and down. \u201cThat what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Turner shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou seem pretty okay with yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was an asshole when I started.\u201d He handed Ty a carved white knight. Ty stared at it, spinning it between his fingers. Turner kept talking, his voice low and persuasive. \u201cYou could be some anonymous white knight, Grady. If that\u2019s the road you want to take. Loyalty and honor. A drop of decency in a bucket with a hole too large to patch. Or you could be my rook.\u201d</p><p>He slid a black playing piece across the board.</p><p>Ty looked from the rook to Turner again, fighting the magnetic pull of the man, intrigued by his offer despite the feeling of foreboding growing in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cSay yes, Ty, and I\u2019ll teach you everything I know.\u201d</p><p>Ty shielded his eyes from the sun, watching the men load the deuce and a half with unmarked crates.</p><p>Turner came up to stand beside him, geared up and ready to go.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your detail?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in light on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Ty turned to face Turner, eyes growing wider. \u201cThere\u2019s a shit storm ten klicks from here. You can\u2019t head out there without a detail.\u201d</p><p>Turner shook his head. \u201cThe major disagrees.\u201d He stepped away, heading for the heavy transport vehicle.</p><p>\u201cChas,\u201d Ty hissed as he lunged to grab at his elbow and stop him. They both glanced around to make sure no one was watching. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this. Take my boys with you. Hell, take me with you, someone that isn\u2019t a goddamn paper pusher with a toy gun.\u201d</p><p>Turner shook his head and looked away. Ty shoved his arm in frustration.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Sergeant,\u201d Turner said in a harsh whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s not my call, okay? You\u2019re not ready for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you; you haven\u2019t been read in,\u201d Turner said between gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo read me in and take me with you to watch your back.\u201d</p><p>Turner narrowed his eyes. \u201cRook, just calm down, go inside with your boys. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow and you can take it out of my ass then.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted through his nose like an angry bull. Turner gave him a condescending pat on the cheek before striding off.</p><p>\u201cHey, Captain,\u201d Ty called after him.</p><p>Turner stopped and turned, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you have to be such a dick all the time?\u201d</p><p>Turner licked his lips and walked closer, looking all around them to ensure they were having a private discussion. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said in a low voice as he drew closer. \u201cBeing such a dick all the time lets you know that when I stand here and tell you I love you, I fucking mean it.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s mouth dropped open as he stared. Turner put a finger under his chin and pushed his jaw shut.</p><p>\u201cNow. You stay here and ponder that, and when I get back we\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and watched him walk off. \u201cWatch your damn six,\u201d he said. Turner gave him a cocky wave over his shoulder, but didn\u2019t turn back around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two days later, Ty stood with Nick O\u2019Flaherty and Elias Sanchez and watched the deuce and a half roll in. They kept their distance with the other Recon boys, silent sentinels as the men unloaded the bodies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grady. I know you two were close,\u201d Nick finally said.</p><p>Ty just nodded, unable to speak for the tightness in his throat.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019d let us run detail,\u201d Sanchez muttered. \u201cWhat a fucking waste.\u201d</p><p>They turned away and headed back for the barracks tent, but Ty remained, watching silently as they laid Chas Turner\u2019s body in a wooden coffin and closed it up.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ty. I had no idea,\u201d Nick murmured. \u201cYou hid your grief well.\u201d</p><p>Zane held tighter to Ty\u2019s hand, but Ty shrugged off the sentiment. He took another swallow of beer. They\u2019d all lost people they cared for. Chas Turner was no different, nor was Eli Sanchez. The losses never stopped hurting.</p><p>\u201cEli hit me harder than the captain ever did,\u201d Ty admitted. He squeezed Zane\u2019s hand, glancing at his lover and offering him a sad smile. \u201cBut when I look back and wonder what moment really made me who I am, it\u2019s him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe taught us just about every goddamned thing we know,\u201d Nick muttered.</p><p>Ty nodded and glanced at his lover again. Zane hadn\u2019t said anything, but Ty knew he was processing. He\u2019d probably come up in a week or a month or a year and want to discuss it. The thought made Ty\u2019s smile grow warmer, and he brought Zane\u2019s hand up to kiss his fingers.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Turner was one badass mother, though,\u201d Nick mused. \u201cAnd now I understand why they called you Rook when we ran those missions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they call you?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cRicochet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p> <p>Nick shrugged, smiling enigmatically. \u201cCouple lucky trick shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarine nicknames usually don\u2019t have a lot of thought put into them,\u201d Ty explained. \u201cAnd they change all the damn time. Nick had like five. I went through about ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Zane glanced at Ty and smiled. \u201cRook, huh? I like that. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>Ty winced. It wasn\u2019t a name anyone had called him in years. Possibly a decade. He liked the way it rolled off Zane\u2019s tongue, but he didn\u2019t like the echoes of the past that came with it.</p><p>Zane leaned toward him, putting his lips to Ty\u2019s ear. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stick with Bulldog.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head to capture a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop,\u201d Nick drawled. \u201cI\u2019m going into a diabetic coma over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find myself fascinated by it,\u201d Kelly said as he stared at Ty. \u201cI can\u2019t even come up with an appropriate comparison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop trying,\u201d Ty grunted. He brushed his thumb over Zane\u2019s palm.</p><p>They settled back to enjoy the silence of the night, something the Recon team had done so many times over the years. Silence was a commodity where they\u2019d spent most of their time. They had learned to appreciate it. And Zane was a man who inherently knew the value of silence.</p><p>Ty\u2019s mind drifted over the many years they\u2019d spent scratching and clawing their way through battle after battle. He and Nick had been together since the beginning, their promotions never more than a few months apart, their achievements linked in ways not many people understood.</p><p>Sanchez had come next. He\u2019d put in for Recon at the same time as Ty and Nick, and it hadn\u2019t taken long for him to fall into step with them. The others hadn\u2019t arrived until they\u2019d moved up to Force Recon, and then the six of them had been inseparable until the day they\u2019d gone home.</p><p>And then Sanchez had come with Ty to the FBI.</p><p>\u201cI miss him too,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Ty nodded and swallowed hard. Kelly sniffed.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, you know,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Ty took a deep breath, not surprised that Nick had known exactly what he\u2019d been thinking. \u201cHe called me for help,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t answer it, and two days later he was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cJesus, is that why you always answer your phone?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded curtly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand tightened in his.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have saved him, Six,\u201d Nick murmured.</p><p>Ty\u2019s throat tightened and he looked away. He covered his mouth with his beer bottle and slumped further into his chair. Zane\u2019s hand in his offered more consolation than their words, though.</p><p>\u201cEli . . . he went out with his boots on,\u201d Kelly said. He shook his head and took a drink. \u201cThat\u2019s the only comfort there is in losing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know what? Zane took care of it,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>Zane flinched, and he leaned forward to look at Nick. Nick raised his beer bottle in a salute.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cZane handled that shit. Like a boss.\u201d</p><p>Zane barked a laugh. \u201cThanks. I think.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave Kelly an incredulous glance. \u201cHow long has he been drinking?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cSince we got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not climbing back down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the word you\u2019re looking for is \u2018falling,\u2019\u201d Kelly muttered. \u201cFalling.\u201d</p><p>Nick reached across Ty\u2019s lap and tapped Zane on the knee. \u201cWe know how you handled it, Garrett. And to us, that means you\u2019re our brother too, you know?\u201d</p><p>Ty watched Nick\u2019s profile as the man settled back in his chair, throat constricting again. Nick calling someone his brother was the ultimate in acceptance from him. There was no higher honor in Nick\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . thank you,\u201d Zane stuttered.</p><p>Kelly leaned forward, holding his beer up. \u201cTo Sanchez.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard and held his beer out. Zane joined with his water bottle. The glass clinked as they each said a solemn, \u201cOorah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, buddy,\u201d Kelly said as he stared out into the night sky and finished off his beer.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>It was over-warm and stuffy in their suite, and Zane woke up feeling half-suffocated. New Orleans in late April was pleasant after the chill of Baltimore, but it seemed the air conditioning was having trouble keeping up. It didn\u2019t help that he was half-draped over Ty as they slept.</p><p>He slowly extricated himself from Ty\u2019s arms and sat up, rubbing his eyes before looking down at his lover, who lay sprawled beside him. The heavy curtains blocked the morning sun, and he could barely see Ty as he tossed and turned.</p><p>Ty wasn\u2019t an unusually restless sleeper, a fact at great odds with his waking hours. But now he seemed unsettled. He tossed his head and shifted his legs, a soft groan passing his lips. He rolled onto his side, his shoulders beginning the slow, rhythmic rocking that often kept Zane awake.</p><p>Zane watched him for a few moments, wondering if it was a dream that was causing the grimace on Ty\u2019s face. He got up to head for the bathroom, only to find Kelly and Nick both tangled on the floor at the foot of the bed. He knew they hadn\u2019t made it back to their room last night, but they had both started on the pullout sofa. It must have been uncomfortable as hell to make them move to the floor.</p><p>Nick was using a pillow Ty had tossed him in the middle of the night, and Kelly was using Nick\u2019s stomach to rest his head as he snored. Zane snorted.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and stepped over them to head for the bathroom, where he took his time, brushing his teeth, shaving, savoring the silence of the early morning. He fumbled in the dark for the pile of clothing he\u2019d left last night and grabbed his pants to hunt for his cigarettes, remembering too late that his lighter had gone missing. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised when his fingers brushed the tip of the lighter, though, stuck down in his jeans pocket. He dug it out, and a piece of paper came wrapped tightly around it. Zane scowled as he unrolled it and held it up to the sliver of weak light coming through the part in the curtain to read the words scrawled on it. It was a phone number and the name \u201cLiam\u201d in small, neat lettering.</p><p>Zane snorted. He remembered Liam\u2019s hand at his hip. Had the man pickpocketed him just to make an impression? He\u2019d certainly forced a memorable way of lighting his cigarette. He\u2019d stolen Zane\u2019s lighter, then put it back with the number around it. Impressive. And just a little flattering. Also creepy.</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty, smiling fondly as he thought about just how riled his lover would get if he saw that note. Ty didn\u2019t consider jealousy a part of his emotional spectrum, but it sure as hell was. Zane would always be more flattered by that than a stranger\u2019s number in his pocket. He balled it up and dropped it and his jeans back to the floor. He\u2019d smoke later.</p><p>He had to navigate his way through the tangle of Sidewinder limbs on the floor to make it back to the bed. He was a little annoyed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to greet Ty in the way he wanted, but he supposed he could sacrifice a morning of groping for Ty to have some time with his friends. If they ever woke up.</p><p>Kelly snorted in his sleep and tried to burrow his face into Nick\u2019s stomach, causing Nick to groan and push him away. Neither man woke.</p><p>Ty tossed onto his side, echoing the groan. Zane recognized the signs of a nightmare. Sometimes Ty woke disoriented and dangerous. Other times he woke shaken and frightened. And sometimes he dreamt of pain.</p><p>Zane lay back down on his side and scooted close to Ty, hoping he might be able to get him to rest a little more without having to wake him up from the nightmare. He placed his hand on Ty\u2019s back and rubbed.</p><p>Ty groaned again, a louder, more pained sound as he rolled back toward Zane. He gasped in a breath, as if surprised that he\u2019d woken, and blinked blearily at Zane.</p><p>Zane frowned. Ty was damp to the touch, more than he would have expected even in the warm bed. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI hurt,\u201d Ty answered, hoarse and sleepy.</p><p>\u201cIs it your back again?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. He reached down to his side, his elbow jabbing Zane in the stomach as he did so, and curled up again. \u201cFeels like you\u2019ve been sleeping on top of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sleeping on top of you.\u201d Zane slid his hand against Ty\u2019s forehead, surprised by how hot Ty felt against his warm fingers.</p><p>Ty rolled onto his back again, gasping as if his pain had spiked. He kept his knees bent, curled up as if it hurt him to straighten out. He immediately rocked back to his side, not able to stay still, then mumbled something as he slid out of the bed and staggered toward the bathroom in the dark. He tripped over one of the men on the floor and stumbled, causing Nick to cry out and lurch to his feet, ready for battle. Sort of. But Ty disappeared into the bathroom before Nick had gained his bearings.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you gay people?\u201d Kelly moaned, still out of sight on the floor. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just sleep in?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked down at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>Zane sat up, torn between being amused and concerned. He could hear Ty retching in the bathroom. He\u2019d been with Ty through allergic reactions, hangovers, and hospital stays, but not an actual illness. Ty was too damn healthy for the flu. Maybe it was something he ate. Like alligator. Or drank. Like five hurricanes.</p><p>Zane had never seen Ty so hungover he was sick, though.</p><p>Nick ran a hand through his hair and sat on the end of the bed. They could hear Ty in the bathroom, still throwing up. \u201cIs that Ty?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cHe woke up sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Kelly asked again, sitting up.</p><p>After a few torturous minutes, Ty called out to them, \u201cCheck under the pillows!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Zane called back.</p><p>\u201cNo, just look under the pillows!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Zane asked as he glanced at Ty\u2019s side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cGris-gris. Hex bags,\u201d Ty answered, his voice laced with pain. \u201cLook all over the bed. Under the mattress. Little felt bags!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all right, buddy?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cStill drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and help him!\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and shook his head. \u201cNutbar. I think we would have noticed a little bag of crunchy things, as much as we shook the mattress last night,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cOh God, please,\u201d Kelly muttered. He raised a hand as if to ward off the images.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>Zane laughed, but he started a slow perusal of the bed.</p><p>Ty was muttering incoherently from the bathroom when Zane found a small felt bag beneath Ty\u2019s pillow, wedged between the headboard and the mattress. He pulled it out and straightened, looking at the little bag with a frown as he reached over and flipped the lamp on.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t good,\u201d he muttered, turning it over in his hand before squeezing it to try to get an idea of the contents. It was roughly two inches by three, tied with a simple cord. It felt like a tea bag, like there was something dry and shredded inside. With a few hard chunks. It looked like the bag in the dead girl\u2019s hand from last night.</p><p>He heard Ty stumble, gasping for breath. He was silhouetted by the light from the bathroom, bent over, clutching his side. \u201cWhat color is it?\u201d He was completely serious, as if the color of the bag would tell him anything at all. He bypassed Kelly\u2019s legs and lurched toward the bed.</p><p>Zane was starting to feel a little queasy too. \u201cIt\u2019s red. Felt, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, someone was in here?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cHousekeeping. Had to be,\u201d Zane said grimly. \u201cI knew those towels were folded wrong.\u201d</p><p>Ty lowered his head, biting his lip as he hunched against the wall beside the bed. \u201cTake me to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd let me have the bag.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really think . . .\u201d Zane let the words trail off and shook his head. It didn\u2019t matter. Ty definitely looked ill, and Zane was more convinced by that than some fantasy about voodoo curses. \u201cAll right. Can you get dressed?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, but he didn\u2019t actually seem to be listening. He was still clutching his side when he snatched the bag out of Zane\u2019s hand. He fumbled with the string that bound the bag, and peered in. He didn\u2019t have a chance to examine the contents, though. He doubled over with a gasp, leaning against the mattress as his knees started to fold.</p><p>Nick rolled over the corner of the bed to come to his side, and Zane crawled over to put a hand on his shoulder.</p> <p>His entire body was trembling, but he was taking deep breaths, trying to fight through the obvious pain.</p><p>\u201cDo we need to call an ambulance?\u201d Kelly asked. He was finally fully awake, though he looked almost as rough as Ty did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the corpsman,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>\u201cWell, as a trained professional, I advise we call an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty gasped. \u201cFuck the shirt, just get me to the ER.\u201d He let the bag go, leaving it on the bed.</p> <p>Zane tugged his jeans on and grabbed the first shirt his fingers touched, one of Ty\u2019s T-shirts. He pulled it on as Nick tried to help Ty into a button-up flannel. Zane grabbed his wallet and Ty\u2019s, then the felt bag, and nodded to Nick. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you get him into a cab,\u201d Nick said. Ty threw an arm over his shoulders. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get the boys and we\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels like my insides are being torn apart,\u201d Ty groaned.</p><p>When they hit the lobby, it was relatively empty, but two of the young bellhops soon took notice of them.</p><p>\u201cDoes he need help?\u201d one of them asked Zane as they came toward them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital,\u201d Zane said, taking a lot of Ty\u2019s weight onto himself as Ty bent in pain. \u201cWe need a cab or the hotel shuttle.\u201d</p> <p>One of them turned to jog for the entryway and hail a cab.</p><p>\u201cToo many hurricanes?\u201d the younger man asked with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cBad gris-gris,\u201d Ty muttered to him. The man hopped away from him as if he\u2019d said he had the plague.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just food poisoning,\u201d Zane insisted.</p><p>Ty growled, pulling away from Zane and Nick to stand on his own and pace several steps. He held to his side. He couldn\u2019t seem to stay still. He would stalk back and forth and then curl as pain overtook him, then start the whole thing again.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, the hotel\u2019s courtesy shuttle was pulling up outside and they were on their way to the hospital. Ty rocked in the backseat, fumbling with the little red bag he\u2019d snatched from Zane\u2019s hand as he tried to get it open.</p><p>\u201cGive me that,\u201d Zane said, taking it out of Ty\u2019s hand and putting it in his pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s not scare the locals any more than we have to until we find out what\u2019s wrong.\u201d When the van pulled up to the emergency entrance, he climbed out of the van and reached back in to help Ty out.</p><p>Ty gripped his hand hard and practically fell out of the van. Someone called to them, asking if he needed a wheelchair. Ty nodded wordlessly. It seemed he wasn\u2019t going another step.</p> <p>\u201cI know what it is, Zane,\u201d he gasped. He looked up at Zane, and Zane could have sworn that he was smiling. \u201cFucking kidney stone.\u201d</p><p>Zane groaned and covered his face with his hands for a moment, ashamed to be relieved by Ty\u2019s self-diagnosis. \u201cAnd you know this from experience, I take it?\u201d</p><p>Ty practically fell into the wheelchair that was brought to him, and he leaned over and began the incessant rocking again. \u201cLast time was like the most pain I\u2019ve ever been in . . . in my life,\u201d he told Zane haltingly. His eyes were watering; he was very nearly in tears. He was smiling, though.</p><p>Zane leaned over and put one hand on each of the arms of the wheelchair so he could look Ty in the eyes. \u201cConsidering I know what sort of injuries you\u2019ve had, that doesn\u2019t make me feel better. At all.\u201d He stood up and gestured for the orderly to push Ty inside.</p><p>\u201cAt least it won\u2019t kill me,\u201d Ty replied as he was pushed away.</p><p>Ty stared at the ceiling tile and the block of light above him. The nurse had put something he couldn\u2019t pronounce into the IV in his arm about two minutes ago, and the space-time continuum had opened up shortly thereafter. His ears buzzed, his eyes wouldn\u2019t blink, he couldn\u2019t feel his extremities, and there was a low sound in the distance that might have been his own breathing.</p><p>But he no longer hurt.</p><p>The lady who\u2019d taken his insurance information had promised to go retrieve Zane, and Ty was simply reminding himself to continue breathing until he got there.</p><p>\u201cHey, how are you doing?\u201d It was Zane, finally. Nick and Digger were with him, looking more bemused than worried.</p><p>Ty turned his head slowly, his eyes focusing on Zane with what he could only consider utter contentment. \u201cBetter,\u201d he managed to answer. \u201cKidney stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, somebody\u2019s stoned,\u201d Digger said with a laugh.</p><p>Zane stopped at the bedside, hands in his pockets. \u201cDid they give you something for the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Ty practically crooned. He shifted on the narrow hospital bed, pulling the blankets around him to ward off the chill caused by the saline being pumped into him. There was still discomfort all through his lower half, but it was dull enough that he didn\u2019t care. He had even welcomed the catheter they put in because it had been less painful than what he\u2019d been going through. \u201cThey took a CT and said it should pass soon.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cCan I have the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bag?\u201d Digger asked. He and Nick still hung back by the door.</p><p>Zane looked reluctant to hand it over as he pulled it out of his pocket, pinched between two fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, son of a bitch,\u201d Digger said, and he shifted his weight from one foot to the other as he dug around in a pocket.</p><p>Nick held out one hand, and Digger slapped a twenty dollar bill onto his palm. \u201cNever bet against the crazy hoodoo ex,\u201d Nick said as he folded the money into his own pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both assholes,\u201d Ty told them.</p><p>Zane turned to look at them, and he was still glaring when he met Ty\u2019s eyes again. He held the bag up. \u201cDon\u2019t scare the doctors with this voodoo stuff, huh?\u201d he said after too long of a pause. \u201cI don\u2019t want you hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ty asked as he took the bag with clumsy fingers.</p><p>Zane motioned to the bag. \u201cThis superstition stuff. The doctors might take you seriously and kick you out of here. That nurse has voodoo dolls at her station out there.\u201d He sounded a little unnerved, which was unusual.</p><p>\u201cVoodoo dolls are usually used for good things, you know,\u201d Ty said. He frowned as his fingers began working on the string of the bag. \u201cIt\u2019s a religion, Zane. Nothing sinister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Digger grunted. \u201cYou sound like a skeptic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a skeptic,\u201d Zane confirmed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ty murmured as he tried to find a more comfortable position. He settled on instructing Zane to lift the head of his bed so he could recline and still inspect the gris-gris bag without too much discomfort. \u201cYou might think it\u2019s just fairy-tale stuff, but this is serious. Serious business.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cSo what is that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gris-gris,\u201d Ty answered slowly. He was probably slurring, but as far as he knew he was still making sense.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, we got that part,\u201d Nick said. He and Digger came closer, and Digger sat on the end of Ty\u2019s bed, jarring it. Ty didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Zane nodded, glancing at the others again. \u201cYou asked specifically about the color,\u201d Zane prompted.</p><p>Ty gazed up at him, wishing he had the ability to convince Zane to take him seriously. He knew Nick, and probably Zane, thought all of it was stupid. A least Digger believed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so fucking stoned,\u201d Digger said, laughing as he patted Ty\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cHis mind is processing at turtle speed,\u201d Nick added, snickering behind his hand.</p><p>Zane placed a hand on Ty\u2019s forehead, and Ty\u2019s eyes fell shut. The warmth of Zane\u2019s palm was like heaven.</p><p>\u201cYou know about this voodoo stuff, right?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Digger answered. Ty felt him shift on the bed. \u201cThe color and material of the bag are just as important to its purpose as the contents. I\u2019m not an expert, but I\u2019m betting if we get it open, Grady and I can tell you what it was meant to do.\u201d</p><p>Ty opened his eyes at the sound of his name.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to open it?\u201d Ty asked. Zane and Nick both nodded. \u201cAre y\u2019all going to freak out if I open it?\u201d He held up the bag gingerly. He wasn\u2019t an expert by any means, but he knew enough about the purposes and the ingredients to get a good idea of what the bag had been intended to do. And what he didn\u2019t know, Digger probably did.</p><p>\u201cWhy would we freak out?\u201d Zane pulled the little rolling table over to the bedside and turned it so Ty had a flat surface in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou freak out over things like that,\u201d Ty mumbled. He pulled at the opening to the bag but couldn\u2019t get the string loose. His fingers weren\u2019t working. Digger finally took it from him and carefully poured the contents onto the shiny surface of the table.</p><p>Ty looked up and around the room, his mind chugging to work. Finally he pointed at the boxes of sterile gloves that were attached to the wall. \u201cHand me some of those, please.\u201d</p><p>Zane amiably nabbed a couple of pairs and brought them back. \u201cThings like that,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I freak out over things like that.\u201d</p><p>Ty pulled on one of the gloves. \u201cYou just . . . don\u2019t believe in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Zane said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cTy don\u2019t touch home plate before the first pitch,\u201d Digger added. \u201cHe believes in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered. He poked through the contents as Digger and Nick laughed at him. He began to separate the different things, making little piles, forgetting what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cHey Ty? Buddy?\u201d Nick finally said gently. \u201cTime to stop organizing and get back on task.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at him. Nick was smiling fondly.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can straighten them later.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. He knew they were humoring him, but he also didn\u2019t give a fuck. He bent his attention back to the gris-gris bag. There was a small roll of parchment, a sprig of crushed juniper, a mossy substance he couldn\u2019t identify, a root of some sort, what appeared to be iron shavings, and two large teeth. Ty pushed them around the table, tidying up his little piles.</p><p>\u201cHow do you connect not believing in something with freaking out about it?\u201d Zane asked. He\u2019d pulled one of the chairs over to the side of the bed and was now sitting at Ty\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI meant, are you going to make me feel stupid for believing this was put under my mattress to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you believe?\u201d Zane sat and leaned back in the chair, right ankle propped on his left knee.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes, recognizing Zane\u2019s interrogation posture.</p><p>Nick leaned forward. \u201cIs that what he does when he\u2019s questioning suspects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty groused.</p><p>\u201cWell hello, Agent Garrett,\u201d Nick said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cBehave yourself,\u201d Zane grumbled. He looked back to Ty. \u201cIs that what you believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered after a moment of thought.</p><p>Zane was watching him intently despite his casual pose. \u201cCan you explain to me why?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked back down at the assortment of items that had been in the gris-gris bag. He was blushing, but during the course of his time in New Orleans, he\u2019d seen and learned things that made it impossible to dismiss the power of simple faith.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane sounded more curious than anything. Not amused, and certainly not angry or frustrated like he got when he couldn\u2019t figure out a puzzle by logical means. He was probably still humoring Ty, but hopefully he wouldn\u2019t dismiss any of this, thinking the drugs were making Ty goofy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about faith,\u201d Ty finally said, looking first at Zane and then at Nick and Digger. Nick was frowning now, and Digger was nodding. Ty met Zane\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI\u2019ve seen things I can\u2019t explain. And I believe in things I can\u2019t see. I believe in fate and luck and curses.\u201d</p><p>Zane crossed his arms. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Digger was nodding too. \u201cSo do I. I also know that people around here don\u2019t take this stuff lightly. And this bag here is quality work; it\u2019s no tourist prank.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder weapon. Just like a gun or knife. It\u2019s poison. It was put in our room by someone with knowledge and belief in the power to cause us harm.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned to whisper into Digger\u2019s ear, but Ty heard his words anyway. \u201cGoddamn, I hate it when he uses real logic.\u201d</p><p>Digger made a dismissive noise and shivered.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t speak for a long moment as he studied Ty, and then he abruptly nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Ty watched him with narrowed eyes. Zane never agreed with him that easily. Maybe he was just taking pity on him since he was in pain and medicated and planned to continue the conversation later. Ty nodded, though, willing to accept it for now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick stood again and leaned over him, studying the contents on the metal table. \u201cCan you tell what\u2019s in it? What\u2019s it meant to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what this moss is, but the rest . . . This is juniper, and I think this root is High John the Conqueror root.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do those things do?\u201d</p> <p>Ty shrugged one shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Ty,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>\u201cThe red felt bag is usually used to attract a lover, but the contents aren\u2019t consistent with that purpose,\u201d Digger offered. \u201cThey\u2019re meant to draw something. Like those iron fillings.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed. \u201cYeah. So basically . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole bag is one big-ass hoodoo magnet.\u201d</p> <p>Nick rolled his eyes. \u201cThank you, Digger, as always, for your contribution to the sanity of the group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a magnet,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cA bad one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA magnet to draw something bad to us,\u201d Zane concluded.</p><p>\u201cA big bad magnet.\u201d</p><p>Digger snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s where the teeth come in.\u201d</p> <p>Ty held one up and looked at it critically. \u201cGator teeth?\u201d</p><p>Digger nodded. \u201cThey look it. They good luck, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for the gator we ate last night,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Digger waved him off.</p><p>\u201cThey are good luck,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cBut gris-gris bags are only supposed to have one,\u201d Digger told them. \u201cAnd they\u2019re supposed to have an odd number of ingredients. So throwing in an extra tooth to make it even, I\u2019m assuming, is bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr whoever put it together just tossed some things in,\u201d Zane suggested. \u201cAnd then planted it to scare us.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and lowered the tooth.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact they planted it at all scares me,\u201d Digger added. He looked at Nick critically. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear \u2019em? See \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I may have climbed a building last night. I don\u2019t remember a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think they came in as housekeeping. I heard them from the shower but didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Digger said. \u201cWe had a fuckton of fresh towels in our room when we got back. Then we had someone knock again trying to clean the room.\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, whoever it was went to all our rooms, hunting for Ty. That\u2019s a lot of trouble to go to for a scare.\u201d</p><p>Ty bit his lip, wondering if he should even be pondering this while the cold buzz was still running through his system. He looked up and winced. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to scare us because it was too well hidden. A tiny bag behind your mattress can only scare you if you know it\u2019s there. If I hadn\u2019t woke up like I did, we never would have looked for it, we never would have found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fair point,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI may not believe in this, but I do believe in you. If you say we should take it seriously, then we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should,\u201d Ty said. \u201cI mean, shit, if this can shake loose a kidney stone, I don\u2019t want to see what else this guy knows how to do.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and scooted his chair a little closer so he could lean sideways against the bed. \u201cFirst Edgar Allan Poe, now voodoo. Great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never inviting you two to a party again,\u201d Nick grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou and your goddamn coconuts,\u201d Digger added. He shifted on the edge of Ty\u2019s bed, jostling him and making a full-body shiver run through Ty.</p><p>\u201cDid you call that detective from last night?\u201d Ty asked as he continued to push around the little bit of moss.</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl dies with a gris-gris bag in her hand. Next morning . . .\u201d</p><p>Zane hesitated, sharing a glance with Nick. \u201cYou want to call the police and report this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you two can sniff around. See if it\u2019s connected. But you can\u2019t bring me into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll boot us out as soon as we show our creds,\u201d Nick argued. \u201cThey were already all over us just for being there last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you try?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Nick sighed loudly and looked away.</p><p>Ty carefully put everything back into the bag. He picked up the roll of parchment and pulled it apart, cold settling in him when he saw \u201cTyler Beaumont\u201d written in beautiful calligraphy.</p><p>\u201cWait, is that like the paper Garrett took a picture of?\u201d Nick asked, sounding shocked.</p><p>Ty nodded.</p><p>Zane craned his neck to look at the parchment. His face clouded over. \u201cYeah, okay, that\u2019s enough connection for me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWas that your alias while you were here?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, rolling the parchment up as it had been.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s bat\u2019s blood ink, you\u2019re fucked,\u201d Digger drawled with all seriousness.</p><p>Ty shot him a glare, careful to leave out the roll of parchment and one of the alligator teeth as he put the bag back together. It wouldn\u2019t make it a good luck charm, but it would lose most of its power. In theory.</p><p>He cleared his throat uncomfortably. He wasn\u2019t ashamed of the fact that he put stock in this, but he still felt a little silly.</p><p>Ty pushed the bag away and began plucking at the fingertips of his gloves. His fingers trembled and he couldn\u2019t seem to grab the purple glove to get it off.</p><p>Zane reached out to still his hands and took over peeling them off.</p><p>\u201cWe could just go home,\u201d Ty said. \u201cBut now I\u2019m hexed. It\u2019ll just follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, you\u2019re not hexed,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cDisagreed,\u201d Digger grunted.</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cWe can\u2019t go home. One, you\u2019re in the hospital with a kidney stone. Two, there is a murderer out there and we have possible evidence in the case, and I don\u2019t think any of us could just walk away with a clear conscience. And three, you really believe in that gris-gris stuff, so there\u2019s no point in trying to run. Every little paper cut and stubbed toe you get will be the bag\u2019s fault until we fix this.\u201d Zane dropped the gloves onto the table and then pushed it out from between them and away, keeping Ty\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>Ty relaxed back into the bed, holding Zane\u2019s hand. He watched him in open admiration. Not many people would so easily accept that he was cursed after one little trip to the ER and because he said so. He was, but not many people would believe him. Or pretend to believe him. Except Digger, but fuck, Digger was certifiable so that didn\u2019t make Ty feel better.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Zane,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane pulled Ty\u2019s hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cUgh, gross,\u201d Digger said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re leaving,\u201d Nick added. They headed for the door, but Ty knew they wouldn\u2019t go far. They could smell trouble just like he could. The door closed and Ty returned his gaze to Zane.</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you like this,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty laughed. Hard. He was folded up in a rolling hospital bed with an IV in his arm and a catheter in a less pleasant place, wearing hospital-issue socks with little rubber paws on the bottoms and a gown that didn\u2019t close all the way in the back. And Zane hated seeing him like this?</p><p>\u201cI hope so!\u201d he said. He covered his mouth to stop the snickering, but his eyes watered as he watched Zane. His partner did offer him a weak smile, but he wasn\u2019t hiding the worry in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Zane!\u201d Ty said as he squeezed his hand. \u201cEnjoy it while my meds last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not enjoying anything until you\u2019re healthy and out of here.\u201d</p><p>Ty sobered and looked at him apologetically. He patted his hand. \u201cLast time it only took a few hours from start to finish. I just didn\u2019t have any drugs, so I was begging O and Eli to kill me the whole time. This time is much more fun so far.\u201d</p><p>Zane moved his other hand so both of them closed around Ty\u2019s. \u201cMaybe some of it will be lingering when I get to take you out of here. You can be a lot of fun when you\u2019re so open to suggestion,\u201d he drawled, making a visible effort to relax.</p><p>That got another round of laughter out of Ty, and he had to be careful not to move his legs or roll as he cackled at his lover. \u201cBecause nothing says sexy like a catheter.\u201d</p><p>Zane finally laughed with him. \u201cNot my kink, but okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty was still laughing when a nurse poked her head into the room to check on them. \u201cI see he\u2019s feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it fool you,\u201d Zane said, turning his head to look at her. He didn\u2019t let go of Ty\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019s got the good drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I know it, honey, I gave them to him.\u201d</p><p>Ty was still laughing. The nurse came into the room and changed his saline bag, telling him the more he got in him, the easier the stone would pass. She checked his vitals, then moved on, leaving them alone again.</p><p>\u201cI almost think I\u2019d rather be gut shot than have to pass a kidney stone, from the sound of it,\u201d Zane said once she disappeared.</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Ty muttered. Suddenly, nothing was all that funny anymore.</p><p>Nick and the others were in the waiting room, sprawled among the sick and injured, when Zane joined them. Zane had no idea how to proceed. He didn\u2019t want to be around Ty\u2019s Recon team without Ty there as a buffer, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to go to the New Orleans PD and tell them his lover had been cursed by voodoo and wanted them to investigate. He wished Ty had never answered that phone call in Baltimore right now.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Zane winced and shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. They\u2019ve got him drugged up. Now he just has to wait it out, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one thing Ty hates doing most,\u201d Digger mused. \u201cWaiting. So poetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sick man, D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ruins every trip,\u201d Nick muttered. He smiled at Zane. \u201cWhat do we do about the hoodoo thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat hoodoo thing?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>Digger poked at him. \u201cThat voodoo you do, baby!\u201d</p><p>Owen batted Digger\u2019s hands away. \u201cStop it, what is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy found one of those gris-gris bag things under his pillow this morning,\u201d Nick explained.</p><p>\u201cLike the one with the dead girl?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants us to report it to the police,\u201d Zane said with a grimace. The bag was in his pocket, and he pulled it out to look at it.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to report being cursed to the police?\u201d Owen\u2019s voice had gone flat.</p><p>Nick stood and stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going out on a limb and guessing they get that a lot down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do? Are we really going to call the police?\u201d Kelly asked, smirking. They were all looking to Nick to make the decision. Zane supposed that was their habit, since Nick had been the team\u2019s second-in-command.</p><p>\u201cHe does have a point. The dead girl had a hoodoo bag, and whoever put that shit in Ty\u2019s room was slick enough to get in and out without either him or Zane noticing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you two stumble into the room groping each other?\u201d Owen asked Zane.</p><p>Zane glared at him for a second before deciding it didn\u2019t warrant a response.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Nick said loudly. \u201cI\u2019ll call the number they left me when I gave my statement last night. Let them decide if they want to pursue it as a lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about Ty?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let the cops come here and interview him. They might recognize him.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced toward the doors, chewing on his lip. \u201cWe can\u2019t report it without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to report it at all?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cTy is drugged up to his asshole right now; can\u2019t we just tell him we called it in and let it drop?\u201d Digger said.</p><p>Nick stared at him for a long moment, then met Zane\u2019s eyes with a shrug. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019d be withholding evidence in a homicide investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either that or run Ty right into a whole load of questions with no answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we know this bag thing is even connected?\u201d Owen asked. \u201cAre we going on Ty\u2019s assessment? Because he didn\u2019t even see the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA valid point,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe\u2019s also high. I mean . . . y\u2019all remember the last time he was high?\u201d He began to laugh, then cut himself short and schooled his expression when no one else laughed with him.</p><p>Nick had his hands stuffed in his pockets, not reacting as each man offered up his opinion. He glanced to Zane again. Zane found himself nodding. He was tired of finding himself embroiled in problems that weren\u2019t his.</p><p>He immediately chastised himself. Truth and justice were part of his job. What the hell was he thinking? If that bag had any possibility of being linked to the murder of that girl, they had a responsibility, not only as officers of the law, but also as human beings, to report it.</p><p>Nick seemed to read his expression, and it wasn\u2019t the first time Nick had done so since Zane had met him. The man was perceptive as hell. \u201cOkay. You and I will go down there and turn this thing in. If we can keep his name out of it, we will. If not . . . maybe we can use the FBI thing to slip past it. You have your badge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. What about Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay here. Make sure he doesn\u2019t die,\u201d Kelly offered, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . that\u2019s comforting, thank you,\u201d Zane drawled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cI do what I can.\u201d</p><p>Ty faded in and out of sleep after Zane left him. It was easier to let whatever was in that IV do its work than to fight it trying to stay lucid. He dozed, never quite sure when he was asleep and dreaming, or when he was awake staring at the ceiling and listening to the beeps and thrums of the busy emergency department.</p><p>At times he dreamed of visitors coming to see him. Zane holding his hand. Nick sitting on his bed to laugh at him. Kelly bending over him to check his vitals. Sanchez begging him to wake up and move before they were blown up. Deuce sitting by his bed with his brand new baby girl in his arms. Chester waving a shovel at a nurse.</p> <p>He would sort out the reality from the hallucinations later.</p><p>Something jostled the bed and Ty forced his eyes to open. There was a man sitting on the side of the hospital bed, dressed in blue scrubs and sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHello, Tyler,\u201d he said, British accent steeped in sarcasm. \u201cFancy meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>Ty jolted in bed, adrenaline racing through him when he recognized his visitor.</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p> <p>Liam Bell\u2019s lips curved into an evil smirk. Ty tried to sit up, but Liam put a hand on his sternum and shoved him back to the mattress.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss, love, I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached to grab at the front of his scrubs, but Liam gripped his wrist, twisting Ty\u2019s arm away and pinning it to the hospital bed.</p><p>\u201cYou never did handle the hard stuff well,\u201d Liam said as he peered at the little machine that registered Ty\u2019s heart rate. \u201cCalm down, I\u2019m not here to hurt you. Yet.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s other hand grasped at him. \u201cWhy are you here? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? Revenge is all the rage this season.\u201d He leaned closer to Ty\u2019s face, using his elbow to push into Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled crookedly and peered over the tops of his sunglasses, blue eyes shining. \u201cThe same place you have, Ty. Hell.\u201d</p><p>Ty gasped for air. He couldn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t defend himself, why his breath was so hard to catch. \u201cDid you leave the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to kill you when you can\u2019t fight back.\u201d Liam leaned closer, close enough for his breath to gust across Ty\u2019s face. \u201cWe shall meet again, Tyler. When you\u2019re well. Until then.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from Ty\u2019s grasp, which was easier than it should have been. Ty struggled to sit up, but Liam was gone.</p><p>They went a few blocks before Nick worked up the nerve to broach the subject with his companion, but he took a deep breath and cleared his throat. \u201cHey, Zane, I need to apologize to you. For the others.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at him as they walked, eyebrows raised. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re assholes.\u201d</p> <p>Zane laughed, shaking his head. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe not. It\u2019s just . . . Ty and I have always been sort of responsible for them, you know?\u201d Nick reached out to stop Zane so he could face him as they spoke. \u201cLook, the guys, they judge pretty harshly. They think you have something to prove.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile fell. He glanced away, nodding and pressing his lips tightly together.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re wrong, you know.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked back at him sharply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen how you handle yourself. Give it some time; they\u2019ll realize Ty trusts you with his life. They\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>He waited for Zane to say something, but the man remained silent, his dark eyes unreadable. At last, Zane licked his lips and smiled weakly. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said before he started walking again.</p><p>They were stepping through the iron gate surrounding the coral-colored 8th district police station on Royal Street when Nick\u2019s phone rang. He dug it out and called for Zane to hold up when he saw it was Kelly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he answered, giving Zane a shrug when the man made an inquiring gesture with his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou guys gotta come back here,\u201d Kelly said in a rush. \u201cTy\u2019s freaking the fuck out, he\u2019s trying to take out his IV and they\u2019re talking about sedating him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe keeps saying he\u2019s not hallucinating and you two can\u2019t go to the police. I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s all I can get out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Nick mouthed.</p><p>\u201cJust come back here,\u201d Kelly said on the phone. \u201cMaybe Zane can get him calm, because I sure as hell can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re on our way.\u201d Nick ended the call and waved at Zane. \u201cKelly says Ty\u2019s losing it, they need us back there.\u201d</p><p>It was almost eight blocks from the station to Tulane Medical Center, but Zane didn\u2019t even hesitate. He took off at a run, and Nick sprinted after him. Taxis in the French Quarter were few and far between, but by the time they crossed Rampart and got to the emergency department doors, Nick was pretty sure they could have carjacked someone and gotten there with less trouble. He had a hard time keeping up with Zane\u2019s long strides.</p><p>When they were let into the room, they found Ty sleeping. Owen and Digger were leaning against the supply cabinet on one wall, and Kelly was sitting on Ty\u2019s bed, arms crossed. Everything was calm, except for Nick and Zane gasping as they both tried to catch their breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d Nick blurted.</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cThey had to sedate him.\u201d</p><p>Nick leaned against the wall, panting.</p><p>Zane moved closer, taking Ty\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat triggered him? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue,\u201d Kelly answered. \u201cWe barely got any sense out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in the lobby when a nurse came running out begging for our help,\u201d Owen explained. \u201cWhen we got back here, three orderlies were holding him down. We tried to tell them he didn\u2019t like being restrained, but they said he\u2019d tried to attack a male nurse who came to take his vitals.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked momentarily horrified, but he hid it quickly and gripped Ty\u2019s limp hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cWhen he saw us, he calmed a little, but not enough. The good news, though,\u201d Kelly added, keeping his voice bright. \u201cHe passed the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Nick huffed. \u201cNow we just have to wait for him to fucking wake up. How long will that take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudging by the amount of sedative they gave him and the way Ty reacts to medications?\u201d Kelly looked at the watch on his wrist. He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t have a fucking clue.\u201d</p><p>Nick glared at him. \u201cI hate you. We ran here. Sprinted.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked him up and down appraisingly. \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>Digger clucked his tongue and smacked a hand against Nick\u2019s arm. \u201cThe only sense we could make out of what he was saying was to get you two the fuck away from the police.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, looking from Digger to Ty, who lay peacefully now. Zane sat on the chair beside the bed, holding Ty\u2019s hand in both of his. He was staring at Ty\u2019s face, seemingly oblivious to the rest of them.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Nick said, at a loss. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we, uh . . . we\u2019ll go get some breakfast and . . .\u201d He gestured at Zane, and the others filtered toward the door with him. They left Ty to his sedation and Zane to his vigil.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Ty moved gingerly as Zane walked with him to the hotel room. Zane had never passed a kidney stone, but he\u2019d heard the horror stories. All he knew was that Ty had been lucky to be drugged and having a minor meltdown to distract him during the process.</p><p>As they made their way down the hall, Ty reached out to steady himself on Zane\u2019s arm. The medicine he\u2019d been given was still in effect, and he was wobbly and uncertain of his footing.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d But he didn\u2019t let go of Zane\u2019s arm. He kept his other hand on his side. Zane wasn\u2019t sure if he was hurting there, or it just made him feel better to hold it.</p><p>When they reached their room, Zane wasn\u2019t surprised to see the other men already there. He\u2019d called ahead to let them know Ty was being released, and Nick had a key. They all stood when Ty stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Six?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>Ty nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Kelly said with a smirk. \u201cPsychotic episode is the new prescribed treatment for passing one of these things?\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, his cheeks coloring. \u201cHallucinations are a bitch when they talk back.\u201d</p><p>Zane put his hand on Ty\u2019s arm, offering a modicum of support. Ty\u2019s hand trembled as it hung between them. He clenched it to make it stop.</p><p>\u201cI need a cigarette or something,\u201d Ty mumbled.</p><p>\u201cMy pack\u2019s in my jeans,\u201d Zane offered.</p><p>Ty headed for the pile of clothing Zane had discarded the night before. Zane recognized it as more of a distraction than the actual need for a cigarette. It was something for Ty to do with himself, with his hands and his mind, so he had a little bit more time to figure out how to explain his behavior to the rest of them.</p><p>He bent gingerly, holding his side as he dug through Zane\u2019s pockets. Everyone else was quiet, waiting, knowing the silence itself would do more to force Ty to talk than any pointed queries. Zane smiled. He kind of liked watching the dynamic of Sidewinder, because even though he still felt like a bit of an outcast, he also knew he was in a room with some of the people who knew Ty best. He was no longer the only one present who would call Ty on his bullshit.</p><p>Ty straightened with a grimace once he found the pack and the lighter. He was frowning, holding the piece of paper Zane had wadded up this morning. It took a moment for Zane to remember what it was. He was pretty sure Ty was too high to be bothered by it. He might even find it funny. Ty tapped one of the cigarettes out of the pack and put it in his mouth, then dropped the pack and idly flattened the paper to read.</p><p>Zane was expecting him to make a joke or a lewd comment about someone slipping Zane a phone number in a bar, so he was shocked by the change that came over Ty\u2019s face. He took the cigarette out of his mouth and dropped it to the floor. His jaw tightened and his hard eyes darted to Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty held up the paper and crumpled it in his fist. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, some guy slipped it into my pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d Ty demanded. His voice had gone low and dangerous, and he advanced on Zane from across the room, heedless of the other men, no longer slow or shaky.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty, some guy who wanted a light.\u201d Zane peered over Ty\u2019s shoulder at the others. They were all growing uneasy, sharing wide-eyed glances and shifting where they sat. Even Ty wasn\u2019t usually this overtly possessive or combative.</p><p>Ty was oblivious to the discomfort in the room as he stalked up to Zane, cornering him in the little entryway. He held the paper up. \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of trash in my pocket. He pickpocketed my lighter and slipped it back in with that note. It\u2019s not a big deal, okay? Maybe we can talk about it once the meds wear off.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes flashed and he struck out at the wall next to Zane, slapping his palm and the piece of paper against it. Zane flinched away, eyes going wider.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>\u201cGrady!\u201d Kelly called. \u201cYou need to sit down before the morphine gets the better of you.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes stayed on Ty\u2019s. He shook his head. He knew Ty wasn\u2019t going to hurt him, but it was growing embarrassing. He just wanted to keep Ty calm until the drugs could wear off. \u201cHe was . . . blond. British. Blue eyes. I don\u2019t know, it was dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas his name Liam Bell?\u201d Ty growled.</p><p>Zane heard a sharp inhalation from one of the others, and it distracted him enough to glance at them and see Nick and Kelly both standing. He met Ty\u2019s eyes again and nodded. \u201cYeah. I think that was his name. How\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>Ty took a step back, releasing the paper. It fluttered to the ground at Zane\u2019s feet. Ty put a hand over his mouth and turned away.</p><p>\u201cLiam Bell?\u201d Nick asked, aghast. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Liam Bell?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was him, Ty?\u201d Owen demanded.</p><p>Ty still had a hand over his mouth. He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou saw him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Nick said. \u201cIn the ER. That\u2019s why you freaked out. You saw him there.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, eyes still closed. \u201cI thought I was hallucinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Liam Bell?\u201d Zane asked again.</p><p>Kelly took a deep breath, looking between Ty and Zane. \u201cHe was . . . uh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a ghost,\u201d Digger answered. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cWe have to leave town.\u201d</p><p>Zane barked a laugh. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>Ty turned on him. \u201cWhat else did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed, far too aware of all the eyes on him. He shrugged it off. \u201cHe wanted a light. He sort of flirted with me. There was nothing.\u201d</p><p>Ty gritted his teeth, stepping closer. \u201cZane, the words he used. What did he say?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed as he fought past the sense of urgency and confusion to remember exactly what the man had said to him. He shook his head, distracted by the look of near panic on Ty\u2019s face. \u201cHe said something about looking forward to seeing me again.\u201d He paused, taking a deep breath to steel himself for Ty\u2019s reaction. \u201cWithout my boyfriend around.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty\u2019s shoulders straightened and his features grew harder, more dangerous. He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cHe told me he wanted revenge.\u201d He looked back at Zane, fear skittering through his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s coming after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about, Ty?\u201d</p><p>Ty backed away, covering his face like he was trying to block out everything so he could think clearly. Those meds were still doing a number on him, and Zane wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do. He wasn\u2019t even sure if this warranted the kind of panic Ty had spiraled into, but the rest of them looked shocked as well.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is this guy so scary?\u201d Zane asked, growing frustrated. He needed details, not more rambling hoodoo ghost talk.</p><p>Ty sat down hard on the end of the bed and swiped a hand over his eyes. He glanced up at Zane, his head resting on his hand. \u201cYou remember me telling you about training with an SAS team?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, even as he tried to think back. It had been before they\u2019d left for the cruise ship assignment and Ty had explained where he\u2019d picked up the British accent he\u2019d been forced to use.</p><p>\u201cLiam was the leader of the group we were assigned with. It was an advanced Coalition team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zane said, still confused. He sat in one of the chairs near the bed, watching Ty\u2019s body language more than anything else. His knee was bouncing, he couldn\u2019t stop fidgeting with his hands, and he wouldn\u2019t meet anyone\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWe were each buddied to our counterpart of the SAS team for the duration,\u201d Nick explained when Ty remained silent. \u201cWe lived together, ate together, went on missions together. They said it was a test to see how it would work, Spec Ops integration or some shit. They were trying to form an international first-strike team.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced around the room at the five men. \u201cWith the SAS?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cThere were others. SEALs and Aussies, Green Berets and Canadians. Two months in, we discovered a mole. We hunted him as a team. For months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCanadians are shifty, man,\u201d Digger muttered.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cSo, if Liam Bell was the team leader, he was buddied with Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered curtly. His knee was bouncing faster, and he had his hands clasped between his thighs, trying not to fidget.</p> <p>Zane stared at him, waiting for him to make eye contact. When the silence began to stretch too thin and Ty was still staring at the floor, Zane sighed. He knew Ty\u2019s M.O. \u201cWere you involved with him?\u201d</p><p>Ty finally looked up and met his eyes. He nodded jerkily. Zane wasn\u2019t surprised, but the other four men burst into a chorus of shock and anger. Ty winced as they each expressed themselves.</p><p>Kelly and Digger both shouted, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Nick ran a hand through his hair and turned away.</p><p>Zane raised his voice to be heard. \u201cWhy is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Ty\u2019s the one who fucking shot him!\u201d Owen blurted.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened and he gaped at Ty, unable to conceal his surprise. Ty had his hand over his mouth and his eyes were closed again.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cWas he the mole?\u201d</p> <p>Ty ran his fingers over his lips and took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. He finally opened them as he nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking shot a guy you were sleeping with?\u201d Owen asked, and it was hard to tell which part scandalized him more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think it was,\u201d Ty explained, voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Kelly whispered. He sank to a chair, brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cold, man. Even for you, that\u2019s some shit,\u201d Digger muttered. He paced toward the balcony, shaking his head.</p><p>Nick was still standing in the little entryway near the bathroom with his back to them. His head was down and he had one hand on his hip. Zane\u2019s eyes were drawn to him. Why did he seem so betrayed by the knowledge? What Ty had done was harsh, Zane had no illusions about it. But it didn\u2019t necessarily bother him. He knew how Ty felt about treachery, and he was a dangerous man, quick to action and rarely looking back. Nick and the others had to know that too. Once you turned on Ty, your time was up.</p><p>Nick finally raised his head, but he didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cYou hit center mass,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>Ty turned, but Zane couldn\u2019t see his expression as he stared at Nick\u2019s back. His entire body trembled, and Zane wondered if it was the meds, the nerves, or both.</p><p>Nick turned to face him, looking grim. \u201cYou fired at center mass from seven yards away, but you missed almost every vital organ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I wrote up the report,\u201d Nick snarled. He pointed a finger at Ty. \u201cYou missed on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, unmoving. The trembling had stopped almost as if Ty had shut it off with a switch.</p><p>Nick took a step. \u201cYou helped him escape. Didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you know he\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Ty hesitated before giving a curt nod.</p><p>The group erupted in another round of protests.</p><p>Nick dragged both hands through his hair and turned around again. \u201cYou missed center mass to help him escape, and you\u2019re the one who covered it up!\u201d</p><p>Zane stood, intending to try to calm the emotions he could see brewing, but the movement stirred the room instead. Ty stood with him, stepping toward Nick. But Nick whirled around when he felt Ty behind him, grabbed Ty by his shirt front, and slammed him into the wall.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Zane called, taking a step to intercede. Kelly grabbed his arm and held him off, patting him on the chest like he would to calm a dog.</p><p>Nick snarled in Ty\u2019s face. \u201cI swore under oath you had nothing to do with it, Ty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Ty gritted out. He shoved at Nick\u2019s chest, forcing him to loosen his hold.</p><p>Kelly let Zane go. His voice was grim. \u201cYou helped a traitor escape.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around at everyone before meeting Nick\u2019s eyes again. He squared his shoulders and raised his head, preparing for the worst. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this time!\u201d Ty shouted as he stalked around the room. He was too angry to be still. He gripped his gun so hard that his knuckles were turning white.</p><p>\u201cTyler, I know you\u2019re angry, but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry? Liam! This is beyond angry!\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded and took a step to the side.</p><p>\u201cStop moving!\u201d Ty shouted. He raised his gun and pointed it at Liam\u2019s head.</p><p>Liam stopped and stared, meeting Ty\u2019s eyes without flinching. \u201cDo you intend to shoot me, Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for this mole for months,\u201d Ty said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been right by your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a traitor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Not to you,\u201d Liam said, remaining calm in the face of Ty\u2019s growing rage. \u201cAnd not to them.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never betrayed you, mate. I\u2019m just doing my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll let me explain.\u201d</p><p>Ty growled, his grip tightening on the gun. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fucking hear it, I\u2019m tired of spy games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny, Ty, because you\u2019re one of the best players I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Ty snarled.</p><p>Liam nodded, taking a harsh breath.</p><p>Ty could barely look the man in the eye, and he lowered his gun for fear of shooting him in the face just to wipe that wounded look off it. \u201cFine. Explain. Do it quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planted here by the NIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe NIA? Do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler, I think you\u2019re anything but.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNIA is a toothless old aunt in the CIA\u2019s basement. They don\u2019t get involved in this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t. They\u2019re being militarized. Dipping into military personnel who already have the access to build their stable. The NIA pulled me from SAS and recruited me for military ops they couldn\u2019t get their own people into. I know you know about this, because they tried to pull you too.\u201d</p><p>Ty gritted his teeth, fighting not to react to that knowledge. Chas Turner had tried for months to recruit him for the National Intelligence Agency\u2019s first wave of dark military ops, but Ty never bit. He\u2019d worked a few missions and become a valuable piece of artillery, but he took his orders from the Marine Corps, not suits at the NIA.</p><p>\u201cThey put me here to feed false information to the opposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d Ty demanded.</p><p>Liam licked his lips. \u201cI have family in Russia. They created a KGB past that could be exploited, and waited for someone to find it and contact me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weak, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked nonetheless. I\u2019ve been transmitting false information for months. I\u2019m not your enemy.\u201d</p><p>The gun lowered as Ty stared at the SAS sergeant he\u2019d called his friend and lover for the past few months.</p><p>\u201cEvery day you\u2019ve looked me in the fucking eye and lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Ty raised the gun again and jabbed it at Liam in utter frustration.</p><p>\u201cStubborn wanker! Listen to me. Life isn\u2019t black and white! You know that better than anyone. I\u2019m not the bad guy here.\u201d</p><p>Ty realized he was nearly hyperventilating. He was so livid the edges of his vision were beginning to blur.</p><p>Liam continued talking, voice soft and low, like a man trying to calm a wild animal. He\u2019d done it before to Ty, soothing him and coaxing him back to sanity.</p><p>\u201cNow listen, I need your help. Word has to get out the spy\u2019s been rooted out and eliminated, or the insurgent forces will try to extract me. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t fancy that sort of homecoming. If they can\u2019t extract me and they don\u2019t hear of my death, they\u2019ll know all those messages were fake. It will cost lives. Many lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me not to turn you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m asking you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to fake my death, I\u2019ve known that all along. It was always the only exit strategy. But then you came along and . . .\u201d He licked his lips, wincing. He sighed and flopped his hands. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty took an involuntary step back, gaping and grasping for words, and nearly tripped over a pair of boots. Liam followed and Ty raised the gun again in unsteady hands.</p><p>Liam noticed the tremble and shook his head. \u201cI need you steady tonight, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me die tonight. Then you can come with me, we\u2019ll start over somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering you a chance at a life without orders, without rules, without being a pawn in someone else\u2019s game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never been pawns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Your code name is Rook. Make no mistake, you are just a player in a game. As am I.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared, fighting to calm himself. Liam stood with his hands at his sides, nonthreatening and earnest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s run, Ty. Come with me. We\u2019ll bury ourselves and start over. With nothing to do but lie on a beach all day and drink and fuck.\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t answer, still torn between shock and anger. \u201cYeah,\u201d he finally sneered. \u201cDrink and fuck and run from the NIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bloody stubborn bastard!\u201d Liam shouted, his fa\u00e7ade finally cracking. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right here, I love you! We have a chance to cut and run, and I want you to come with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d Ty said as despair and uncertainty began to seep in.</p><p>\u201cFine. You still want to serve? I\u2019m game. Come with me to the NIA,\u201d Liam tried. \u201cWe\u2019d be unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll shoot it out. You take me down, I\u2019ll clip you in a leg, make you unfit for service in the Corps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot you! And you\u2019re sure as shit not shooting me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you with a knife then! Come with me, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty took in a shaky breath, not allowing himself to ponder the possibility or even be tempted to desert. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s mask broke, and Ty could see the pain in his clear blue eyes. He recognized it well because he\u2019d been feeling it ever since he\u2019d discovered that Liam had been using his clearance to transmit on the CB frequency the rebels were monitoring. Ty gritted his teeth. He\u2019d thought Liam a traitor, and though he was relieved to be wrong, it seemed he would lose him anyway. For the first time, uncertainty began to gnaw its way into him.</p><p>Liam shook it off, rallying faster than Ty had been able to. \u201cIf you don\u2019t intend to go with me, will you still help me? Will you join me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head sadly, his hands still held out to his sides. \u201cYou have to shoot me. And it has to be out there, in the common areas, to make sure you\u2019re not at risk and to get scuttlebutt going.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, his voice harsh. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you go like that.\u201d</p><p>Liam gave him a weak smile. \u201cOh, how I wish you meant that like it sounds, darling.\u201d He took a step toward the door.</p><p>\u201cStop moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me, Ty.\u201d Liam took another backward step and put his hand on the doorknob. \u201cYou and I both know you can\u2019t take me down without a gun, and you won\u2019t even shoot me when I ask you to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty drew in a deep breath. \u201cLiam. We\u2019ll figure something else out. Please don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Would you miss me?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked into his eyes and nodded jerkily. \u201cYes, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me why I shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d They stared at each other. Liam took a step back. \u201cOr better yet, come with me and tell me every night.\u201d</p> <p>Ty\u2019s heart pounded, the blood rushing through him and making him light-headed.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t follow and shoot me somewhere that looks like a kill shot, I\u2019m going to go find someone else who will. Someone without your aim.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou could be killing me if they miss.\u201d Liam turned and disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Ty holstered his gun and darted after the man, knowing Liam would do exactly what he\u2019d threatened. He caught up to him in the canteen. It was crowded with troops, laughing and eating, playing pool and darts, relaxing after a long, trying day.</p> <p>\u201cSergeant Bell!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>Liam stopped on the other side of the room, turning to meet his eyes.</p><p>The room gradually quieted, confused by their combative stances.</p><p>Liam glanced around at their comrades in arms. Ty understood now that Liam had always intended to leave them, known forever to them as the spy among them who was shot and killed. They would never know what he\u2019d done for their safety, what he\u2019d sacrificed, and Liam had known that all along.</p><p>Ty grew angrier as the confusion ebbed. Who the hell had the right to ask them to be like this? Who decided it was their job to sacrifice their lives?</p><p>Liam looked at him expectantly, silently begging him to announce he was a traitor, to draw on him. A low murmur of confusion and amusement began to rumble through the room.</p> <p>Ty couldn\u2019t get the words out. They stuck in his throat. His hand wouldn\u2019t reach for his gun. He shook his head, unable to come through for Liam when he needed him most.</p><p>Liam mouthed the word, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand settled on his gun. His body was cold all over and his hand shook. There was no way he could take that shot. He\u2019d miss the target and kill him.</p><p>Liam sneered and peered at Ty with icy blue eyes. He drew his gun. Shock and alarm rippled through the soldiers and Marines as Liam aimed at Ty. \u201cI\u2019ll shoot you, Tyler,\u201d Liam murmured.</p><p>Ty went cold, seeing the truth in the man\u2019s eyes, and yet he still couldn\u2019t pull his own weapon. If he had to die, he wanted someone worthy to take the kill shot.</p><p>Liam fired and the bullet caught Ty in the left shoulder. He cried out and stumbled back, fighting past the shock to realize that if he didn\u2019t shoot Liam, someone else in the room would. He pulled his service pistol, not taking the time to think, not letting his nerves overtake his hands, and put two rounds in Liam\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou shot him because he asked you to?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick released Ty\u2019s shirt and backed away. They all gaped at Ty.</p> <p>\u201cTechnically, I shot him because he shot me.\u201d Ty pressed his back against the wall. He was breathing hard, like he expected one of them to come at him again. He looked cornered.</p><p>Zane knew what happened to Ty, and to the people around him, when he was cornered. He moved forward, brushing past Nick. \u201cYou need to sit down,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>Ty nodded, taking a deep breath. He locked eyes with Zane, refusing to look away as Zane placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIf he asked you to shoot him, why would he be here for revenge? Why are you scared?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, taking a step toward the bed and then reversing and pacing past Zane. He met Zane\u2019s eyes again briefly, then turned back to the bed.</p><p>Nick caught him by the arm to stop him. \u201cAnswer him.\u201d</p><p>Ty took another deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and glanced around the room. He gently pulled his arm out of Nick\u2019s grasp. He sat down hard. \u201cLiam is the reason Sidewinder was discharged.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of questions and complaints arose, but all Zane could do was watch the line of Ty\u2019s shoulders as he leaned forward and rested his face in his hands. He suddenly looked like a man who\u2019d been carrying a great weight, and Zane knew there were other secrets Ty carried, secrets as big as this one. Secrets that weighed on him in ways no one could understand by merely looking at his fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>Nick took a step into the center of the room, raising his hands to calm the other three. He turned to Ty and knelt in front of him. \u201cTell us what happened. Please, Ty. You\u2019ve obviously been keeping this on yourself, it\u2019s time to trust us.\u201d</p><p>Ty straightened, both hands on his knees. He looked down at Nick. \u201cOnce they had him declared dead and he\u2019d recovered enough to move, I think Liam pulled strings with NIA. He convinced them we\u2019d make a good asset, the whole team, that we could be military assets for NIA just like he\u2019d been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNIA made a deal with the Marine Corps?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Ty nodded, looking sick. \u201cThey tried to, from what I was able to gather. I was never given the full briefing, but I do know we were to be released into the umbrella of the National Intelligence Agency to be used as part of a new ultra-militarized arm of the CIA. We\u2019d have had to jump whenever they called. We wouldn\u2019t have been real Marines anymore, we would have been spooks in Marine uniforms. When I was informed of the orders, I . . . I refused them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke for the whole team?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me I got kicked out of the Corps because you had a lover\u2019s spat?\u201d Owen growled.</p><p>Ty stood, baring his teeth like an animal. Nick stood with him, just managing to stop him from advancing. He shoved him back to the bed. Ty bounced on the mattress, grabbing his side and grunting.</p><p>\u201cShit, sorry!\u201d Nick said. He patted Ty\u2019s head but kept his body between him and Owen. \u201cWhy would Bell be back here for revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what he told me in the hospital. His plan all along was for me to join him. I chose the Corps, all of you, over him. I can only assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re here with Zane,\u201d Nick added. \u201cWho is the partner you never let Liam be.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s stomach flipped to hear someone say that. He probably should have been ashamed to be thrilled by the words, but he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSo you think he\u2019s here in New Orleans, murdering people because he\u2019s pissed at you?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>Digger stood and ambled toward the balcony. \u201cThis explains so much. I feel like I\u2019ve just finished a crossword puzzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what that feels like?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sniffed.</p><p>\u201cThis is why they paid us off, to keep quiet about the NIA. And why they gave us those release terms,\u201d Owen said. \u201cGood God, Ty, why didn\u2019t you tell us any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was top secret,\u201d Ty answered. He sounded and looked exhausted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Zane stepped forward, frowning. \u201cWhat terms?\u201d</p><p>They all turned to look at him, as if they\u2019d forgotten he was there.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Owen blurted. He looked from Zane to Ty. \u201cYou talk about how much you love this guy and you haven\u2019t even told him?\u201d</p><p>Ty pointed a finger at him and snarled, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d Zane asked cautiously.</p><p>Owen glanced at him, curling his lip. \u201cAsk your boyfriend. He\u2019s the one with all the secrets.\u201d</p><p>Nick strode toward Owen, giving his shoulder a shove. \u201cJohns, shut your fucking mouth.\u201d</p><p>But Zane turned his attention to Ty. The look on his lover\u2019s face didn\u2019t do much to dispel the sudden bout of nerves. \u201cTy?\u201d</p><p>Ty stood. His hands balled into fists as he glanced from Zane to Nick. Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell him, Grady!\u201d Owen shouted. Nick shoved Owen into the wall and pointed a finger in his face, hissing.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here,\u201d Ty growled. Nick grabbed Owen\u2019s shoulder, but the man shrugged him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice. I\u2019m fucking out of here.\u201d He stormed out, letting the door slam behind him.</p><p>Nick squared his shoulders, regaining his calming demeanor with impressive speed. He gave them one last glance, then headed for the door. Kelly and Digger followed, murmuring good-byes to Zane as they passed.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, Zane heard Owen shouting in the hallway. He turned to Ty, though. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty said, his voice hoarse. He cleared his throat. He seemed to be fighting to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s something . . . something I\u2019ve been keeping from you.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s stomach flipped. \u201cI thought we got all the secrets out.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, looking sick. \u201cNot this one.\u201d</p><p>Zane took a deep breath, trying to come to terms with the flicker of fear in Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>Ty struggled to meet Zane\u2019s eyes as he began to speak. \u201cI was never completely discharged from the Marines.\u201d</p><p>Zane barked a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile fell and he took a step toward Ty. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at the door. \u201cThe boys and me . . . the team. We\u2019re still obligated to the Marines.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared, mouth hanging open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ty ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIt happens with a lot of Special Ops crews; the military never really lets us go. We\u2019re too highly trained, too much money and time has been put into us. And the terms we signed when they released us compel us to go back if they order it. If they want us back . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ty, I mean . . . what the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never discharged from the Marines. Sidewinder wasn\u2019t disbanded, even though the official paperwork cited disobedience as the reason for leaving. We were just . . . put on reserve because of the fuss the NIA made. They took my refusal of the orders and used it as the excuse to put us all into cold storage.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked both riddled with nerves and relieved to have said the words. Zane tried to speak, but nothing would come out. He took a staggering step back and pressed his hand to his stomach, feeling sick and dizzy.</p><p>After a few moments of tense silence, Ty leaned closer. \u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019re still a Marine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot technically. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sort of technically a Marine, Ty. You either are or you aren\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Ty put a hand up to calm him, but Zane batted it away. \u201cYou\u2019re still a Marine! You\u2019re telling me that any day, you could be called back into service and you\u2019d have to prance off with your little go bag and be gone for months on the front line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I\u2019m upset!\u201d Zane roared. \u201cThis is something you stay prepared for, isn\u2019t it? The bag in the closet, never missing a morning run. When the fuck were you planning on telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was . . . I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t need to. The contracts expire in December.\u201d</p><p>Zane sniffed in disgust. \u201cJesus Christ, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised both hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s something I can just go around telling everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not everyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that! But Zane, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes it okay not to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGive me details,\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you more. I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell you that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck you can\u2019t. You\u2019re standing here telling me you\u2019re still a fucking Marine, that you and your team are still on some sort of long-term fucking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane, calm down.\u201d</p><p>Zane slammed his fist into the wall. Blood was roaring through his ears and he had to shout to hear himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been living with you for a year and you can\u2019t tell me more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you, Zane!\u201d Ty shouted. \u201cGod! What I\u2019ve said already could get me thrown in the Disciplinary Barracks at Leavenworth! Do you understand? I am still subject to USMC laws and codes of conduct!\u201d</p><p>Zane ran his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cAnd frankly, Liam Bell scares me more right now than any secrets I\u2019ve been keeping from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there more?\u201d Zane asked sarcastically.</p><p>Ty hesitated, and Zane caught a flicker of guilt in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s more. There\u2019s something worse than this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what else you\u2019re hiding.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised his head and squared his shoulders, his nostrils flaring. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared. His heart was pounding. He\u2019d known they had secrets between them, things they weren\u2019t ready to share. They\u2019d discussed these things, shady parts of their pasts they\u2019d rather not take out of the box. But Zane had never expected Ty\u2019s secrets to be something that could hurt him. Hurt them.</p><p>Zane studied his lover, letting that truth settle somewhere deep inside him.</p><p>\u201cTell me now, tell me everything I need to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty\u2019s jaw muscles jumped, but he stayed straight and tall, matching Zane\u2019s glare with his own. When he spoke, though, it came out broken. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth and slammed his palm against the wall. \u201cTell me the truth or I walk!\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard, but it was obvious that he was weighing whether or not he should speak.</p> <p>\u201cYou really have to think about it?\u201d Zane shoved away from Ty, unable to tear his eyes from him even as the pain twisted in his chest like a knife. \u201cI guess we finally found the one thing more important to you than I am.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s face hardened. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Ty! I feel like I don\u2019t know a goddamned thing now!\u201d Zane jabbed his finger toward Ty. \u201cI tell you I\u2019m going to walk and you have to fucking think about it? Just fuck you!\u201d</p><p>Ty took a deep breath, but it didn\u2019t help the strength of his words when he tried to speak. \u201cIf I told you . . . I\u2019m afraid you\u2019d walk anyway.\u201d</p><p>Zane threw his hands out. \u201cWhat have you got to lose?\u201d</p> <p>Ty\u2019s jaw tightened. Zane held his breath, waiting, giving him a last chance to come clean, unable to imagine what Ty could have been keeping from him that he was so afraid to admit to.</p><p>Ty shook his head, his jaw set.</p><p>Zane took a step back. He was devastated to have been backed down, called on his bluff. He had no idea where to go from here.</p><p>Only one place came to mind, one place to retreat from the stone wall Ty had just raised. It wasn\u2019t just a wall to protect Ty or his secrets. It was a wall to protect Ty\u2019s secrets from Zane.</p><p>He turned on his heel and grabbed up his cigarettes and lighter from the floor. He brushed past Ty as he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p> <p>Zane turned.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man out there who wants to hurt you. And he\u2019s good. Please don\u2019t go off alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to Hell, Ty,\u201d Zane grunted, and he wrenched the door open and stalked out.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Nick was waiting when the door opened, but Zane brushed past him when he tried to stop him. He had to jog to catch up with Zane\u2019s angry strides, and he felt like a puppy hopping along with its master as he tried to keep abreast of the man stalking down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re pissed, man, I am too. But Ty keeps secrets, that\u2019s what he does. That\u2019s what he\u2019s trained to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to defend him,\u201d Zane snarled. \u201cIs that what you\u2019ve done for twenty years? Defend Ty? You must be goddamned exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d Nick reached out and took Zane\u2019s arm. \u201cWould you slow down? Jesus.\u201d</p> <p>Zane stopped and turned to face him. Nick could tell he had about two seconds to make his case. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not stepping into this, okay? Whatever he said in there, it\u2019s between you and him. But I knew Liam Bell. And if Ty says he\u2019s out to get you, I believe him. Don\u2019t go out there alone just because you\u2019re pissed.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes and huffed. Nick tightened his grip on Zane\u2019s arm, hard enough that Zane looked down at it pointedly.</p><p>\u201cImagine that you\u2019re out there in this city, and Ty is hunting you down,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Zane\u2019s nostrils flared and his eyes darkened.</p><p>\u201cNow imagine him smarter. Faster. Imagine him more ruthless and with less to lose. Now imagine that Ty, and he wants revenge. I don\u2019t know about you, man, but that scares the living hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard. He looked mutinous for a moment, but then nodded. \u201cI see your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let me go with you?\u201d</p><p>Zane grumbled and glanced down the hall at the door to their room.</p><p>\u201cLet me tail you, then,\u201d Nick tried. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know I was there and I\u2019ll watch your six while you do whatever it is you need to do to cool down.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and finally wrenched his arm out of Nick\u2019s grasp. \u201cJust leave me alone, all right?\u201d</p><p>He stalked away before Nick could argue. Nick stood and watched Zane\u2019s retreat for a few seconds, torn. He trusted Ty when he said Zane was the target, but he couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t tag along with the man if Zane refused to let him. Zane would shake him easily, and in the end Zane was responsible for his own safety.</p><p>He turned and headed back down the hall to knock on Ty\u2019s door.</p><p>Ty opened it almost immediately. Nick shook his head in answer to Ty\u2019s questioning look.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Ty spat. He ran his hands through his hair and paced into the room.</p><p>Nick held the door open for Kelly and Digger, who\u2019d been standing by, waiting to see what would happen next. Owen was long gone. They filed into Ty\u2019s room, gathering around him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>Ty had his hands on his hips and his head lowered. He looked pale and drawn, and Nick could see he wasn\u2019t running on all cylinders yet. But years of training forced them to look to him first.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Nick watched him for a long moment, and when it became obvious Ty wasn\u2019t pulling it together, Nick cleared his throat. \u201cWe can leave town. But I got a feeling Bell isn\u2019t here \u2019cause he can\u2019t find us at home. He\u2019s here because he wants us all together. He wants us here. And he knew we\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cI agree, but how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanchez,\u201d Digger said. \u201cHe knew we\u2019d get together for Sanchez\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means he also has the resources to know Eli is dead, and that Digger is confined to the state,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s either here on company business, or he\u2019s using those resources and gone off the reservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he have to do with the gris-gris bag?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cYou really think he killed that girl last night?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s brow furrowed. Ty grimaced and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSneaking in as a maid and leaving towels on the bed is a little sloppy for Bell,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Ty held up a hand. \u201cWe\u2019re running off the rails here.\u201d He rubbed at his face, massaging between his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he approach Zane first?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t know you\u2019d find that note, or that Zane would tell you about meeting him. What\u2019s his game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is a game to him. It\u2019s like chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play chess,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you!\u201d Ty barked.</p><p>Nick shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe need to take care of this, right here, right now,\u201d Ty said. \u201cWhile we\u2019re all together.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. He knew he wouldn\u2019t feel safe heading back to Boston with a man like Liam holding a grudge. \u201cWhat about Zane?\u201d</p><p>Ty hesitated, breathing faster. \u201cI\u2019ll send him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he listen?\u201d Kelly asked, looking dubious. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty understandably pissed.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted. \u201cTy. He\u2019s not going to leave you here, in danger, even if he is pissed at you. Even I know him better than that.\u201d</p><p>Ty ran a hand over his eyes again. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get him back here,\u201d Nick said. \u201cUse him as our sixth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he up for that?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>Ty straightened and shot Digger a look. \u201cI trust my life to him every day. He\u2019s up for anything we throw at him.\u201d</p><p>Digger pursed his lips. \u201cOkay. So go fetch him.\u201d</p><p>Ty growled. \u201cAnd you two go find Owen and drag his ass back here.\u201d</p><p>Kelly and Digger nodded and turned, almost synchronized in their movements. There was something comfortable about sinking back into that uniformity, into that chain of leadership and trust.</p><p>Nick watched Ty rummage through Zane\u2019s jeans, looking for something. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here. If someone\u2019s not back in an hour you\u2019re the cavalry. Turn on the GPS tracking on the phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood, holding a bronze sobriety chip. Nick\u2019s father had dozens of them in a drawer at home.</p><p>\u201cZane\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, looking grim and distressed. \u201cHe might need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Is he that easy to knock off the wagon?\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at him for a moment, but then he swallowed hard. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d He headed for the door and was almost out of the room before Nick called after him.</p><p>\u201cTake your piece!\u201d</p><p>Ty cursed and went back to his suitcase to rummage through it.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay to do this? I can go out there and bring him back. I wasn\u2019t on a morphine drip all day and he\u2019s not quite as pissed at me as he is at you.\u201d</p><p>Ty checked the clip of his service weapon and jammed the magazine home, then stuffed it in the back of his jeans and covered it with his flannel shirt.</p><p>Nick watched him with a growing sense of unease. His movements weren\u2019t measured, his mind was all over the place. \u201cTy,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cTy, you\u2019re not up to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be,\u201d Ty growled. \u201cA few hours for the drugs to clear, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, I\u2019m telling you as a friend. You\u2019re not up to this, drugs or not.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLiam Bell. He\u2019s the only person I know who was ever as good as you. And right now, he\u2019s better than you are.\u201d</p><p>Ty breathed out harshly and looked away. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, heading for the door. \u201cHe always was.\u201d</p><p>There was no finding a quiet spot in the French Quarter, especially when half the revelers were wearing huge Easter hats, bunny ears, and layers of beads.</p><p>Zane had wandered toward the outskirts of the Quarter, looking for familiar ground. His steps tried to follow in those of the past, trying to find that little bar he and Becky had visited so long ago. His memory wouldn\u2019t lead him there, though, so he settled for a little tavern on a side street with empty tables.</p><p>His mind was roiling, seething, replaying the look in Ty\u2019s eyes when he\u2019d refused to tell Zane what he was holding back. They had been living together for a year. Lovers for almost two. Partners for longer than that. The idea that Ty had been able to keep something from him, with so little effort, was staggering. And he could feel there was worse, lying in wait.</p><p>This Liam Bell business was only the half of it.</p><p>By the time he reached the bar, his entire body was shaking with anger and adrenaline. He ordered a whiskey straight and took the glass to sit at the corner table.</p><p>He placed it in front of him. A challenge. A test of how far he\u2019d come. He\u2019d done everything in the last year for Ty, trying to be worthy, trying to make himself a better, healthier man. He\u2019d fought the withdrawal that had wracked his body and the cloying need that filled his mind every morning when he woke, all to prove to himself that he deserved to be happy, that he deserved Ty\u2019s love.</p><p>Had Ty even been worth it?</p><p>He stared at the whiskey glass, letting the pull envelop him just to see how strong he was to fight it now.</p><p>Ty thumped into the empty chair across from him, rattling the table. The whiskey in Zane\u2019s glass sloshed. He stared at it, not looking up to meet Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Ty,\u201d Zane said without looking up from the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard to get past this, don\u2019t do this now. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>Zane glowered at him. \u201cWho the hell are you to tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>Ty recoiled like Zane had slapped him, but he jutted his chin out and squared his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m your partner. And I\u2019m your friend. And I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. And you can hate me if you want to, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I love you. And I\u2019m not going to sit idly by while you do this to yourself because of me.\u201d</p><p>Zane glared, but the pain in the pit of his stomach was overpowering the anger. He looked back to the glass, still full of whiskey.</p><p>Ty reached out and slammed something onto the table. When he moved his hand, Zane\u2019s one year sobriety chip remained.</p><p>Zane stared at it, then transferred his glare to Ty. \u201cYou think I need that?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged, looking pointedly at the glass.</p><p>\u201cI really am that weak to you, aren\u2019t I?</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes were steady and dark as they stared at each other, neither man flinching. \u201cYou\u2019re not weak, Zane,\u201d Ty said. \u201cBut we all need help sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you need my help, right? To deal with this Liam Bell guy, this guy from your past you were never going to tell me about. It\u2019s okay to lie to me, keep things from me, but when you need a spare gun, oh, go pick Zane up at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sulk, it doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and finally looked away. \u201cWill you come back with me? Help us figure this shit out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on the first plane home anymore?\u201d Ty shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a stand here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we\u2019re all together. We know where he is. He\u2019s lost the element of surprise and we have the stronger force.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave a curt nod and pushed his chair back to stand.</p><p>\u201cOn one condition,\u201d Zane added.</p><p>Ty sat back, resigned.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything. You\u2019re hiding something, something big, and I want to know what it is. And if you tell me it\u2019s classified, I will smash this glass into your face. And then I\u2019ll be on the first plane home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty remained motionless, not even blinking. Zane had to fight to meet his stare. He rarely saw Ty so still. The last time had been in a blizzard, when Ty had denied ever being in Paris when he damn well had been.</p><p>It was Ty\u2019s only tell. He stopped moving when he lied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to force this out of me?\u201d Ty snarled after a few more seconds.</p> <p>Zane gave a single nod.</p><p>Ty sat forward, staring at the tabletop. He took a long, deep breath. \u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered, losing the hard edge to his voice. He looked up at Zane, his eyes dark in the low light. His nerves must\u2019ve been contagious, because Zane\u2019s stomach was churning. \u201cAfter the Tri-State case, after you were pulled from Miami, Richard Burns assigned me as your partner so I could protect you.\u201d</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his shoulders, pulling one hand below the table. Zane knew he was rubbing his palm across his thigh to dispel the urge to fidget, but he also knew Ty had a gun under there, and Ty\u2019s hand always hovered near his gun when he was scared.</p><p>\u201cThe Vega cartel,\u201d Ty said.</p> <p>Zane straightened. \u201cHow did you know I was under with them? Have you read my file?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was given to me as part of my briefing, but I didn\u2019t read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour briefing. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane . . . for the last year and a half, you have been my assignment.\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to slow around them. Sounds faded. The pangs in Zane\u2019s chest were the labored beating of his heart as he tried to absorb what Ty was telling him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . you\u2019re, what, on guard duty? You\u2019re my personal protection detail, complete with free blowjobs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Ty snarled. \u201cThe Vega cartel found out they had a UC working within them. You got pulled before they could get to you. They\u2019ve had feelers out all over the agency ever since. They know what you looked like. If they found out your identity or location, they\u2019d come for you, and they\u2019d come hard. Almost every time Burns has called me for a job, it\u2019s been to head them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Zane gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s been wreaking havoc in Miami.\u201d</p><p>Ty lifted his head, his expression guarded.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cI\u2019ve been following the reports. Someone\u2019s taking out Vega people left and right, no one knows who it is or why. Even the Bureau is after this guy. But it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>Zane tried to get a handle on that, the image of Ty sneaking off to Miami, hunting people down, terrorizing the lower rungs of the cartel, leaving mangled bodies behind, forcing men on their knees and putting bullets in their heads to leave dread and suspicion in his wake. The man Zane crawled into bed with every night, the man who held him, the man he talked down from nightmares, was the same man doing that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Zane,\u201d Ty begged.</p> <p>Zane struggled to reconcile it with the man he knew. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019ve done all that to cover my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Burns let you run off to Texas so fast, wasn\u2019t it? He thought it was related.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded.</p><p>Zane gaped. \u201cYou . . . I\u2019ve been your mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane brought his hand to his mouth because he couldn\u2019t seem to force it to close on his own. His fingers trembled against his face.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty said harshly.</p><p>\u201cHas this all been some sort of long con?\u201d he choked out. \u201cAn easy way to get close to me and watch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true! Will you let me explain without getting dramatic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDramatic? You\u2019re telling me everything our relationship is based on came out of some assignment briefing, and I\u2019m being dramatic?\u201d</p><p>Ty raised a hand to calm him, which only served to make Zane angrier. Ty had no right to try to calm him now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had damn near two years to explain, Ty! But you didn\u2019t say a fucking word, just kept on like it wouldn\u2019t destroy us when that came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you!\u201d</p><p>Zane banged his fist on the table. Whiskey sloshed across the scarred top. \u201cBullshit! Why the hell would Dick make you protect me from something and not tell me I was in danger? It makes no sense!\u201d</p><p>Ty flinched and lowered his head, then brought both hands up and placed them on the table, twining his fingers. Zane had seen him do it plenty of times when he was nervous. But Zane didn\u2019t care that Ty was nervous right now. He wanted him nervous. He wanted the bastard squirming in his seat because Zane\u2019s world had suddenly fallen away to reveal nothing but a glass floor beneath him.</p><p>When Ty spoke, his voice was quiet, but Zane could hear the tremor in it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you because my second objective was to make sure you hadn\u2019t been turned.\u201d He looked up to meet Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>The implications stole Zane\u2019s breath, making him light-headed. Burns had put Ty on him to make sure he hadn\u2019t become a cartel mole, to make sure he hadn\u2019t betrayed the agency. All those years, Richard Burns had suspected him of being a traitor, of working for the very cartel he\u2019d almost killed himself to bring down. The man he\u2019d thought had battled for his career, who\u2019d saved him and shoved him through rehab to get him clean, had merely been waiting for him to prove himself the enemy. And the instrument of that betrayal was the only man in the world Zane had ever trusted implicitly. Ty.</p><p>The anger and pain were so sharp and sudden that Zane brought a hand to his chest to combat the tightness.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Zane swallowed past the knot in his throat and met Ty\u2019s eyes again. It was hard to breathe. \u201cYou thought I was a traitor?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and reached across the table for Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you, Zane, I know what you are.\u201d</p><p>Zane pushed his hand away and stood. \u201cThen why the hell would you let it go on? He would listen to you if you told him!\u201d</p><p>Ty stood with him, reaching out to put a hand on his shoulder. Zane swatted it away, balling his fist. Ty put up both hands to calm him. \u201cIt was the only way to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d</p><p>Heads began to turn, people staring at them, but Zane didn\u2019t give a fuck. Ty glanced over his shoulder. \u201cCan we please sit down?\u201d he asked. The tone of voice was the same one Ty used when he was trying to coerce someone into being calm. Zane had always found it amusing and oddly comforting. Now, he recognized it as just another of the many ways Ty could manipulate and hurt someone. He\u2019d used that voice to smooth over too many lies, too many half-truths, and too many indiscretions.</p><p>Zane took a shaky breath and sat on the edge of his seat, willing to listen but also ready to bolt if the pain in his chest grew any sharper. Ty sat with him, maintaining eye contact. He scooted his chair closer so their knees were touching, and leaned on his elbows so he was as close to Zane as possible. Zane\u2019s heart sped up, and he fought not to reach out and touch Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, struggling to start. \u201cI couldn\u2019t . . . I couldn\u2019t tell Burns you were clean.\u201d</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth and gripped the edge of the table.</p><p>Ty spoke faster. \u201cAs soon as he knew, he could have reassigned me. He might have moved me on to the next job, and I wasn\u2019t ready to risk that. What we have, Zane, it is the best thing in my life. And I know you feel that way too, because we both fought hard for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fought hard for you, Ty. I loved you, how could you keep this from me?\u201d</p><p>Ty put a hand over his mouth. His fingers were trembling, but he grabbed Zane\u2019s hand, holding it hard. Zane tried to yank it away, but Ty held on. \u201cBecause I knew it would hurt you. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you, I didn\u2019t want you to ever know Dick questioned your loyalty. I was hoping to wait it out, hoping I could hand in my final report when you retired and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. He\u2019d never realized it was possible for a heart to break for so many reasons at the same time. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to hurt me? Well you failed that mission miserably. That\u2019s really the only thing you care about, right? Mission accomplished?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s grip tightened and he lowered his head. He was holding onto Zane as if he\u2019d fall if he let go. Zane recalled the last time they\u2019d both fallen; Ty\u2019d begged him to trust him, and then thrown him off a building. Literally. And Zane had trusted him, with his life, with his happiness, and finally with his heart.</p><p>During all that, though, Ty hadn\u2019t trusted Zane with one simple secret.</p><p>Their entire time together flashed through his mind as the pressure in his chest grew. He ran his thumb over Ty\u2019s finger, trying to understand Ty\u2019s reasoning, desperately trying to believe him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes were drawn to the movement, to the finger that would wear a ring if their plans went the way Zane wanted them to. \u201cNothing about us was a lie,\u201d Ty whispered brokenly.</p><p>Zane had heard that before. Nothing else was a lie, Zane. Except all of it had been a lie. \u201cFool me once, Ty, shame on you.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised his head, his eyes pleading.</p><p>\u201cFool me twice . . .\u201d Zane shook his head. He let go of Ty\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cZane, please.\u201d</p><p>Zane shut his eyes as he stood. \u201cI need some time, okay? I just need . . . I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go anywhere alone.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned and kicked the closest empty chair, sending it clattering to the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve always been alone!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>He stalked away before Ty could say anything more. Zane knew how good Ty was with words, how easily he could manipulate someone into doing what he wanted. He knew Ty\u2019s weapons, and he would be damned if he let himself be susceptible to any of them now.</p><p>Ty called his name as Zane walked away, but Zane knew that if he turned around, he\u2019d be lost in Ty\u2019s labyrinth again. He deserved to be angry. He deserved to be hurt. He wouldn\u2019t give Ty a chance to slither his way out of a betrayal like this until he\u2019d had time to think. He desperately needed to think.</p><p>He made it all the way out the door and around the corner before he leaned against the brick fa\u00e7ade of the building and took a deep, shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cJust walk away,\u201d he whispered. He couldn\u2019t turn around. His resolve would crumble.</p><p>But how could he walk away? He\u2019d never seen Ty\u2019s fingers tremble like that. He\u2019d never heard Ty plead with anyone like that. Perhaps if he looked back, he\u2019d be able to hold onto the anger long enough to keep a clear head.</p><p>When he craned his head to look through the window, Ty was still sitting where he\u2019d left him, the toppled chair next to him, his head bowed, his hand covering his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat looked rough,\u201d a man said at Zane\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Zane glanced at him, not really seeing him. He nodded, and looked through the window again. His heart was breaking and the only person he could think to go to for comfort was still sitting at that goddamned table. \u201cI, uh, I need to go back in there,\u201d he stuttered, taking a step past the man.</p><p>The muzzle of a gun shoved into his side stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, love. We have some catching up to do,\u201d Liam Bell purred against Zane\u2019s ear.</p><p>Pain blossomed at Zane\u2019s temple, and the lights flickered out.</p><p>Ty had his phone to his ear, calling Zane\u2019s number for the tenth time as he stepped out of the elevator. It clicked over to voice mail again, and Ty left another message. He was sounding more and more pissed and panicked with each one, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>It took him three tries to get his key card to work, and he shoved his shoulder into the door to push it open.</p><p>When he stalked into the room, Nick was perched on the end of the bed. Kelly and Digger were sitting opposite him, all of them looking grim.</p><p>\u201cNo Zane?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Ty shook his head, fighting past the wave of nausea, grief, and panic. \u201cNo Owen?\u201d He asked in return, surprised when his voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cHe left the hotel,\u201d Kelly explained. \u201cHe\u2019ll come back, no need to track him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, unless Bell gets to him first,\u201d Digger muttered.</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay, this isn\u2019t some horror movie. He\u2019s not going to pick us off one by one when we venture out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Irish,\u201d Digger said. \u201cI remember Liam being pretty gleeful about hunting people down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s not after all of you,\u201d Ty said. \u201cHe wants me to suffer.\u201d</p><p>Nick lifted his head. \u201cKilling off the people you love is the way I\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, you\u2019re getting creepier since you came out,\u201d Kelly muttered. Nick winked at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd if Bell\u2019s not behind the gris-gris, who is?\u201d Digger added.</p><p>Ty ran his hand through his hair. He dialed Zane\u2019s number again.</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cZane. I can\u2019t reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan down,\u201d Digger whispered.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Nick hissed. He looked at Ty, frowning deeply. \u201cWould he really disappear on you knowing what\u2019s going down? That doesn\u2019t seem like Garrett\u2019s style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Ty said as he listened to Zane\u2019s voice mail message again. He ended the call and stuffed the phone into his pocket, staring at the floor as waves of prickling cold hit him. \u201cHe\u2019s got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that,\u201d Nick tried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s got him, Nick.\u201d He looked around his feet, searching for the crumpled piece of paper he\u2019d found in Zane\u2019s pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put it on the counter in the bathroom.\u201d</p> <p>Ty stalked into the bathroom and grabbed it off the vanity. There was a phone number with the name. He dug his phone back out and dialed it, forcing his fingers to work.</p><p>After two rings a recording answered, a voice that had haunted his dreams for years.</p><p>\u201cWait your turn,\u201d it said.</p><p>Ty gritted his teeth and forced himself not to leave a message that would have come out seething and incoherent and panicked. Instead he ended the call and stared at the phone, his world reeling. He had to think clearly, he had to get to Zane and do it now.</p><p>He slammed the paper back onto the counter and fought hard not to toss his phone. He hung his head, taking deep, calming gulps of air. His breath slid the scrap of paper across the marble, and Ty looked closer at it. Now he saw more on the scrap of paper. Streaks of yellowish stains.</p> <p>\u201cIrish!\u201d he called. Nick appeared in the doorway. Ty picked up the paper, glancing up at the glaring vanity lights overhead. \u201cDid something spill on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d Nick said. He peered over Ty\u2019s shoulder, then up at the hot light bulbs. \u201cWhat\u2019s it smell like?\u201d</p><p>Ty sniffed the paper. \u201cCitrus. Lemon maybe.\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped closer and grabbed the hairdryer off its dock on the side wall. Ty flattened the paper out and Nick turned the hairdryer on the paper. The yellow streaks began to form words.</p><p>\u201cUgh, I knew I hated him when we were stationed together,\u201d Nick grumbled. The words became clearer as the heat brought out the acid in the lemon juice. \u201cHe probably sat in a bar somewhere and used the damn lemon from his water. I hate him!\u201d</p><p>Ty just shook his head, heart hammering as the words became clear. Liam Bell had slipped this piece of paper into Zane\u2019s pocket, knowing it would make its way to Ty, believing Ty would keep a level enough head to find the message written here.</p> <p>Liam was already outthinking him and Ty was already relying on luck.</p><p>2 AM. Jackson Square. Be there or your partner dies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill him,\u201d Ty growled.</p><p>Nick put a hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently. \u201cEasy, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty slammed his hand against the paper. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</p><p>He turned, but Nick grabbed him by both shoulders, holding him there and forcing Ty to meet his eyes. \u201cThink, okay? Breathe.\u201d</p><p>Ty lowered his head like a bull preparing to charge, but Nick faced him down, waiting for him to calm himself. Ty took a deep breath and nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick whispered. He released Ty.</p> <p>Nick\u2019s phone began to ring from his back pocket, breaking the spell. Ty was shaking when Nick pulled the phone out and turned away from him. He glanced up, trying to stay calm, trying not to think of the things that could happen to Zane between now and 2 AM.</p><p>Nick cursed as he checked the caller ID, walking away. \u201cGood afternoon, Detective,\u201d he answered with a wince. He turned to Ty. \u201cOf course, any way we can help. When would you like us to come in?\u201d His eyes widened and he waved at Ty. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to the hotel?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the phone and then to his feet. The detective was coming here to interview them again. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m afraid Agent Garrett isn\u2019t here right now, maybe we can delay it until he is.\u201d</p><p>Ty shoved his phone in his pocket and rushed to the bed to grab his jacket. He couldn\u2019t be caught in the room. He glanced at the others, and they both waved him toward the door. Nick tapped his watch and held up five fingers: five minutes to get clear.</p><p>Ty made a gesture to let them know he\u2019d find them, then wrenched the door open, only to stop short when he found himself face-to-face with a man holding a phone to his ear and a badge, two uniformed policemen flanking him.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Ty grunted.</p><p>\u201cWell, Tyler Beaumont,\u201d the detective drawled. He shut his phone, and Nick cursed behind Ty. \u201cI should have known you\u2019d show up with a load of trouble and a couple fake badges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up, darling, we\u2019re wasting time here,\u201d a voice said in the darkness.</p><p>It was the same name Ty called him sometimes, but it wasn\u2019t the same word. There was no drawl to it, no affectionate smirk in the voice. It was British, said with sarcasm and disdain.</p><p>Zane forced his eyes open, wincing as light lanced through his brain. A blond man came into focus. He leaned over Zane, holding a penlight. He shined it in Zane\u2019s eyes, and Zane groaned and turned his head away.</p><p>\u201cWakey wakey,\u201d Liam crooned.</p><p>\u201cGo to Hell,\u201d Zane grunted.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be testy, Zane. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d</p><p>Zane ignored the throbbing in the back of his head to glare at the man. \u201cBy bashing me in the head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing less would have stopped you from going back in that pub and making a huge mistake.\u201d</p><p>Ty. Zane tried to sit up, but his hands and arms were tied down. He was stretched out on a concrete floor, trussed up with ropes around his ankles, knees, and wrists. Liam sat beside him on the ground. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>\u201cMerely precautionary,\u201d Liam said. Zane was already tired of the way he talked, all dark threat laced with that cheerful British accent. \u201cHear me out, and then I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t trust that for a second, but as long as Liam was talking, Zane had a chance of slipping his ties and escaping.</p><p>\u201cYou see, I know Tyler Grady. Quite well, to be frank, and he\u2019s a danger to you. To everyone, really, but we can\u2019t all be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler who?\u201d Zane mumbled as he stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s sweet. Still protecting him even after what he\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Zane cut his eyes sideways.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Zane. I know what happened. I knew before you did. And I know more. Do you care to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of hearing more of Ty\u2019s sins, not from this source.</p><p>Liam leaned closer, casually resting his elbow on Zane\u2019s chest so he could look down into his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand. Ty broke my heart too. It\u2019s a small but spectacular club. Welcome.\u201d</p><p>Zane licked his lips, trying to regulate his breathing, desperate to slow his heartbeat so the man wouldn\u2019t feel it banging against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really his fault, it\u2019s just how Ty works. He\u2019s easy to fall for when he\u2019s got that mask up. He makes you love him because he knows that\u2019s the easiest way to get what he wants from you. You trust him, you see something worthwhile, something vulnerable in him, and you think you can help. Six months later, he has all your secrets, and he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Zane was shaking his head as Liam spoke.</p><p>Liam reached to pop the button on his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky your heart was merely broken.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes darted between Liam\u2019s hand and his face, his mind whirring. Liam yanked another button loose, then another. He pulled his collar down to reveal two circular scars on his chest. Bullet wounds. He tapped one with a finger. \u201cCourtesy of the love of your life.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at the scar.</p><p>\u201cA .45 caliber MEUSOC pistol. Standard for Force Recon, you know. Back in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re SAS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. I see he\u2019s told you the story.\u201d</p><p>Zane was silent. This really was the man Ty had been talking about. The man he\u2019d been involved with in the service, the man he\u2019d shot. He was handsome and charismatic, exactly the type Ty would be drawn to. Zane could see that much. That, and he carried a gun.</p><p>Zane wanted to question him further, but doing so would reveal how much he already knew. He wanted Liam to keep talking.</p><p>\u201cNo matter. I\u2019ve always said the past is the past for a reason, yeah? Although it does occasionally come back to bite you in the arse. Do you remember a man named Antonio de la Vega?\u201d Liam asked, his blue eyes narrowing.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught. \u201cName\u2019s familiar. Zorro, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come now, Zane, don\u2019t be coy with me. We\u2019re all friends here. We can share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends don\u2019t tie friends up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got the wrong sort of friends then,\u201d Liam purred. He laughed, a surprisingly warm, pleasant sound. \u201cI quite like you. You\u2019re fun. Listen, Ty\u2019s already called me once so he knows I have you. I\u2019m not going to harm you, I promise. And I keep my promises, unlike some of us. But I need to lay some groundwork before I call him back, so do me a favor and indulge me. Antonio de la Vega?\u201d</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth, but he supposed he didn\u2019t have much to lose. \u201cI heard he was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question. Nor is it news.\u201d</p><p>Zane groaned. \u201cI remember him. Head of the Vega cartel, out of the Republic of Colombia. Feeds into the larger set of Gulf cartels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. He is indeed very dead. You were one of the FBI agents to infiltrate them. The last one left alive, to be exact. You lot almost took him down, from what I understand. Quite a nice body of work.\u201d He paused to glance down the long line of Zane\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cEyes are up here,\u201d Zane grunted.</p><p>Liam was smirking when he looked back at Zane\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a price on your head.\u201d He paused, waiting for a response. When Zane merely stared at him, he nodded. \u201cWhen that plane crashed with Antonio de la Vega in it, his brother took over. You remember his brother?\u201d</p><p>Zane did. Antonio de la Vega had been smart and controlled, stingy and almost surgical with his use of violence. He\u2019d lived by a certain code of loyalty and honor. He hadn\u2019t been a bad man to work for, and illegalities aside, Zane had quite liked the man. He\u2019d been saddened when he\u2019d heard of his death. But the younger de la Vega was a different animal altogether. He had a temper. Zane nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cWell. He believes the FBI agent who helped destroy part of his operation is the very same agent who killed his brother. He\u2019s out for blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Antonio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? You went from SAS to being a cartel henchman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, darling, I went from SAS to NIA.\u201d</p><p>Zane rested his aching head on the cold floor. It seemed that what Ty had told him was at least partially true. \u201cNIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour very own National Intelligence Agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it fucking stands for. What are they doing involved with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re freelancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Juan Carlos de la Vega was contacted earlier this week and told the FBI agent who killed his brother would be here in New Orleans this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhom.\u201d Liam shrugged, pursing his lips. \u201cI was merely contracted to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>That got Zane\u2019s attention, and fast. He raised his head. \u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t kill his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But Tyler did.\u201d Liam nodded condescendingly. \u201cDon\u2019t look surprised. It\u2019s what he does, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you\u2019re here to kill him for a paycheck?\u201d</p><p>Liam quirked an eyebrow. \u201cDoes this low opinion of me come from Tyler, or from my actions, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>Zane could only assume that was a rhetorical question, since he could feel where the blood had caked on the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who my target was until I got here, so you can stow the attitude. I can only stall for so long, however. When the job doesn\u2019t get done, more will come. And you know what will happen then.\u201d</p><p>Zane clenched his jaw and nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re a smart boy, so I assume you\u2019ve already detected the real problem. For you, that is. It\u2019s not that someone wants to kill Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems like a real problem to me.\u201d</p><p>Liam waved that off. \u201cAs you like. The real issue, of course, is de la Vega\u2019s henchmen don\u2019t know what Ty looks like. They will, however, spot your beautiful face from a mile away. And I\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t believe in coincidences.\u201d</p><p>Zane was silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to untie you now,\u201d Liam said. He leaned over Zane, still smirking. \u201cYou must promise not to try to maim me, because I will put you down.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. Liam was at least six inches shorter than Zane, with compact, wiry muscles and very little bulk to him. \u201cYou\u2019ll put me down?\u201d he repeated, incredulous. Liam nodded. \u201cYou and what army?\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned wider. He pulled a knife from a sheath in his boot and cut through the zip tie that held Zane\u2019s feet together. As soon as Zane was free, he kicked up, aiming for Liam\u2019s head. Liam blocked the blow with his forearm, then rolled over his own shoulder to crouch several feet away. He was still grinning.</p><p>Zane arched his back, pushing himself off the floor so he could pull his tied hands under his body and over his legs, bringing them in front of him as he rolled to his feet. He faced Liam, bent low, ready for an attack.</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not here to fight you, love. I do enjoy the feisty ones, so if you\u2019re willing, I\u2019m ready to go. That being said, I\u2019d rather not make you bleed anymore today. I\u2019ll even hand you the phone so you can call Tyler yourself.\u201d He pulled a cell phone from his back pocket and waved it enticingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane nodded. The man was convincing, but Zane couldn\u2019t help but expect a trap. No one so calm and soothing could be up to any good. \u201cSlide it over.\u201d</p><p>Liam placed it on the floor and pushed it. Zane stopped it with his foot, not taking his eyes off Liam.</p><p>Liam held up the knife as well. \u201cA peace offering, yes?\u201d He placed it on the ground and shoved it toward Zane too.</p> <p>Zane bent slowly, not taking his eyes from his opponent as he grasped the knife. He cut the tie on his wrists and then whirled the handle of the knife around his fingers, gripping it so the blade rested along his wrist, ready to fight.</p><p>Liam propped his elbow on his knee, resting his chin in his hand. \u201cFeel better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re armed. Go ahead and give Tyler a call. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s burning down the Quarter looking for you by now.\u201d</p><p>Zane fumbled with the cell phone, using his free hand without moving his eyes from Liam\u2019s. He hit send twice, assuming it would be Ty\u2019s number. Nerves skittered through him as the phone rang. Liam remained in a crouch. His composure and reassurance were infuriating.</p> <p>When Ty\u2019s voice mail picked up, Zane frowned harder. \u201cTy,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cYou answer your goddamned phone in the middle of sex but you can\u2019t pick up now?\u201d He jabbed the phone off, cursing.</p><p>Liam\u2019s brow creased. \u201cHe didn\u2019t answer?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head.</p><p>Liam ran one finger along his lower lip, frowning harder. \u201cOdd, that.\u201d</p><p>Zane took deep, calming breaths and tried to push past his whirlwind of thoughts to find a point of clarity. It all boiled down to whether to trust Liam Bell\u2019s word right here and now. And it was hard to a trust a man who\u2019d smashed your skull in and then tied you up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Zane, it\u2019s been a while since I knew him. But with all his faults, he always made a bloody good cavalry. If he\u2019s not answering, he\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Zane whispered, hating to agree with the man. If Liam had said the sky was blue right now, Zane would have felt compelled to argue that it was in fact merely refracting light.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>Zane shifted from foot to foot, as if the battle in his mind was taking place in his body as well. He finally held up the knife. \u201cI want another one of these. Then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Ty sat on the wrong side of a battered wooden table in a small interrogation room with no air conditioning. He wasn\u2019t handcuffed, not yet, and they\u2019d yet to read him his rights. But he had no illusions about being able to get up and walk out. The easiest way out of this would be to identify himself as an FBI agent and be done with it. But there were too many risks, too many loose threads left over from his days undercover, and he\u2019d have to play the part he\u2019d once played down here until he had more information.</p><p>He had some time if Liam intended to meet him at 2 AM.</p><p>The door creaked as it opened, and the same detective from the hotel sauntered in and tossed a heavy file on the table. An officer pulled the door closed behind him. Ty\u2019s eyes strayed to the door as it clicked shut. They had him under guard. His knee began to bounce and he forced himself to stop.</p><p>He met the detective\u2019s eyes, sprawling in his chair in a casual, insolent pose.</p> <p>\u201cSurprised to see you crawling to town,\u201d the detective said.</p><p>Ty clucked his tongue. When he spoke, it was with the same affected drawl he\u2019d perfected while undercover years ago. \u201cDetective Poirot, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoirier. But you can call me Sir. It\u2019ll be Boss here soon. Soon as we get you in chains.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes. \u201cAnd what is it I\u2019ve done to deserve being chained up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill that girl, Tyler Beaumont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour crew we have in the lobby? Witnesses say they saw a man with them the night of the murder. Description fits you to a T. They say you ducked out, then your buddies closed up shop, wouldn\u2019t let anyone leave. Smart. Make the police think the scene\u2019s pure while you slip out the hole you crawled in through.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed and sat forward. \u201cThere\u2019s a real killer out there somewhere. And you\u2019re wasting your time here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just in town on a jaunt, Detective. Little harmless fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suppose Ava Gaudet would think your little jaunt is harmless?\u201d</p><p>Ty cocked his head, trying hard not to react. Ava had been his main contact here during his undercover days. Another few months in town and he probably would have married her. \u201cWe made our peace. What\u2019s she got to do with a murdered girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat murdered girl calls her to mind. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Tattoos. Even had one of them cute little feathers tucked behind her ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Poirier laughed. He tapped the file on the table between them. \u201cI have you here for half a dozen offenses in the two years you were on our radar. Breaking and entering. Money laundering. Racketeering. Assault and battery. Did you beat your girl too? Her daddy sure thinks you did.\u201d</p><p>Ty remained motionless. He had to keep his cover if Ava Gaudet\u2019s father had Poirier\u2019s ear. He was the precinct commander. And he was dirty as hell. Only two people in town had known Ty was FBI at the time Katrina hit, and Ty knew neither of them would have given up that information, and certainly not to Louis Gaudet. It would have cast doubt on them by association.</p><p>Poirier wasn\u2019t deterred by Ty\u2019s silence. He continued flipping through the file. \u201cAll that, not to mention over a dozen drunk and disorderlies. You were in the tank more often than not every Thursday night. Like clockwork.\u201d They stared at each other, each waiting for the other to flinch. Finally Poirier leaned his elbows on the table. \u201cYou ever get a little too drunk, Tyler Beaumont? Get a little too angry? A little too out of control?\u201d</p><p>Ty crossed his arms, inclining his head. He\u2019d met his handler in the drunk tank every three or four weeks. But he couldn\u2019t tell Poirier that.</p><p>\u201cYou ever put your hands around a girl\u2019s neck and squeezed? Watch the life drain from her?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t rise to the bait, but he was beginning to question the wisdom of not identifying himself. He couldn\u2019t, though. If he did and Gaudet got a hold of him, he\u2019d never make it out of the police station alive.</p><p>Poirier narrowed his eyes, moving his tongue around inside his mouth like he was chewing on something. He picked up the folder and tapped it on its side, then opened it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to make a phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer my questions first. Why are you here? You left under cover of water six years ago, why come back? Why now?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s knee began to bounce again as he fought to concentrate on the interrogation and not worry himself into a fit about Zane.</p><p>\u201cWas it Arthur Murdoch? He owned the tavern you worked for. You come for his funeral?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s knee stopped. \u201cMurdoch\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Poirier nodded solemnly. \u201cGris-gris bag in his hand. Your name written on that little piece of parchment.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s jaw tightened and he fought a wave of nausea. Murdoch had owned the dive where Ty had worked and lived. He\u2019d been almost like a father to Ty, and he and his beloved mongrel had taken seats on the helicopter Ty had pulled every string to get before Katrina made landfall. He had known Ty was an FBI agent, and he\u2019d sworn to take that secret to the grave. Now someone had killed him, pointing his fingers at Ty in the end.</p><p>\u201cEither read me my rights, or I\u2019m walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that, right after you give me one last answer.\u201d Poirier pulled an evidence bag out of his pocket and plopped it on the table. Inside was the gris-gris bag Ty had kept in his pocket. They\u2019d taken it along with all his other belongings when they\u2019d brought him in. \u201cIt matches the one the girl was holding. And the one Murdoch was found with.\u201d</p><p>Ty could feel the blood draining from his face as he stared at the bag.</p><p>Poirier leaned forward, lowering his voice. \u201cTell me, Tyler Beaumont. Who was your next victim going to be?\u201d</p><p>It was under an uneasy peace that Zane and Liam rode the elevator of the Bourbon Orleans to the fifth floor. Zane stood far enough away to be able to maneuver, keeping an eye on Liam even though the man had proved true to his word thus far.</p><p>Liam shook his head, smiling as he stared at the doors. \u201cAre you always this paranoid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m still bleeding from our introduction, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Liam glanced at him and winked.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes. The man was insufferable. No wonder he and Ty had been an item. He forced Liam to move ahead of him as they made their way down the hall, and he hung back out of reach. He\u2019d seen the fear in Ty\u2019s eyes when he\u2019d said Liam was here for trouble. And men like Ty didn\u2019t scare easily.</p><p>Liam held up the room key Zane had given him and slid it in, stepping back as the little light flicked green. Zane pushed the door open and called out, \u201cComing in with company!\u201d</p><p>No one responded, and Zane nodded for Liam to go in. Liam put both hands behind his head and strolled into the room, Zane moving behind with one of the borrowed knives in his hand.</p><p>As soon as Liam cleared the entryway, a gun appeared from behind the corner, pressing to Liam\u2019s temple. \u201cOh dear,\u201d Liam drawled.</p><p>Owen Johns stepped away from his hiding spot and out of Liam\u2019s reach with practiced speed, keeping the gun trained on him.</p><p>Zane groaned. The one man here who wouldn\u2019t listen to a word either of them said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he tried anyway. He held up his knife. \u201cI\u2019m fifty percent sure he\u2019s on our side.\u201d</p><p>Owen\u2019s lip curled and he grunted. \u201cLast time I saw him, he was dead, so forgive me for being a little wary.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at Liam. \u201cGet on your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t that sort of game.\u201d Liam sighed. \u201cGo fetch me your master and we\u2019ll discuss it together.\u201d</p><p>Owen bristled at the condescension, but he began to relax his stance. \u201cThe others have been arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane blurted.</p><p>\u201cI watched from across the street. Took all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible to dispense with some weaponry here?\u201d Liam drawled. \u201cMy fingers are going numb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a unicorn\u2019s chance in Hell,\u201d Owen grunted.</p><p>\u201cNow, what would a unicorn be doing in Hell?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask him when you get there.\u201d</p><p>Zane slid his knife back into the sheath Liam had given him for it. \u201cWhat else do we know? Why were they all taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only assume someone figured out who Ty was,\u201d Owen answered grudgingly. \u201cSomeone fingered him for the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat murder?\u201d Liam asked. For the first time, he sounded genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cThe one you committed,\u201d Owen snarled. \u201cKilled a girl, left a hoodoo curse bag behind. The same one you stuffed in Ty\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not stuffed anything in Ty\u2019s bed in some years. And I didn\u2019t kill anyone last night, certainly not some girl with a voodoo curse. Are you all still this insane? I thought that faded with time.\u201d</p><p>Zane pointedly cleared his throat. \u201cYou think someone saw him and recognized him from when he was undercover?\u201d</p><p>Owen nodded.</p><p>\u201cOr someone\u2019s setting him up,\u201d Liam offered, turning to meet Zane\u2019s eyes for emphasis. \u201cSomeone who knew he\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth. If that were the case, the cartel merely had to get to Ty in jail and he was done. They had him cornered already and Ty didn\u2019t even know they were after him. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cHe went by the name Tyler Beaumont while here. Not exactly original, but one shouldn\u2019t stray too far, am I right?\u201d Liam winked at Owen.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I forgot how annoying you are,\u201d Owen grumbled. He still had his gun up. Where had the man gotten it? Zane remembered someone saying Owen was a head of security at some big corporation, so he might carry all the time. But knowing what he did now, Zane could only assume Sidewinder carried all the time no matter what, in case they were called to action. The thought made Zane both sad and exceptionally angry.</p><p>Liam shrugged and finally lowered his hands. He edged toward the interior of the room and sat in one of the chairs, smirking at Owen as the man followed him with his gun.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, what the fuck is going on?\u201d Owen growled.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say, Mr. Bell was persuasive in getting an audience with me. There\u2019s some stuff in play that\u2019s going to get ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody stuff,\u201d Liam answered.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to Ty and the others,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI\u2019ll go down there, identify myself. We\u2019ll clear this up and get to work.\u201d</p><p>Liam tutted and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane demanded, already exasperated by the man.</p><p>\u201cIdentifying yourself will leave you wide open. The New Orleans Police Department is a sieve, it always has been. If the cartel lads don\u2019t already know Ty\u2019s there, when word gets out that a Fed was in there throwing weight around? You\u2019ll be dead before Ty\u2019s out of his cell and Ty will soon follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What cartel guys? What the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Owen asked. He was growing more agitated, and he was still holding the gun.</p><p>Zane took him by the shoulders so the gun was no longer trained on Liam, and he forced Owen to meet his eyes. \u201cListen carefully, because I\u2019m only going to say this once. Liam is with the NIA, but he\u2019s undercover taking jobs as a paid assassin. He was hired by a cartel in Miami to come here and kill me and/or Ty, but he\u2019s trying to help us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>Owen glared at Liam. \u201cSo you\u2019re really NIA like Ty said.\u201d He slid his gun into the holster under his arm, but advanced on the man, pointing his finger. \u201cYou\u2019re the one got us tossed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was not my intention,\u201d Liam said, cool as ever as Owen seethed over him. \u201cWhat the Marines did to you lot after was unconscionable and had nothing to do with me. I am sorry it happened, but I am no longer officially affiliated with the NIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were NIA,\u201d Zane said in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cI lied. I tend to do that. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Owen shook his head.</p><p>Zane waved a hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re not really NIA, that just makes you a paid assassin!\u201d</p> <p>Liam shrugged.</p><p>Zane had to take a moment to calm his thoughts before he spoke again. \u201cTy thinks you\u2019re here for revenge.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. It was a deep, rich sound. \u201cI suppose he would. Guilt does odd things to an already unstable mind. Now! Shall we discuss how we\u2019re going to break him out of jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst we grab all our stuff,\u201d Zane said, fighting back his misgivings. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t be able to come back for it after this.\u201d</p><p>Liam chuckled. \u201cThis should be fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Owen grumbled before turning away.</p> <p>\u201cI am a Boston Police Detective,\u201d Nick hissed to the officer manning the front desk. He was sitting between Kelly and Digger, all of them handcuffed to a bench as they waited to be processed. It was humiliating, to say the least. \u201cMy name is Nicholas O\u2019Flaherty, my badge is in my luggage. All you have to do is give my captain a call and we\u2019ll clear this up!\u201d</p><p>The woman at the desk continued to ignore him.</p><p>\u201cWasting your breath, man,\u201d Digger grumbled.</p><p>Nick thumped his head against the wall. People came and went through the ornate lobby of the old building even though it was now after midnight. Tourists walked in off the street to buy T-shirts out of a vending machine. Some of them stopped to gawk at the three of them sitting there. Digger had taken to waving at them to show his handcuffs.</p><p>Kelly leaned against Nick, his head on Nick\u2019s shoulder as he drowsed. \u201cThis is not the way I saw this weekend going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cBecause I figured it was sixty/forty we\u2019d end up just like this. Again.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes.</p><p>The most frustrating part of it was knowing all three of them could have picked the locks on the handcuffs in the blink of an eye. But what were they supposed to do? Storm the police station and bust Ty out of some cell or interrogation room? Go on the lam in NOLA? And for what?</p> <p>\u201cWhich one was the sixty?\u201d Kelly asked after a few minutes.</p><p>Digger pointed to the floor.</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The door opened again and a rush of air blew through the lobby. Nick jerked to attention. He recognized the line of Owen Johns\u2019s shoulders as the man slunk into the station and loitered near the T-shirt machine. Trailing in behind him was another man, and Nick belatedly realized it was Zane.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the cavalry,\u201d Digger said.</p><p>\u201cThank Christ,\u201d Kelly grumbled. He raised his hands, rubbing at one wrist and dropping his handcuffs to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? They were too tight.\u201d</p><p>Digger dropped his cuffs to the floor with a clank that echoed through the station. \u201cIf he\u2019s not wearing his, neither am I.\u201d</p><p>When Nick looked back, Zane was at the desk speaking to the officer. Nick\u2019s fingers began to work at the lock of his handcuffs. Owen was sauntering toward them, a smirk on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re busting you out.\u201d</p><p>Nick stood and yanked his handcuffs off his wrists, then tossed them at Owen with a curse. \u201cYou should be sitting here with us.\u201d</p><p>Owen caught the cuffs, but he was laughing. \u201cAnd if I was? Who\u2019d be saving your ass then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him in here,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Nick scowled. Cold settled in the pit of his stomach. \u201cGarrett\u2019s not flashing a badge over there. This isn\u2019t official, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you getting us out?\u201d</p><p>Owen glanced casually over his shoulder and reached under his jacket. \u201cPlan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan B? What\u2019s Plan B?\u201d</p><p>Owen clucked his tongue, held up a small canister, and grinned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d Digger hissed. \u201cYou went through my stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou travel with smoke grenades?\u201d Nick blurted.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Owen said. He flicked the starter ring of the grenade and tossed it over his shoulder. Violet smoke began to billow from it as it spiraled through the air. \u201cRun like hell.\u201d</p><p>Ty had been read his rights, handcuffed to the table, and then left alone once he\u2019d refused to say more. He tended to carry a key in the lining of all his shoes, so dealing with the lock on his handcuffs was simply a matter of getting his foot high enough to dig the key out. When he got them off, he wrapped them around his fingers to use like brass knuckles. He was taking down whoever stepped through that door next. He refused to sit here while Zane was in danger, and if that meant breaking out of jail and becoming a fugitive for the duration, then so be it.</p><p>He also knew he was in quite a bit of trouble here himself. Part of his work while in New Orleans had been tracking the activities of one seriously scary bad cop. That cop was now the commander for the Royal Street station. And he\u2019d be coming for Ty.</p><p>He stood beside the door, waiting to pounce on the next man who came through it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand what the gris-gris had to do with Liam Bell. Was Liam really just here for revenge? It didn\u2019t make sense, and he was beginning to suspect his own guilt and feelings over how that had ended were clouding his assessment. Why here? Why now? If the plan was to set Ty up for the murders of that girl and Arthur Murdoch, then it was a piss-poor plan. And if the intention hadn\u2019t been to peg Ty as the murderer, that meant the gris-gris bag in his hotel room was a promise. He was the next victim.</p><p>And what in the hell did Liam grabbing Zane have to do with any of it?</p><p>The doorknob rattled beside him, and then the door cracked open. Ty tensed, preparing to launch himself. Then the heavy metal door was shoved open as if someone had thrown all their weight into it. It slammed into Ty, knocking him against the cinderblock wall. He staggered as the door swung away, regaining his bearings only to find a gun trained on him.</p><p>\u201cSo predictable,\u201d Liam said with a shake of his head. \u201cHello, love.\u201d</p><p>He was standing far enough away that Ty wouldn\u2019t be able to reach him without lunging past the barrel of that gun. Ty leaned against the wall, breathing hard. \u201cWhere is Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Out in the lobby acting as a distraction. It\u2019s sweet he\u2019s the first thing you think of, though.\u201d</p><p>Ty lunged at him, and Liam brought up the gun, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve hurt him, I swear to God I\u2019ll make you bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of hurting anyone, Tyler, I merely needed your full attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201c2 AM or your partner dies? That\u2019s how you get my attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked, didn\u2019t it? But things have changed. We\u2019re in a bit of a hurry here, so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Liam tossed him his jacket and his gun. \u201cI\u2019m the rescue party.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>It was the middle of the night, but the French Quarter didn\u2019t seem to realize it. Zane and the others had escaped the police station in a whirl of purple smoke and chaos, and each man had darted off in a different direction. The crowded streets helped to hide them. They were supposed to scramble for fifteen minutes, then make their way to a rendezvous point once they were sure they were clear.</p><p>Any man who couldn\u2019t shake the police was going to have to take one for the team.</p><p>Zane had easily evaded any pursuit, using the crowds as cover. After darting down a few side roads, he wandered along Bourbon Street for ten minutes, the dancing crowd full of Easter revelers guiding him like a ship on a river.</p><p>He tried not to contemplate his predicament, but it was hard to keep it out of mind. They were now wanted by the police. He and Nick had both given their identification to the detective when they\u2019d given their accounts of the murder scene, so eventually they\u2019d be connected to the breakout. His real name would come out of this and the Bureau would get involved. They would have a lot of explaining to do, but he felt certain he and Ty could talk their way out of it.</p><p>And then there was Ty. It seemed like Zane kept forgetting what Ty had admitted to, like his mind was actively trying to block it out. Ty had essentially spent the last two years spying on him. How was Zane supposed to know what was real and what had been another of Ty\u2019s clever tricks to glean information from him?</p><p>How much of Ty had he really seen? How well did he know Ty at all?</p><p>When he reached Jackson Square, Kelly was the only one there. He was loitering near the iron fence that surrounded the raised, grassy park area. During the day, people used the fence to hang artwork and sell their wares, but at night it was all cleared away. People sat on the concrete ledge or leaned against the fence, smoking, drinking, laughing. Several of them played music with tip jars in front of them.</p><p>Kelly was lingering near a man with a guitar. When he spotted Zane, he pushed away from the wall and grinned lopsidedly. \u201cNot exactly a discreet meeting place.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cIt was the only place we all knew how to get to. And it\u2019s crowded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Zane winced and glanced around the throng. He didn\u2019t want to go through this more than once, and he knew the others would have the same question. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly intelligent,\u201d Kelly said with a laugh. \u201cI can usually follow.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, the others will be here soon, and then we\u2019re dealing with the whole group dynamic and accusations and serious ADD, so . . . you want to let me know what\u2019s going on now so I can help you?\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at the man for a long moment, then nodded. \u201cYou were the group\u2019s corpsman, right? So you can deal with . . . any injuries that come from this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kelly said warily. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into Liam Bell,\u201d Zane said, and hurried to explain faster as Kelly\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHe claims he was hired by a Miami cartel to come here and kill Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kelly narrowed his eyes, looking off into the distance over Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh. A hand touched his back and he jerked, reaching for the knife in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cEasy, tiger,\u201d Nick said as he stepped around Zane and patted him on the back. \u201cSomeone want to tell me why I just made myself a fugitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Kelly answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this again,\u201d Zane grumbled.</p><p>Nick stood on his tip toes and looked around the crowd. Several uniformed policemen were walking along the edges of the crowd. Others rode horses. The way they were scanning faces made it obvious they were looking for someone. \u201cWe should start moving,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re too conspicuous standing like this.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grabbed Nick\u2019s arm and stopped him.</p><p>Nick and Zane both turned to see what had caught Kelly\u2019s attention. Zane spotted Ty immediately. He was still moving slowly, obviously still in some pain and fighting off the remainder of the sedative the hospital had given him. He was keeping his head down and his face in shadow, but Zane knew the roll of his shoulders. Trailing behind Ty, looking far less conspicuous, was Liam Bell. Ty\u2019s eyes locked on Zane\u2019s, and relief flooded through his entire body. Ty took a hasty step forward, but a hand appeared on his shoulder, jerking him back. He went rigid again, putting his hands to his sides.</p><p>Zane would recognize that posture anywhere. Ty had a gun at his back.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes stayed on Zane\u2019s, and Liam used Ty\u2019s body to cover himself. \u201cLet\u2019s all be calm now,\u201d Liam said when they got close. \u201cWho\u2019s armed?\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled his jacket away to reveal the knife there. Nick and Kelly both shook their heads.</p><p>Liam eased his grip on Ty\u2019s shoulder, then gave him a pat on the back. He slid the gun under his coat and grinned. \u201cJust making sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Nick demanded. \u201cWhy is he here and am I allowed to hurt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Zane glanced at his watch. \u201cThey haven\u2019t shown yet. They\u2019ve got two more minutes.\u201d</p><p>They remained in an uneasy standoff as the bells of the cathedral rang out the hour. Liam still lingered behind Ty\u2019s shoulder for cover. No one spoke. No one moved, save for Zane periodically checking the time.</p><p>Digger eventually materialized from the crowd, Owen on his heels. They\u2019d apparently met up somewhere and made their way here together. They approached warily, sensing the tension in the group. Neither man said a word when they joined them.</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d Zane finally said, relieved everyone had made it out. \u201cWe have all our stuff stashed, we\u2019ll go get it. But where to after that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t break town,\u201d Nick grunted. He had yet to take his eyes off Liam. \u201cWe need somewhere to lay low, regroup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you can tell us what the fuck is going on,\u201d Kelly added.</p><p>Zane nodded.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do we go?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cMy safe house is blown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>\u201cToo much activity, I don\u2019t trust it.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced over his shoulder at the man, then back at Zane. His mouth was set in a grim line. \u201cI might know the perfect place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d Zane asked. Ty nodded.</p> <p>Nick snorted. \u201cThe girl who tried to kill you with a cleaver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot. I think she might be in danger too; I need to warn her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll split up, then,\u201d Liam said. He gave Ty another pat. \u201cYou test the waters with cleaver girl, and we\u2019ll get our supplies.\u201d</p><p>Ty glared over his shoulder, but he nodded. \u201cYou four, go with him. Keep him in line. Zane and I will scout it out and call you in thirty.\u201d</p><p>The others nodded, albeit grudgingly as Liam led them away. Zane and Ty were left alone. Meeting Ty\u2019s eyes made Zane\u2019s stomach flutter, but the anger lingered. He clenched his teeth, trying to keep it in.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ty asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, maybe. He\u2019s slick, Zane. Don\u2019t ever let your guard down around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zane snarled. He took a step closer, straightening to his full height so he could look down at Ty. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what people have been saying about you for two years now.\u201d</p><p>Ty flinched, but he didn\u2019t look away. He pushed his shoulders back, narrowing his eyes. It was like watching a dog bristle as it stared down a threat. Zane hadn\u2019t felt that since their first few weeks together. He refused to back off, though. He put his finger on Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten just because your ass needed saving.\u201d</p><p>It was too dark to read Ty\u2019s expression, but he finally broke eye contact to glance down at Zane\u2019s finger.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this place?\u201d Zane asked when it became apparent that Ty wasn\u2019t going to respond.</p><p>Ty spoke through gritted teeth. \u201cJust off Frenchmen Street. Down Decatur and across Esplanade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead the way.\u201d</p> <p>Ty stared at Zane for another few breaths. Then he stepped past him, brushing his shoulder against Zane\u2019s as he set off through the carousing crowd.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t say a word as they prowled toward the far edge of the French Quarter, heading to the little two-block area of Frenchmen Street and the adjoining Faubourg Marigny. Zane knew how Ty felt about going to see Ava again, and Zane wasn\u2019t too happy about it either. There was a good chance she\u2019d be holding a grudge, and with good reason. Zane knew what kind of lies had to be told when you were undercover, and now, thanks to Ty, he realized how badly it hurt to be on the receiving end of them.</p><p>But their options were few and far between, and Ty seemed to think she was in danger.</p><p>At least he\u2019d be along to make sure she didn\u2019t throw another knife at Ty. If she did, she\u2019d have a couple to dodge herself.</p><p>So, forearmed and forewarned, Zane followed Ty out of the lively French Quarter into the more sedate residential area of Marigny.</p><p>Ty turned onto a cobblestone alley of stone walls covered with ivy and blooming flowers. It really was gorgeous down here, with the gaslights and wrought-iron gates and ambiance galore. Even the shards of glass in the concrete on top of walls and fences, meant to keep revelers out of private yards, had its own charm. New Orleans had character. Zane hadn\u2019t really appreciated it when he\u2019d been here with Becky. He\u2019d been more concerned with watching her, observing the joy of the experience through the way she lit up.</p><p>He often found himself doing the same thing with Ty. He enjoyed the way Ty lived through every pitch at a baseball game more than he enjoyed the game itself.</p><p>How much of his own life had he forgotten to live as he watched the people he loved?</p><p>The crowd thinned until they were the only ones on the street, offering them less cover. Ty took Zane\u2019s arm so they\u2019d look more like a couple returning home than two fugitives skirting the shadows. He felt stiff as he did it, as if he expected Zane to rebuff him. Zane\u2019s breath was hard to catch. He had never imagined being alone with Ty feeling so awkward.</p><p>\u201cPlaces this side close down at two,\u201d Ty said. He abruptly turned into a narrower, shadier alley.</p><p>Zane slowed, scowling at his surroundings. His arm slipped out of Ty\u2019s as Ty kept walking. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped and turned, and Zane had a flash of memory, a picture of Becky, her hair bouncing as she turned, her eyes shining.</p><p>Zane stared at Ty\u2019s hazel eyes, shocked into silence.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been here before.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and looked down the alleyway. \u201cLots of these back alleys look alike. This is a local place, pretty far off the tourist path.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at the cobblestone and the plain stone walls. He nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Ty continued down the alley, and after a few dozen yards he stopped at a weathered wooden door set into the crumbling stone wall. The carved sign that hung over the door read La F\u00e9e Verte.</p><p>Zane stared at it. He was almost certain that had been the name of the dive Becky had dragged him to all those years ago.</p><p>Ty pressed his shoulder against the door, and it creaked open accusingly.</p><p>Within was the same large room Zane remembered from his dreams. It was still ill-lit and crowded with tables, and the single microphone stand still stood on the stage in front of wine-colored curtains.</p><p>Candles flickered in hurricane lamps on the tables, only now it seemed they were battery powered. Years of wax drippings still decorated the tables.</p><p>Zane glanced around, stunned. He turned where he stood, staring at the stage, his mind recreating that night, the man he\u2019d watched and found himself attracted to, the first man he\u2019d ever realized he might want, the man he\u2019d almost unconsciously based most of his sexual encounters on since. He could still see the man standing on that stage, wide shoulders, playful smirk, shining eyes, and a beautiful voice.</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d Zane gaped at him.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty looked around the bar, brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cTy, it was you. The man I saw singing, the one I told you about . . . it was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes strayed to the stage, then back to Zane. He didn\u2019t look all that shocked. There was a bang from the back and a curtain behind the bar wavered.</p><p>A dark-haired woman poked her head out to call, \u201cWe\u2019re all closed up now. Try Bourbon Street.\u201d She disappeared behind the curtain again.</p><p>Ty and Zane both stared at the curtain before sharing a glance. \u201cIt was you,\u201d Zane whispered again, still rocked to his very foundations by the revelation.</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be. You said it was your anniversary. I wasn\u2019t here yet in July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was for our anniversary. We came in December because it was easier.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood motionless, eyes on Zane for a long moment before he glanced back at the curtain. It wasn\u2019t but a few seconds before the curtain swayed again, and the woman shoved it aside as she stepped out. She was on the shorter side, with long hair so black it was almost blue in the smoky haze. A fluffy white feather was tucked behind her ear, and on closer inspection, several more feathers of various colors appeared to be part of her hair too.</p><p>Her dark eyes were lined in kohl, masking their real color, and it was hard to tell in the dim light but she seemed exotic in a way, like there may have been Native American blood in her. She was athletic and curvy, certainly Ty\u2019s type, wearing black pants that hugged her hips and a laced corset for a top. Her body was tense as she stared at them.</p><p>Zane glanced from Ty to her and back. She was surprised, that was clear, which told Zane she wasn\u2019t behind the hex Ty was sure had been put on him.</p><p>\u201cTyler Beaumont,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ava,\u201d Ty responded. Zane knew he was nowhere near as calm as he sounded.</p><p>She moved suddenly, vaulting over the bar and running toward him. Zane almost moved to block her, but Ty didn\u2019t flinch as she launched herself at him and wrapped her arms around his neck. He grunted in pain, stumbling beneath her weight as she hugged him.</p><p>She let him go and slid her feet to the floor, then smacked Ty with an oath that sounded like mangled French. When she pulled back for another smack, Zane reached out and caught her wrist midair. Ty\u2019s guilty conscience may have been willing to stand there and take it, but there was a limit to how much Zane would allow, even if he did want to do the same right now.</p><p>She yanked her hand out of Zane\u2019s grasp and drew a deep breath. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Murdoch,\u201d Ty told her, remarkably calm in the face of her temper.</p><p>She glared at Zane, her eyes raking him up and down.</p><p>\u201cThis is my partner, Zane Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Fed too?\u201d she spat at Zane.</p><p>It was sort of a bullshit question, but she was obviously rattled by Ty showing up out of thin air. Zane tipped his head and raised one eyebrow in silent confirmation, if not a subtle dare to comment about it, before looking her over in return, checking for obvious weapons.</p><p>\u201cZane, this is Ava Gaudet. Ava, we need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said with obvious disdain. She turned her dark eyes back to Ty. \u201cYou need my help. Like you needed my help before?\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes before letting them stray to meet Zane\u2019s. He shook his head. \u201cThis was a waste of time,\u201d he said to Zane. He jerked his head toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Zane was perfectly willing to let any of Ty\u2019s old flames carry on without them, so he nodded and took a slow step back. He didn\u2019t see any knives on Ava, but that didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t one. Or more.</p><p>Ty turned to go, showing no compunctions about exposing his back to the woman.</p><p>She sighed loudly and held up her hand. \u201cWait. What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Ty studied her briefly before digging into his pocket and pulling out the small red bag he\u2019d been carrying. Zane didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d retrieved it from the police station, but he\u2019d obviously thought it a priority as he and Liam had escaped. He held it up and let it drop, holding it between two fingers by its cord.</p><p>Ava gasped and took an involuntary step back, running into Zane. He steadied her with a hand on each arm. \u201cWell, I guess that answers that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that like the one the cops said they found on Murdoch? Where did you get that?\u201d Ava asked Ty, sounding as if she\u2019d forgotten how angry she was.</p><p>\u201cIt was under my mattress,\u201d Ty answered through gritted teeth.</p><p>She glanced between them. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t do it! I didn\u2019t even know you were in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a place to lay low. There are seven of us. People are after us, and so are the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeet pue tan!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, looking at Zane wryly. \u201cShe just called me a goddamned son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Zane responded.</p><p>\u201cYou need my help? You don\u2019t need my help, you need an army!\u201d She shooed Ty toward the door. \u201cI want no part in whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl was murdered last night,\u201d Ty hissed.</p><p>\u201cThat is not my problem!\u201d Ava shoved him toward the door, both hands on his chest. He didn\u2019t budge, and she couldn\u2019t make him.</p><p>\u201cShe looked like you,\u201d Ty said loudly. He held up the bag. \u201cShe had one of these.\u201d</p><p>Ava was breathing hard, but she stepped back and stared at the bag, then glanced over her shoulder at Zane. She looked genuinely frightened. \u201cYou think they meant to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The police think I killed her and Murdoch. My name was in these bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being set up.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cAnd you know the only person who could possibly have known I was in town.\u201d</p><p>Ava licked her lips. \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p><p>Ty quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, wait, Daddy?\u201d Zane blurted.</p><p>Ty and Ava both nodded. Ava put a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Ty said almost gently. \u201cWe need a place to stay for the night. They\u2019ll never look here. Are the rooms upstairs empty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ava whispered. She put a hand on her hip and lowered her head like she was trying to catch her breath.</p><p>Ty met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cCall them. Let them know how to get here.\u201d</p><p>Zane took out his phone, glancing between them as he dialed. He couldn\u2019t wait to hear the rest of this story.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me about this bag?\u201d Ty asked Ava.</p><p>Ava glowered at Ty mutinously for a few moments, then dropped her hands and gave a curt nod. \u201cDump it on the table. I\u2019ll get some drinks.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel and stalked back to the curtained doorway behind the bar as Zane spoke with Owen. They were the only two who had retained their phones. Once he hung up, he stared at Ty until the man met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHer father was my case when I was here,\u201d Ty told him. \u201cHe\u2019s the 8th District Police Commander. He\u2019s dirty as all hell.\u201d</p><p>Zane felt his blood run cold. \u201cWhen you said you left a pissed off Cajun daddy down here . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it. I never knew if he figured out I was his problem or not. Now I know. He probably caught wind of me when we hit the airport. We\u2019ve been dead men walking ever since we got here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow. And I thought I had a scary father-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. He looked around the dim tavern. \u201cAre you sure you and Becky were here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, I may not remember what your face looked like, but I remember this place like it was yesterday. It was you. How long were you down here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCouple years.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. That wasn\u2019t unusual. It had taken him several months to establish himself in Miami. And they\u2019d both been yanked out of their assignments: Ty because of Hurricane Katrina, Zane because he\u2019d been arrested and had to be pulled for his own safety. When he\u2019d been put back in, he\u2019d discovered most of the Miami cartel still thought he had done his time in prison somewhere and his cover remained intact. Ty\u2019s cover had weathered the storm too, and now he was back in the thick of it.</p><p>Ty was chewing on the inside of his lip, his eyes focused on the wall near the door, where an array of framed photographs lined the brick.</p><p>A crash and muttered curse came from the kitchen, then Ava stomped through the heavy curtain with a couple of bottles in her hand and a cloth thrown over her shoulder. Ty took a few steps and tossed the bag onto the table. She glared evilly and sat down in front of it, thumped the bottles down, and used the edge of the table to open one with the heel of her hand.</p><p>Zane snorted. He liked this one.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Ty\u2019s partner, tell me why you\u2019re here.\u201d She reached for the bag and began pulling at the strings.</p><p>Zane considered truth or evasion for a few seconds before shrugging. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating a birthday.\u201d</p><p>She laid the cloth out on the table and dumped the contents of the bag onto it. She nodded but didn\u2019t respond, fiddling with the pieces of the gris-gris bag for a few moments. \u201cHow did you find the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to your partner,\u201d Ava snapped.</p><p>Ty growled softly but let Zane answer, mumbling under his breath as he paced away.</p> <p>Zane glanced between them. He could see the possibility of chemistry there. A lot of flash and bang . . . much like himself and Ty. Had Ty ever been in a relationship that hadn\u2019t either begun or ended with open animosity?</p><p>\u201cWe found it in a standard search,\u201d Zane said, wondering how familiar she was with law enforcement procedures.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d She put her nose closer to the mossy substance on the cloth. \u201cProbably found it having sex.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. He wasn\u2019t getting any threatening vibe off her, and he kind of liked how direct she was.</p><p>She cocked her head at Zane as if sizing him up. Then she turned the other way, to Ty. He was watching her from several feet away, hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d she asked him. \u201cMigraine? Stomach bug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidney stone.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and nodded. Zane narrowed his eyes, not happy that she\u2019d known something had been wrong with Ty. He pressed his lips together tightly. He didn\u2019t like putting any stock in this voodoo stuff, but he seemed to be the only one. And he had to admit, it was pretty coincidental that Ty had been struck down with a kidney stone on the same night he\u2019d slept over a hoodoo bad luck magnet.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize the work,\u201d she said stiffly after examining the bag and its contents.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Ty hissed.</p><p>She smacked her hand against the table.</p><p>\u201cIs it your father\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, still staring at the tabletop.</p><p>Ty got in her face and lowered his voice. \u201cIs it Shine\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head away and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho is Shine?\u201d Zane ventured to ask.</p><p>Ty straightened, looking grim. \u201cAva\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s more refined than his work usually is. And its purpose is . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThis level of skill is beyond me, and I would say it\u2019s beyond Shine, but I haven\u2019t spoken to him in a year. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s been or what he\u2019s been into.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted, stepped forward, and placed the second alligator tooth on the corner of the cloth, along with the roll of parchment with his alias on it. \u201cI kept that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said quietly. She picked up the paper and studied the calligraphy. \u201cThat does make things clearer. It seems it was meant to do you great harm. How many people here want to kill you? Because with this in your pocket, they will all find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Ty said gruffly. He was standing at her shoulder, large and grim next to her.</p><p>She met his eyes and straightened her shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone who you really were. Not even my dad.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t look surprised. More relieved.</p><p>But Zane wasn\u2019t all that taken aback. \u201cIf she\u2019d told anyone, it would have cast doubt on her as well, just by association. Especially since you were . . . close.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and moved to sit in one of the chairs beside her. Ava was doggedly staring at the red felt bag. \u201cSo . . . my cover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs still intact,\u201d she told him grudgingly. \u201cAlthough I told everyone you left me for the Russian whore, so you\u2019re still an ass.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted at Zane. \u201cShe means she told everyone I ran from the hurricane.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and didn\u2019t try to hide his smile as he walked toward the wall to peer at the pictures. He supposed he ought to feel more awkward being here with Ty, who he wanted to throttle, and his former almost-fianc\u00e9e, who had tried to kill him. Especially since he was now positive he had actually met them both years ago and been asked to join them after a show.</p><p>Zane grew warmer with the knowledge. The man he\u2019d seen in New Orleans had been the little spark of interest he\u2019d needed for his first encounter with a man. It had been Ty all along. Zane sniffed and shoved his hands in his pockets. He wasn\u2019t even sure what to do with that realization, especially since every time he thought of Ty, the anger and betrayal threatened to overwhelm him.</p><p>Ty and Ava were talking about the ingredients of the gris-gris as Zane studied the pictures. The one Ty had been staring at earlier was large, with a simple wooden frame, and beneath it the date and event were written on a piece of tape. Easter, 2004. Seven years ago. The picture was of a man sitting in a chair, tipping it back, feet on the table as he grinned. A crowd of people in festive masks danced in the small confines of the bar in the background of the photo, their motions blurred and surreal. The man sitting was the only thing in focus. He wore a bowler hat and a vest. He held a thin cigar near his face, the frozen smoke curling up over his hand.</p><p>It was the man Zane remembered, there in black and white. And after a long moment of staring, Zane knew that he was looking at a picture of a younger, wirier Ty. His hair was different, longer. He had a Van Dyke beard. His face seemed gaunt in a way. He truly was a chameleon. But it was still Ty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty, there have to be half a dozen people who\u2019d want to make you miserable,\u201d Ava sneered as Zane turned back to them.</p><p>Ty flopped a hand. \u201cCan you reverse it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only one who can reverse it is the one who put it on you. Or you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how do I reverse it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat back and ran both hands over his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t find out, though, okay? This curse on you will spread to those around you. Anyone who comes in contact with you now is in danger, including me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like it\u2019s contagious?\u201d Zane couldn\u2019t keep the amusement or the cynicism out of his voice. But Ty and Ava both looked grim.</p><p>\u201cThis is like a black spot on his soul,\u201d Ava whispered. \u201cIt will spread to everyone he cares for, everyone his soul has touched.\u201d</p><p>Ty slumped and banged his forehead on the table.</p><p>The three rooms above La F\u00e9e Verte had once been rented out to travelers, back in the early days of the city, and though most of the old buildings in the neighborhood had been converted into condos and apartments, the layout of La F\u00e9e Verte\u2019s rooms was very much unchanged from one hundred years ago. They all had small kitchenettes and just enough space for a double bed, a wardrobe, and a chair. They shared a washroom at the end of the hall, and adjoined a smaller room that served as an office for the bar below.</p><p>Ty knew all of the rooms well. He had lived in one of them for almost two years. They generated extra income for the bar, but Murdoch had rented mostly to employees at a ridiculously low rate. It kept someone on the premises at all times, and it kept them loyal to him. For Ty\u2019s purposes, living there had thrown him right into the middle of the world he\u2019d needed at the time.</p><p>Ava led them up the narrow stairs. Ty let his hand caress the brocade wallpaper as he went, the texture and scent bringing back memories that were, for the most part, good ones.</p><p>His life here had been different from any other he had lived or pretended to live. But there\u2019d been a heady seductiveness about it, something dark and rich and tempting. Ty had almost succumbed to its charms.</p><p>Ava used a key on a long purple ribbon to unlock one of the doors, and she stepped aside to let them into the room. Ty took the key from her. She met his eyes defiantly, but there was pain there too. He knew he\u2019d hurt her. All in the name of doing his job. Just like he\u2019d hurt Zane. He tore his eyes away from her and looked into the room.</p><p>He was stunned to find that little was different since he\u2019d last been there.</p><p>\u201cMurdoch didn\u2019t see any point in changing what you did to it,\u201d Ava told him.</p><p>Ty shook his head and stepped into the room. An odd sense of homesickness flooded him. He stopped in the middle of the threadbare Oriental rug as he distantly registered Ava\u2019s footsteps moving away.</p><p>Not one thing seemed different from the night he\u2019d left.</p><p>The simple iron bed was burnished silver, the patina of age giving it a character the delicate scrollwork could not manage. The ivory quilt was plain, and the design of the cotton sheets was faded and well-worn, giving the entire bed a vintage Dust Bowl look.</p><p>The walls were covered with yellowing pages out of old books, glued haphazardly, one on top of another, onto wooden paneling that could no longer be seen. Ty had spent days doing it, trying to insulate the thin walls so no one could hear what he was up to when he was alone, but people who\u2019d seen his work afterward had attributed it to an artistic, quirky personality instead of simple paranoia.</p><p>Along one wall sat an old stove and an antique Crosley refrigerator that occasionally needed rewiring. Beside that was a tiny table with two celery green padded chairs, and a sink below open shelves that held dishes.</p><p>In the corner of the room opposite the bed was a large wardrobe. Ty stepped toward it and opened the door on the right, almost expecting to see his clothes still hung neatly inside. It was empty, however, not even a hanger left.</p><p>He turned to face Zane, who had stopped on the threshold. \u201cThis is almost exactly how I left it.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s focus was on him, though, not the room. His words were quiet, almost bitter. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it was you.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard. He didn\u2019t know if this was promising or damning.</p><p>\u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>Ty had to avert his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure. I didn\u2019t . . . I was hoping it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your perfect wife versus me in eyeliner and my girlfriend with feathers in her hair, asking you to play with us? Come on, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes you you. Jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Zane remained silent, but the irritation and disgust in his expression hit harder than any words. It seemed all Zane could see were lies. The tension was growing heavier, pressing at Ty, making him want to fidget. \u201cYou think it was fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in fate.</p><p>Ty nodded, pushing back the tumbling of his nerves. \u201cIt believes in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think people make their own fate.\u201d</p><p>Ty could think of nothing to say to the anger in Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Zane glared at him for a moment. \u201cThis is cozy,\u201d he said, sliding his hand along the doorjamb. \u201cNicer than my warehouse, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He stepped inside. \u201cDid you do this to the walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s The Three Musketeers. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed as he stepped closer to the pages. \u201cIn French.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s better that way.\u201d Since Zane read novels in Spanish, Ty figured he\u2019d understand.</p><p>Zane had one hand in a pocket. \u201cThis place is . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cGothic.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded wistfully. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what I loved about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Zane moved a few steps closer. \u201cAnother new side to Ty Grady.\u201d</p><p>They faced each other, the silence heavy and tense.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what other sides I don\u2019t know about,\u201d Zane finally murmured, as if talking to himself.</p><p>Ty swallowed hard. \u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you take with you when you left?\u201d Zane asked. He turned away, unwilling to let Ty explain. \u201cAnything? Or just the memories?\u201d</p><p>Ty scowled. \u201cJust a book I carried with me. It had a cut-out in it with my real passport.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s jaw clenched, like he was physically holding back his emotions. \u201cWhat did you miss most?\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned, confused by the questions, until he finally recognized what Zane was doing. This was how his partner interrogated suspects. He would start with that intense stare and then ask mundane questions to throw the suspect off. Then he\u2019d ease out just enough to make it seem okay before he punched through to the real queries in a quiet, frightening voice. It was quite effective, and Ty had seen Zane break people no one else could get to talk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty chewed on his lip thoughtfully, trying to give Zane a real answer even as he dreaded the punch of the final question. \u201cI missed the smell,\u201d he finally decided.</p><p>Most people would have taken that as a joke, but Zane would take it seriously. He\u2019d been there, that somewhere you remembered by feel and scent more so than sight or sound. It was a visceral answer.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ty asked when Zane didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>Zane slid his other hand into his pocket and shrugged. \u201cNo one ever asked me to remember the good things.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed. He\u2019d done things here he hadn\u2019t necessarily been proud of. But for the most part, it had been two of the better years of his life. He remembered all of it fondly until the end. He knew Zane\u2019s experience in Miami had been vastly different.</p><p>They were still standing there, silent and uncomfortable, a few minutes later when Ava returned.</p><p>\u201cYou find what you need?\u201d she asked, her voice breaking the spell.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and shook his head. \u201cGot distracted,\u201d he said, surprised when his voice came out hoarse.</p> <p>\u201cI called Shine. He wasn\u2019t home. I can go out there, snoop around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t let you do that,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>Ava smirked. \u201cYou won\u2019t be letting me do anything.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. Ava looked him up and down, then whistled and shook her head. \u201cTyler does have a type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said loudly.</p><p>She merely smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll go keep a lookout for your friends.\u201d She turned away.</p> <p>Zane leaned sideways to watch her walk down the hall. \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, unable to say anything.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you want to tell me before the others get here?\u201d</p><p>Ty took in the rigid line of his shoulders, the tension in his jaw, and the hardness of his eyes. Zane had every right to be angry. The timing could have been better, but all of this mess was on Ty\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded.</p><p>Zane met his eyes for a few seconds before turning away and disappearing down the hall.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cI would very much like to know what the hell is going on,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>He was sitting across from Nick at the largest table in the place. Nick had his eyes on Liam, who was wandering around the edges of the barroom and refused to sit with the rest of them. Nick didn\u2019t trust the man one bit, but he was willing to hear an explanation from someone before punches were thrown.</p><p>The woman who\u2019d let them in, Ava, had subsequently barred the door and disappeared behind a curtain. Nick could hear her moving back there, but he had no idea what she was doing, nor did he really care.</p><p>Ty sat to Nick\u2019s right, sedate and unusually flustered. And to Nick\u2019s left sat Zane, who seemed irritated and harsh. It wasn\u2019t difficult to deduce whatever Ty had told Zane had jammed a wedge between them. Nick hoped they could keep it together long enough to get through whatever this was and sort it out when they got home.</p><p>The floorboards above them creaked, and all of them looked up.</p><p>\u201cIs someone else here?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>Zane shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe floors do that,\u201d Ty muttered. He was rubbing the bridge of his nose with two fingers, hunched over the table.</p><p>Nick glanced at the ceiling again. The place had an eerie feeling to it, like it had been abandoned by the living but was still occupied. A shiver ran down Nick\u2019s spine. The whole city kind of felt like that, actually. All the voodoo crap was getting to him.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, why don\u2019t you fill us in,\u201d Nick said, keeping his voice low. If Ty wasn\u2019t going to lead the discussion, someone had to.</p><p>Zane\u2019s dark eyes slid to glare at him, then he glanced up, his gaze following Liam as the man moved. He took a deep breath before speaking. \u201cI was undercover for a while in Miami, working in the Vega cartel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of them,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThey reach all the way to Boston sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd further. They got a tip that they had a mole, so they started a witch hunt. I got arrested one night on a DUI and the Bureau took the opportunity to pull me out, to save me and the information I\u2019d stolen.\u201d</p><p>Liam drifted closer, and everyone was silent as they waited for Zane to connect the pieces.</p><p>\u201cI thought that part of my life was history, but . . .\u201d Zane stared at the tabletop, shaking his head.</p><p>Liam cleared his throat. \u201cBut. Roughly two years ago Garrett was inserted back into the cartel for a brief stay. He was pulled again, just days before Antonio de la Vega, the head asshole in charge, died in a plane crash in the Caribbean while returning to Colombia. Of course, Zane\u2019s alter ego became the prime suspect within the cartel. Juan Carlos de la Vega took over, righted the Vega ship, and went on a crusade to find the man who murdered his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you come into this?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Liam kicked out a chair and sat, staring at Ty. His face was expressionless. \u201cAfter you shot me, thank you for that by the way, I couldn\u2019t go to the NIA as planned. I had to find work somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Owen huffed and leaned away from Liam to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a mercenary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPays the bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not NIA?\u201d Ty asked. His frown had deepened.</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes narrowed and he leaned closer. He tapped his chest with one finger. \u201cBecause you missed, darling.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes followed Liam\u2019s hand, and Nick could see the blood draining from his friend\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cClipped my heart. The right ventricle.\u201d</p><p>Ty either couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t respond. He sat back in his chair, resting his chin in his hand. Nick wondered what was going on inside Ty\u2019s mind, how he would have reacted if everyone at the table weren\u2019t looking to him for leadership.</p><p>\u201cIt was repaired before I bled out, but they weren\u2019t willing to take an active field agent with a compromised heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you always had a compromised heart,\u201d Digger muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny from you, Back Woods. How many innocent little bunnies do you have strung up in your hunting shed right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat bunny!\u201d Digger shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Kelly asked Liam.</p><p>\u201cI was hired by de la Vega. He received an anonymous tip saying the man who killed his brother would be here Easter weekend.\u201d</p><p>All eyes shifted to Zane, but Zane\u2019s eyes were on Ty. He tore them away to glance around the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d he said, returning his gaze to Ty.</p><p>\u201cTyler?\u201d Liam drawled. \u201cCare to share with the class?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t move, which was never a good sign. He looked from Zane to Liam, then spoke without removing his hand from his chin. \u201cI tampered with the navigational equipment of his plane,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe horizon should have read wrong and they would have flown straight into the water when the autopilot was turned on. I planted explosive charges as a backup.\u201d</p><p>Zane inhaled sharply. Nick got the feeling Zane already knew this, but hearing it straight from Ty\u2019s mouth was disconcerting, even for Nick.</p><p>\u201cDid you go with the polymer bonded?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>\u201cSlurries and gel mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you broke your finger when we were apart?\u201d Zane demanded. Ty nodded curtly and Zane grunted, looking away with a sneer. \u201cYou deserved it, then.\u201d</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat and pointed at Liam. \u201cSo let me get this straight. You\u2019re here to kill him,\u201d he said, indicating at Ty. Then he gestured to Zane. \u201cBut you thought you were after him because he was the mole.\u201d</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Liam nodded. \u201cAt its very basic, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why aren\u2019t either of them dead?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Liam said, drawing out the word. \u201cEither I am the worst assassin in the world, which, if you want a hint, is not the right answer. Or . . . I realized I was after a couple of Feds and I pulled out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refused the job?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you hadn\u2019t called it in yet!\u201d Zane shouted.</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d Liam winked at Zane. \u201cI do that, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you lying now?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Liam grinned as they locked eyes. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Nick ran a finger over the bridge of his nose. \u201cEither way. By now they\u2019ll have sent a backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely!\u201d Liam grinned. \u201cYou were always the brains of this operation, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, British.\u201d</p><p>Liam shivered theatrically and grinned. \u201cThey won\u2019t have had the time to plan that I did, so they will go for something with less charisma and more brute strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cI would say six to eight. Just to cover their bases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we have cartel hit men after us?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cWhat the shit does that have to do with gris-gris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is a gris-gris?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Liam and Digger stared at each other, eyes narrowing, lips curving into snarls.</p><p>Nick passed a hand over his eyes, groaning.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come to the hospital?\u201d Ty demanded of Liam.</p><p>A frown creased Liam\u2019s brow. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come to my room and threaten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would I go to all this trouble if I could have found you at the hospital? Why were you in hospital?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Nick and slid lower in his seat, rubbing his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you really did attack a male nurse at the ER?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>Ty nodded from behind his hand.</p><p>Liam shook his head, peering at Ty. \u201cYou really are off the rails, huh?\u201d</p><p>Ty sat forward, holding out a hand. \u201cThe point is, the situation has changed. The cleanest way to handle any of this is to skip town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to run?\u201d Zane asked, practically sneering.</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes, trying not get defensive. \u201cThere\u2019s running and then there\u2019s strategic retreat. It\u2019s good to know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to run,\u201d Zane repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty said. \u201cWe\u2019re not equipped to handle this here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never have a better chance against them. There are seven of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d Ty corrected.</p><p>Liam counted the men around the table. When he got to seven, he pointed to himself and shook his head. \u201cThis is not my fight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on dying for any of you.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane locked eyes again. Nick sort of wanted to lean away from the line of fire.</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well we will never have another opportunity like this one,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth. \u201cWe know they\u2019re coming. Even if this isn\u2019t their fight, it\u2019s yours and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett, we are outgunned,\u201d Ty said, his voice getting louder. He pressed a finger against the table. \u201cWe know they\u2019re coming, but we don\u2019t know how or when. And in case you\u2019ve forgotten, there is a city full of cops hunting us down right now. If there\u2019s trouble, we\u2019re just as likely to end up in jail as we are dead, and either way ends bloody for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane crossed his arms and huffed. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day I wanted to call you a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Owen whispered.</p><p>Nick sat straighter and put both hands out. \u201cOkay, slow down.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at Zane, not moving, not blinking. He didn\u2019t even appear to be breathing. Nick tensed, preparing to grab Ty when he lunged. Zane returned the stare, unwavering. Across the table, Liam whistled softly.</p><p>Ty stood as if the noise had propelled him, his chair scratching against the wooden floorboards. Nick stood with him, but Ty didn\u2019t attack.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cTo get a drink,\u201d Ty spat. Nick sighed as Ty stalked toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cWell that was productive,\u201d Digger muttered.</p><p>Nick sat again. Digger and Kelly were both shaking their heads, looking to Nick for guidance. Owen had his arms on the table, resting his head on them. Liam was sitting with his lips pursed, and when Nick made eye contact, Liam grinned and winked. Zane was still leaning back in his chair, but his body wasn\u2019t relaxed. He was resting his mouth against his hand, elbow propped on the arm of the chair. His hard eyes followed Ty\u2019s movements.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said. \u201cNothing good is going to come of us sitting here sniping at each other. We\u2019ll call it a night, come back with clearer heads at dawn. Keep watch in shifts of two. Bell doesn\u2019t take a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting a guard on me?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Would you like to tell me why I shouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to tell you where to go, do I have permission to do that?\u201d He stood, muttering under his breath as he walked away. He said something to Ty as he mounted the stairs, then ducked and covered when Ty chucked a heavy glass at him. It shattered against the wall and rained shards over Liam\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea, Grady!\u201d Liam shouted. He stood from his crouch. \u201cLace the steps with glass so we can hear them coming, good thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep running your mouth, you bastard, you\u2019ll wake up bloody!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, in my sleep, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll ever get the upper hand.\u201d</p><p>Liam hustled up the steps before Ty could reply, taking them two at a time and narrowly avoiding the second glass Ty threw at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick chewed on his lip for a few seconds, then turned to glance at the others. \u201cWho wants to volunteer for first watch with Ty?\u201d</p><p>The bar felt heavy when it was deserted, as if the music and smoke and drink had all risen to the top and begun pressing down on everyone below. That had always been Ty\u2019s favorite time of day. The memories weren\u2019t so sweet now, though.</p><p>\u201cDrew the short straw, huh?\u201d Ty said as Zane came up behind him. Ty couldn\u2019t look him in the eye now, not even through the mirror that hung over the back of the bar. The last time he\u2019d been called a coward, Zane had been the one defending him. It was dizzying to see how all they\u2019d built could unravel so quickly.</p> <p>Zane slid onto the stool beside him. Ty doggedly stared at the bar top. He didn\u2019t want to look at Zane right now, didn\u2019t want to feel the pain that came with those dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was out of line, saying that in front of everyone,\u201d Zane said. His voice was soft, but still cold.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to take me down a peg or two in front of the boys. You did it. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed, and Ty felt the gust of his breath against his cheek. \u201cThis is where you\u2019re supposed to apologize too, and we start trying to make sense of what we have left to us.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced up sharply. \u201cWhat we have left to us? Why are you so ready to walk, Zane? I was doing my job. You of all people should understand what that means.\u201d</p> <p>Zane grunted. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw that in my face. You know as well as I do that whatever you\u2019ve been doing the past two years was anything but your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Ty sneered.</p><p>\u201cHow about apologizing for lying to me? For spying on me? Using me?\u201d</p><p>Ty slammed his hand on the bar. \u201cI never lied to you, Garrett, not about us! Never once did I tell you anything that wasn\u2019t true, not when it came to you and me. And I sure as hell didn\u2019t use you for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell forgive me if I don\u2019t believe a goddamn word you say. The only way I hear the truth from you is when someone has a gun to your fucking head. Or mine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone did have a gun to your head!\u201d Zane started to get up, but Ty reached out to grab him. He didn\u2019t dare let him turn away, afraid Zane wouldn\u2019t ever turn back again. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through, why the hell can\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you lie.\u201d</p><p>The words hit him in the gut, and he gasped for air.</p><p>The curtain rustled and Ava came through carrying three reservoir glasses. She set them on the bar, looking between Ty and Zane with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou two going to sit there glaring at each other all night?\u201d she asked before ducking below the bar to retrieve a wooden box from underneath.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t flinch. He continued to glower at Ty, the anger and betrayal roiling in the air between them. They were both frightened, and the only thing they knew to do when they were scared was lash out.</p><p>Ty leaned closer. \u201cYou can be angry for as long as you want, Zane. It doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s happened, and it doesn\u2019t change the way I feel about you. Remember that, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Ty left it at that, turning away from Zane to take one of the glasses. They were specially made for preparing absinthe; thick and heavy, with a wide mouth and a small reservoir in the stem. They were quite beautiful, as drinking glasses went. Ava pulled three ornate spoons from the wooden box and set them on the bar.</p><p>The silence stretched thin. Ty had tried every avenue. He\u2019d explained himself, pleaded, reasoned with Zane, and professed his love over and over. None of it had made a dent in Zane\u2019s armor. Ty peered sideways at Zane. There wasn\u2019t much else he could do, and Zane seemed just as willing to toss it all away now as he had earlier. \u201cThis is the part where I drink and don\u2019t give a damn if it bothers you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFeel free to look away.\u201d</p> <p>Zane\u2019s lip curled and he narrowed his eyes. \u201cNo need to be concerned about me. Maybe a stiff drink will settle your nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, my,\u201d Ava said. \u201cI see that gris-gris is working already.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted. He didn\u2019t know if it was the gris-gris, but he and this town sure as hell were cursed.</p><p>\u201cThank you for throwing the cheap glasses instead of these,\u201d Ava said as she poured a reservoir full of light green liquid into each glass. The bottle was labeled Vieux Pontarlier. It was the very best absinthe you could buy, made exactly the same way it had been two hundred years before and imported from France.</p><p>He knew Zane had delved into all manner of chemicals, legal and illegal. He wasn\u2019t sure absinthe had made it to the Miami scene, though, and he wasn\u2019t sure Zane would know what Ava was doing.</p><p>Zane glanced from the spoons to the dark bottle she set on the bar, then back to Ty for a moment. He looked suspicious, as if he thought Ty was about to do something dangerous or illegal.</p><p>There was a completely mistaken aura surrounding absinthe as that of a mysterious, addictive, mind-altering substance, giving it a gothic horror sort of taboo. It was all completely unfounded, of course. It was just about the only thing Ty could drink while on the job, because while absinthe did get you drunk, it also made you unusually lucid, creating the illusion of a waking dream. He functioned well. It was all he had drunk for nearly two years while undercover.</p><p>He set the spoon on his glass, making sure the special lip underneath caught the edge of the glass to keep it in place. Then he plucked a sugar cube from the bowl Ava had set down and placed it on the center of the spoon.</p><p>Ava turned to fill a pitcher with water.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Zane finally asked, sounding annoyed to have to ask.</p><p>\u201cAbsinthe. The real stuff, not the tourist trade.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned but didn\u2019t say anything. Ty didn\u2019t try to set any of his preconceptions straight.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d sit and do this every night,\u201d Ava told Zane as she returned with the pitcher full of ice water. \u201cYou should try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett\u2019s got poor impulse control. Don\u2019t you, Garrett? Has to stay away from the cocktails.\u201d Ty poured the water out over his sugar cube. The water and dissolving sugar mixed with the green absinthe below, turning it a weak, milky green.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Zane snarled. \u201cMaybe you should learn a thing or two about it.\u201d</p><p>Ty removed the spoon, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cEvery night after we sang, we\u2019d go sit in that corner there, pour a glass of la f\u00e9e verte, and laissez les bon temps rouler,\u201d Ava told Zane with a hint of bittersweet irony. She leaned her elbows on the bar and took a sip of her drink. \u201cAnd every Saturday night,\u201d she continued, voice lower, growing huskier, \u201cwe would pick a plaything to join us. You would have been chosen, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>After what felt like a drawn-out moment of silence, Zane said, \u201cLet the good times roll, huh?\u201d</p><p>Ty focused on his drink, watching the green liquid swirl and mix. \u201cWhen in Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRome wasn\u2019t the only thing that burned in a day,\u201d Zane replied evenly.</p><p>Ty met his eyes for a long moment, for the first time seeing distrust in them. He lowered his head, closing his eyes, then took a drink.</p><p>Ava reached beneath the bar again and pulled out a little homemade voodoo doll, made with sticks and a piece of burlap. The eyes had been drawn on, and the hair was bundled sage. She set it on the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Ty reached for it, recognizing the ring around its neck. It was his, one he\u2019d thought he\u2019d lost years ago. His confusion turned to outrage and he grabbed the doll. \u201cThis is me?\u201d</p><p>Ava shrugged. \u201cI had some free time. It\u2019s served its purpose. I guess you\u2019ll be wanting it back. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d She picked up her glass to take with her. \u201cYou boys play nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou voodoo\u2019d me?\u201d Ty gaped at her as she left, the voodoo doll still in his hand. \u201cYou bitch!\u201d</p><p>Her laughter reached them from the back.</p><p>Zane plucked the doll from his hand. \u201cYou told me voodoo dolls were good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Ty answered, still scowling at the curtain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of pins in you.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him and yanked the doll out of his hand. The pins were mostly in his head, blue ones, meant to draw love. But there were also white, red, and black pins scattered over the doll\u2019s torso, hands, and groin, symbolizing positivity, power, and repelling evil.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one in almost every place you\u2019ve been hurt the past few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them mean bad things,\u201d Ty insisted, though he was flustered by the coincidence of the locations. He started yanking them out and tossing the pins on the bar.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said they meant good things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>The silence began to stretch, growing more unbearable by the second. Ty could feel Zane\u2019s eyes on him. He glared at the doll for a minute before taking a deep breath and looking at Zane. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Zane still watched him intently. He shook his head. \u201cYou think you did no wrong. And I can\u2019t trust you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d</p><p>Ty held his breath for a few heartbeats, just to see if his heart was actually still beating. Zane couldn\u2019t have crushed it more completely if he\u2019d used his boot heel. Then he took a long drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it taste like?\u201d Zane asked. He seemed remarkably detached for a man who was talking about ending them.</p><p>Ty pursed his lips and sighed. If Zane intended for this to be the last night they were together, then Ty was going to make the most of it. He took another sip, then spun on his stool to face Zane. He reached out for Zane\u2019s shirt and pulled him closer. Butterflies started in his stomach, like it was the first time he\u2019d ever tried to kiss his lover. Zane stiffened but allowed Ty to draw him near, his lips parting. Ty pressed his lips to Zane\u2019s. Once his tongue slid along Zane\u2019s, Zane shuddered and gave a barely audible moan.</p><p>The kiss felt like they were back at square one trying to decide how brave they had to be to initiate something. Ty was almost light-headed with nerves.</p><p>Their lips lingered too long before Ty pulled away and met Zane\u2019s eyes. They were a little wide, but Ty suspected it had nothing to do with the kiss and everything to do with the absinthe. The taste was distinct, as were its effects. Ty could already feel it working its way through him, calming his mind and body, enhancing the sensations of touch and smell. It couldn\u2019t soothe the ache in his chest, though.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Zane whispered, and he licked his lower lip.</p><p>Ty eased back onto his stool and took another sip from the heavy glass. \u201cThis was my life for two years,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI almost lost myself to it.\u201d</p><p>Zane propped his elbows on the bar and folded his hands. \u201cI can see how you\u2019d get lost in this lifestyle. You\u2019ve never seemed to have an addictive personality, though, so I\u2019m a little surprised.\u201d</p><p>Ty finished off the drink, shivering as it went through him. He set the glass down with a loud clunk. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who fights things every day, Garrett. Yours are just harder battles, closer to the surface. Mine . . .\u201d He swallowed and peered around the bar, taking in the overwhelming mystique of something ageless in the air and in the city. It shimmered. He didn\u2019t finish what he was saying, lost in the glow until he felt the touch of warm fingers on his hand.</p><p>\u201cGrady, come back,\u201d Zane said quietly.</p><p>Ty tore his eyes away from the shimmer and met Zane\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cThat stuff must have a hell of a punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy to get lost in,\u201d Ty murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane said under his breath. His fa\u00e7ade cracked, and suddenly he looked devastated. Like he\u2019d given up. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared hard at him. For the first time it began to sink in that Zane might truly mean to leave. There might not be anything Ty could say or do to stop it, and suddenly he couldn\u2019t sit there any longer. He pulled his hand from Zane\u2019s grasp and stepped away. \u201cI\u2019ll take watch upstairs,\u201d he said, voice hoarse. His boots crunched on the broken glass at the base of the staircase as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane called after him. Ty paused on the bottom step. Zane hesitated long enough that Ty took another step before he spoke. \u201cDo I really know you? Do I know Ty Grady at all?\u201d</p><p>Ty studied him, trying to parse the anger and pain into something that didn\u2019t feel like he was dying. Zane was still sitting at the bar, his eyes dark and wounded, his shoulders slumped. One chance. That was all Zane was willing to give, even if it broke them both. Ty shook his head and started back up the steps, speaking in a low voice as he went. \u201cIf you have to ask that, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Two hours after Ty left him, Kelly joined Zane downstairs for the changing of the guard.</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s got upstairs,\u201d Kelly told him.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zane grunted. He started up the steps, each crunch of the glass bringing him closer to another confrontation with Ty, to a night of sleeping with his lover right next to him and feeling like there was a stranger in his bed.</p><p>When he reached the top of the steps, he took a deep breath to steady himself. It was harder and harder to curb the anger growing. He\u2019d had two hours to think of nothing but all the times Ty must have lied to him to keep from being caught, all the times they\u2019d talked about Zane\u2019s time in Miami that Ty must have been digging for information.</p><p>All the times Ty had simply looked him in the eye and lied.</p><p>His twenty-year party. He had seen Richard Burns there, and now he knew exactly where Ty had disappeared to. He hadn\u2019t been retrieving that damn orchid from his car. God knew what they had been discussing. Zane\u2019s hands balled into fists and he stopped on the steps. He wanted to stomp up there and clock Ty just to get the anger out, just to do something. And his entire body screamed for a drink. He wavered, fighting the urge to go back and pour himself a whiskey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The familiar rumbling undertone of Ty\u2019s voice stopped him.</p><p>Ty and Nick were at the far end of the hall, standing outside the room Liam must have taken. Zane studied Ty\u2019s silhouette in the dim hallway. He seemed rigid and tense. He spoke with extensive use of his hands, but nothing of the low murmur reached Zane\u2019s ears.</p><p>Goddamn, Ty. Why couldn\u2019t he have made this easy? Why did he have to tell Zane the truth about his assignment? Why now? Why not hold onto it like he said he\u2019d wanted to instead of breaking Zane\u2019s heart with it? Why did he have to accept the assignment at all? He should have just used some backbone and said no!</p> <p>Zane would have said no, had their position been reversed. That much he knew. He would never have kept a secret that big from Ty, not after that first week in New York. Trust was all they\u2019d had, and Ty had used it, abused it. The only thing Ty was afraid of was saying no to a set of orders.</p><p>Ty headed down the hall. Behind him, Nick rested his back against the wall and slid down to sit. Zane supposed that was where Ty had set up camp too. Right outside Liam\u2019s door, using shadow for cover, with a direct view of the only exit. He wondered what Liam thought about having an armed guard at his door, about not being trusted without a handler on top of him.</p><p>Then Zane realized he knew exactly how Liam felt.</p><p>Ty stopped in front of Zane, both of them standing in the doorway to the room Ty had once occupied. Zane gritted his teeth when he met Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cOr are you still too mad at me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I deserve to be mad for a little longer?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes searched over Zane\u2019s face, then he stepped into the room. He kicked his shoes off, pulled his T-shirt over his head, and tossed it at the table.</p><p>Zane followed, pulling the door closed behind him. He made sure to lock it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to leave it at that?\u201d Zane said, voice pitched low. They were in the room with the pages plastered to the walls. He had confidence in Ty\u2019s work, that they couldn\u2019t be overheard.</p><p>Ty faced him. He shrugged. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? I told you I was sorry. I told you why I did it. And you know what, Zane? I\u2019d do it again. In a heartbeat. Because I was protecting someone I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t protecting me, Ty, you were spying on me. The fact that you don\u2019t see that, that you\u2019d march right down that road again without thinking twice, that scares the piss out of me. How the hell can I trust you now?\u201d</p> <p>Ty rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were meeting with Burns in Baltimore, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>\u201cBurns wasn\u2019t in Baltimore, Zane!\u201d</p><p>Zane took several long strides and grabbed Ty by his shoulders, shoving him up against the wall. \u201cStop lying to me!\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes flashed and he clenched his jaw, baring his teeth. \u201cCall me a liar one more time and I\u2019ll put you down.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s grip tightened. His breaths came harder and faster. Maybe a good knock-down, drag-out fight would do them both some good. Zane certainly wanted to smash his fist into Ty\u2019s teeth right now.</p><p>He pushed away instead, backing toward the door so he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to lash out. \u201cYou might want to get used to it. That\u2019s the kind of stuff you call people who lie for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Ty demanded.</p> <p>Zane turned his back on him. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Ty had to take a few seconds to gather himself before he could follow Zane out the door. He\u2019d be goddamned if Zane headed down there to drink, not because of him, not without a fight. He glanced down the hall as he pulled his shirt back on. Nick had come to his feet, his gun in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Ty waved him off. \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>He hurried down the steps and reached the barroom just in time to see Zane pouring a snifter full of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>Zane glared at him, and Ty had to fight every fiber of his being not to avert his eyes. He plowed on, though, stepping up behind the bar, opposite Zane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give you ten seconds to get the fuck away from me,\u201d Zane snarled.</p><p>Ty\u2019s heart stuttered. He had never seen Zane like this, had never known he even had it in him to seethe like this. He squared his shoulders, though. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you do this.\u201d</p><p>Zane held perfectly still. He didn\u2019t even seem to be breathing. \u201cYou did this, Ty,\u201d he said, then lifted the glass to his lips.</p><p>Ty grabbed his wrist. The whiskey spilled all over the bar. Zane stood so fast that his stool clattered to the floor. Ty barely managed to block Zane\u2019s arm before the glass crashed into the side of his head, then Zane reached across the bar and grabbed Ty by his shirt, lifting him off the ground and dragging him across the bar top.</p><p>Ty could do nothing but grasp Zane\u2019s forearms and hold on as Zane yanked him off the bar and threw him to the floor. He rolled and pushed to his hands and knees, then to his feet. Zane picked up the barstool beside him and swung it with one hand, as if it were nothing more than a pillow.</p><p>The stool crashed to the floor at Ty\u2019s feet as he staggered back. He was both shocked that Zane had lashed out and chastising himself for not expecting it. He knew how deeply he\u2019d hurt Zane, and he knew what happened when Zane\u2019s anger went unchecked. He should have known. Zane\u2019s rage only served to calm Ty further.</p><p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done, Ty, I\u2019ve done it for you!\u201d Zane shouted.</p><p>Ty was peripherally aware of Kelly hovering near the bar and Nick and Liam standing on the stairs watching. He waved at them to make sure no one interfered. He couldn\u2019t have anyone getting hurt in a scuffle. He shook his head as Zane came at him. \u201cNot like this, Zane,\u201d he tried.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fist flew at him. Then again. Ty was able to block the first two punches, but the third caught him in the kidney and he doubled over. Waves of pain almost brought him to his knees. He lunged forward, wrapping Zane up to try to stop him without hurting him. He refused to throw a punch in retaliation.</p><p>Zane shouted, his voice full of anger, pain, and betrayal. He picked Ty up and slammed him against the large wooden support beam in the middle of the room. The glass of a picture frame cracked against Ty\u2019s shoulders. Ty tightened his hold on Zane\u2019s arms, locking him down, trying to immobilize him before he hurt himself or Ty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zane,\u201d he gasped, trying to hold tight.</p><p>Zane pressed his face into Ty\u2019s neck, fighting back a sob. His entire body was trembling.</p><p>Ty dug his fingers into Zane\u2019s back, holding him close. He put his lips to Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders tightened under Ty\u2019s hands. \u201cI would have chosen you over anything,\u201d Zane hissed. He pulled back, breaking Ty\u2019s hold, bunched the front of Ty\u2019s shirt in both hands, and jerked Ty forward until they were nose-to-nose, until Ty\u2019s feet weren\u2019t solidly on the floor. \u201cMy job, my family, my wife. I would have given my life for you! But you! You can\u2019t even give me the truth!\u201d</p><p>Ty only had time to squeeze his eyes closed before Zane picked him up and tossed him sideways. He crashed against one of the tables and slid with it as it tumbled over amidst breaking glass and bits of splintered wood.</p><p>It took him a moment to get his wits about him. The others were wide-eyed and gaping. Ty rolled to his stomach and pushed up, accompanied by the tinkling of glass from a broken hurricane lamp as it cascaded down his arms and back.</p><p>Zane was framed by the neon light coming from the bar behind him, casting him into darkness and shadow.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Zane,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Zane turned his back on him and went back to the bar. He pulled out a new glass and poured another whiskey, neat. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly feel better,\u201d he said before throwing the whiskey back in one gulp.</p><p>Zane stood at the bar, watching the scene unfold in the mirror as the whiskey burned its way through him.</p><p>Nick and Kelly moved to help Ty out of the debris from the table and chairs they\u2019d destroyed. Liam hung back, arms crossed, watching with one eyebrow raised. When Ty stood, his hand went immediately to his side, and he doubled over again. Zane was struck with concern, but he shrugged it off. He\u2019d known Ty would still be tender in the kidney area. One good jab had made it almost impossible for him to defend himself. It had been unnecessary, though. Ty hadn\u2019t even tried to fight back.</p><p>Zane ducked his head when Ty\u2019s eyes found his in the mirror. Zane caught the pain and fury despite trying not to. He continued to stare at the empty glass in front of him as they helped Ty up the steps.</p><p>Zane reached for the bottle and poured himself another glass.</p><p>\u201cIs that really the best idea?\u201d Liam asked. He leaned against the bar beside Zane. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to deduce you might be one who imbibes a bit too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>\u201cAn alcoholic, that\u2019s what I meant by that,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIn case that wasn\u2019t clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll toss me over a table as well?\u201d</p><p>Zane bared his teeth at Liam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing, love, I wouldn\u2019t pull my punches like he did. Seems an unfair advantage, trying to hurt someone who refuses to swing back.\u201d He reached for the glass in Zane\u2019s hand and took a sip. \u201cMight as well drink tonight, though, yeah? Tomorrow, Ty\u2019s going to get you all killed.\u201d He handed the glass back to Zane and smirked.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Liam tapped his temple. \u201cHe\u2019s not thinking. Neither are you, for that matter.\u201d His arm brushed Zane\u2019s as he leaned against the bar again. \u201cThese cartel hooligans. You know who they\u2019ll send, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an inkling, yes. Mateo Valencia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he good?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged and took another sip. The whiskey scorched its way down his throat, lighting a fire inside him he\u2019d been sorely missing. The world around him grew cooler compared to it.</p><p>\u201cIs he better than you?\u201d</p><p>Zane flexed his wrist, where a sheath and knife felt just right against his skin. He remembered a meeting in a penthouse suite when one of Antonio\u2019s pups had yapped one too many times. Zane\u2019d slashed the man from lip to ear, just to teach him a lesson. Just to remind him he didn\u2019t speak until spoken to.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Liam cocked his head. \u201cGood to know.\u201d He glanced at the steps. They were still alone. Kelly was probably checking Ty over to make sure he wasn\u2019t hurt. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished satisfying your need for fine whiskey, I\u2019d like to speak with you upstairs. Privately.\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed. He took another sip, closing his eyes. He had missed the smell. The taste. He had missed the world of black and white. \u201cCan\u2019t you say it here?\u201d</p><p>Liam whistled low and moved closer to whisper in Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to discuss such things without clothing.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned his head sharply, but Liam didn\u2019t back away. His nose brushed Zane\u2019s, and for a few heartbeats, Zane thought he was going to kiss him. Liam didn\u2019t move though, and Zane finally backed away with a jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cYou are single now, Zane, in case that wasn\u2019t clear in the way he looked at you. Ty doesn\u2019t mess around with people who don\u2019t want him.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart hammered faster.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Liam murmured before walking away.</p><p>Zane pushed the door open and stepped inside, closing it behind him with a click that seemed to echo through the building. He took a few tentative steps in the darkness, and set the bottle and glass on the kitchen table.</p><p>A light flipped on, and Zane looked over his shoulder at the gun pointed at him.</p><p>\u201cPut that away,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Ty sat up in bed and swung his legs to the floor. He slid the gun under his pillow again. \u201cHow many have you had?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head and tapped the bottle. \u201cNot enough to make it okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s expression remained impassive, which was singularly annoying since Zane usually read him so well. \u201cI was doing my job,\u201d he said, his voice low and even. \u201cI was doing what I had to do to stay with you. What\u2019s so fucking wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>Zane sneered. \u201cTell me something, Ty, is there anything you won\u2019t do for a job?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t have an answer for that. He stood instead, crossing his arms. His breaths were harsh, like every word Zane hurled was making it harder for him to get air.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a part of you that you haven\u2019t sold for one thing or another,\u201d Zane snarled. He advanced on Ty, giving an almost manic laugh. Ty stood his ground, merely cocking his head as Zane got in his face. \u201cI\u2019ve spent half my adult life with whores. You\u2019re just better at your job than the others were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk, Zane,\u201d Ty finally managed to say. The blood had drained from his face, but he was standing straight and tall. \u201cKeep your mouth shut before you say something I won\u2019t forgive.\u201d</p><p>Zane took one more step, trying to crowd him into retreating toward the wall or the bed. But Ty still stood his ground. \u201cGod forbid you refuse an order, Ty. God forbid you choose something you love over being told what to do.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his shoulders and met Zane\u2019s words with a stony face. The only thing Zane wanted to see in Ty\u2019s eyes was pain. He wanted to hit him where it would hurt like nothing else, and punching him or tossing him around wouldn\u2019t hurt someone like Ty. Sticks and stones could break his bones . . .</p><p>Words were what hit Ty hardest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane closed his eyes. It was hard to fight the urge to jab at that soft spot with the whiskey flowing through him. He moved away and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cJesus Christ, Ty, I thought I was going to marry you. Did you know that? I\u2019ve been trying to decide how to ask you for months! I was trying to fucking ask you when Nick fucking O\u2019Flaherty called you for help! You just had to answer the fucking phone!\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s fa\u00e7ade finally broke. His lips parted, but Zane didn\u2019t let him speak.</p><p>\u201cI told my mother to fuck off for you! I took off Becky\u2019s ring and put it away for you, you son of a bitch! And all you were doing was your job!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just following orders,\u201d Zane grumbled. He swayed as he took a careless step back, tired of trying to intimidate Ty into backing down. \u201cEverything I know about you is based on lies. You\u2019re a caricature. Just a good little soldier.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s voice broke. \u201cYou really believe that?\u201d</p><p>Zane waved a hand at him. The warmth of the whiskey churned through him, leaving a cold outer shell that nothing would penetrate. \u201cYou make yourself whatever you need to be to get the job done, and then you move on to the next.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou made yourself perfect for me. But that\u2019s not the real you either, is it? I bet you don\u2019t even know who the real you is anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t move, but his breaths were harsh in the silence. Through the haze of anger, Zane could see the life seeping out of Ty\u2019s eyes, turning them hard and flat. A part of Zane screamed for him to stop\u2014stop talking, stop being angry, stop going down this path. There was no coming back from this. But the part of Zane that was so hurt by Ty\u2019s betrayal, the part that had continued to drink downstairs, that couldn\u2019t get over the pain and anger, forced him to keep going.</p><p>He took a step toward Ty and jabbed a finger at his chest. \u201cWhen this mess is settled and we get back to Baltimore? We\u2019re over. You and I. Done.\u201d</p><p>Ty grabbed his hand and shoved it away. \u201cRight, Zane, that\u2019s great. Why wait until you\u2019re sober, right?\u201d</p><p>Zane shoved him. \u201cWe\u2019re done!\u201d</p><p>Ty slammed both forearms against Zane\u2019s arm and twisted, forcing Zane to contort with a howl of pain. Ty spun him and shoved him face first into the mattress. Furious, Zane flicked a wrist and one of his knives deployed. It nicked Ty, who cried out and let Zane go.</p> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>Zane rolled to his back and kicked at Ty\u2019s chest, sending him staggering as Zane stood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to hurt you, Garrett!\u201d Ty shouted. He wiped blood from the cut on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d</p><p>Zane grabbed for him, but Ty easily avoided his hand with a slap of one palm against Zane\u2019s forearm. Zane rounded with the other hand and Ty repeated the move, not dodging but merely redirecting the force of Zane\u2019s swings.</p><p>\u201cRussian sambo, right?\u201d Zane sneered as they circled each other. \u201cAnother secret I\u2019ll probably never have explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdd that to the list, right behind sobriety.\u201d</p><p>Zane lunged and Ty went into a modified kick flip, only instead of kicking out, he rolled over Zane\u2019s back to land behind him. Zane shoved his shoulder back, catching Ty in the side and flinging him onto the bed. The springs complained and the headboard banged against the wall.</p> <p>Zane climbed on top of him and grabbed both of Ty\u2019s wrists, holding him down before Ty had a chance to recover. Ty bucked under him, but he couldn\u2019t fight Zane\u2019s weight in that position, not unless he meant to do real harm. And if there was one thing Zane knew about Ty, it was that he would let himself be beaten to a pulp before he truly hurt Zane.</p><p>Zane could feel Ty\u2019s heart pounding, his breaths growing more difficult, his hard muscles working to free himself. Zane pressed down to keep him from getting loose and kissed him, hard and messy, forcing his tongue into Ty\u2019s mouth and not giving him a chance to say otherwise.</p><p>Ty fought his grip, bucking his hips. Zane was growing harder with every struggle. Just like the first time they\u2019d fought in an alley in New York City and then fucked all night long, the violence fueled him. He thrust down, grinding his cock against Ty. Ty moaned into his mouth, but he still tried to pull his hands from Zane\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Zane let go of one wrist and grabbed a handful of Ty\u2019s hair instead, yanked Ty\u2019s head to the side, and bit at his neck. He let Ty\u2019s other wrist go and reached for his shirt, ripping it at the neck so he could taste the sweat along Ty\u2019s collarbone.</p><p>Ty\u2019s breathing was harsh and labored. He twisted, and his forearm caught Zane in the cheek. Zane grabbed his hand and yanked Ty\u2019s arm across his body, shoving it to the bed and pinning him. Ty tried to twist out of it, but Zane was too heavy.</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d Ty snarled.</p><p>\u201cI know you can throw me off,\u201d Zane grunted. \u201cGo ahead, Ty. Do it.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes narrowed. His breaths were gusting across Zane\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t make a move to break Zane\u2019s grip, though.</p><p>Zane released his hand to see if Ty would struggle more. When he felt Ty\u2019s body relaxing under him, he kissed him again, pushing himself between Ty\u2019s legs, shoving his tongue between those sinful lips. He bit at Ty\u2019s lower lip. Bit hard.</p><p>Ty\u2019s fingers dragged down his shoulder and he let Ty\u2019s lip go. He thrust again, his cock growing painfully hard inside his jeans. He reached between their bodies to loosen his belt and pull the zipper, then pushed his jeans and boxers down.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes were dark and unreadable. \u201cI thought we were done.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled slowly. \u201cAs soon as you know what it feels like to be used. Then we\u2019re fucking done.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Ty\u2019s shirt to rip it the rest of the way. Ty swatted at his fingers, but Zane knocked his hand away and instead reached to pull the straps on both his wrist sheaths. He tossed the knives away and hovered over Ty, pressing their bodies together.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your fucking kit?\u201d</p><p>Ty licked his lips. \u201cBy the door.\u201d</p><p>Zane pushed off him and moved to rummage through Ty\u2019s toiletry bag. He finally dumped everything on the floor. Toothpaste and shaving cream and several EpiPens went rolling across the floor. Zane grabbed up the lubricant, but he stopped when he saw a small black jewelry box at his foot.</p><p>He picked it up and straightened. Ty had tossed his torn shirt to the floor and was shoving his pants to kick them off, his movements jerky and irritated.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to order me around, you know,\u201d Ty told him. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m still yours.\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed, his stomach tumbling at Ty\u2019s words. The anger ebbed as he held the box up for Ty to see. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>Zane watched sadness roll over Ty\u2019s face. \u201cIt was for you.\u201d</p><p>Zane was breathing hard, trying to fight the veil of whiskey to see through to the only man he\u2019d thought he would ever love. Without asking for permission, he flipped the box open.</p><p>Inside was a rectangular silver token. A rough anchor had been etched into the face of it. Zane picked it up and dropped the box to the floor. He could feel something on the other side, but his eyes were fixed to the anchor.</p><p>\u201cI had my ring from the cruise ship job melted down for it. It\u2019s a sobriety token.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up. Ty was sitting on the edge of the bed, shoulders slumped, eyes on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou told me one time that . . . I was your compass. I gave you direction when you were lost,\u201d Ty said, nearly choking on the words. He glanced up, eyes reflecting like liquid in the low light. \u201cWell, you were my anchor. You were something solid for me to hold onto. I wanted you to remember that.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him for a solid minute, trying to feel something beyond the warmth of the whiskey, beyond the reach of the anger. He had convinced himself the Ty Grady he knew wasn\u2019t the real one.</p><p>But what if it was? What if Zane was the only one who\u2019d seen the real man beneath all those layers?</p><p>He turned the token over in his hand. \u201cI believe in you\u201d was etched on the other side. He balled it in his fist and tossed it at the door with a mournful shout.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d he shouted, stalking toward Ty. \u201cI trusted you!\u201d</p><p>Ty stood to meet the assault. Zane grabbed him and kissed him brutally, digging his fingers into Ty\u2019s hair, slamming him against the wall beside the bed. A moment later he shoved Ty onto the bed and climbed over him, continuing the kiss in all its angry glory.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty said, breathless. Whether it was from the weight on top of him or the weight of his emotions, Zane didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ty. Don\u2019t fucking say my name.\u201d He reached between them, taking Ty in hand and squeezing. Ty gasped and closed his eyes. It made it easier for Zane, not being forced to look into Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He filled his palm with lube and stroked himself, using his other hand to tug at Ty\u2019s thigh. He leaned over him, biting at his lip, yanking his leg higher, thrusting his hips, forcing Ty to lift his other leg and let Zane settle on top of him. Ty\u2019s entire body was trembling.</p><p>\u201cFor once in your life,\u201d he ground out against Ty\u2019s lips. \u201cBe something honest for once in your life.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the head of his cock against Ty, waiting for the gasp he knew was coming. The gust of air came against his lips, the same one Ty always seemed to let out when Zane first entered him. Zane bit down on Ty\u2019s lip to turn that gasp into one of pain, then shoved harder, breaching, pushing past tight muscles.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten what it felt like to delve into the warmth of someone else when all he felt was the cold calm of the alcohol and the bite of unchecked anger. God, it was so good.</p><p>He gripped Ty\u2019s hair to hold him still beneath Zane\u2019s weight as he inched in. It was agonizing to go so slowly when all he wanted was to hear Ty cry out for mercy, to fuck him until he could feel nothing but the simplicity of emptying himself deep inside someone else, emptying all the pain and anger into someone who was begging for more.</p><p>He pushed until he was completely sheathed, until Ty was writhing beneath him, trembling against him. Ty\u2019s breath shivered over Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then, Garrett,\u201d Ty whispered. \u201cYou want me to feel used?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane hissed. \u201cI want you to hurt like I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>Zane smacked his hand over Ty\u2019s mouth. He pulled out and forced himself in again, lingering long enough to appreciate the slow slide of his cock as he delved deep, to feel Ty\u2019s body jerk beneath his. Ty gasped against his hand. His fingernails raked down Zane\u2019s back. Zane reached under Ty\u2019s hips and pulled him off the bed, shoving deeper, forcing Ty to contort.</p><p>Ty called out, the sound muffled by Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>Zane started up a brutal rhythm, holding Ty down, the only sounds he heard were muffled and incoherent. His hips moved faster, harder, anger and anguish driving him, seeking pleasure that only his body registered and his mind refused to let him feel. He buried his face against Ty\u2019s chest, pushing harder, finally letting his hand fall away from Ty\u2019s mouth so he could lift Ty\u2019s hips higher.</p><p>Ty gasped his name. It was a pleading sound, filled with the same anguish Zane felt in every fiber of his being. Zane smacked his palm over Ty\u2019s mouth again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you say it,\u201d he growled. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say it.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands grasped at his back, dragging, clawing at him. His body writhed under Zane\u2019s as Zane came inside him. As Zane\u2019s movements slowed, his world came crashing back to him, everything black and white, everything made crystal clear and magnified to a pinpoint by the whiskey coursing through him. He moved his hand, and Ty gasped for air.</p><p>Zane pulled out of him, but he kissed him again, running his fingers down Ty\u2019s body to grip his cock. He was growing harder as Zane handled him, his moans vibrating against Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get off?\u201d Zane asked, his voice surprisingly hoarse. Ty gasped. \u201cSay it, say the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Ty tried.</p><p>Zane held him down and stroked him, riding out the rhythm of Ty\u2019s body seeking release. \u201cTell me what I want to hear, Grady.\u201d</p><p>Ty gripped Zane\u2019s shoulders, pushing his cock into Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cI need you,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>The words tore through Zane with the precision of a scalpel. He kissed Ty greedily one last time, pumping him until Ty\u2019s entire body trembled with impending release. Then he let go and backed away from the bed, leaving Ty on the precipice without any stimulation to push him over. He nodded toward the door as he met Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cGo on. I\u2019m betting Nick\u2019s fucking waiting for you with a nice warm bed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Zane woke with a splitting headache, cotton in his mouth, and a back that burned like he\u2019d been dragged across gravel. He sat up carefully, waiting to see if his stomach would rebel. His head pounded, but thankfully nothing else protested.</p><p>He looked around the room with a growing frown. He didn\u2019t remember getting into bed. He didn\u2019t remember falling asleep. Pages and pages of old books were plastered to the walls of his room. The same room Ty had been in. The bed beside him was cold and obviously hadn\u2019t been slept in. His clothes were neatly folded and piled on the table, sitting beside a bottle of whiskey and an empty glass. Zane stared at the glass, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach finally making him nauseous.</p><p>The night came back to him in a jumble of words and smells, of demanding kisses and rough sex. The scratches on his back were from Ty. He remembered shouting at him. Telling him they were done. He remembered taking a swing at him. Had he thrown a chair at him? Oh Jesus, what else had he done? He knew he could be violent when he was drunk and angry. His only comfort was knowing Ty would have fought back, and from the bruise he could feel on his face, Ty had done just that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He carefully got out of bed and shuffled to the table for his clothes. The glass wasn\u2019t empty after all. It was full of water, and two pills sat beside it. Zane\u2019s stomach lurched again. Ty had left ibuprofen for the hangover he knew Zane would have.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn you, Ty.\u201d</p><p>He got dressed quickly, downed the pills, and very carefully avoided making eye contact with the label of that bottle. He could hear the murmur of voices downstairs, and he hustled to join them.</p> <p>He stopped short at the head of the steps. He could hear Ava speaking, but she was speaking over the murmur of male voices. She wasn\u2019t involved in the conversation the others were having. She sounded like she was on the phone. He strained to hear what she was saying, but he couldn\u2019t make out the words. She was speaking in hushed tones, and something about it pinged Zane\u2019s alarms. He searched all over the hallway, trying to figure out where her voice was coming from. He finally found a small air vent in the ceiling. Was she upstairs? Or was she down? Was there even an upstairs?</p><p>Zane waited a few more seconds, trying to make out anything she was saying. The conversation had stopped, though. Zane ran a hand through his messy hair and took a deep breath, trying to talk himself into going downstairs.</p><p>Flashes of last night were coming to him, and he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to face Ty after what he\u2019d said and done.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go on the offensive here,\u201d Nick said as Zane made his way down the steps. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing they won\u2019t expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Owen asked.</p> <p>\u201cAmbush them,\u201d Ty said. His low growl sent shivers up Zane\u2019s spine. \u201cSet up a meet with bait. Scout out a meeting place, take them out when they show themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>Zane moved around the table to one of the empty chairs. He sat opposite Ty and crossed his arms. Everyone was silent and tense, glancing at Zane as if they expected him to blow up like he had last night. Ty narrowed his eyes at him. Zane had to avert his gaze, examining the tabletop instead. In the periphery, he could see the remains of the barstool and table he had destroyed, neatly swept into a corner.</p><p>If Zane had to guess, Ty had stayed up all night cleaning up the mess.</p><p>Digger finally grunted to break the silence. \u201cThat\u2019s all great, in theory. But how do we contact them?\u201d</p> <p>Ty tore his attention away from Zane and gestured at Liam. \u201cCan you get in touch with them?\u201d</p><p>Liam gave a curt nod. \u201cSure, Grady. I\u2019ll just call them up and explain to them the situation. That I fucked off on their job because I found a pissed off Recon team instead of one easy target. And then I\u2019ll ask them what hotel they\u2019re staying at. Just for shits and giggles. It\u2019s flawless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Ty grunted.</p><p>\u201cFlawless, I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right! Do you know how to get in touch with them or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get yourselves killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really care if we do?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to bugger off and get yourselves killed, it might as well be me doing it so I can collect the bounties.\u201d</p> <p>Zane snorted. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019d help us, we wouldn\u2019t be as likely to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty, Garrett, but my heart ain\u2019t that soft. As soon as you lot are gone, I\u2019m out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways the hero,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Ty and Liam shared a hateful glance before Ty pushed away from the table and stood.</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight,\u201d Liam said, loud enough for his words to be aimed at Ty. \u201cYou want to call up the crew who wants you dead, tell them you\u2019re the man they\u2019re looking for, and then lure them into a kill zone?\u201d</p><p>Ty met Liam\u2019s eyes. Then he sought out Zane for his opinion. Zane stared at him, feeling sick. Ty had looked to him still\u2014not his former second-in-command, not one of the men he\u2019d known and worked with for decades. Zane\u2019s mouth was too dry to even swallow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty finally said.</p><p>\u201cThey think it\u2019s one man they\u2019re after. No way they\u2019d expect six,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>\u201cI have a bunch of ear buds, a few other things,\u201d Digger said. \u201cSniper rifle, a couple smoke canisters, Kevlar vest.\u201d</p><p>Kelly leaned forward. \u201cA Kevlar vest?\u201d</p><p>Digger nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou travel with full assault gear?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared at him. Ty began to massage the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Liam stood and smoothed his hands over the front of his shirt, then walked away. \u201cYou\u2019re all criminally insane.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his head from side to side, working out the kinks. Then he rapped his knuckles on the table to draw everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, we need to know how many they have and find a location good for the meet. And we need to do it fast. This place won\u2019t be safe for much longer.\u201d</p><p>Zane finally tore his eyes away from Ty. \u201cTaking care of the cartel won\u2019t get us out of New Orleans any easier. It\u2019s the police we should really be worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cCall the local Bureau office. Tell them what\u2019s going on. Get backup. Get the cops off our asses. Make this something official instead of . . .\u201d He waved at Digger. \u201cCriminally insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lose my job,\u201d Ty said. He was pacing, head down and arms crossed.</p><p>Nick craned his head. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here. I could compromise half a dozen cases just by showing my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you say something before you came down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were in jail!\u201d</p><p>Nick made a disgusted noise. He leaned his elbows on the table and began to massage his temples.</p><p>\u201cCall Burns, he\u2019ll get you out of it,\u201d Zane said, surprised by the bitter sarcasm that came out.</p><p>Ty stared at him for a long moment, looking wounded, before he began to pace again. Zane forced himself to meet his eyes.</p><p>He was ashamed to admit he still wanted to see Ty burn. He\u2019d hoped Ty would come at him again last night, that they\u2019d go down swinging at each other. But he knew deep down that Ty wasn\u2019t that type of man. He wasn\u2019t going to chase Zane, or beg and plead with him. He wasn\u2019t going to hover over him and swat the drink from his hand every time he grasped it. He would let Zane walk away, he would let Zane self-destruct, he would internalize anything he was feeling, and become that same man he\u2019d been the day they met. A hard, sarcastic shell. Zane could already see him building up those layers, and he hated Ty for it.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019ll it be, lads?\u201d Liam asked. He winked at Zane.</p><p>Kelly and Digger both craned their heads to look at Ty as he paced. Owen was resting his head on the table.</p><p>Ty had his back to them, his head down. He really only had two choices. Get himself fired to keep everyone safe, or risk their lives, and a murder rap, to take down the cartel heavies.</p><p>\u201cHey, Six?\u201d Digger said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your goddamned Six anymore,\u201d Ty grunted. He began to pace again. \u201cCall the Bureau,\u201d he finally said, his voice grim.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Nick said carefully.</p><p>\u201cMy job or your lives? There\u2019s no choice there.\u201d Ty met Zane\u2019s eyes across the room. \u201cMake the call. Tell them you\u2019re bringing in a Confidential Informant. That\u2019s what I was supposed to be if my cover was ever blown. Use the name Tyler Beaumont; that\u2019ll ping any dirty Feds, so we\u2019ll go in expecting a trap.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t move. His heart was sinking and it was too painful to move right now, to look away from Ty\u2019s eyes. If Ty lost his job, what would they have between them? \u201cYou\u2019re willing to give it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about being willing anymore, Garrett,\u201d Ty snarled. \u201cMake the fucking call.\u201d</p><p>The curtain behind the bar wavered, and Ava pushed past it to lunge into the room. \u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d she hissed. \u201cMy daddy and his boys. They\u2019re coming here. You have to leave!\u201d</p><p>Chairs scraped on the wooden floors as everyone stood and scrambled toward the stairs to retrieve their gear.</p><p>\u201cAre they coming for us?\u201d Ty asked Ava.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cShine called me, told me they were on their way. They know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Ty cursed under his breath. He reached out and pulled her to him, hugging her tightly before he let her go and darted up the steps.</p><p>Only Zane remained, still sitting at the table, arms crossed. He stared at Ava until she turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou called him. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d Zane asked, voice pitched low so only she would hear it.</p><p>Her breath caught. She swallowed hard and inclined her head, squaring her shoulders. \u201cTy isn\u2019t the only one in town who\u2019s scared of that old bastard,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut he\u2019s the only one I know who just might be able to kill him if he\u2019s given the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using him to get rid of your father. Risking his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what men like him are for.\u201d She turned on her heel and ducked behind the curtain again.</p><p>Ty led them through the residential streets of Marigny, pushing them to reach the French Quarter, trying to stick to the Easter crowds, desperate to keep his mind on survival and off the fact that his heart was breaking every time he and Zane were close.</p><p>\u201cIf we can get to the cathedral, we can lose ourselves in the crowd until the parades start,\u201d he told them. Soon they neared Jackson Square and St. Louis Cathedral, one of the most recognizable landmarks in the French Quarter.</p><p>People milled around dressed in their Sunday best. Every woman wore a hat of some description, and many of the men did as well.</p><p>\u201cShit, you think we\u2019ll be killing people on Easter Sunday?\u201d Nick muttered as they neared the cathedral.</p><p>Ty nodded and Nick cursed, then stopped briefly in front of the cathedral and made the sign of the cross as he faced the soaring spires. Kelly grabbed him by the arm and tugged him, peering up at the structure.</p><p>\u201cForgive him, baby Jesus, he knows not what he does,\u201d Kelly said, then pulled Nick with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Hell anyway, I don\u2019t know why I bother anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned down Pirate\u2019s Alley, the narrow lane that skirted the cathedral, and then they cut through St. Anthony\u2019s garden, the tiny area behind the cathedral where four unmarked tombs rested. Ty leapt over one of the marble slabs. He could hear Nick complaining behind him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re empty!\u201d Ty called to him. All but one, but Ty didn\u2019t add that. He led them on through several turns until they reached Antoine\u2019s Restaurant. The place was obviously closed, but a crowd was building in the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Zane asked. He was a little out of breath, but then, so were the rest of them.</p><p>\u201cThe first parade starts here at nine or nine-thirty. We should be safe for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite the fact that the police station is two blocks that way?\u201d Zane asked, pointing toward Royal Street.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, like a walking map?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>\u201cSort of, yeah,\u201d Zane answered.</p><p>\u201cThe station will be damn near empty right now,\u201d Ty told them. \u201cThere are three parades today, plus the Easter services. They\u2019re already out. The safest place is in a crowd, and this is all I got.\u201d</p><p>Nick patted him on the shoulder, nodding. \u201cIt\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the Feds,\u201d Owen said as they all parked themselves near the fa\u00e7ade of the restaurant. They looked like wandering vagrants. Their clothes were unkempt, they were carrying bags on their backs, and Ty and Zane were both wearing hats they had taken from Murdoch\u2019s office before leaving.</p><p>Ty pulled out his phone and dialed the number for the local Bureau field office.</p><p>\u201cYes, I need to speak with Gregory Pike,\u201d Ty said as soon as the call was answered. He could feel the others forming a sort of barrier around him and Zane as they stood on the periphery of the parade crowd. He ducked his head to avoid being recognized or caught on any security feeds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, Special Agent Pike no longer works here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Ty hissed. He put the phone to his chest and closed his eyes, trying to think. Pike had been the handler for all UC cases before Katrina hit. He\u2019d been a solid, trustworthy local, one who\u2019d proven impervious to bribes or scandal. His replacement could be anyone, and Ty didn\u2019t trust just anyone. He cleared his throat and brought the phone back up. \u201cI need to speak with his replacement, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head urgently. \u201cReplacement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t think we can trust him,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Zane extended his hand. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is New Orleans, Zane, you don\u2019t trust anyone. But if I hear his name, I might know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang up,\u201d Nick hissed.</p><p>Kelly gripped Nick\u2019s shoulder and shook his head. \u201cThis is the only avenue that doesn\u2019t end bloody. We\u2019ll go in careful, bug out if he doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around the faces staring at him and noticed one missing. \u201cWhere\u2019d Liam go?\u201d</p><p>The others searched around, but Liam Bell was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cHe bailed,\u201d Zane said. He sounded surprised.</p><p>Ty gritted his teeth. \u201cWe consider him hostile now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean I get to shoot him?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Owen cursed. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight a three-front war with a few of Digger\u2019s toys and four guns.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight one front if we don\u2019t get help.\u201d</p><p>Saint Louis Cemetery #1 on Basin Street was the oldest cemetery in New Orleans. It wasn\u2019t far from where the parade started. The walk was excruciating for Zane. Ty wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with him, wouldn\u2019t even glance in his general direction. Zane wasn\u2019t sure which of them should be apologizing or if there was even anything left to say after last night. Ty had crossed a line, there was no question of that. But last night, Zane had crossed one too.</p><p>He trailed along, silent as Ty told them a little of the history of the cemetery so they\u2019d be familiar with the terrain.</p> <p>The raised tombs were due in part to the Spanish and French traditions of the original New Orleanians, but also served as a solution to the fact that New Orleans was below sea level. Solid land was at a premium even in the 1700s, and using it to bury the dead was just bad business. So the iconic aboveground cemeteries of New Orleans were pieced together over the centuries. Ty told them they would have lots of cover, but to be careful about taking blind turns, as they might wind up smacking straight into an abandoned vault that had sunk half into the ground.</p><p>There were three gated entrances into the cemetery, only one of which stayed open. It was otherwise surrounded by high walls. Not a fortress by any means, but an excellent place for such a meeting. The maze inside would offer cover, and the limited points of egress would make it easy to spot anyone who shouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>As the parade inched down Bourbon, they began to split off. Ty was to double-time it to the north and circle back, heading down Rampart and then cutting through Louis Armstrong Park. He would approach Basin Street Station, a visitor center with a roof terrace that was the perfect place to put a sniper. He\u2019d secure a position up there and remain until it was clear. He carried Liam\u2019s British-made AWS suppressed sniper rifle with folding action in a nondescript violin case he\u2019d stolen from La F\u00e9e Verte.</p><p>Owen and Digger were to enter the cemetery and loiter on the south side to prevent entry, while Nick and Kelly were to guard the back gate from outside the cemetery.</p><p>Zane was left to head straight down St. Louis Street and approach the cemetery at its main entrance.</p> <p>The ear buds Digger had provided were dependent on small wireless radios, and as long as the radio was within a few yards of the ear bud, they would work. Zane kept his in his pocket. They had a limited range, but Zane could still hear the others after they all went their separate ways. Ty remained silent for several minutes, his harsh breathing as he ran the only evidence that his ear bud worked at all. Then his breathing evened out and he began to whistle a tune. Zane slowed his pace, a feeling of dread coming over him. When Ty whistled, it never boded well.</p><p>The street in front of the cemetery\u2019s main entrance was crowded with parked cars and several horse-drawn carriages. Zane hung back, loitering and strolling up and down the street for nearly an hour as he observed the area. The others were doing the same, reporting in occasionally. Ty had made his way to his roost somehow, and since Zane hadn\u2019t heard him trying to charm any employees, his guess was Ty had just snuck up there.</p><p>\u201cI got a Fed,\u201d Ty finally whispered in Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cComing up on Garrett now.\u201d</p><p>Zane watched a thin man in a dark suit step out of a black Tahoe that he\u2019d parked illegally along the street, then head straight for the cemetery entrance as he buttoned his suit jacket.</p><p>\u201cGot him,\u201d Zane said under his breath. \u201cAnyone following?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear back here,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>\u201cGot a vehicle parked on this side,\u201d Owen reported. \u201cSome sort of touring van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on your count, Garrett,\u201d Ty murmured.</p><p>Zane waited a few more minutes, then crossed the street at an angle, standing in the grassy median and shielding his eyes from the sun. The Basin Street Station building was to his right. It was pale yellow with black iron workings around the top terrace. That was where Ty had set up. It was impossible to see him, though; the sun sat right behind him. Behind the enclosed walls of the cemetery, Zane could see the uneven structures of tombs and tiny chapels. Stone angels wept. Brick faltered to the hands of time and unstable earth.</p><p>Zane took a moment to steady himself, and then crossed to the other side of the street. The agent saw him coming and nodded at him, then turned, following a small tour group into the cemetery and breaking off to the right. Ty had told the FBI contact to meet them in the front of the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s heading in. It\u2019s a trap,\u201d Ty said in Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cEverybody bug out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative,\u201d Zane said, and he followed the man into the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Garrett, the others can\u2019t cover you in there!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>Zane nodded. He\u2019d spent most of his time undercover alone; he was more used to taking these types of risks than Ty was. And he had every confidence that Ty\u2019s sniper rifle would cover him just fine.</p> <p>Zane trailed through the maze of tombs, following the directions Ty whispered in his ear. He headed to the back where Ty said the Protestant section would be. It was a grassy area, devoid of vaults and mostly clear. It took Zane many twists and turns, and several dead ends with Ty\u2019s voice in his ear telling him which way to go, before he found it.</p><p>The agent was sitting on an iron bench, waiting for him. He was possibly the most Federal-looking FBI agent Zane had ever seen: black suit, loafers, sunglasses, and a thick black tie. He\u2019d unbuttoned his jacket and his shoulder holster was partially visible, and his pants leg rode up to reveal his backup holster and weapon. A field agent he was not.</p><p>Zane sighed and stepped out of the row of tombs he\u2019d cut through. The man straightened when he caught sight of Zane, and he stood, buttoning his jacket.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Howard?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Are you Garrett?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your CI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy CI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were bringing in a CI. A Tyler Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Yeah, he\u2019s the one with that little red dot on your chest,\u201d Zane said, pointing to Howard\u2019s tie.</p><p>Howard looked down and jerked when he saw the laser sight dancing on his tie. His eyes were wide and scared when they met Zane\u2019s. He reached for his gun, but his buttoned suit impeded him, so he brought his wrist to his mouth and ducked, as if that would save him from Ty\u2019s sniper rifle.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re onto us! They came armed!\u201d he shouted to whoever was on the other end of his radio.</p><p>Zane cursed and turned to duck behind the nearest row of tombs. The telltale pops of a suppressed weapon echoed in the humidity. Marble chips flew as the rounds hit next to Zane\u2019s head. He ducked and weaved left, covering his head. He could hear the others in his ear bud. None of them sounded panicked. In fact, Ty\u2019s voice came over the frequency as calm as if he were ordering a sandwich at the local deli. Zane had heard more emotion from Ty as he watched a football game.</p><p>\u201cGot five going over the northeast wall,\u201d Ty said in Zane\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cWhich one\u2019s northeast?\u201d Owen shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot yours. Garrett\u2019s hemmed in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye aye, we\u2019re going in,\u201d Nick growled. More suppressed pops came from the wall, followed by the boom of Nick\u2019s weapon.</p><p>\u201cFive more through the main entrance,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cThese aren\u2019t locals. Get out.\u201d</p><p>Shots fired from the roof. Zane peered around the tomb to see Special Agent Howard scrabbling for cover. Bullets hit at his feet, kicking up earth and grass, making him dance back and forth. Ty was playing with him, pinning him down.</p><p>Tourists screamed in the distance. Horses whinnied. Sirens began to blare from the traffic station down the street. Zane lunged from his hiding spot and ran low, angling toward Howard, where he was trapped in the open by Ty\u2019s covering fire. A bullet whizzed past his arm, so close it burned.</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry,\u201d Ty said in his ear.</p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d Zane snarled. He reached Howard and grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, jerking him to his feet and pulling him toward the tombs. He saw Nick and Kelly scaling the gate on the back wall.</p><p>When he reached cover, Zane slammed Howard to the ground and held his gun to the man\u2019s nose. He patted him down, taking all his weapons, his badge, and his car keys.</p><p>\u201cSix, you got cops on your position in three,\u201d Nick shouted.</p><p>Ty ignored the warning and fired more shots. Someone in the cemetery screamed.</p><p>\u201cTwo down. And a half. Seven live. Get your asses out of there!\u201d Ty ordered. \u201cGarrett, quit dancing with him and move!\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t release the man, instead gripping him hard by his collar and forcing him along with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too hot up here, I\u2019m gone,\u201d Ty said. \u201cClear out!\u201d</p><p>Shots continued to echo through the cemetery, but the sniper rifle fell silent.</p><p>Zane craned his head to look up at the roof as he dragged Howard through the maze of vaults and tombs. Ty had finally abandoned his post, but Zane didn\u2019t know how he planned to get out of that building now that all hell had broken loose.</p><p>There was more gunfire from the back of the cemetery. Zane couldn\u2019t tell if Sidewinder was chasing the unfriendlies or if they were now being chased. Agent Howard fell to his knees, whimpering and tugging at Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Zane shouted. He yanked him hard, slamming him against the crumbling exposed brick of an ancient vault. He shoved his gun under Howard\u2019s chin. \u201cWho\u2019d you call?\u201d</p><p>Howard began blubbering. Zane could barely make out his words. He yanked the ear bud from his ear to be rid of the chatter and shoved the gun harder against Howard\u2019s neck. \u201cShut your damn mouth.\u201d</p><p>Howard\u2019s sniveling cut off with a gulp. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI have a family.\u201d</p><p>Zane bared his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Who did you call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice commander. Gaudet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t cop firepower; who else is involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014he said he had help. Someone new in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames.\u201d</p><p>Howard jerked his head from side to side. He was trembling. \u201cSpanish. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColombian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Please God, don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Zane released him. He peered over the vault. The gunfire continued. He stuck the ear bud back in, only to be greeted by garbled shouts and echoes of shots.</p><p>He stepped away from Howard and pointed the gun at the man\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cOh, God no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your final lesson in loyalty,\u201d Zane growled. He put a bullet in the man\u2019s kneecap and darted away.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did they get all this firepower?\u201d Nick shouted as he and Kelly ducked behind a large marble vault. Bullets thwapped into the ground around them, ricocheting off marble and stone. Nick\u2019s face was bleeding and he could feel a shard of something stuck just below his eye. His sunglasses had probably saved his vision.</p><p>\u201cNot cops!\u201d Ty yelled through the static in Nick\u2019s ear. He was breathing hard, probably running.</p><p>\u201cCartel hitters,\u201d Zane hissed. \u201cHoward said Gaudet called them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo wait, the cartel and the cops are working together?\u201d Owen asked. \u201cHow\u2019s that fair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Kelly shouted. \u201cSound the retreat, baby, let\u2019s get our happy asses out of here!\u201d He reached to Nick\u2019s face and yanked the piece of shrapnel out. Nick cussed him up and down and held his hand to the wound.</p><p>Owen\u2019s voice came through. \u201cSix?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s response was barely audible.</p><p>\u201cRabbit hole,\u201d Kelly muttered at Nick\u2019s side. He was reloading his gun, crouched as low as he could get. If Ty\u2019d gone down the rabbit hole, there was no one to offer cover fire.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here,\u201d Zane ordered. \u201cEverybody out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve put a guard on the roost,\u201d Digger said. \u201cGoddamn you Liam Bell!\u201d</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t make out where any of the others were. They\u2019d been outnumbered and overpowered, chased into the maze of tombs within the cemetery. It encompassed an entire block, filled with crumbling sidewalks, winding alleyways too small to fit a grown man through, and towering stonework that abruptly cut off pathways and created kill boxes with no escape. Without Ty in the sniper\u2019s roost to cover them or give them enemy positions, they were in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost at the front entrance,\u201d Zane said on the ear bud. \u201cMake your way here, I\u2019ll cover you.\u201d</p><p>Nick patted Kelly\u2019s knee, pointing toward the direction of the main entrance. Kelly nodded and they both darted off down the closest lane.</p><p>Shots chased them.</p><p>\u201cFree drinks! Fireworks!\u201d Ty shouted at the top of his lungs. His signal was stronger, meaning he\u2019d escaped the Basin Street building somehow. Nick snorted. Ty and the cockroaches. He could imagine him running into a crowd of Easter Sunday churchgoers, tourists, and parade marchers, trying to create a distraction and lure people out of harm\u2019s way. \u201cFree drinks inside!\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Nick saw a man climb on top of a touring van parked on a side street. He crouched on the roof and tossed something into the cemetery. An earsplitting boom and a flash followed. As he and Kelly darted between tombs and dodged bullets and shrapnel, Nick got a closer look at the man. Liam Bell.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cIs he on our side?\u201d Kelly called. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! Run!\u201d</p><p>Smoke began to billow from the back of the cemetery. Liam tossed two more canisters, closer to their own position. Nick and Kelly skidded to a stop. Nick covered his ears and squeezed his eyes closed as the flashbangs went off.</p><p>They wasted precious seconds trying to shake off the concussive blast. Nick could hear screams of pain and anger. He peeked around the corner of the tomb that shielded them, only to come face-to-face with a man who was doing the same thing. Nick rolled away as the man brought his gun up and fired.</p> <p>\u201cGo!\u201d he yelled, pushing at Kelly\u2019s arm.</p><p>They sprinted down the lane, catching glimpses through the narrow alleys of two men racing down the opposite lane. When they reached a widened intersection, Nick raised his weapon, preparing to fire as their pursuers rounded the corner.</p><p>But Zane was there, flattened against the tomb wall, knives in his hands. When the two assassins reached the corner of the tomb, he stepped out and swept a hand across one man\u2019s neck. Blood spurted as Zane turned gracefully and shoved a knife into the other man\u2019s side. He jerked it up, under the body armor, under the ribs. He stepped back, covered in blood as both men fell to the ground, dead or dying.</p><p>Nick and Kelly gaped at him as he twirled both knives over his fingers and shoved them back into their sheaths.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Kelly grunted.</p> <p>Zane shrugged and bent to gather the weapons off the dead bodies. He pointed toward the entrance, a mere ten yards away.</p><p>Nick and Kelly stayed low and close, watching each other\u2019s backs as Zane brought up the rear, scurrying from tomb to tomb for cover. Owen and Digger appeared from the other side. The smoke bombs Liam had thrown seemed to have bought them enough time to clear the cemetery. Owen and Digger darted out, then took up posts behind the walls to cover their last few yards.</p><p>Nick was almost to the open gate when something thumped into him from behind. The report of the shot reached his ears a split-second later. He was thrown forward. More bullets hit the walls around him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hit, he\u2019s hit!\u201d Owen cried, the voice coming both from nearby and inside Nick\u2019s ear. \u201cDoc!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s hit?\u201d Ty asked, voice suddenly panicked.</p><p>No one answered him.</p> <p>Nick pushed at the ground, but the weight on top of him was too much. He turned his head. Kelly had fallen into him when the bullet hit. Owen fell to his knees beside Nick\u2019s face. They lifted Kelly off him and Nick pushed up, scrabbling the rest of the way out of the cemetery.</p><p>They hit open ground and ran, rushing into traffic on Rampart Street. Nick and Zane fell back to cover them as Owen and Digger carried Kelly between them. They faltered in the large grassy median and took cover behind a horse and carriage that had been abandoned by its driver.</p><p>Crowds of people were running to and fro, panicked and confused.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s hit?\u201d Ty demanded, his voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the median,\u201d Zane said, breathless. \u201cKelly\u2019s down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc,\u201d Digger said as he put a hand on Kelly\u2019s face.</p><p>Kelly coughed and took in a loud, shivering breath. Owen knelt, cradling Kelly\u2019s head. Nick fell to his knees beside him and began trying to find the wound through all the blood.</p><p>Zane remained standing, keeping guard and watching out of the corner of his eye.</p> <p>Mere seconds passed before Ty joined them. He dove to the ground beside Kelly, jostling Nick as he tried to cut away the bloody clothing. \u201cWhere\u2019s he hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t find it,\u201d Nick stuttered.</p><p>\u201cDoc, stay with me now,\u201d Digger pleaded. He patted Kelly\u2019s cheek. Kelly\u2019s eyes fluttered open. They all leaned over him. Digger sounded like a frightened child. \u201cWhat do we do, Doc?\u201d</p><p>Kelly tried to speak. Blood began to trickle out of the side of his mouth.</p><p>Ty grabbed Owen\u2019s shirt and shook him. \u201cGet a car.\u201d</p><p>Owen nodded and pushed up, darting into traffic to commandeer a vehicle. They were mere blocks from the hospital. Zane fired into the cemetery, keeping their opponents at bay.</p><p>Kelly struggled to take another breath, but it only produced more blood. Digger held onto his hand. Nick\u2019s fingers trembled as he searched for an exit wound.</p><p>Ty leaned over and ran a bloody hand through Kelly\u2019s hair. \u201cSteady now,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kelly nodded and closed his eyes.</p><p>Zane shot at the cemetery again. Return fire hit the carriage, and the horse panicked, pulling away and taking their cover with it.</p><p>Ty and Nick moved together, their backs to the cemetery so their bodies shielded Kelly\u2019s. Ty\u2019s voice shook as he whispered, \u201cYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kelly picked up when Ty\u2019s voice broke, his words a struggle. \u201cFor thou art with me. And thou carry a big-ass stick.\u201d</p><p>Ty hunched over him and winced as a bullet struck nearby. Tears trailed down his cheeks and he pressed his forehead to Kelly\u2019s. Nick realized he had tears streaming down his own face.</p><p>Screeching wheels and Owen\u2019s urgent shout forced Nick to tear his eyes away. He glanced over his shoulder to see Owen waving from the driver\u2019s side of a big yellow sedan.</p><p>\u201cOn three,\u201d Ty said. \u201cZane! Help us!\u201d</p><p>Zane hustled over to help lift Kelly, and they carried him to the vehicle, still taking sporadic fire from the cemetery. Digger ducked into the backseat and pulled Kelly in by his shoulders. Nick spotted Liam, then, laying down covering fire with Zane to keep both the cartel thugs and the police at bay. Liam ducked into the front seat, still returning fire. Ty pushed Nick\u2019s shoulder, forcing him to get in next. Nick clambered into the back, kneeling on the floor between the front seats and holding Kelly\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGet in!\u201d Ty shouted, shoving Zane by the shoulder.</p><p>Zane crawled in behind Nick, facing backward to keep from jostling Kelly\u2019s sprawled body. \u201cWhat are you doing, Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to have time,\u201d Ty grunted as he slammed the door in Zane\u2019s face. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait! Ty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrady! Goddamnit!\u201d Nick shouted.</p><p>Ty banged on the roof of the car and shouted at Owen. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Owen gunned the engine and sped off. Nick and Zane watched through the window as Ty turned and fired a few shots over the heads of the police with his pistol, then sprinted off toward the French Quarter.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Ty ran as fast as he could down the middle of the street, heading for Bourbon or Royal and what he prayed would be the parade crowd. He knew he had fifteen seconds, maybe thirty, before anyone pursued. They\u2019d be too worried about him taking up a position somewhere and gunning them down. But that was all the leeway he\u2019d have before he was caught, and he had to make it count.</p><p>He\u2019d only managed one city block before someone shouted behind him. But they couldn\u2019t fire at him, not with the pedestrian traffic so close.</p><p>A bullet pinged off the road next to his feet.</p><p>Fuck! Ty covered his head and hunched his shoulders, but he kept running.</p><p>They were firing directly into the pedestrian areas of the French Quarter, directly into that parade crowd. The streets were lined with homes and businesses. People who\u2019d been innocently strolling along were now screaming and taking cover wherever they could find it. These weren\u2019t local cops chasing him down. There would be no talking his way around an interrogation until the cavalry arrived. He was running for his life, not a few extra minutes.</p><p>He had to reach Canal Street, toward the business district and, if his luck held, Harrah\u2019s Casino.</p><p>The casino would have facial recognition software covering the floors, everyone knew that, and the cartel thugs wouldn\u2019t risk being identified by it. It was a solid mile away, though.</p><p>A chain-link fence appeared on his left, surrounding a rare outlying vacant lot, and he sprinted for it. More shots chased him, busting the rear window of a car parked along the road and pinging off a lamppost just inches from Ty\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Ty vaulted the flimsy fence, catching the top of it and taking it down with him as he went over. He hit grass and gravel and rolled, regaining his feet but losing precious seconds. He dug for the other side of the lot where a higher, sturdier fence had been erected. He leapt at the brick wall and kicked off it to clear the fence like a high jumper, then hit the ground running. A bullet sprayed brick dust where his foot had been and men shouted in Spanish from the far corner of the building.</p><p>Ty found himself in the interior of a city block, weaving between trash bins, parked cars, bicycles, and buildings. He slowed at a small courtyard, his heart hammering as he realized he may have hemmed himself in. He could hear his pursuers clambering over the fence.</p><p>He looked up. He could use the iron stairs of the apartment building and maybe reach the roof with a short climb, but he\u2019d be an easy target for far too long. And if he by some miracle made it up there without getting shot, he\u2019d still have the dilemma of being stuck on a fucking roof.</p><p>There was nowhere to hide that he wouldn\u2019t be found eventually. He could kick down someone\u2019s door, hope they had windows or a door that faced the street, and risk whatever homeowner he barged in on being shot behind him. Or beating him with a curling iron.</p><p>He grabbed the gun at the small of his back. He had twelve shots left in the magazine, and a spare with fifteen more strapped to his ankle. If he had to make a last stand in this dead-end courtyard, he would make it a bloody one.</p><p>He ran for a large green dumpster in the far corner of the courtyard, intending to use it and the trash inside as cover. But as he rounded the dumpster, he found a gap between the buildings. It was narrow, hidden by the layout of the old structures, and it appeared to lead to a dead end. Ty headed down it anyway, praying the darkness was really another gap between buildings rather than mere shadow.</p><p>He heard angry voices behind him.</p><p>\u201c\u00bfHa donde se fue este cabron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo esta aqui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo le crecio alas. Buscale!\u201d</p><p>Ty knew enough to understand the last word: Find him.</p><p>He moved faster, trying to stay silent as he reached the end of the alley. His gamble paid off, and he took a hard right down another tight alleyway that led to another seam between buildings. It went off to the left, even narrower than the first two. Ty had to turn sideways to get through it. It ended with a wooden fence, and after a few hard kicks, Ty broke through into a small, private courtyard filled with plants and garden decorations, colorful tile and antique string lights overhead. And on the far side was an alleyway to the street. Ty could see people walking past.</p><p>The alley was blocked at the street end by a tall iron gate topped with broken pieces of colored glass, glinting in the sunlight. But it sure as hell looked better than dying in a hail of bullets.</p><p>Ty tucked his gun back into his belt and darted across the courtyard.</p><p>He dodged creeping vines and salvaged antiques as he ran through the passage, and when he reached the end, he jumped for the gate, grabbing onto the iron with his hands and pushing with his feet. He scaled the gate as wide-eyed tourists and drunk college kids gaped at him from the other side. A frat boy handed his plastic cup to his friend and brought out a phone to begin recording. A horse and carriage clopped along with a young family in tow.</p><p>As Ty reached the top of the gate, where the shards of glass were his last obstacle to freedom, he heard shouting in the courtyard behind him.</p><p>He put a foot on the brick beside him and pressed his shoulder into the opposite wall, walking his feet up the side of the wall until he was high enough to simply twist his body into a flip and free-fall over the gate.</p><p>He landed too hard and rolled into the street, finding himself at the mercy of a very large white horse that tossed its head and snorted.</p><p>Ty scrambled to his feet, backing away from the animal as people broke into excited murmurs around him. He glanced back down the alleyway, edging out of sight behind the horse just as men appeared in the shadows through the wrecked wooden gate.</p><p>\u201cThat is so going on YouTube!\u201d the guy with the phone cried.</p><p>Ty climbed onto the carriage.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d the driver started, but Ty put a finger to his lips and showed the man his gun.</p><p>He snatched the man\u2019s top hat, then placed it on his head, slid off the carriage, and hustled to the intersection, hoping to blend in with the crowd.</p><p>As he rounded the corner, a large man stepped in front of him. Shine Gaudet. The man Ty suspected of killing Murdoch. The man who\u2019d picked a girl out of a crowd and choked the life out of her because she resembled his sister. He was 6\u20198\u201d with arms the size of river logs. Ty had once playfully sparred with him, and he\u2019d been playfully tossed across the room and bruised three ribs in the process.</p><p>\u201cWell if it ain\u2019t Tyler Beaumont,\u201d Shine drawled. He smirked.</p><p>Ty took a step back. \u201cLet\u2019s be calm about this, bubba.\u201d</p><p>Shine raised his fist, displaying his knuckles to Ty. His attention shifted from Ty to his fist with a widening smile, then he opened his hand, turning his palm up to display a handful of gray dust. With one big puff, he blew the dust into Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>Ty held his breath and kept his eyes closed. He could hear Shine laughing, a deep rumbling sound that began to fade into the distance as Ty tried to wipe the dust away with his sleeve. His knees hit the pavement, and his world faded to nothing before the rest of his body could contact the ground.</p><p>Zane bulled his way through the electronic door almost before the nurse had it open. He didn\u2019t bother with appearances as he jogged down the hall.</p><p>Everyone had tumbled out of the stolen sedan at the emergency entrance, and Zane had rolled over the console to get to the front seat. He and Liam had then peeled away in the car, trying to lead any pursuers away from the others. They\u2019d ditched the car several blocks away, and Zane had been hard-pressed to keep up with Liam as they\u2019d raced back toward the hospital. They hadn\u2019t had a chance to speak a word, but Zane had infinite questions for the man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he rounded the corner, Zane saw their companions loitering around one of the emergency bays near a closed curtain. His heart sped up, making him dizzy as he neared them.</p><p>Digger was pacing in front of the curtain, fingers laced at the back of his head. The other two were sitting, both of them covering their faces with their hands. All three men were bloody. Bloody gauze littered the floors. Even the curtain had a bloody streak on the edge where someone had grabbed it.</p><p>Zane was nearly hyperventilating as he approached. Liam\u2019s breaths were harsh and loud behind him.</p> <p>Nick looked up at the sound of their approach. His shirtfront was soaked red, his eyes gray, his face streaked with blood and tears. He had a butterfly bandage on his cheek.</p><p>Zane slowed, dreading what he might find.</p><p>\u201cKelly?\u201d Zane asked hesitantly.</p><p>Nick shook his head, then lowered it again and covered his face in both hands.</p><p>\u201cThey took him into surgery,\u201d Owen managed to say. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d</p> <p>Zane breathed a sigh of relief. Surgery at least meant he wasn\u2019t dead when they\u2019d carried him in.</p><p>\u201cLads, I hate to be insensitive,\u201d Liam said, peering over his shoulder at the nurse\u2019s station. \u201cBut we have about five seconds to clear our arses out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, I\u2019m not leaving him,\u201d Digger growled.</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m not fucking leaving him!\u201d Digger grabbed Liam by his leather jacket, shaking him. \u201cWhere the fuck were you when we needed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your hands off the coat,\u201d Liam said, voice calm. His eyes sparked, though, and even Zane recognized that he\u2019d reached a dangerous point. He was no longer amused.</p> <p>Digger sneered but released him with a final shove.</p><p>\u201cI understand your desire to stay, I really do,\u201d Liam continued, his voice low and soothing. \u201cBut you\u2019ve done all you can for the doc, you have to look now to the other team member we lost out there.\u201d</p><p>Owen stood and shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not any teammate of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why am I the only one wondering how long he\u2019ll survive without help?\u201d</p><p>Zane swiped a hand over his face. \u201cHe got away from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that how?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know Ty. You can\u2019t trap a cockroach.\u201d</p><p>Liam snorted. \u201cBut you can kill one if you stomp it hard enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe got away. He\u2019ll go to ground,\u201d Zane insisted. \u201cHe won\u2019t let himself hang in the wind too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of what Ty is doing or how capable he might be of slipping through the cracks, Liam\u2019s right,\u201d Nick said. \u201cWe need to clear out of here before we\u2019re found. All that blood . . . they\u2019ll know one of us was hit, they\u2019ll be here looking soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kelly? We can\u2019t leave him behind. Unprotected?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s safer here than he was out there.\u201d</p><p>Nick stood, and Owen and Digger closed ranks behind him, facing Liam and Zane. Zane couldn\u2019t help but admire the way Sidewinder seemed to come together when they needed to. He had never worked as part of a team before Ty, preferring to go at things solo even when he\u2019d been a child. Even Becky had been more of a confidante, a support system, something to fight for instead of with. She\u2019d been a way to forget life\u2019s troubles rather than an ally to take them on, and Zane had been happy with that arrangement. She had been exactly what he\u2019d needed at that point in his life. But he had changed. Life had changed. And he had never had someone to face the world beside him, not until Ty.</p><p>Zane\u2019s stomach lurched at the thought. Ty wasn\u2019t the happy escape Becky had been for him. He might never offer Zane the warmth and light Becky once had, but Zane knew Ty would be there in the dark. In the last twenty-four hours, Zane had lost sight of that, blinded by the anger.</p><p>\u201cWhere would he go?\u201d Liam asked as he led them through the hallways, looking for a back exit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to think like Ty?\u201d Owen snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible; my brain isn\u2019t powered by squirrels on treadmills.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head, unbuttoning his bloody shirt as he walked. He shrugged out of it and dumped it into a hamper in the hallway. The others followed suit, discarding as much of their bloody clothes as they could in various nooks and crannies they passed on their way out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d go where they\u2019d least expect,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere public?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>\u201cThe hotel, maybe. The rooms are still under your name, they can\u2019t be traced to Ty or Garrett,\u201d Owen said to Nick.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how they found him to start with,\u201d Nick growled. \u201cHe\u2019s familiar with this city, there\u2019s no telling what kind of places he knows.\u201d</p><p>Zane inhaled sharply. \u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked over his shoulder at Zane, eyebrows raised. \u201cMaybe so. If he didn\u2019t go back there for help, maybe she\u2019ll know where he would go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know Ava\u2019s the one who called her father.\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped short, and Zane almost barreled into him. \u201cWait, she what?\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who called her father. She hoped Ty would go up against him and take him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat chick\u2019s all wrong, man,\u201d Digger whispered.</p><p>The change that came over Nick O\u2019Flaherty was almost frightening. His face hardened, his eyes going a deep, striking green when he lowered his head. He glanced at Owen and Digger, and both men nodded at some unspoken communication.</p><p>Nick headed off toward the exit, Owen and Digger on his heels.</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Liam said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cYou flipped the wrong switch in that one. I think we\u2019ve just landed the job of white knight,\u201d Liam grumbled. He started after them at a jog. \u201cLet\u2019s go save the girl from the rabid Yank Marines.\u201d</p><p>They double-timed it from the hospital, skirting the edges of the confusion and panic that was now the French Quarter, and headed for Marigny and Frenchmen Street. Nick kept looking down each street as they ran by, both hoping to see signs of Ty\u2019s passing and praying he didn\u2019t. The chaos meant the pursuit had been hard and fast, and it seemed to have encompassed two or three blocks.</p><p>Ty had made a worthy chase of it, at least.</p><p>Nick hoped the calm of the latter regions meant that Ty had gotten away and blended into the scenery, rather than getting caught.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the reach on these ear buds?\u201d Zane asked. He refused to slow down, and for once Nick was glad for the man\u2019s stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cYou got to be in a mile range of the hand unit,\u201d Digger answered. \u201cIf Ty\u2019s got his unit on him, we should be able to hear him and he should be able to hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can\u2019t hear him, that means he dropped his radio?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>\u201cOr his ear bud. Or he went into the drink. Or he\u2019s underground. Or he\u2019s behind lots of concrete. Or somewhere the signal\u2019s getting jacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? They ain\u2019t military grade. Damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any of you actually tried contacting him?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>They had to stop at Esplanade to wait for the heavy traffic. Nick put a finger to his ear and pulled the hand unit out, holding it up for the best reception he could give it. \u201cGrady?\u201d</p><p>They all waited, breathing shallowly to better hear.</p><p>All Nick received was the buzzing of radio silence in his ear.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s hiding,\u201d Zane said. \u201cMaybe he can\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll go with that,\u201d Liam said, sarcasm dripping from his words.</p><p>Nick stared at him for a long moment, and when Liam met his eyes, Nick hit him. Liam tumbled to the sidewalk as everyone else watched impassively.</p><p>Digger patted Nick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMe too, brother.\u201d</p><p>Liam sat up and wiped a hand over his mouth. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Nick said. The signal changed and they hustled across the street after Zane helped Liam to his feet.</p><p>When they reached La F\u00e9e Verte, the bar was closed down. Zane banged on the door and shouted for Ava to open it, but they got no response.</p><p>\u201cThe fucking place has no ground floor windows,\u201d Owen said as they all examined the fa\u00e7ade of the building for any point of entry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, lads, daddy\u2019s here,\u201d Liam drawled. He stepped up to the door, digging in the backpack he was carrying.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cBlowing your mind, love.\u201d Liam pulled out two small squares of off-white clay.</p><p>\u201cIs that C4?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cPE4, thank you very much.\u201d Liam molded the plastic explosive against the hinges of the door.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really understand going under the radar, do you?\u201d Nick grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou Recon boys sneak under the radar,\u201d Liam said as he set the charges. \u201cThe Special Air Service gets shit done.\u201d</p><p>Owen raised an eyebrow at Nick. \u201cIf you want to hit him again, I\u2019ll hold him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d Nick said. They all moved away and threw themselves against the wall.</p><p>Liam lit the charges and then hustled down the wall, flattening himself at Zane\u2019s side. The blast was small, and the sound was almost entirely covered by the racket of the Easter festivities and the live bands warming up nearby.</p><p>Zane was at the door before the smoke even cleared, kicking it off its destroyed hinges.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Liam called after him. \u201cGood lord, to watch him you\u2019d think Ty gave reward blowjobs for being rescued.\u201d</p><p>They streamed into the bar one after the other, clearing the room. Zane had already found Ava by the time Nick entered, grabbing her before she could barricade herself in the office. Zane held her around the waist as she struggled.</p><p>Nick stalked up to her and grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>She was breathing hard, gritting her teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know they have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want Ty hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you threw a butcher knife at him when he left before?\u201d Zane growled in her ear.</p><p>\u201cSays the man who threw him into a table,\u201d she snarled. She was still meeting Nick\u2019s eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Daddy had help. I swear. I thought you boys could take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s in the hospital dying,\u201d Nick sneered. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>Liam came up behind Nick and patted him on the shoulder, pulling at him gently. Nick released her and backed away before he was tempted to really hurt her. Then Liam reached out to pat Zane\u2019s arm. \u201cLet her go,\u201d he said, his voice oddly soothing.</p><p>Zane lifted his chin stubbornly, but he did. Liam took her by the hand and led her to one of the barstools nearby. He sat her down and cupped her face.</p><p>\u201cWe need your help, dear, or Ty\u2019s days are up.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him for a few breathless seconds and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere would he go if he was being chased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrah\u2019s. He always told me, if I got in trouble, to get to the casino. Something about facial recognition. Every bad in town knows they have it, they won\u2019t risk getting swiped by it.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded at Zane and Nick. That was a plan that sounded decidedly Ty-like.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Liam continued, his voice still low and almost seductive. \u201cIf your father were to get his hands on Tyler, where would he take him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take him anywhere. He\u2019d kill him right away.\u201d</p><p>Liam tutted, still looking her in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. Ty told us your father tried to set him up for murder first. He wanted him in his jail, not dead. He wanted to speak to him before he killed him. Think hard.\u201d</p><p>Ava shook her head almost defiantly.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere underground maybe?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no underground in New Orleans,\u201d Zane growled. \u201cIt\u2019s all water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d take him somewhere no one would hear him scream,\u201d Liam whispered to Ava.</p><p>She nodded, closing her eyes. \u201cThe Lower Ninth Ward. He\u2019d take him there.\u201d</p><p>Liam snapped his fingers at Digger. \u201cYou know where that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Area got flooded by Katrina when the levees broke. There\u2019s whole blocks of wrecked houses just sitting there empty. It\u2019s not too far.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded, then turned and backhanded Ava off the stool.</p><p>The others jumped, and Owen shouted in protest. Even Zane moved to intercede, but Ava remained on the floor, unconscious.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Nick cried.</p><p>Liam shrugged and poked her with the toe of his boot. \u201cNow we have leverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Gaudet doesn\u2019t have him?\u201d Nick gritted out.</p><p>Liam pursed his lips, then shrugged again. \u201cThen that was for the doc.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re either real stupid or real brave.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. The world was spinning. He couldn\u2019t feel the ground under his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you back in town, Tyler?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at Commander Louis Gaudet. \u201cDo you . . . do you ever become just very aware of your ears? They\u2019re . . . right there on your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Shine answered.</p><p>Gaudet\u2019s voice came from right in front of Ty\u2019s face. \u201cIs that some sort of code, boy?

He pointed to a pile of Ty\u2019s effects in the corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cEven so, check him for a wire.\u201d</p><p>The big man grabbed Ty\u2019s shirt and yanked it, pulling the buttons from their threads. Rough hands patted him down. Ty\u2019s head fell forward. He couldn\u2019t seem to make the spinning or the buzzing stop.</p> <p>Fingers gripped his hair and yanked his head back. A callused hand smacked his face.</p><p>\u201cWake up, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Ty forced his eyes open and inhaled noisily. Louis Gaudet peered at him. His face wobbled and Ty tried to blink the apparition away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is in that powder?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cCouple things. Valerian root. Poppy dust. Bones of a pure white cat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s messed up, man,\u201d Ty mumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re messed up.\u201d</p><p>He looked Shine up and down. The man had gained some muscle in the last five years, if that was possible. Ty\u2019s eyes landed on a cylinder shape in Shine\u2019s pocket. It was either a tube of his fucked-up hoodoo dust, or it was one of Ty\u2019s EpiPens from the room above the bar. Zane had dumped them out, and Ty hadn\u2019t been able to find them all in his haste to pack up that morning. That meant Shine had been in that room, which meant Ava had either given them up or been forced to talk.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes. \u201cHow much poppy dust?\u201d</p><p>Shine laughed, and a moment later a bucket of water hit Ty\u2019s face. He gasped, trying not to hyperventilate as the icy water trailed down his arms to drip off the ropes that bound his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you back in town, Tyler?\u201d Gaudet asked.</p><p>Ty worked hard to swallow. He shook his head. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTry us, son. We got all day and all night to get the real story from you.\u201d He held up a syringe and waved it for Ty to see. \u201cWe can make it a quick overdose, or we can make it a painful one. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and nodded. \u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d He licked his lips and began to flex his muscles, testing the ropes. His wrists were tied to the back legs of the chair, and his ankles were secured to the front legs. The water had given him a little leeway, but he still couldn\u2019t get free. \u201cI . . . I\u2019m here on a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of job?\u201d</p><p>Ty opened his eyes as the buzzing in his ear continued. He was breathless, but that was good. It gave his words an element of truth, made it harder to detect a lie. \u201cI hunt vampires.\u201d</p><p>Gaudet stared for a few seconds before straightening with a loud sigh. \u201cVampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a very serious vampire problem here.\u201d</p><p>Gaudet rolled his eyes and scrubbed at one cheek. He looked at his son. \u201cShine? Make him sorry for pulling my leg.\u201d</p><p>The big man began to wrap a strip of cloth around his knuckles.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Shine,\u201d Ty groaned. He shook his head. \u201cDown boy.\u201d</p><p>Shine began to laugh. \u201cBoy, you got bad gris-gris sticking to you. Almost like you\u2019re cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was you, huh?\u201d Shine nodded and Ty chuckled, even more breathless and hoarse than before. \u201cIs this a bad time to talk about how I fucked your sister?\u201d</p><p>Shine backhanded him hard enough to tilt the chair.</p><p>Gaudet sneered. \u201cYou got a smart mouth on you, boy. Always did. Shine\u2019ll fix that right up, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe better hurry,\u201d Ty managed to say. He gulped for air, trying to force himself to hyperventilate. He had to be convincing.</p><p>Gaudet bent in front of him, narrowing his eyes. He waved at Shine. \u201cHe\u2019s having one of those damn allergy attacks,\u201d he said, disgusted. \u201cI told you not to use that damn powder, boy, now he\u2019s gonna die before he can talk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell are we supposed to search an entire neighborhood of ruined houses?\u201d Owen hissed.</p><p>Zane pulled out a top shelf bottle of whiskey and didn\u2019t offer to share.</p><p>Nick sat beside him and leaned close so no one else would hear him. \u201cYou want to go easy on the hooch, Garrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d Zane whispered. He stared at the tabletop, unable to get Ty\u2019s face out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sitting here drinking when Ty\u2019s in trouble. That doesn\u2019t seem like the Zane Garrett I met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man died last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe lied to you.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at him then looked away quickly. The last person he wanted to talk to about this with was Nick O\u2019Flaherty. Hell, the man was probably standing in line waiting for Ty to be single.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Zane, he lied to us too. In fact, I don\u2019t know a single person Ty hasn\u2019t lied to, including himself.\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed and took another drink of whiskey. \u201cYou must be one hell of a loyal bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he? Has he really earned that from you, O\u2019Flaherty? Because I thought he\u2019d earned it from me too, and then I found out the truth. I found out he uses things like love and loyalty as tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what love and loyalty mean to him if that\u2019s what you really believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Zane took a gulp of whiskey. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you educate me then, O\u2019Flaherty, because you know him so fucking well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Ty\u2019s not all there,\u201d Nick said, tapping his temple with a finger. \u201cHe has always been a step away from the wrong path. One screw comes loose, and he\u2019s gone. The only thing keeps him on the side of the righteous is his loyalty. His sense of purpose. You take that from him? And you\u2019re looking into the eyes of a monster.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Nick, surprised by how hard the words hit him.</p><p>\u201cSo you question his motives. You question his tactics. But you be damn sure you know what you\u2019re doing before you question his loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago, I was trying to decide how to ask him to marry me,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cTonight I\u2019m trying to figure out if I can even love someone like him.\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent for a long while, long enough for Zane to drain his glass. Then he leaned closer. \u201cYou ask yourself if you\u2019re in love. You\u2019re not asking the right question.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed bitterly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the right question?\u201d</p><p>Nick pressed a finger onto the table. \u201cWould you bust him out of prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane answered immediately.</p><p>Nick sat back, eyebrows climbing high. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said again. He poured another glass, gritting his teeth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him make it to a cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that not enough?\u201d</p><p>Zane glared. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re the team mother or whatever, but stop. I\u2019m not part of your team.\u201d</p><p>Nick tilted his head. \u201cYou are now. And I know if Ty were here, he wouldn\u2019t want to see you like this.\u201d</p><p>Zane slammed a hand on the table and grabbed Nick\u2019s shirt collar. \u201cWell Ty\u2019s not here!\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t retaliate or try to break his hold. He just put a hand on Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo help me find him. And I\u2019ll help you break him out of jail.\u201d</p><p>Zane wanted to lash out, to shout again or to shove him away. But it was nearly impossible to remain angry and sullen under Nick\u2019s calming influence. Besides, Ty needed them. He let go of Nick\u2019s shirt and sat back. Nick reached slowly for the bottle, giving Zane a chance to stop him; Zane shook his head and stood up, running both hands through his hair. \u201cJust put it where I can\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>Liam cleared his throat loudly. \u201cNow that that crisis has passed, can we focus here?\u201d</p><p>Zane glowered at him, but Liam merely leered in return.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we can narrow it down,\u201d Digger said. He took out his combat knife and gouged a deep line across the table. \u201cThis is the canal. When the levees broke, the barges in the canal and the storm surge took out most of the houses alongside it. What\u2019s left in these first few blocks,\u201d he said, slashing the table into a grid, \u201cis nothing but empty lots or rebuilt homes.\u201d</p><p>Zane studied the grid closer. \u201cSo we can narrow it down.\u201d</p><p>Digger nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be near the canal then, nor would it be near businesses or large thoroughfares,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Digger scratched his cheek with the large knife, then marked the approximate areas Zane had mentioned. \u201cAlso, most of the houses with no one living in them will still have markings on the sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of markings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spray-painted X. Little markings in each quadrant. They were used when rescue crews went through the houses to show when they were there, which crew it was, what sort of dangers there were. And the body count.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, wincing. He remembered Ty talking about the rescue efforts he and others had been involved in after Hurricane Katrina hit. He couldn\u2019t quite wrap his mind around the horrors.</p><p>\u201cSome of those houses still have their markings. Means the owners haven\u2019t been able to return to rebuild. Or they ain\u2019t coming back. We find a marked house with a vehicle near it, I guarandamntee you that\u2019s our spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can find him,\u201d Owen said. He was standing behind Digger\u2019s chair, unable to sit still.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if they have him,\u201d Nick said. \u201cIf the Colombians got him first, he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he got away, he\u2019s sitting in a casino, drinking a cocktail in front of a security camera,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, our only avenue is to search for him here,\u201d Liam said, tapping the table. \u201cIf he\u2019s dead, we\u2019re no use to him. And if he\u2019s sitting somewhere safe, he\u2019s no use to us.\u201d</p><p>Nick tucked his gun into the back of his jeans. \u201cSo we go to the Lower Ninth Ward and split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the hell we will,\u201d Owen growled. He pointed at Liam. \u201cLast time we split up, this bastard ran away, Doc got shot, and Grady disappeared. We stay together.\u201d</p><p>Nick studied him for a long moment and finally nodded. \u201cWe need a plan if we find the place. How do we take it?\u201d</p><p>Zane gripped the back of a chair. \u201cShock and awe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to explain?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Zane nodded and locked eyes with Liam \u201cI want it. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Liam raised both eyebrows and sat forward. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour jacket is armored and your boots are for riding. Where\u2019s your bike?\u201d</p><p>Ty worked the ropes at his wrists as Gaudet and his son argued, taking fast, shallow breaths, trying desperately to fake an allergic reaction.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he finally croaked. He shook his shoulders from side to side. \u201cGet these ropes . . . off my chest . . . so I can fucking breathe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say,\u201d Shine growled. \u201cLet him die, what\u2019s the problem? We\u2019re going to kill him anyway!\u201d</p><p>Gaudet smacked Shine on the side of the head. \u201cI need information before I can let him kick off. Where\u2019s that doohickey Ava gave you?\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned. A woman scorned was nothing to mess with. He\u2019d remember that if he lived.</p><p>Shine began to dig in his pockets. \u201cShe found it in his room at the bar,\u201d he said, pulling out one of the EpiPens.</p><p>\u201cShoot him with it,\u201d Gaudet ordered.</p><p>\u201cOh hell no,\u201d Ty gasped. He shook his head violently as Shine turned the cylinder over and frowned at it. \u201cMight as well . . . let him loose . . . with a Ginsu!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully particular for someone who\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>Shine put his hand on Ty\u2019s shoulder and flicked the cap off the EpiPen cylinder. He pulled it back, preparing to stab it right into Ty\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Ty wheezed. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t inject . . . adrenaline . . . right into my heart. You dumb fuck!\u201d</p><p>Shine turned it over in his hand and glanced at his father, who rolled his eyes. \u201cLet me have it. You got to take it out of the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you just stab it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just the case, boy. Let me have it.\u201d Gaudet took it from Shine and slid the EpiPen from its case.</p><p>\u201cBlue end,\u201d Ty told him.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t a needle,\u201d Shine muttered. \u201cLet\u2019s just give him a sack to breathe in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis throat\u2019s closing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we put a hole in his throat and he can breathe again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstructions . . . on it!\u201d Ty managed. \u201cFlip the blue . . . jab the orange . . . hold it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Gaudet turned it over and tapped it.</p><p>Ty took a deep, rasping breath.</p><p>\u201cFuck it, untie one of his hands,\u201d Gaudet finally ordered.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Gaudet nodded, and Shine pulled a large hunting knife from a sheath at his thigh. He waved the knife in Ty\u2019s face. \u201cTry anything, I\u2019ll gut you.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded jerkily. Shine cut through the rope around his left wrist and stepped back. Gaudet handed him the EpiPen. He flipped the end and gripped it tight, raising it above his thigh to jam it in. But instead of his own thigh, he swung his arm out and jabbed the injector into Gaudet\u2019s chest.</p><p>The man stumbled back, pawing at the EpiPen. Shine followed, taking his arm to steady him.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s gonna do so many bad things to your heart,\u201d Ty said as he began laughing. He reached across his lap to pull at the rope that bound his right hand.</p><p>Shine yanked the EpiPen out. He threw it to the ground and it shattered as it skidded across the floor. Gaudet grabbed at his chest, doubling over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s having a heart attack, Shine,\u201d Ty said, his voice low and urgent. \u201cBetter get him out of here, Shine.\u201d</p><p>Shine rounded on him, the knife clutched in his huge hand. \u201cI\u2019m gonna make you bleed, Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll bury me right beside your daddy, bubba!\u201d</p> <p>Shine hesitated, and behind him, Gaudet was taking deep breaths and clutching at his chest. He waved his hand at Shine, as if telling him to go ahead and kill Ty. Shine held the knife close to his body and gripped Ty\u2019s shoulder, preparing to stick him, but Ty grabbed Shine\u2019s biceps, locking his elbow as Shine pushed forward. He gritted his teeth and put every ounce of strength he had into keeping that knife at bay, but he hadn\u2019t managed to loosen his other arm, his feet were still bound to the chair, and Shine was laughing at him, pushing the tip inexorably closer to Ty\u2019s chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to push forward to hurt Ty. He could have sliced at Ty\u2019s forearm to loosen his grip. He could have wrenched away and come from behind to slit his throat. He could have easily killed him in so many ways, but Shine continued to push against him instead, forcing Ty to fight for his life. Ty\u2019s fingers worked frantically at the loose ropes on his other wrist. With his feet tied, he couldn\u2019t get any leverage. Shine laughed. He was enjoying the slow march of death as Ty lost the battle.</p><p>The knife touched the material of Ty\u2019s shirt and he shouted wordlessly, digging deep for more strength where he knew he would find none. Fighting for his life against a man who merely wanted to play with it.</p><p>The knife broke skin. Ty pushed back against the chair, desperate for more inches. His life didn\u2019t flash before his eyes. His evil deeds didn\u2019t come back to haunt him, nor did any of the good he\u2019d done revisit him. He didn\u2019t find added strength in thoughts of the future or memories of the past. He didn\u2019t see his family, or his teammates, or the faces of men he\u2019d comforted as they\u2019d died. The only face he saw as the knife bit into him was Zane\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d</p> <p>Ty cried out again. He didn\u2019t know where Zane\u2019s voice had come from, but he pushed harder against Shine\u2019s arm, desperate to hear it again.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>An engine revved somewhere close. Shine pulled back, his head shooting up at the sound.</p><p>Gaudet had finally recovered from the rush of epinephrine and adrenaline enough to hit Shine in the back. \u201cDo him!\u201d</p><p>The engine grew louder, drawing closer. Ty could hear it both outside the thin walls and in his ear. The ear bud Shine had missed was still there. It had been buzzing in Ty\u2019s ear all this time, and now it was picking up the roaring of an angry motorcycle.</p><p>Ty craned his head and saw the rider through the dirty front window, barreling toward the house through a field of weeds and brush. It was an off-white cruiser with a hulking rider sheathed in black leather and a skullcap-style helmet, face covered with a pair of sunglasses and a black bandana with a white skull printed on it.</p> <p>Ty caught his breath, staring out the window as the rider pointed a gun toward the house. Gaudet and Shine seemed to be trying to decide between fight and flight. \u201cIts rider was named Death,\u201d Ty told them, beginning to smile. Gunshots shattered the hinges and panels of the rickety front door and continued to rain down on the occupants of the room. \u201cAnd Hell followed with him!\u201d Ty shouted as both men dove to the floor, covering their heads.</p><p>Splinters and shards of bullets flew through the air. Shine and his father both scrambled to the corners of the room, covering themselves. Ty brought his hand up to shield his eyes as the motorcycle burst through the ruined door, screaming into the room and tearing up the floorboards and remnants of carpet as it went. The rider put a foot down and caused the back wheel of the motorcycle to slide around, chewing up the wood and shooting shrapnel at the men cowering on the floor.</p><p>Ty gaped at the reflective surface of the sunglasses. The rider tossed him a small knife\u2014Zane, it was Zane\u2014and Ty barely managed to overcome his shock to catch it. He sliced through his ropes and struggled out of the chair. Zane held his gun up and ejected the empty magazine onto the floor. He\u2019d used all his ammunition busting through the door and had nothing left to finish the job.</p><p>Gaudet and Shine scrambled for their weapons. Ty lunged forward, taking Zane\u2019s hand and swinging onto the back of the bike.</p><p>He held on tight and pressed his face into the man\u2019s back as the motorcycle took off and darted out of the house.</p><p>Gunshots chased them, but the motorcycle was too fast for their pursuers. Ty\u2019s grip tightened, his hand clutching at the edges of the leather jacket, the same black leather jacket he\u2019d given Zane years ago.</p><p>They took several twists and turns through the ruin of the neighborhood, then the bike slowed and Ty was able to lift his head. Soon they reached an empty intersection, and Ty saw the men of Sidewinder converging ahead.</p><p>The motorcycle pulled to a stop beside a nondescript gray van and an old Cutlass sedan, where the other men were gathered, armed and ready.</p> <p>Ty rested his head against Zane\u2019s back, breathing hard and still shaking with adrenaline. He nodded at the others, who simply stood there and grinned.</p><p>Zane reached up and pulled the bandana down. Ty tilted sideways to pull Zane\u2019s sunglasses off, then patted his cheek. Zane nodded and turned his head away without saying a word.</p><p>The others came closer, all of them grinning like fools.</p><p>\u201cWicked jailbreak, Garrett,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cThat was some shit right there,\u201d Digger shouted, and he held his fist up for Zane to bump it. Even Owen offered him a slap on the shoulder.</p><p>Nick took Ty\u2019s arm and helped him off the back of the bike. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn surgery. We don\u2019t know anything, we had to leave him.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard as relief flooded him. Behind Nick, Liam stood with Ava near the van. She was tied up, a bandana around her mouth to keep her quiet. Ty looked back at Nick.</p><p>\u201cWe were going to trade her for you if we had to. Zane was searching when he heard you.\u201d</p><p>Ty stepped away, turning to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. Zane stared at him, his face as impassive as the carved angels in St. Louis Cemetery. Ty wanted to say so many things to him, but they didn\u2019t have time. And from Zane\u2019s expression, he didn\u2019t want to hear them anyway.</p><p>Ty walked over to Liam and Ava instead. Ava flinched from him when he reached up to take the bandana out of her mouth, and Ty belatedly saw the bruise forming on her cheekbone. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glared at him as he pulled the bandana down.</p><p>\u201cDid you call him?\u201d Ty asked, voice pitched low.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Before she could explain, Ty stuffed the bandana back in. She thrashed her head, but Liam held her still as Ty tightened it and silenced her. Then he turned on Liam, who grinned and patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat bruise your handiwork?\u201d</p><p>Liam rolled his eyes. \u201cShe grassed us out. And she may still have got the doc killed. So don\u2019t cry to me, Argentina, she got what she deserved.\u201d</p><p>He moved to pass Ty, but Ty stopped him with a hand on his chest. \u201cWe all get what we deserve,\u201d Ty whispered in his ear.</p><p>Liam cocked his head, mere inches from his face. Then he sniffed and pushed past him. Ty took Ava by the arm and pulled her with him, pointing in the direction of the house he\u2019d been held at. \u201cYour daddy is that way. Start walking.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes glared at him, but she jutted her chin out and started off down the crumbling road without looking back.</p><p>\u201cYou sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cKeeping her around would be like trying to keep a raccoon in a cage. You\u2019ll end up bloody. With rabies.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled and climbed into the van. Ty looked to Zane again, feeling his chest growing tighter. Liam stepped up to Zane, breaking the eye contact between them before Ty could say anything. He held up a hand, grasping Zane\u2019s and pulling in closer to hug him. \u201cYou\u2019ll do all right, mate! Bloody hell!\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s attention was still on Zane when Liam turned back to him. Liam gave him a shove. \u201cHe deserves a bit more than your usual rescue blowjob, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Ty tore his eyes away from Zane.</p><p>Liam grinned widely. \u201cYou don\u2019t give it to him, darling, I sure as hell will.\u201d</p><p>Ty swung at him before he\u2019d thought it through, before it registered that Liam\u2019s words had made him angry. Possessive. Jealous as hell. His punch didn\u2019t land flush, though, because Liam leaned away and blocked Ty\u2019s hand. He wrapped Ty\u2019s arm up and twisted it, pulling Ty sideways toward him.</p><p>Ty grunted and arched his back as Liam torqued his arm and shoulder. Liam put his lips to Ty\u2019s ear, and when he spoke it was in whispered Russian. \u201cNow, now, darling, wouldn\u2019t want you getting hurt in a fight for a man you\u2019ve already lost.\u201d</p><p>Ty managed to land a jab to his midsection before Liam shoved him away as if Ty were some untrained drunken brawler.</p><p>Liam waved a hand at Zane. \u201cNow give me back my motorbike before I knock you off it.\u201d</p><p>Zane sat in the passenger seat of the van as Digger drove. He didn\u2019t know where Sidewinder had found the various vehicles they\u2019d driven to the Ninth Ward, only that Owen claimed they had \u201cpermanently borrowed\u201d the van from the rental place near the French Quarter. He didn\u2019t care. His mind was roiling now that they\u2019d pulled off the rescue.</p><p>He kept seeing Ty tied down to that chair, at the mercy of a large hunting knife wielded by an even larger man. He kept hearing Ty\u2019s desperate cry of \u201cZane!\u201d ringing in his ears. He\u2019d forgotten all the anger, all the hurt and humiliation, forgiven it in a heartbeat when he\u2019d thought Ty might be taken from him.</p><p>But now it was all flooding back, and the way Ty stared at him, his eyes flat and lifeless, his jaw set in a hard line, made Zane cold all over. They couldn\u2019t even say they were back at square one, because now there was so much betrayal and anger between them, Zane could feel the chasm widening.</p><p>Nick\u2019s words echoed in Zane\u2019s ears. What the hell kind of person had Ty been that even Nick was afraid of him?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s got a phone?\u201d Ty asked. He was sitting in the middle of the bench seat, between Owen and Nick.</p><p>Zane shifted in his seat to look back at him. \u201cWho are you calling?\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, barely meeting Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cBurns. Even he can\u2019t save my job now, but at least he can get us out.\u201d</p><p>Zane locked eyes with him, knowing what that would mean, knowing that a life without his job, without a purpose, was one of Ty\u2019s biggest fears. Nick\u2019s warning echoed again. What would Ty turn into without a purpose, without that anchor? He nodded, though. It was their last resort.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Ty\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cThis is out of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey blew a cat at me!\u201d Ty shouted. \u201cSomeone give me your phone!\u201d</p><p>Zane handed his to Ty. \u201cPut it on speaker,\u201d he requested.</p><p>\u201cYou promise you won\u2019t say anything to him?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear to me, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever, I pinky swear, just call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I missed an episode of a television show here,\u201d Owen said.</p><p>\u201cBlew a cat at you?\u201d Nick asked, though he sounded like he didn\u2019t really want the answer.</p><p>Ty muttered that he\u2019d explain later and dialed Richard Burns\u2019s number. He pressed the speaker button and held the phone out, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cRichard Burns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy Easter, kiddo. How\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2014 I\u2019ve gotten into something deep, I need help.\u201d</p><p>Burns was silent a few breaths. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett\u2019s with me. So are the Sidewinder boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Tyler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse. Liam Bell is here with a pink slip with our names on it. The Vega cartel has sniffed us both out, and someone somewhere told them we\u2019d be here this weekend.\u201d</p><p>They heard him moving, closing a door and coughing. \u201cHow did anyone know you\u2019d be there? Why are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was last minute, we didn\u2019t even know we\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a mole, someone on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir, but that\u2019s not my concern right now. The police commander here has me pegged as a CI that gave him fits five years ago; he\u2019s trying to kill me. He\u2019s got us locked down. The agent we tried to contact for extraction was dirty. I don\u2019t . . . we can\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p>Burns didn\u2019t respond for a tense moment. Ty licked his lips, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grady,\u201d Burns finally said, his voice stern and professional. \u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at the phone, his mouth falling open. Zane\u2019s heart raced. Richard Burns was like a father to Ty. There were photos of the man holding Ty as a baby on Mara Grady\u2019s wall.</p><p>\u201cUncle Dick . . . we\u2019re going to die down here,\u201d Ty said, hoarse and pleading. \u201cPlease help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Ty,\u201d Burns whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re too far out. Good luck, son.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call, leaving Ty holding the phone in a hand that had begun to tremble.</p><p>Ty hadn\u2019t said a word since his call with Burns, and Nick wasn\u2019t sure they were going to pull Ty back from the brink in time to save any of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Digger had taken them through several shortcuts and odd turns and finally back into the French Quarter. Road blocks had cropped up everywhere, and there was no way for the group to get out now. If they were going to escape New Orleans, they would have to split up to do so. And none of them were willing to do that.</p><p>They headed for the last place Ty knew to go. He said it was his former boss\u2019s home, the man who\u2019d been murdered before they arrived in New Orleans. Arthur Murdoch had no family left, and his house would probably still be vacant. He had resided in the Trem\u00e9, a historical black neighborhood that bordered the other side of Rampart Street, across from the French Quarter.</p><p>They arrived at Murdoch\u2019s house and sat on it for an hour to watch it for surveillance. When they found it clear, they dumped the van nearby, where it was unlikely to be found any time soon. And if it was found, it would simply serve to point their pursuers away from the neighborhood. As they made their way back to Murdoch\u2019s house, Nick got the impression the area was usually a lively place, though it was run-down and in disrepair. It was also dead quiet after all the shooting on Rampart earlier.</p> <p>They all crowded around Murdoch\u2019s living room, stretched out on the couch, hovering on the arms of the chairs, and sitting around the tiny dining table.</p><p>\u201cHe left you in the wind?\u201d Liam asked in patent disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Nick asked Ty.</p><p>Ty\u2019s jaw tightened and he stood, pacing away from the rest of them. Nick watched Zane and Liam, who were sitting at the table. Both men looked worried and defeated.</p><p>\u201cHey, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had to rely on our own devices, right?\u201d Nick tried. He looked over at Ty, who still had his back to them, staring at a wall full of photographs and artwork. Ty was in several of those photos, arm around a grandfatherly black man in a Panama hat. \u201cTy?\u201d</p> <p>When Ty turned, he looked like a different person. His eyes had gone hard and flat, his mouth set in a thin line. All the humor and charisma that made Ty Grady who he was had disappeared, replaced by the soulless, lifeless person the military had battered them all into. They had been trained to morph into that person when they needed to act without emotion. Nick hadn\u2019t seen that look since they\u2019d come home. It had always ended in blood. It sent a shiver down his spine.</p><p>\u201cI need a few minutes,\u201d Ty said, then he stalked through the room and out the front door.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s that,\u201d Liam sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cThe only things Tyler\u2019s ever understood were loyalty, honor, and orders. His entire life has been devoted to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zane growled.</p> <p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d Liam shook his head. \u201cBecause I think if you did, you\u2019d be a little more frightened right now. Do you know what happens to people like Ty when they realize everything they\u2019ve been living for has been a con?\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Nick quickly, then back at Liam. Nick lowered his head and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen a trained dog that\u2019s always been kept on a leash?\u201d Liam asked after a few moments of tense silence. \u201cOnly released when the order to kill was given?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked up. Zane was staring at Liam, grim.</p><p>No one answered. Liam sat straighter. \u201cHave you ever seen what one of those dogs will do once no one\u2019s giving it orders?\u201d</p><p>Zane sniffed and ran a hand over his face. He nodded, staring at the darkened window. \u201cNot a goddamned thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Liam said in disgust. \u201cHe won\u2019t even eat unless someone tells him to. He curls up and starves without his master.\u201d He stood and grabbed his jacket.</p><p>Nick scowled as Liam pulled on the coat. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Ing. Leaving.\u201d He pointed toward the door. \u201cThat is not the man I knew ten years ago. He\u2019s not even half the man I knew. And now look at him. His heart\u2019s broken, Dick Burns has betrayed him, and he\u2019s getting his men shot left and right. He\u2019s done. And I for one don\u2019t intend to follow him into the hereafter.\u201d</p><p>Nick lunged to his feet, shaking with anger. If they knew half the things he and Ty had done, half the sacrifices Ty had made to see orders through, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy to sneer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Liam grunted. He waved a hand at Nick. \u201cDon\u2019t defend him. Jesus, it was hard enough watching you two circle-jerk in service, I don\u2019t need to see it now.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the door, still shaking his head. When he yanked the door open, a hand reached out and grabbed him by the throat. Liam didn\u2019t have time to react or defend himself before Ty shoved him back into the room. Nick and Zane both lunged to their feet.</p><p>Liam kicked out, but instead of dropping back and defending like Ty often did, he attacked. He used Liam\u2019s leg and then shoulder for leverage, kicking up, wrapping a leg around Liam\u2019s neck and twisting and rolling to slam him to the floor. The entire house seemed to shake when they hit. Then Ty was on Liam, his knee in Liam\u2019s solar plexus, his hand on Liam\u2019s throat again in an iron grip. Liam kicked and flailed, grasping. Ty easily avoided every attempt he made to free himself.</p><p>\u201cThis trained dog\u2019s still got a few tricks up his sleeve,\u201d Ty snarled.</p><p>Liam made a gurgling noise and kicked his feet against the battered hardwood floor, trying to get leverage. He smacked at Ty\u2019s face. The veins in Ty\u2019s arm jumped as he squeezed Liam harder.</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d Nick shouted, the same voice he\u2019d used to relay orders. \u201cLet him up.\u201d</p><p>Ty squeezed just long enough for Liam to start clawing at his head. Then he released him, grabbing him by his jacket collar and lifting his shoulders off the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re in this until the end,\u201d he hissed. \u201cIs that understood?\u201d</p><p>Liam grasped at Ty\u2019s wrists, gulping for air. He nodded. \u201cAs long as you can still do that to someone like me? I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Ty released him and stood. They all stared at him with wide eyes. \u201cTime to stop waiting for the cavalry.\u201d</p><p>A grin slowly overtook Nick, and he sat back down and put his hand over his mouth to hide it. That was the Ty Grady he remembered, the one a lost eighteen-year-old from Boston had fallen in awe of.</p><p>He wondered if Zane was seeing the same thing.</p><p>Zane\u2019s arms were crossed and his eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d he asked Ty.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m in a room with some of the smartest, most devious assholes I\u2019ve ever known. If we can\u2019t slither our way out of this, then we don\u2019t deserve our titles.\u201d Ty nodded at Owen and Digger, then at Nick. Nick smiled.</p><p>Liam began to sit up, but Ty put a foot on his shoulder and shoved him back to the floor. A ghost of a smile crossed Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cRight now we have two enemies, after two different things, who\u2019ve joined forces,\u201d Liam rasped. He shoved at Ty\u2019s foot. \u201cWe need to pit them against one another. Will you get off me!\u201d</p><p>Ty stepped away, smirking at Liam as he pushed himself off the floor and brushed himself off.</p><p>Owen stood from where he\u2019d been lounging on the couch. \u201cWhat if we give them what they want?\u201d</p><p>Ty sat down hard in the chair Liam had vacated, across the table from Zane. \u201cI\u2019d rather not die in this plan.\u201d</p><p>Owen held up a hand. \u201cThey think you\u2019re Tyler Beaumont, right? Ex-military, wandering performer, hired henchman. CI important enough for the FBI to try to save.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWho\u2019s to say you weren\u2019t hired to off someone?\u201d</p><p>Ty cut his eyes toward Nick, not yet willing to say he wasn\u2019t following but obviously not following any more than Nick was. Nick shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd Garrett,\u201d Owen continued, \u201che could be a dirty Fed, still be part of the cartel crowd.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a look over the table. Both men still seemed confused.</p><p>Digger leaned over and put both hands on his head. \u201cJohns, I swear to baby Jesus, if you don\u2019t start making sense, I\u2019m gonna kick you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Owen insisted. \u201cBell contacts the cartel, tells them Garrett, or whatever name you used, wants a meet with them. Follow?\u201d</p><p>The room was silent.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you . . . draw it in a chart or something?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cLook, Garrett\u2019s a dirty Fed. Liam\u2019s a hired gun. They\u2019re both after Ty, who is a dirty rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Owen flopped his hands. \u201cWell, you were!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted, but I am no longer after Ty,\u201d Liam added. \u201cTurned the job down, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails. Garrett has Grady, wants to trade him in for safe passage to Miami, and Bell tells the cartel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say that the first time?\u201d Liam grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want safe passage to Miami,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not being literal, Garrett, Jesus Christ,\u201d Ty snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grady, I have a hard time thinking like an asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe means getting back in good with the cartel. Or getting out clean, what the fuck ever. Would your cover still fly with them? Could you go in as a compromised agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said, nodding slowly. \u201cI was there two years ago. The story was I got out of prison. When they pulled me, though, I just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Ty tapped the table. \u201cThat was right around the same time de la Vega was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would know,\u201d Zane mumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he found out you were a Fed, turned you, and gave you a job to do in the Bureau. You left to do it right before he was offed, and ever since, you\u2019ve been looking for the man who killed him. Will that work?\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at Ty for several seconds before nodding. \u201cThey\u2019ll be suspicious. Going in and admitting I\u2019m a Fed, that . . . that might actually work. Yeah. Yeah, I can work with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Zane calls up the cartel boys,\u201d Nick drawled, \u201ctells them he\u2019s their long lost buddy, and he\u2019s got the man who killed big papi?\u201d</p><p>Digger made a clicking sound with his tongue. \u201cSo far, all I\u2019m seeing is Garrett handing Grady over to the people who already want him dead and telling them more reasons why he should be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re not the only people who want him dead,\u201d Owen said.</p><p>\u201cYou want to play a fiddle game where Ty is the fiddle?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d Ty shook his head. \u201cThe fiddle dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with it,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cThe fiddle is usually an object,\u201d Digger said. \u201cWhat the fuck kind of messed up fiddle game you been playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Owen said quickly. \u201cWe make the cartel believe Ty is the one they want, not Zane. And then we call up Papa Gaudet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho obviously wants to talk to me before killing me,\u201d Ty added.</p><p>\u201cRight. And we tell him when and where the cartel plans to acquire and kill Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve, in theory, pitted Gaudet against the cartel.\u201d Nick winced. \u201cThat\u2019s banking on Gaudet still wanting information from Ty badly enough to keep him alive. And hoping they\u2019ll fight over him instead of just teaming up to make him dead.\u201d</p><p>Owen\u2019s shoulders slumped and he sat back down. \u201cTrue. I wouldn\u2019t want those odds if I was the fiddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the fiddle game!\u201d Digger shouted.</p><p>Ty sat silent, resting his chin in his hand and scowling. His knee began to bounce as he examined the floor. Finally, he waved his hand and sat up straighter. \u201cSo we give them what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Dead?\u201d Zane asked incredulously.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the two sides to wipe each other out, we don\u2019t need them to fight. We just need them to think they succeeded. So we get them both there. Zane brings me in, and he kills me in front of all of them. Their problem is gone so they\u2019ll clear out, and bonus points, they\u2019re no longer after Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell is that a good plan when it involves me killing you?\u201d Zane shouted.</p><p>Ty put a finger to his lips and shook his head. \u201cThere is a small glitch, I\u2019ll admit.\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed at the stubble on his chin as the idea became clear. \u201cWe put you in Digger\u2019s vest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, that\u2019s risky,\u201d Digger whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s only NIJ II level protection. If Garrett\u2019s close enough to make sure someone doesn\u2019t take a head shot, he\u2019d be too close for the vest; the bullet could go right through. And if it don\u2019t go through, it\u2019s definitely fucking him up. Broken ribs, sternum, maybe organ damage.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cNot if Zane\u2019s shooting a blank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019d look real, there\u2019d be no impact,\u201d Ty said, but he was sitting forward, warming to the idea. \u201cBut if the real shot is taken from further away . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sniper?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty gave him a curt nod. \u201cIt\u2019d have to be a long-ass way. One, to make sure he\u2019s not spotted during the meet, and two, make sure it doesn\u2019t kill me. NIJ II is . . . 1,100 to 1,800 feet per second.\u201d</p><p>Nick groaned and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re talking eight-hundred, maybe a thousand yards before a sniper round drops to that velocity. Or more. I know I can\u2019t make that shot with enough accuracy to hit a vest with my best friend in it.\u201d</p><p>Ty met Nick\u2019s eyes and nodded. Nick\u2019s heart jumped into his throat. He gave a slight shake of his head, silently pleading with him not to ask. Ty smiled sadly, then met Liam\u2019s eyes. Liam began to grin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh fuck no,\u201d Zane blurted. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can make it,\u201d Ty assured him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but will he, is the question.\u201d</p> <p>Liam grinned wider. \u201cDo you trust me not to hit your heart, Grady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane hissed, reaching for his arm.</p><p>Ty tore his eyes away from Liam and met Zane\u2019s. \u201cI swore to protect you from them,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI was already willing to take a bullet to do that. After everything that\u2019s happened . . .\u201d He shook his head, unable to finish.</p><p>Zane looked stricken, and he wasn\u2019t able to form words before Ty looked away.</p><p>Liam was rubbing his hands together. \u201cLet\u2019s go practice!\u201d</p> <p>Nick slumped in his chair and rubbed his hands over his face. \u201cThis is a horrible plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we get too excited, where the hell would we set up this meet?\u201d Digger asked. \u201cWe\u2019d need an open area free of bystanders, with somewhere high enough to clear a line of sight. There\u2019s nowhere in the city like that.\u201d</p><p>Liam thumped his back against the wall and sighed. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>The room fell silent.</p><p>\u201cThe river?\u201d Owen suggested.</p><p>Liam made a derogatory noise. \u201cWith the wind and distance, there\u2019s no way in hell. And if you cut the distance and make it a ferry, that\u2019s even worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe amusement park,\u201d Ty said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d Liam laughed. \u201cThere are way too many variables. Crowds, ride interference, not to mention security as you try to walk in with a very large weapon.\u201d</p><p>But Ty was shaking his head. \u201cThe Six Flags park was drowned by Katrina. They never reopened it. You can see the roller coaster from Interstate 510.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rides and stuff are still there?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cFor the most part, yeah. It\u2019s completely deserted, only patrolled by a private security company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could work,\u201d Nick said. \u201cRoller coasters in the air, wide thoroughfares laid out in a predictable fashion, no bystanders, and plenty of cover if things go to shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you draw a map of it?\u201d Liam asked Ty.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I look like, an Etch A Sketch? I don\u2019t know the layout.\u201d</p> <p>Zane stood and went to his suitcase, digging through it to bring out an iPad. \u201cIf it was ever on the internet, I\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>Nick rested his elbows on his knees. \u201cWe\u2019re really doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you can see another way that doesn\u2019t involve a full-blown war,\u201d Ty said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost Doc; we won\u2019t make it out alive if we go toe-to-toe.\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent, nodding.</p><p>Ty sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need some supplies. We might as well start now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need fake blood,\u201d Nick said. \u201cLots of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can do that.\u201d Digger hopped to his feet and grinned, rubbing his hands together.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a mom-and-pop store down on the corner,\u201d Ty said. \u201cThe back door only has bars for security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need something for camouflage too,\u201d Nick told him.</p><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo peppers!\u201d Ty added urgently.</p><p>\u201cAll right with your damn peppers! One little anaphylactic episode and he\u2019s freaking out about the peppers.\u201d</p><p>Digger turned to get his jacket, and Owen began to gather his things as well.</p><p>\u201cOwen,\u201d Ty said. Owen turned, and Ty shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? No one should go anywhere alone right now.\u201d</p><p>Ty winced. \u201cQuite frankly, he\u2019s the only one who can walk around in this neighborhood and not stand out.\u201d</p><p>Digger poked a finger in Ty\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s racist.\u201d Ty rolled his eyes. Digger smacked his cheek gently. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I still love you, hillbilly.\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave, a hop in his step. Nick didn\u2019t know if it was the prospect of action or of cooking up fake blood that made Digger so happy. And frankly, he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>Liam thumped his bag of supplies down on the coffee table, and everyone looked to the door, where Digger\u2019s canvas bag sat.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to go through his fun bag?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>\u201cGuarantee you he has it booby-trapped,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Ty and Owen shared a glance. Nick held out his fist and the other two followed suit. \u201cTwo out of three.\u201d</p><p>Ty slapped Owen on the arm. \u201cClose your eyes, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a tell at Rock, Paper, Scissors?\u201d</p><p>Ty and Nick both nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you tell me ten years later? You\u2019re both assholes!\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled from across the room, but Liam walked away in disgust. \u201cYou\u2019re all bloody idiots.\u201d</p><p>Zane lay on one side of the full-sized guest bed, unable to sleep as the plans for the next day ran through his analytical mind. There was so much that could go wrong. Too much. People would probably die tomorrow. He might be one of them. Ty might be one of them.</p><p>Ty had set up a staggered watch so no one would be on together too long. He obviously didn\u2019t trust Liam, but with a man down, they had to use him. Zane could hear the occasional creak of steps as Digger and Liam moved about, taking their turns.</p><p>Owen and Nick had argued over going to the hospital to check on Kelly. Nick insisted there was no way to connect Kelly to them, and the best way to keep him safe was to stay away from him. Owen seemed almost desperate to get news, though, and Zane\u2019s heart went out to all of them. Not knowing if Kelly was alive or dead had to be driving them all crazy. Nick and Owen had moved to the larger bedroom, still arguing, leaving Ty and Zane to share this tiny bed in awkward, weighted silence. Ty had retreated to the shower with very little to say, and Zane had crawled into bed with a heavy heart and mind.</p><p>Now, Ty curled in the bed beside him. His back was to Zane and he had a pillow over his head so it was impossible to even see him. But Zane watched him anyway in the moonlight that filtered through the window.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get over the fact that he\u2019d met Ty years ago. An introduction so fleeting he hadn\u2019t even remembered what Ty looked like. When tragedy had struck Zane\u2019s life, that simple meeting had influenced him in ways he had never truly pondered. Ty had done that, touched his life even before he knew him.</p><p>Ty had said it was fate. But Zane didn\u2019t believe in fate.</p><p>Zane reached across the bed and poked him.</p><p>Ty jerked, and the pillow moved as he raised his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know he was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked. He rolled enough to be able to see Zane.</p><p>\u201cLiam. You hallucinated him in the hospital before you found the note in my pocket. So how\u2019d you know he was here?\u201d</p><p>Ty settled onto his back, rubbing at his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you have, Ty. You think about everything.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at Zane.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know he was here?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s focus drifted until it was on the wall over Zane\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou think it was magic, don\u2019t you? Voodoo. Fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ty sighed and pushed the pillow away. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in any of it, so what does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in you,\u201d Zane whispered. Ty looked at him sharply. \u201cI believe you used to be one scary son of a bitch, Ty. Everything I\u2019ve been told, the glimpses I\u2019ve seen from you. What I\u2019ve heard from Miami.\u201d</p><p>Ty was hoarse when he spoke. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you put that person behind you because you hated him. Because it scared you.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard and snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a coward, Ty. I know what it takes to scare you. And I think the thing you\u2019re afraid of more than anything in the world is yourself. But when Richard Burns told you I was in trouble, you brought that man back out. For me.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at the ceiling, unwilling or unable to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. He was holding his breath, and as Zane\u2019s eyes adjusted to the dark, he could see Ty trembling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still do it again,\u201d Ty finally whispered.</p><p>Goose bumps rose all over Zane\u2019s body. He wondered what it would be like to see the man Ty was so frightened of showing him. He could see Ty closing off, so he switched directions. \u201cWhen did you learn to speak Russian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam said something to you today. He spoke in Russian.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed. \u201cI can understand it okay but I can\u2019t speak it. I could never get the hang of it. He tried to teach me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Ty licked his lips, staring at the ceiling. \u201cHe told me there was no use in getting hurt in a fight for a man I\u2019d lost.\u201d</p><p>Zane pushed onto his elbow, his eyes raking over the shadows that made up Ty\u2019s face. \u201cHe\u2019s you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d A frown marred his features. \u201cHe\u2019s what you were like ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a shaky breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard Burns gave me a cause.\u201d He closed his eyes and turned his head away.</p><p>Zane fell silent, trying to connect the new pieces of the man in front of him. Nick had said the only thing keeping Ty on the ground was a sense of purpose. A cause. Now that Burns had turned his back on him, what would happen to Ty when this was over? Would he spiral away? Zane remembered the piece of silver Ty had melted down for him, the anchor etched into it. Pain and fear flooded him, squeezing his chest.</p><p>The only thing he could make of it was that, tomorrow, Ty intended to risk a bullet to the chest for him. Zane wanted to shake him, to scream at him. As angry as he had been, as willing to walk away as he\u2019d thought he was, the thought of never finding all these pieces to the puzzle, of losing Ty now, setting Ty adrift in that big sea of his mind, was terrifying.</p><p>Zane reached out, sliding his hand over Ty\u2019s waist beneath the covers. Ty tensed under his fingers, but Zane scooted into the neutral territory of the bed anyway, wrapping his arm over Ty\u2019s waist, pulling himself closer. He shoved his face against Ty\u2019s cheek and inhaled deeply. Ty\u2019s shoulder was rigid against him.</p><p>But then, Ty reached up for him. His fingers brushed through Zane\u2019s hair. His hand was cool against Zane\u2019s skin when he placed it on Zane\u2019s ribs.</p><p>He pushed his forehead against Zane\u2019s lips. Zane kissed his skin. \u201cYou\u2019re still,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cThat means you\u2019re expending so much energy worrying, your body doesn\u2019t need to fidget.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed, but it was a hollow sound. \u201cI love that you know that about me,\u201d he said sadly. His fingers tightened against Zane\u2019s back. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make this better, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t either. The words settled in the room like fog rolling in off the Mississippi. Zane\u2019s mouth went dry. \u201cIt can\u2019t be over,\u201d he whispered. \u201cRight? Not when neither of us want it to be.\u201d</p><p>Ty lifted his head, and they lay facing each other in the dark.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never made it simple,\u201d Zane finally said.</p><p>Ty laid his hand on Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cI swear to you, Zane. I thought what I was doing was right. I searched for you after I left New York. You were out of my reach. When Burns read me in, the only thing I could think of was that it was the only way of getting back to you. Being partnered with you full-time, being able . . . being able to see you every day, to have you in my life. When he said you might need protecting, it was the only thing I heard. I swear to you. All I wanted from the day I left you in that hospital was you. To be back there with you.\u201d</p><p>Zane throat tightened. The sincerity in Ty\u2019s eyes, the desperation in his voice, those weren\u2019t things he could fake, were they? \u201cTy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need me to do? I\u2019ll do it, Zane, whatever you need to save us.\u201d</p><p>Zane swore before he captured Ty\u2019s lips in a desperate kiss. When he pulled back, it was only barely, and their lips brushed as he said, \u201cGoddamn you, Ty.\u201d By the time he got the last word out, Ty was pulling him closer by the back of the neck to kiss him again. \u201cFeel like I\u2019ve been on a goddamn seesaw,\u201d Zane growled, his fingers dragging over Ty\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ty breathed. His hand trailed along Zane\u2019s hip, fingers sliding under his boxers. He pulled away from the kiss and pressed his face against Zane\u2019s, sliding his nose against Zane\u2019s cheek.</p><p>A shiver ran through Zane. Ty\u2019s hands were warm against the goose bumps. Zane kissed him again, leaning back so Ty would have to roll on top of him to continue the kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou were worth it,\u201d Ty murmured.</p><p>That jolt of intense arousal and connection made its way through Zane\u2019s body. The effect Ty had on him was something he would never find anywhere else, he knew that much. He shivered again as Ty\u2019s fingers brushed his skin.</p><p>Ty slid his hands under Zane\u2019s shirt, pushing the material up. Zane sat to help him get the shirt off, wrapping his arms around Ty\u2019s waist lifting his head for a kiss. Ty\u2019s hands cupped his face. The kiss was gentle and tentative, so unlike what Zane was used to.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, you know,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard. \u201cI sold my soul a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Ty gripped Zane\u2019s shoulder and pressed him down, laying him out again, then stretched out over Zane, his hand dragging down Zane\u2019s body to push at his boxers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane gasped.</p><p>Ty kissed him. Zane trailed the tips of his fingers down Ty\u2019s arm, sliding over the tattoo and the scars and the muscles.</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d Zane asked.</p> <p>\u201cI know it. I will never be the man you think I am.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breaths came harder. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been trying so hard to be worthy of each other.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and pressed another kiss to Zane\u2019s lips, drawing it out, deepening it, putting some fire into it. He tossed Zane\u2019s boxers over the edge of the bed as soon as Zane shimmied out of them, then rested his weight over Zane, propping on his elbows and sliding both hands into Zane\u2019s hair. He dragged his body against Zane\u2019s and Zane spread his legs around him, squeezing his ribs with his knees. He slid his hands up Ty\u2019s back and hooked his arms under his, effectively latching onto him. Ty began to rock, his muscles twisting and bulging, the movement pushing their thickened cocks together.</p><p>Zane\u2019s entire body throbbed. He thought Ty would be able to feel his heart, it was beating so hard. Breathing was difficult as he inhaled Ty\u2019s familiar scent. They were on the eve of battle, making love in the calm before the storm, and it heightened Zane\u2019s senses to know this might be the last time Ty touched him.</p><p>He arched, feet sliding down the backs of Ty\u2019s legs, body writhing to increase the friction between them. He squeezed his thighs against Ty\u2019s hips, loving the way it felt when Ty thrust against him. He wasn\u2019t concerned with the endgame. He didn\u2019t care if either of them came. He didn\u2019t desperately need Ty inside him. He just wanted this feeling to last.</p> <p>His hands found Ty\u2019s hair, tightening. Ty hitched against his body, continuing to rock and slide as he kissed him harder.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Zane,\u201d Ty gasped. \u201cNothing I\u2019ve done will ever change that.\u201d</p><p>Pleasure curled in Zane\u2019s groin, but it was joined by another curl, deep in his chest. He found Ty\u2019s eyes, gone dark with arousal. His body was hard and solid on top of Zane\u2019s, nothing wasted. The lines around his eyes and mouth bore witness to the trials he\u2019d faced, and his skin was marred by years in the trenches of good and evil, battling back again and again to become the only person Zane had ever trusted with his life.</p><p>Zane ran his thumb over Ty\u2019s cheek, seeing him suddenly with new eyes. Ty had never tried to be something he wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d never tried to hide what he was. Warrior. Weapon. Bad guy. Zane knew what he was. The pain and betrayal faded. The world faded.</p><p>Ty turned his face under Zane\u2019s thumb and kissed his palm. Zane raised his hips, pushing his cock against Ty\u2019s thigh.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty moaned, lowering his forehead to Zane\u2019s shoulder and flexing his back and hips to keep the wildly arousing rhythm going. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p> <p>Zane didn\u2019t answer. He knew Ty needed him, could feel it in the very air they breathed. He pressed his nose and mouth against Ty\u2019s cheek, clenched hard at Ty\u2019s shoulder and hair, body writhing beneath Ty\u2019s. His cock slid against hard muscle and soft skin. Ty\u2019s cock drove against his hip and stomach, pressing against his.</p><p>Ty bit down on the curve of Zane\u2019s neck as he shoved a little harder against him, and a jolt went through Zane\u2019s body. Ty hummed against his skin until it degenerated into a low growl. The rocking stopped, shifting into a more sinuous, deliberate pressure.</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, Ty,\u201d Zane gasped out.</p><p>Now he needed Ty inside him. It felt like he\u2019d stuck his finger in a light socket, electricity zigzagging through him wherever Ty touched, settling deep in his belly, coiling. Ty knew exactly what he was doing to him and exploited it mercilessly, egging on the pleasure racking Zane\u2019s body with a violent kiss. Zane bucked his hips as Ty\u2019s tongue lapped at his. Ty grasped Zane\u2019s hands, lacing their fingers together, slid them under Zane\u2019s head until their chests touched, and pinned them to the mattress. Zane\u2019s body was completely at Ty\u2019s mercy.</p><p>Zane forced his eyes open and found Ty\u2019s as he surrendered all control to him. He trusted him, despite everything, despite trying to convince himself he couldn\u2019t. He trusted Ty with his body. He always had. He trusted Ty with his heart. It was his very soul that Ty had the power to break.</p><p>Ty captured Zane\u2019s mouth in a kiss.</p><p>Sensation overflowed for a brief, shining moment. Ty\u2019s lips against his. The warmth and weight of his body, the way he felt between Zane\u2019s thighs. The sensual rocking of his hips, their cocks sliding, leaking. Then it all came crashing down. He arched his back, squeezing Ty\u2019s hips, groaning Ty\u2019s name into their kiss, his entire body spasming and tightening as his orgasm crashed over him. Ty didn\u2019t let up, didn\u2019t pull away, still rubbing against him, sliding slick now between their bellies.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty growled against his ear.</p> <p>Zane was still gasping for breath, sensations and emotions washing over him in a jumble. He panted against the skin of Ty\u2019s neck, unable to do anything more than inhale his scent.</p><p>Ty released Zane\u2019s hands and pushed himself to his knees. Zane grabbed him by the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not done.\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned over him to kiss him again. He reached between them, swiping one hand down Zane\u2019s slick abdomen and cock, stroking down to Zane\u2019s thighs and urging them apart.</p><p>Zane let his knees fall to the sides, spreading his legs wider. Ty kissed the inside of Zane\u2019s knee, then crawled backward. He left the bed and went in search of one of their bags, leaving Zane to try to regain his breath alone.</p><p>When Ty returned, he crawled between Zane\u2019s legs and ran his tongue along Zane\u2019s stomach. Zane lifted his head to watch, fascinated as Ty licked his cum from his abs.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>Ty knelt, running his hand through Zane\u2019s cum, spreading it across his stomach. Then he added a generous amount of lube to his palm and used that hand to grip his own straining cock. Zane pulled one leg up and rolled over onto his stomach, inviting Ty to take him. Ty gripped one of Zane\u2019s hips and moved in close, wasting no time pushing in.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers dragged across the sheets. Ty\u2019s hand found his and he laced their fingers together, clenching as he pushed in deeper. Once he was as far as he could get, he laid his body out over Zane\u2019s, kissing Zane\u2019s shoulder, enveloping him in strong arms. His breathing broke into sharp pants.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ty,\u201d Zane panted, rolling his hips just enough to spur Ty into action.</p><p>Ty pressed his face against Zane\u2019s back, groaning, kissing his skin. He pulled most of the way out before thrusting in again with a ragged curse. Zane gasped, arching. Ty tortured Zane with that incredible slow slide of his cock several more times, his breaths in Zane\u2019s ear, before he lost control and shoved in deeper.</p><p>Zane would never enjoy anything more than Ty taking him from behind. His chest pressed into the mattress, Ty\u2019s lips at his ear. The way Ty held him close, found his way into Zane\u2019s very soul.</p><p>Ty pulled Zane\u2019s hips up, curling until he could reach to tease at Zane\u2019s mouth with his tongue, trailing the taste of his cum along swollen lips. His hand slid over Zane\u2019s shoulder, closing over his chest, hugging him close.</p><p>There was nowhere to go, nowhere to run from the intimacy or the pleasure. And Zane didn\u2019t mind one bit.</p><p>When Ty moved again, it was a steady rolling of his hips, and he didn\u2019t relinquish Zane\u2019s mouth. More kisses, more intensity, faster rocking, harder thrusts . . . the thrill echoed through them as Ty held on tight. Zane managed to gasp out Ty\u2019s name through the kiss, urging him on, begging him. Ty never sped up his motions, though, just continued to thrust in, rocking in time with Zane\u2019s panting breaths.</p><p>Finally, he buried his face against Zane\u2019s shoulder and gasped, choking out Zane\u2019s name. His body locked up and he shoved in deep, shaking all over but still rocking as he climaxed.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes, drinking it in, sharing it with his lover. He shifted his hips and arched his back in an attempt to extend the pleasure.</p><p>Ty sagged over him, struggling for air, but each time he got half a breath, his chest caught and an aftershock tore through him. Zane could feel it echoing through Ty to himself.</p><p>After several long moments, Ty pulled out of him with a sound that was almost a sob and collapsed at his side.</p><p>Zane lay where he was, unable to move even if he\u2019d wanted to. He snaked a hand across the short distance between them and slid his fingers into Ty\u2019s. Ty\u2019s hand closed around his with a gentle squeeze.</p><p>\u201cI just need to be able to trust you, Ty,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou can. I swear you can. I\u2019d die for you, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart was in his throat as he studied Ty\u2019s profile. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Ty had a handful of cartridges laid out in front of him, some the .40 caliber rounds for Zane\u2019s Glock, and some the high-powered, armor-piercing monstrosities that loaded Liam\u2019s sniper rifle. Ty wished they could have found less deadly ammunition, but this was all they had to work with.</p><p>He had converted three of Zane\u2019s shots to blanks, though having done it without the proper equipment they might still pack a little bit of a punch. He\u2019d taken the bullet out, leaving nothing but the charge, and packed them with newspaper to seal the powder in the case.</p><p>That wad of newspaper would come out like any other projectile, and the muzzle blast would still be powerful. It wouldn\u2019t kill him, though.</p><p>He was just finishing the round that Liam would be firing at him, creating a makeshift hollow-point that should expand and break up when it hit the resistance of the vest. He cut the hollow of the jacket to weaken it so it would expand like a flower on impact, rather than penetrate deeply. Without the vest, the sharp petals of the flower would slice through flesh two to three times the size of the original bullet.</p><p>If Liam missed, it was going to be ugly.</p><p>He lifted his head as Liam stepped into the room. The man looked around at their preparations, an eyebrow raised.</p><p>He stopped in front of Digger and Owen. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKetchup. And some other stuff,\u201d Digger answered. He and Owen had spent all morning filling quart bags with the concoction. \u201cBarbecue sauce, Crisco. Chocolate powder and water.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s nose curled as the list went on. It sounded like something Digger would cook and serve at home.</p><p>They put enough of the sauce in each bag to let them remain slim when sealed and flattened. Then they duct-taped the bags to the outside of the Kevlar vest.</p><p>Liam picked up one of the bags and squished it. \u201cMarines are disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Owen grunted.</p><p>\u201cI have to agree right now,\u201d Nick said. He had a quart tub of Crisco and had been mixing it with diaper cream and chocolate powder to make face paint. The diaper cream had an especially unpleasant smell. \u201cWe\u2019re putting this on our faces.\u201d</p><p>Liam shuddered and poked at the vest Ty would be wearing.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the back?\u201d</p><p>Digger shrugged. \u201cWe got no way of doing that without wiring Ty with some small explosives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no,\u201d Ty said immediately.</p><p>Liam snorted. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p><p>The vest itself was white, made to look like a T-shirt beneath other clothing. It reduced one layer, but with the Kevlar and the slimy bags of fake blood, Ty\u2019s mobility would still be cut down. He wasn\u2019t meant to be mobile, though; he simply had to stand there and die.</p><p>His stomach tumbled with nerves and he wiped a hand over his face. \u201cDid you scout the location?\u201d he asked Liam.</p><p>Liam sauntered over and sat opposite him, nodding. \u201cI have a nice little nest all set up on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me where,\u201d Ty interrupted. \u201cIf I get nervous, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. There\u2019s graffiti everywhere, so I put a big black X on the pavement where you\u2019re meant to stand. Try to get as close as you can to it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. He picked up the bullet he\u2019d just finished and held it up for Liam to see. \u201cHollow-point round.\u201d He held up another, one he hadn\u2019t messed with. \u201cArmor-piercing round.\u201d He waved them together. \u201cDo not get these mixed up.\u201d</p><p>Liam chuckled, then leaned closer, sighing heavily and meeting Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cTyler, if I wanted you dead, I would have done when it was easy to kill you.\u201d He plucked the fragmenting round from Ty\u2019s fingers. \u201cWe have no way of marking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Any etchings on the outside will fuck with the spin. Hell, I\u2019m even afraid to mark it with a Sharpie.\u201d</p><p>Liam was humming, turning the bullet over. He clutched it in his hand, then patted the back of Ty\u2019s neck, pulling his head to press their foreheads together. Ty closed his eyes. Months of their time spent together in arid camps in Kabul and damp training installations in the south of England came back to him. He\u2019d trusted this man.</p><p>\u201cYou did this for me once,\u201d Liam murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s time I return the favor.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, swallowing hard.</p><p>Liam\u2019s voice dropped lower. \u201cAnd if you want to stay dead, I\u2019ll always be a call away.\u201d He released Ty and stood.</p><p>Ty sat back, eyes still closed as he fought for calm. He felt Liam moving away. The front door opened and snicked shut again, and just like that, Liam Bell was gone.</p><p>Ty took a deep, unsteady breath and glanced up.</p><p>Zane was standing in the bedroom door, watching him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to make the calls,\u201d Zane said. The activity in the room died down, everyone stopping to look at Zane. \u201cIs everyone ready?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked around, taking in the faces of the men he\u2019d called his friends, the men he\u2019d loved like brothers and spilled blood for. And then Zane. The only man Ty had ever truly given his heart to. If there was anyone to make a last stand with, it was the men in this room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Zane sat astride Liam\u2019s Honda Shadow, a bandana with a menacing skull printed on it pulled over his face. Ty sat behind him, his hands looped over Zane like a seatbelt, tied at the wrists. They had a pillowcase over his head, a large smiley face drawn on it.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Digger told him. \u201cThis is New Orleans. Nobody\u2019ll bat an eye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s kick it, Garrett,\u201d Ty said in Zane\u2019s ear.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t waste more time with goodbyes. He gunned the bike away from the house, winding their way through the streets toward the hulking wasteland of Six Flags New Orleans.</p><p>The noise of the motorcycle signaled their arrival, and that was exactly how Zane had wanted it. All eyes on them. The front gate of the park had been cut and left ajar, and Zane used the bike to plow through it. He came to a halt in the park entrance, stunned by the shape of the place.</p><p>The map had shown a happy amusement park set up in a vague circle around a center pond. On the far side was a large body of water, abutted by an area of the park called Pontchartrain Beach. It was a long, wide thoroughfare, and that was where Zane had told Valencia and Gaudet to meet him.</p><p>But the map hadn\u2019t prepared him for the park itself: an urban badlands, left to hold its own against the elements and urban explorers with spray paint.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Ty, you know how to pick them,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cIs it as creepy as it feels? \u2019Cause I can\u2019t see shit through this thing.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>Main Street Square was built to mimic the architecture of the French Quarter. It boasted stunning colors and Creole townhouses with sweeping galleries, but it was all covered in graffiti and debris. Weeds encroached. Huge pots sprouted weeds and saplings, and many had \u201cNOLA Rising\u201d written on them. Zane couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the crumbling fa\u00e7ades. Left to their own devices, the buildings had begun to tear themselves apart.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty whispered. His arms tightened around Zane\u2019s chest. \u201cWe can\u2019t linger.\u201d</p><p>Zane gave a curt nod and maneuvered the bike through the trash and detritus along the causeways. Other parts of the park were in even worse shape, and Zane pushed the motorcycle faster, not liking the feeling the park gave him. When they reached the bend that began Pontchartrain Beach, Zane stopped the bike, and Ty pulled his hands over Zane\u2019s head so they could dismount. Zane grabbed the rope between Ty\u2019s hands and looked at him. The garish red smiley face grinned back.</p> <p>He walked Ty ahead of him, jerking him by his arm, shoving him around debris in his path.</p><p>Five men in pristine suits stood to one side of Pontchartrain Beach, their backs to the swampland behind them. Under an awning on the other side of the wide causeway, Gaudet and his very large son stood with two men in uniform. And Ava. Her eyes were red and her face was puffy. She took an involuntary step toward them when they appeared. Her brother held her back.</p><p>Zane pulled Ty closer, standing just behind him, a gun jammed into his ribs. Faded blue waves were painted all over the pavement, as if he and Ty were submerged in some surreal river, and several feet away was the large X Liam had marked on the ground.</p><p>Zane stepped beside Ty and turned him, then swept the pillowcase off Ty\u2019s head. He met his eyes one last time, trying to memorize every fleck of gold, every imperfection and quirk. There was fear in Ty\u2019s eyes, and Zane\u2019s resolve almost left him. But he shoved him, making him stumble toward the X.</p><p>\u201cXander,\u201d Mateo Valencia said. He stepped forward, his arms spread wide. \u201cOr should I say, Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me whatever you want. I\u2019m not here to chat. I\u2019m here to end this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA position I share,\u201d Valencia said. He ran a hand along the scar on his cheek, the one Zane had given him years ago. \u201cTell me why I should not just kill everyone here and leave?\u201d</p><p>Gaudet pulled his gun, and his men followed suit. \u201cYou can try it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want to avoid,\u201d Zane shouted. \u201cOne death! That\u2019s all we need here. And I have just the man for it.\u201d He gave Ty another shove, closer to the X. \u201cCommander Gaudet, you know this man as Tyler Beaumont. He has information you need, am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mateo, the only thing you need is the man who killed Antonio. Muerto. Si?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaro que si.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you\u2019re getting out of this, cowboy?\u201d Gaudet asked.</p><p>Zane opened his mouth to speak, but Valencia beat him to it. \u201cHe is one of ours. A thorn the FBI inserted into our paw. A thorn we removed and sent back to them with poison in him.\u201d</p><p>Zane hated the sound of that, but he kept a stony face.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want out from under de la Vega. This is my ticket. Do we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is agreeable to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you want out of my city with a free pass, huh?\u201d Gaudet asked.</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us get this done with,\u201d Valencia called.</p><p>Zane took a shaky breath. Nerves were building. \u201cGaudet, what is it you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Gaudet stepped forward, but not too far from the protection of the others. \u201cThe information you gathered, Beaumont. What happened to it?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>Gaudet gripped Ava by the arm, pulling her forward. \u201cTalk some damn sense into him.\u201d</p><p>She took a ragged, unsteady breath. It was loud in the silence of the dead park. \u201cTy,\u201d she said with difficulty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She began walking toward him.</p><p>Zane saw her father raise his arm, his gun trained on her back. His body jerked, but thankfully Ty reacted before he could.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he called.</p><p>Ava startled and whirled to face her father. She stumbled back when she saw him lowering his gun. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, darlin\u2019. Make that boy talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Ty shouted. His voice broke. \u201cOkay. Cher, viens \u00e0 moi.\u201d</p><p>Zane had heard Ty whisper enough French to understand that order: Come to me. Ava didn\u2019t hesitate, and Ty caught her and stepped in front of her, shielding her. Tears were streaming down her face, but Zane saw her slip a small blade into Ty\u2019s palm. Zane shook his head. They hadn\u2019t anticipated this. Who the hell would\u2019ve expected the man to threaten his own daughter? He licked his lips, glancing to the swamp. If this went to hell, that swamp was their only hope.</p><p>Liam made a low whistling sound through the device in Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cLittle touch and go there, lads. Who do I shoot first if things go to hell?\u201d</p><p>Zane made a shushing sound.</p><p>\u201cThe information you gathered?\u201d Gaudet demanded.</p><p>\u201cKatrina wiped it out,\u201d Ty said quickly. \u201cEverything I had, it\u2019s gone. There\u2019s nothing left on you.\u201d</p><p>Gaudet pursed his lips and nodded curtly. It seemed to Zane that Ty had merely confirmed what Gaudet already knew. \u201cIt\u2019ll do. Ava, girl, get back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais non!\u201d Ty cried.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be taking her with me,\u201d Zane growled. \u201cPayment for services rendered.\u201d</p><p>She gulped air, trying not to cry as she gripped the back of Ty\u2019s shirt. Ty was covertly slicing through the ropes at his wrists with the knife she\u2019d slipped him, preparing for everything to go to hell. Ava was made of tough stuff, Zane could say that about her. But she was about to fall apart.</p><p>\u201cShoot him now, Xander, or I will,\u201d Valencia called, obviously tiring of the family drama.</p><p>\u201cAva, run,\u201d Ty gasped. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>Ava backed away a few steps. Zane rounded on Ty, putting his back to the Colombians and raising his gun. He pointed it at Ty\u2019s chest. He met Ty\u2019s eyes, seeing the fear there, the uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d Liam said in his ear. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty whispered. Zane\u2019s world began to slow.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>Ava darted forward, grabbing Ty\u2019s shoulder and swinging around him. Zane pulled the trigger. The blast echoed through the park, two shots becoming one.</p><p>Ty\u2019s shout was lost in the sound of the shot. The bullet thumped into her back and threw her into Ty. He caught her around the waist as she fell, crying out, cradling her with a hand to her face as they both dropped to the ground.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Liam shouted. \u201cSon of a bitch! Stupid fucking girl!\u201d</p><p>Other shouts mingled with the hammering of Zane\u2019s heart in his ears. He took a step toward them, watching as Ty laid her lifeless body on the ground, his hands shaking and covered with blood.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Zane could hear guns being drawn behind him. Ty grabbed Zane\u2019s hand and pulled himself to his feet. He shoved his shoulder into Zane\u2019s body, spinning them, forcing Zane to use him as a shield. He held Zane\u2019s hand behind his back, squeezing it hard, refusing to allow Zane to let go as Gaudet and his men opened fire on them.</p><p>Ty\u2019s body jerked against Zane\u2019s as the first bullet hit, then again and again, shoving Zane back, forcing him off-balance.</p><p>The Colombians opened fire on the crooked cops, offering Zane the covering fire they thought an informant of theirs deserved, mowing them down like ducks in a gallery with their high-powered weapons.</p><p>Zane\u2019s back hit the pavement, the weight of Ty\u2019s body pinning him. The back of Ty\u2019s head banged into Zane\u2019s lip and he tasted blood. More gunfire came from the swamp. Patches of swamp grass were rising from the mire. Sidewinder.</p><p>Mateo Valencia strolled toward them. He was shaking his head, reloading his gun.</p><p>\u201cTy, get off me, come on,\u201d Zane grunted. He pushed at Ty\u2019s shoulder, but Ty merely gasped a ragged breath in response. \u201cTy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I forgive so easily?\u201d Valencia asked Zane in Spanish. He ran a finger along the scar on his cheek as he loomed over Zane.</p><p>Zane freed his arm and fired before Valencia could finish his reload. It was a blank round, but he still staggered back, swiping at singed pieces of his suit and bleeding where the paper plug had embedded in his neck. He shouted, aiming his gun at Zane\u2019s head. But he never got to fire. One flick of Zane\u2019s wrist, and the Vega cartel\u2019s top enforcer fell to the ground with a knife in his heart, his gun sliding from his hand, useless.</p><p>Zane scrambled from under his partner\u2019s weight and knelt beside him, finally yanking the bandana off his face and tossing it aside. Ty was covered in blood from his chin to his knees, though what was real and what was fake, Zane couldn\u2019t tell. Ty blinked up at the gray sky, gasping for breath that wouldn\u2019t come. There were half a dozen bullet holes in his chest.</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, Ty,\u201d Zane cried. He laid his gun aside and bent over Ty, grabbing his face with both hands. \u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>Ty struggled to take in air to respond. He reached up to grab Zane\u2019s wrist instead, gripping it hard. He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTy, please,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Ty opened his eyes again and met Zane\u2019s, gasping and making sounds like he was trying to form words. A bullet had grazed his neck. Another had grazed his arm. Zane had no idea how bad the rest of his wounds were. There was too much blood.</p><p>Tears blurred Zane\u2019s vision and he looked up, desperate for help. Sidewinder was sweeping in from the swamp like angels of death, clearing weapons from dying hands, putting bullets in the heads of anyone who remained alive.</p><p>Three helicopters thumped in the distance, coming closer.</p><p>\u201cTake his vest off him, Zane,\u201d Liam said in Zane\u2019s ear.</p><p>Zane gasped and began pawing at Ty\u2019s shirt. He ripped it open, then used his knife to cut the straps of the vest away.</p><p>Ty gasped in air, his body arching off the ground as Zane freed him from the restrictive, mangled plates. He gasped again, pulling in air as hard as he could and beginning to shiver all over.</p><p>Zane patted at Ty chest, wiping away the blood. \u201cYou\u2019re not hit!\u201d he cried, beginning to laugh hysterically. \u201cOh thank you, God.\u201d He used his bandana to wipe away the fake blood from Ty\u2019s neck, pressing it to the wound oozing real blood. He pulled Ty up to hug him and Ty groaned, but he wrapped his arms around Zane and dug his fingers into his shirt, hugging him fiercely. One hand came to tangle in Zane\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking my ribs, Zane,\u201d Ty managed to wheeze before a coughing fit overtook him.</p><p>Zane released him and helped him lie back down. Ty closed his eyes, taking in deep breaths, one hand pressing to Zane\u2019s against his neck, the other shaking as he rested it on his stomach. Zane used his sleeve to wipe the blood away from his own mouth and nose, and with his face clean of it, he could smell the fake blood on Ty, hints of tomato and chocolate and barbecue sauce. He collapsed beside Ty, relief overwhelming him as he rested his head on Ty\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an utter asshole,\u201d Zane murmured against Ty\u2019s abs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Nick shouted as he ran toward them.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t move to answer. He felt Ty raise a hand, probably giving a thumbs-up.</p><p>The sound of the helicopters grew louder, and soon Zane could feel the wind of the rotor wash on his face. He finally realized a dozen men in SWAT gear were clearing the scene and trying to relieve Sidewinder of their weapons. Digger and Owen began to argue with two men who quickly pointed guns at their heads and made them get on their knees.</p><p>Zane sat up, confused by the appearance of another player. But then a familiar figure stepped out of the helicopter and began jogging toward them.</p><p>\u201cDick?\u201d Ty croaked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard Burns reached down to help Ty to his feet. He patted him on the shoulder, but then gave up on propriety and hugged him. \u201cI got here as fast as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhen Ty called and said there was a mole relaying your movements, I ran a test and found a trace on your phone. I couldn\u2019t tell you I was coming in or the mole would have known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I thought you left us in the wind,\u201d Ty said, still breathless and holding his bleeding neck.</p><p>Burns patted his cheek. \u201cI would never do that, Beaumont. You know that.\u201d He took a step back and surreptitiously wiped the disgusting blood concoction off his hand with a handkerchief as soon as Ty\u2019s attention was elsewhere.</p><p>Zane was still glowering at Burns when he realized Ty had stumbled away from them. He shed the remains of the vest and dropped to his knees at Ava\u2019s side. Blood had pooled under her and began to trail toward the center of the causeway. Her eyes stared into the sky.</p><p>Ty reached a shaking hand and set it over her forehead, closing her eyes. Zane could hear him murmuring a prayer in French through the ear bud in his ear.</p><p>Zane ran a hand through his hair, then yanked the ear bud out as he turned away from them. He met Burns\u2019s eyes. \u201cTy told me everything.\u201d</p> <p>Burns stiffened, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was a traitor?\u201d Zane asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cBetter safe than sorry, Zane. I knew as long as Ty trusted you, I could too.\u201d</p><p>Zane rushed forward and swung at him, knocking him to the ground with a shout. \u201cYou can\u2019t fuck with people\u2019s lives like that!\u201d he barked as two men ran up to them, each grabbed an arm, and began pulling him back. \u201cCan\u2019t you see what he would do for you? You can\u2019t use him like that, Dick! You can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Burns sat up, jaw lax and nose bleeding. He clambered to his feet and waved the men off. Zane took short, quick breaths as Burns came closer and gripped both of his arms.</p><p>\u201cBe calm, Zane. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>Zane took deeper breaths, struggling to concentrate on the here and now and deal with the betrayal and anger later. Burns patted him on the cheek and then walked away. Zane watched him go, feeling the anger drain out of him, replaced with a wide swath of loss. Burns was the first person since Jack Tanner in the academy who Zane had really felt cared about him. What the hell was he supposed to do now?</p><p>Nick caught Zane\u2019s attention as he picked up the remains of Ty\u2019s Kevlar vest. The man looked from Ava\u2019s body to the vest, then peered into the distance, where the wooden rails of a roller coaster undulated like a felled dragon in the swamp.</p><p>Zane moved closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullet went right through her. Ty\u2019s talon hollow-point would have torn her to shreds, but it wouldn\u2019t have gone through her.\u201d He shuffled guiltily when he realized Ty had trudged up to stand with them, but he held up the vest for them to see. Among the flattened pistol rounds was a larger one, embedded in the vest. Nick turned it over to show them the very tip, where it had penetrated almost through, right over Ty\u2019s heart. It had no petals from the grooves Ty had cut into it. It wasn\u2019t the same bullet.</p><p>\u201cHe mixed up the bullets. Used an armor-piercing round,\u201d Zane said, suddenly light-headed.</p><p>\u201cThat would have killed me,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cShe saved your life,\u201d Nick said. \u201cSlowed it enough for the vest to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. They all turned toward the roller coaster in the distance, the only place the shot could have originated from.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he go for a head shot?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cHe knew you boys would catch him before he could get away. But if I went down like I was supposed to, no one\u2019s the wiser until he\u2019s long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know it was on purpose,\u201d Zane tried. \u201cThe bullets looked alike.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, eyes still on the skeletal behemoth in the swamp. He finally lowered his head and walked away, following Burns toward the waiting helicopters.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really shouldn\u2019t be speaking,\u201d the nurse told them.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you get him to shut up long enough to heal, you let us know how you did it,\u201d Digger grumbled as he plucked a bit of saw grass from that morning off his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep him quiet,\u201d Nick promised, giving her a charming smile. It was probably ruined by the homemade face paint he\u2019d discovered wouldn\u2019t wash off. She nodded and left them, and Nick returned his attention to the man in the hospital bed.</p><p>Kelly grinned widely at them. \u201cI know you all cried over me.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMainly because we knew we\u2019d be the ones nursing you back to health,\u201d Owen added.</p><p>Kelly held up a fist, and Owen gently pressed their knuckles together.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d it go down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone died, pretty much,\u201d Digger answered. \u201cLiam Bell was long gone by the time me and Irish climbed that death trap. Our names are being cleared by the FBI. Ty\u2019s been suspended until Hell freezes over.\u201d</p><p>Nick tore his eyes away from Kelly\u2019s face to study Ty, sitting in the reclining chair in the corner. His ribs were tightly wrapped, there was a bandage on his neck, and\u2014perhaps the biggest tragedy of all\u2014a bullet had sliced right through his bulldog tattoo. He had dark circles under his eyes. And he\u2019d been holding that damn voodoo doll since he sat down.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying it\u2019ll be a few weeks, at least,\u201d Ty said. His voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cWe made it?\u201d</p><p>They all laughed uncomfortably. For some reason, it didn\u2019t feel like they\u2019d made it.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d Zane asked suddenly. He\u2019d been sitting in the far corner, letting the rest of them visit.</p><p>Nick snorted, but Zane was frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious? What the fuck was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam Bell happened here,\u201d Ty said. His scratchy voice and hollow eyes and the way he was caressing that voodoo doll were eerie. Ty was starting to creep Nick out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>Ty turned the doll in his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch on fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Nick said quietly. \u201cNone of what happened here is your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Ty finally looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s his.\u201d</p><p>Nick said nothing. He wasn\u2019t going to touch that one.</p><p>\u201cHe outplayed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a game, Ty,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cSure it was. Liam wasn\u2019t freelancing here. He works for the NIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t miss. I don\u2019t miss. He was here as an NIA agent. And what is the NIA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brand new, ultra-militarized arm of the CIA,\u201d Kelly recited.</p><p>\u201cWith broad purpose but small, precious resources,\u201d Ty added.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you think Liam and the NIA engineered all of this?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do exactly what we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClean out a rat\u2019s nest?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying NIA pitted a retired Recon team against a Colombian cartel?\u201d Owen asked. \u201cOn purpose?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cIt was a perfect storm. We cleared out a dozen of the cartel\u2019s men, plus a high-ranking dirty cop who controls a busy port city. They lose no assets. Don\u2019t take the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>Ty held up his hand. He slowly extended his thumb. \u201cHe knew Sanchez. Knew he was dead, knew his birthday, knew we\u2019d all gather. He knew Digger was confined to the state. That leaves one place and time we\u2019d all be. And to know all that, he had to have CIA sources.\u201d He pointed his index finger, counting off his reasons. \u201cThe cartel came by boat, which means they left Miami before we did. He didn\u2019t see us and then call them. They knew to be here because he told them to be here.\u201d He flipped up another finger. \u201cHe knew my past here. You think it was coincidence I hit Gaudet\u2019s radar as soon as I landed? He effectively boxed us in, forced us to act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty,\u201d Nick finally said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the bastard either, but . . . I\u2019m just not comfortable thinking he\u2019s that many steps ahead.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is what happened, why would he try to kill you?\u201d Owen asked. \u201cDo you really think he just mixed those bullets up?\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at the voodoo doll, long enough the silence became uncomfortable. \u201cHe\u2019s a scorpion and I\u2019m a turtle,\u201d Ty finally answered.</p><p>\u201cAre you hallucinating again?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s a fable. The scorpion asks the turtle to take him across the river. The turtle says no because he\u2019s afraid the scorpion will sting him. Scorpion tells Turtle he won\u2019t sting him because they\u2019ll both drown. But halfway across the river, the scorpion strikes. As they\u2019re sinking, Turtle asks him why, and Scorpion replies, \u2018It\u2019s just my nature.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s worried eyes moved to Ty, who was studying the voodoo doll again. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he knows Ty\u2019s the only one who can catch him,\u201d Kelly rasped.</p><p>Ty stood carefully without another word, then took a step toward Kelly. Kelly lifted a hand and Ty took it, squeezing it gently. \u201cI\u2019ll be back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Ty petted him on the head, then turned to shuffle out of the room.</p><p>The rest of them began to stand, giving Kelly their own goodbyes before they all filed out.</p><p>Nick stood at the doorway, watching the others walk away.</p><p>Digger put his arm over Owen\u2019s shoulders. \u201cCare for a few cocktails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely noon, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? This is Nawlins!\u201d</p><p>They laughed as they headed for the elevator. Ty and Zane followed, walking side by side but not saying anything. Nick shook his head as he watched them go.</p><p>\u201cThey gonna be okay?\u201d Kelly asked from the bed.</p><p>Nick pondered them. \u201cOh, you know Ty,\u201d he finally said, injecting some cheer into his voice. \u201cHe can squirm out of anything.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent as Zane hailed a cab for them. Digger and Owen had cavorted off into the French Quarter as if nothing had happened that morning, but Zane was finding it a bit more difficult to brush off.</p><p>He and Ty climbed into the cab, directing it to the Bourbon Orleans, where they still had a room under Nick\u2019s name. What remained of their belongings had been taken there earlier.</p><p>Zane glanced sideways at Ty. His neck was stained with remnants of Digger\u2019s fake blood and his real blood, and his face was ashen, but Zane had seen him look worse. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we both came out of this without anything other than scratches,\u201d Zane tried.</p><p>Ty bobbed his head distractedly.</p><p>\u201cDo you still have the gris-gris bag?\u201d</p><p>That caused Ty to raise his head. He licked his lips. \u201cYeah. Gotta figure out how to cleanse it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere used to be a priestess on Rampart. Probably still there.\u201d</p><p>Zane studied him, wishing the distance between them hadn\u2019t grown so full of thorns. He worked hard to swallow past the tightness in his throat.</p><p>The taxi came to a stop and Zane paid the driver as Ty trudged to the hotel entrance. Zane jogged to catch up with him. \u201cHey,\u201d he called, frustration growing as he followed Ty through the lobby. \u201cAre we going to talk about . . . anything?\u201d</p><p>Ty punched the button on the elevator. He nodded, not meeting Zane\u2019s eyes. The doors opened and Ty stepped in, turning to face Zane. \u201cDo you love me, Zane?\u201d</p><p>The simple question, asked with so little emotion in Ty\u2019s eyes, hit Zane like a hammer in the chest, stealing his breath, making his knees go weak. He stumbled into the elevator before the doors could close on them.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes I do.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>Zane released the breath he\u2019d been holding. He was relieved to hear that confirmation after all that had happened, after all they\u2019d said and done to each other. \u201cSo . . . what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Ty swallowed, looking a little sick. \u201cI can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t sit on your pedestal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad thing, Zane. I\u2019m not. We\u2019ve both known from the start the only reason you got clean was because I begged you to. You hang on by your fingernails because I expect you to. It\u2019s not fair to you. It\u2019s not fair to me. I can\u2019t be the reason you\u2019re sober, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath came out harsh and shaky.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not perfect, and the next time I let you down, it can\u2019t be me you\u2019re leaning on. You have to be strong enough to stay off the bottle. For you. Not me.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t meet Ty\u2019s eyes anymore and he averted his gaze to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of what I\u2019ve done, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d Ty whispered. He reached out and put two fingers under Zane\u2019s chin, lifting his head to meet his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I let you down.\u201d</p><p>Zane moved closer, his eyes rapt on Ty\u2019s. Ty\u2019s hand moved from his chin to cup his cheek, and Zane leaned to kiss him carefully. The kiss demanded nothing. It was merely a sentiment of love and devotion from one man to another.</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart pounded with the acceptance. When he stepped back, they were still looking into each other\u2019s eyes. The elevator stopped and jolted them both. Zane took a deep, bracing breath. \u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty shook his head. \u201cI love you. You love me. We know what we have can be strong. Stronger.\u201d</p><p>Zane lowered his head before he could see the pain that was about to pass over Ty\u2019s face. The elevator door opened and closed behind him. \u201cBut . . . the pieces have to be strong for the whole to be. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty whispered. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not right now. I . . . I don\u2019t even know what I am anymore. I haven\u2019t for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d Zane said, vehement as he jerked his head up. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave man. And you\u2019re a man who loves with his whole heart and soul. That\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his lips together tightly. His eyes were glistening, and as Zane watched, a tear broke free and trailed down his face. Ty ducked his head and wiped it away with the heel of his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s who you think I am.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an assassin,\u201d Ty said, his voice unsteady. \u201cI\u2019m a killer. I\u2019m the tip of a spear.\u201d</p><p>The hair on Zane\u2019s arms rose. His stomach tumbled. Another tear followed the trail of the first down Ty\u2019s dirty face, but Ty didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Ty continued, his voice breaking. \u201cYou\u2019re a phoenix, Zane. Rising from the ashes. And all I do is make you burn.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s throat was too tight to swallow past, and his next breath came out a choked sob. He had never imagined that was how Ty saw him, and hearing it now made him want to take back every harsh word they\u2019d ever shared, every thrust and parry of their relationship. He reached for Ty\u2019s face, fingers trembling.</p><p>Ty hugged him, clinging to him, his breaths harsh in Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay here,\u201d Ty said shakily. Zane gasped, but Ty didn\u2019t let him pull away. He held to him tighter. \u201cUntil the suspension\u2019s over. I\u2019m going to stay here with Kelly. I\u2019ll give you that time and space you said you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty wrenched away and dug in his pocket for something, then shoved it into Zane\u2019s hand and hugged him again like he was afraid Zane might try to get away. When Zane looked at the object over Ty\u2019s shoulder, his chest fluttered at the sight of the silver anchor token Ty had made him. I believe in you, it read.</p><p>Zane wanted to argue, to beg Ty not to make him leave him here. But Ty was right. He had realized it himself, remembering the way he\u2019d watched Becky, thinking her joy was shared. The way he observed Ty\u2019s vibrant lust for life and fooled himself into thinking he was living just by basking in that glow.</p> <p>But he had no friends. He had no joys. He had nothing that wasn\u2019t about Ty or the job.</p><p>He had to learn to live. If he was a phoenix, he had to learn to fly on his own, or he\u2019d keep smoldering in his own ashes.</p><p>He nodded against Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Zane sat at his desk, finishing up paperwork from a racketeering case they had been building for the last four weeks. He\u2019d been working without a partner, taking on more responsibilities as a team leader. Two weeks ago, the Assistant Special Agent in Charge had been promoted and transferred to a different post, and Zane had unofficially moved into the position, taking even more responsibility until it was filled.</p><p>It was a promotion in every sense of the word, and Dan McCoy had let Zane know the ASAIC was his if he decided to take it. It would mean no more field work.</p><p>No more partner.</p><p>Zane hadn\u2019t been able to say yes, but he hadn\u2019t refused it either. Candidates were being vetted and interviewed, and Zane had time to decide.</p> <p>Until then, he concentrated on slowly but surely righting his ship. He\u2019d begun his AA meetings again, keeping the anchor token with him at all times. He\u2019d stopped going to the gym quite as often, trying to fill his free time with other, more varied things. He set up an easel and a massive drop cloth on the top floor of the row house and began painting again. He started talking out loud when the room was empty, like Ty sometimes did, and he found it made his thoughts clearer to send them into the air rather than keep them trapped in his mind to weigh him down. He reread the books he\u2019d clung to all these years, reminding himself why he loved them the first time around. Then he went out and hunted down new ones.</p><p>With Ty\u2019s permission, he went through every nook and cranny in the row house. He looked through all of Ty\u2019s books, finding half a dozen with cutouts and things hidden in them: passports, lockbox keys, money from several different countries, a flash drive, the emblem from the grill of the Bronco, and one of Elias Sanchez\u2019s dog tags. He put it all back.</p><p>He finally looked under the kitchen sink, hunting through everything to find what it was Ty had hidden under there. He\u2019d caught Ty once, when he\u2019d lost his sight, rummaging through here. What he finally found made him grin from ear to ear: a box of Cuban cigars inside a fireproof, portable safe. He took one out and put the rest back where he\u2019d found them.</p><p>The most shocking thing he found, though, was something he\u2019d always known was there. In an armoire in the spare bedroom, Ty kept dozens of little boxes. Decorative boxes, old cigar boxes, leather jewelry cases. Zane had never asked about them, never looked in them. He\u2019d always been just a little afraid to see what Ty kept in those boxes.</p><p>Ty managed to surprise him yet again. Inside he found trinkets Ty had collected over the years. Things he\u2019d picked up and taken home for no apparent reason. Things from cases he\u2019d worked. Things from people he\u2019d known. In one box, Zane found a bottle cap from a Shiner beer, the kind he\u2019d had in Texas. A poker chip. A purple crayon. A piece of the fake skin they\u2019d used to cover his tattoo on the cruise ship. A dried flower.</p><p>Zane discovered that Ty was basically a squirrel.</p><p>After the initial shock of being alone, he started branching out further, trying to find out more about himself instead of Ty. He went to a few Orioles games alone, immersing himself in the intricacies and inches that had so fascinated him as a child. He started putting his knife skills and love of puzzles to good use and taught himself to cook.</p><p>He stood outside of a bar in Fell\u2019s Point with dozens of others and watched the news as it was announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed. For the first time in over a week, Ty called him. They watched the same newscast, sharing it together, neither saying more than ten words.</p><p>He escorted Clancy to her sister\u2019s wedding, pretending to be her very charming and wealthy boyfriend for her overly nosy mother in exchange for the honor of a few tangos. Clancy wasn\u2019t a half bad dancer.</p><p>He helped Alston move out of his girlfriend\u2019s condo, all the while dodging Alston\u2019s possessions being chucked at them from the top of the stairs. They bonded over hot wings, discussing all the ways the job fucked up their relationships.</p><p>Perrimore got engaged, and Zane was shocked and slightly panicked when he asked Zane to be his best man. He had never planned a bachelor party, but when his mind turned to Ty, to the obvious person to ask for help, Zane pushed it away. He could do this.</p><p>He\u2019d driven to Philadelphia to see Deuce, Livi, and their baby girl. Amelia Rose Grady had been born a few weeks before Christmas, and at five months old, she was already pulling Deuce around like he was on roller skates. She had her mother\u2019s white-blonde hair, and her eyes appeared to be turning that particular Grady green that seemed to serve as nature\u2019s warning to other creatures.</p><p>He had spoken to Ty every week.</p><p>It had been a good month. A good start. Zane was proud of himself, and he realized that he hadn\u2019t been able to say that in a very long time.</p><p>He finished up his paperwork and packed it away. He was the last one in the office, and as he was walking to the elevator, he turned to look at the stairwell. He still wondered what the hell had happened a month ago. He believed Ty now when he said he hadn\u2019t known that Burns was in Baltimore the night of Zane\u2019s twenty-year party, but Zane knew he\u2019d seen the man.</p><p>It frustrated him not to have all the answers.</p><p>His steps echoed in the empty parking garage. His leather jacket creaked as he slid his arms into it. It was times like this, times when he was alone, when the world was quiet, that he thought of Ty. It would be just like Ty to show up now, maybe sitting on his motorcycle with a smirk, reminding Zane that his birthday was in a few days. That was the type of entrance Ty would make.</p><p>Zane grinned at the thought. He found his bike sans Ty, but the thought still made the ride home a good one.</p><p>He parked in the backyard, behind the lovingly covered Mustang, and clomped up the steps to the door, humming to himself. When he stepped inside, he set his helmet down on the counter nearby and dumped his keys into the bowl next to it.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home,\u201d he said wryly to the empty row house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about damn time.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s head shot up. Ty was sitting on the arm of the sofa, smiling. He was more tanned than he had been, and he certainly looked healthier. His hair was shorter, and the western style shirt he wore seemed to stretch across the taut muscles of his chest and arms.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>Zane took a few steps closer and Ty stood, his smile growing softer.</p><p>\u201cYou look really good, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane lunged for him and wrapped him up in a hug. The smell of Old Spice permeated Zane\u2019s senses for the first time in a month.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Ty asked as they hugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Zane managed. He pressed his nose to the scar on Ty\u2019s throat. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded jerkily. He didn\u2019t let go of Zane. \u201cAre you ready for me to come home?\u201d he asked, voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane answered before Ty had even finished the question. He grabbed Ty\u2019s face in his hands and kissed him, over and over until Ty was laughing and trying to fend him off.</p><p>At last, Zane took a step back to examine him. \u201cHow have you been? How\u2019s Kelly doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. They sent him home, and I think his ex-wife plans to take care of him, so he\u2019s desperate to get better so she\u2019ll leave. My suspension\u2019s been revoked. They\u2019re letting me come back next week.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned. He grasped Ty\u2019s hand and moved around the sofa to pull him down with him. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Ty licked his lips, smirking.</p><p>Zane grinned widely. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll show you the new sheets I put on the bed.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed and crawled onto the couch with him.</p><p>Zane wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into his lap instead. Ty straddled him, sitting back and cocking one eyebrow at Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do while you were down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sang. I stayed with Kelly. With Ava gone, I was the closest thing to a relative Murdoch had left, so I took care of his estate.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cThe bar?\u201d</p><p>Ty bit his lip and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s mine. I uh . . . I closed it up. Looking into selling it. I\u2019ll donate whatever it makes to one of the groups trying to rebuild. There was a kid who used to bartend there, had real talent with the bottle juggling and mixing and stuff. I saw him at Murdoch\u2019s funeral. His boss is interested in buying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep it?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t last long as it is, not without Murdoch and Ava there. Her voice was what brought them in. He was what gave it life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged it off and nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever get the curse lifted?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I did,\u201d Ty drawled, but he frowned as he patted Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d the priestess tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me I had dark days ahead.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t want to believe in any of it\u2014the voodoo, the mysticism, the incredible coincidences Ty said were fate. But the words made his stomach flip. \u201cDo you believe her?\u201d</p><p>Ty met his eyes. \u201cDo you believe we met in New Orleans because we were meant to?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth went dry. \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty nodded, looking grim. He leaned forward and brushed his lips over Zane\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than okay,\u201d Zane said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be us.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled against his lips. Zane chased him when he pulled back, kissing him again. It grew more heated, needier, devolving quickly into two men who hadn\u2019t seen each other in a month and desperately wanted to touch each other. Zane rolled Ty until they both tumbled off the couch and Ty was sprawled on the floor, Zane straddling him. \u201cHave we caught up enough that I can start taking your clothes off?\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed, a carefree, boyish sound, and glanced to his side, distracted by what he saw. \u201cYou moved the rug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kitty-cornered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Ty asked, aghast.</p><p>\u201cTo see you lose your shit when you got home.\u201d Zane leaned closer, grinning evilly. \u201cThere are other things out of order too. Books not alphabetized. Coffee mug handles facing different directions.\u201d He lowered his voice to a whisper as Ty\u2019s eyes widened in horror. \u201cThe closet isn\u2019t color coded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just watching the world burn, huh?\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed.</p><p>\u201cGod I missed you,\u201d Ty said in a rush of breath.</p><p>Zane grabbed a handful of Ty\u2019s hair and tugged, and when Ty\u2019s head tipped back, Zane kissed him hungrily, not letting go of him. Ty\u2019s laugh turned into a growl, and suddenly there was no space between them. No tears or lonely days, no secrets and no lies. Just Ty and Zane. On the floor of their row house. On a crooked rug.</p><p>Zane reached between them to unzip Ty\u2019s jeans, and then began struggling with loosening his own belt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty\u2019s growl became a groan as Zane rose up onto his knees. Ty jerked Zane\u2019s pants down to his thighs and sat up, kissing his stomach.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers tightened in his hair. He watched, inhaling sharply as Ty wrapped his hands around Zane\u2019s hips and dragged his teeth over Zane\u2019s hip bone. He tugged Zane\u2019s briefs down, grasping the back of one of Zane\u2019s thighs.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ty,\u201d Zane managed. He wanted nothing more than to hold the back of Ty\u2019s head right there by his hair and shove himself down Ty\u2019s throat, but there was something else he\u2019d been fantasizing about as he lay in bed alone, something he had to do now that Ty was back.</p> <p>So he gripped Ty\u2019s hair harder and moved off him. \u201cGet on the couch,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Zane grabbed the back couch cushions and tossed them to the floor. Ty began to laugh again, but he climbed onto the couch like he\u2019d been told. He reached up to touch Zane, fingers digging into his hips. He thought Zane intended to fuck his mouth. He was ready for it, grinning.</p><p>Ty was too much to resist like that, and Zane leaned down to kiss him messily, settling between Ty\u2019s legs to let their bodies rub together as he moved.</p><p>Then he pushed back up and unzipped Ty\u2019s jeans the rest of the way, tugging at them. He didn\u2019t pull them off, though, instead standing to kick out of his suit pants. Ty sat up long enough to pull off his shoes and socks and toss them to the floor, then shimmy out of his jeans and boxers.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna do this wearing the jacket?\u201d Ty asked.</p> <p>Zane closed his eyes as that image flashed through him.</p><p>\u201cYou should have kept that skull bandana, Zane, it was the hottest thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Ty,\u201d Zane snarled. He yanked his battered leather jacket off and tossed it aside, struggling out of the rest of his clothes. Once naked, he knelt on the floor and bent over Ty\u2019s lap, taking him into his mouth to suck and tease, hands traveling up and down Ty\u2019s thighs and gripping his hips.</p><p>Ty breathed Zane\u2019s name as he arched his back. It was a sound Zane had sorely missed. He had missed everything about this: the easy teasing, the feel and smell of Ty\u2019s body against his, the sounds Ty made when Zane touched him. Zane\u2019s month alone had been a good one, but God was he glad to have Ty in his arms again.</p><p>Zane pushed off him and raised his head to kiss him again, tugging him close, wrapping him up. He stretched his hand down Ty\u2019s body, soaking in the warmth, re-familiarizing himself with the hard muscles and pulling at Ty\u2019s hip.</p><p>He wanted to maul him.</p> <p>The muscles of Ty\u2019s shoulders and back bunched as he reached for Zane. He licked and kissed at Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you the other way,\u201d Zane commanded.</p><p>Ty raised one eyebrow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and grinned, his hands sliding over Ty\u2019s skin. Ty kissed him one last time, then Zane was stretched out on the couch and Ty clambered carefully over him. Ty shifted back until his cock slid along Zane\u2019s cheek. With a groan, he dropped his head and licked along the side of Zane\u2019s cock.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t waste any time. He wrapped his hands around Ty\u2019s hips and took Ty into his mouth, yanking so Ty would thrust down. He groaned appreciatively at the added stimulus of Ty\u2019s tongue. Very little could get Ty hotter faster than a hard cock between his lips, but it had taken Zane a few years to accept that the same might true of him. This was one of Ty\u2019s favorite things to do. Ty had told him that many times. So why the hell shouldn\u2019t Zane enjoy it to the fullest?</p><p>Ty started moving his hips, tentatively pushing down into Zane\u2019s mouth. Zane heard and felt Ty\u2019s groan.</p><p>Zane let his hands roam as he sucked, shifting to push up against Ty\u2019s tongue, pulling down to encourage Ty to thrust harder. It worked, and Ty finally gave him a firm thrust. He was supporting himself on one arm, the fingers of his other hand wrapped around the base of Zane\u2019s cock to squeeze.</p><p>Zane went into sensory overload. With Ty\u2019s mouth around his cock and his lips closed around the head of Ty\u2019s, his ears began buzzing and pleasure built in his groin. He dug his hands into Ty\u2019s hips, dragging his fingers along his skin, then raised one knee up and worked it under Ty\u2019s arm so he could wrap his legs around Ty\u2019s torso. Ty gasped, pulling his mouth off Zane to curse under his breath and moan desperately before sucking Zane onto his tongue again.</p> <p>Even if Zane had wanted to say something, Ty was pressed too close for him to get his mouth free. Ty\u2019s measured strokes began to grow erratic as Ty sucked Zane harder. His fingers dragged along the crease of Zane\u2019s thigh and slide down to tease between his legs.</p><p>Zane hiked his leg up higher, writhing under Ty\u2019s body and moaning loudly as Ty thrust into his mouth. It was only a few more strokes before Ty groaned desperately and pushed himself up on both hands, coming almost free of Zane\u2019s mouth. \u201cZane,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo, come back,\u201d Zane breathed as he grasped Ty\u2019s hips and raised his head to take Ty back to his mouth. He licked him up and down, then ran his tongue over Ty\u2019s balls and sucked one of them into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck.\u201d Ty huffed and reached for Zane\u2019s cock, wrapping his mouth around the leaking head and starting to suck again.</p><p>After giving each one of Ty\u2019s balls thorough attention, Zane let them roll off his tongue and guided Ty\u2019s cock back between his lips. Ty groaned and thrust down into Zane\u2019s mouth, harder and deeper than before, and he sucked Zane as his fingers massaged Zane\u2019s balls.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t stop the shout, but it came out muffled as Ty\u2019s cock filled his throat. He shoved his hips upward, knees squeezing at Ty\u2019s shoulders. Ty\u2019s needy noises came nonstop. Zane\u2019s cock brushed along the back of Ty\u2019s throat.</p><p>Zane reached down to drag his fingers over Ty\u2019s shoulder in warning. The muscles shifted under his touch as Ty bent his elbow and lowered himself further, still sucking and now sliding Zane\u2019s balls against his palm. Ty\u2019s thrusts into Zane\u2019s mouth turned short and quick and hard as he began to shudder.</p><p>Zane moaned nonstop, the stimulation coming from every possible direction. He dug his fingernails into Ty\u2019s thighs. He was going to come, and he was going to do it down Ty\u2019s throat. He wanted nothing more than for Ty to do the same to him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hips stuttered to a stop before he arched his back and started to spill over Zane\u2019s tongue. Zane sucked and swallowed and moaned, burying his nose against Ty\u2019s balls, loving that Ty\u2019s cum was spurting down his throat and wondering how in the hell he had never tried this before. Ty slowly dragged his lips up, teeth grazing along the shaft of Zane\u2019s cock.</p><p>Zane sucked and swallowed as his body twisted and he shoved his hips up, chasing Ty\u2019s mouth, barely realizing he was doing it. His cock slid on Ty\u2019s tongue, and Ty jerked and inhaled in a rush before shuddering and starting to suck again.</p><p>Zane arched his back and threw his head to the side, releasing Ty\u2019s spent cock and dragging his teeth against the tender inside of Ty\u2019s thigh. Ty groaned appreciatively and Zane bit down as his orgasm washed over him, wishing like hell he could see what Ty was doing.</p><p>As the orgasm wound down, Zane\u2019s death grip on Ty\u2019s waist loosened, his teeth sliding against Ty\u2019s thigh, and his body began to relax beneath Ty\u2019s. His breaths were harsh and hard. After a long moment, Ty pushed himself to the side with a grunt and rolled off the couch to the floor. He sat with his back against it, his head coming to rest on Zane\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Zane settled his fingers in Ty\u2019s hair. \u201cThat was fun,\u201d he panted.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t comment. Zane\u2019s fingers tightened in Ty\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell couldn\u2019t you have tried that when I could watch?\u201d Ty finally gasped.</p><p>Zane began to chuckle, low and dark. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cEither get back up here with me or go get me a bottle of water,\u201d he muttered, still recovering from the full-body meltdown.</p><p>Ty\u2019s low laugh turned into a hum of approval. He knelt at Zane\u2019s side, leaning over to drop a kiss at Zane\u2019s hip before hovering over Zane again, this time face-to-face.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you make me do that before?\u201d Zane asked him. He claimed Ty\u2019s lips for a torrid kiss that prevented Ty from laughing. But Ty was grinning when he pulled back.</p><p>Zane shook his head minutely, clutching Ty to him and shifting his shoulders until they were both on their sides on the couch. Ty sighed and closed his arms around Zane. Zane raised his chin so Ty could fit his head against his chest, and he held him as close as he could get him.</p><p>His familiar smell permeated Zane\u2019s world.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, Ty?\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled against his cheek. \u201cI was an assassin,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m a Marine. I\u2019m the man who doesn\u2019t miss. And I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>Zane bit his lip on a smile.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, Zane?\u201d</p><p>Zane cocked his head. \u201cI\u2019m an artist. I\u2019m a geek.\u201d He felt Ty smile. \u201cI am one badass motherfucker on a motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>Ty began to laugh.</p><p>Zane dipped his head until they were staring into each other\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>The next day, Ty drove Zane to work and went up with him to say hello to everyone. A celebratory mood hung in the air. Zane wasn\u2019t the only one who had missed his partner.</p><p>Ty was wearing tattered jeans and a gray T-shirt with an angry elephant on it, holding a knife, that read \u201cElephants never forget, and they never forgive.\u201d It had made Zane laugh when Ty had pulled it out, and now Zane had a hard time keeping his eyes off Ty as he settled at his desk.</p><p>They weren\u2019t there for five minutes before McCoy called them into his office. Ty and Zane trudged along amidst the taunts and catcalls of their coworkers. Zane pulled the door shut behind him, and was shocked to see Richard Burns leaning against a file cabinet in the corner of the office.</p><p>\u201cGlad to see you back, Grady,\u201d McCoy said to Ty. \u201cGarrett, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Zane sat, looking between McCoy and Burns apprehensively. McCoy got up and made his way out of the office, leaving them alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make this brief,\u201d Burns said as soon as the door shut. He moved toward the desk, bending and sliding his hand underneath it.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a confused look.</p><p>Burns placed both hands on the desk. He waved Ty and Zane over, and after another moment of confusion, Ty got up to step around the other side of the desk. Zane followed. Burns spoke as they moved.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your recent exposure in the media, we\u2019re going to be taking you off undercover work permanently.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d already been warned of that much. They were in a fucking calendar, after all. Zane supposed they were just moving up the timeline after what had happened in New Orleans.</p><p>Burns pointed under the desk. Ty studied him cautiously, then knelt and peered underneath. When he looked back at Burns, his eyes had widened. Zane crouched to inspect the desk as well, and his heart stuttered when he saw a small microphone taped to the desk. A listening device.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll both be strictly investigative agents from now on,\u201d Burns said. He laid a notecard on the desk.</p><p>Your mole is here.</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart stuttered again. Burns\u2019s hand came to rest on his shoulder, squeezing hard.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re both so good at closing cases,\u201d he said with special emphasis. \u201cCarry on, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Ty took the card, crumpling it in his hand and turning away with a last glance at Burns. He nodded, his jaw tight and his eyes hard. Zane was numb, unable to process the information. One of their coworkers was spying on them. Trying to get them killed. How much did they know? How much had they seen? How were they getting their information?</p><p>They left Burns in the office, passing McCoy in the doorway. He patted Zane\u2019s back, giving him his usual friendly grin. Zane managed a smile and nod for his boss as they headed back to their desks.</p><p>Neither of them said a word. There was nothing to say, not here. Not now.</p><p>It barely registered when the elevator dinged, but when Ty straightened, Zane caught the movement. The look of concern on Ty\u2019s handsome face spurred Zane to turn.</p><p>Two men in Marine uniforms stood at the elevator, speaking with McCoy and displaying a packet of official looking papers. Burns joined the discussion when it got heated.</p><p>Alston sat on the edge of Zane\u2019s desk beside Ty to watch. \u201cThis is odd.\u201d</p><p>McCoy argued with the Marine, growing angrier until Burns finally sent him back to his office. Burns continued the discussion, but the stoic Marine merely answered with single words. Burns finally headed to McCoy\u2019s office too, pulling his cell phone out as he went.</p><p>Zane shared a glance with Ty, who shrugged.</p><p>One of the Marines took a few steps closer to the work groups and stood straight and tall. \u201cIs there a B.T. Grady present?\u201d</p><p>All eyes on the floor turned to Ty. Ty glanced around, his expression a mixture of confusion and trepidation. Then he stood, stepping away from Zane\u2019s desk. He matched the man\u2019s posture, a parody in his Converse sneakers and elephant T-shirt.</p><p>The Marine seemed startled, but he covered it quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Staff Sergeant Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady,\u201d Ty corrected.</p><p>The Marine gave a curt shake of his head and stepped forward, handing Ty a blue packet of papers. \u201cI\u2019m here to inform you that you have been recalled to active duty, Staff Sergeant, by special authority of the SOCOM initiative you agreed to when you were formerly released.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached out to take the orders, looking shell-shocked. He stared at the folded bunch of papers, then raised his head, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes briefly before looking back at the Marine. \u201cAnd what if I refuse?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen your team will be recalled without you, Staff Sergeant. And you and anyone else who refuses will spend up to three years in Leavenworth for dereliction of duty.\u201d There was no malice in the words, merely a Marine giving Ty the answer he had requested.</p><p>Ty was trying hard to keep his expression stony. \u201cThank you, Sergeant,\u201d he finally said, voice tight. The Marine turned on his heel and rejoined the other at the elevator, leaving with as little fanfare as they had arrived.</p><p>\u201cDid you just get conscripted?\u201d Lassiter asked.</p> <p>Clancy stepped forward to look at the papers. \u201cJesus Christ, can they do that?\u201d</p><p>Ty subtly turned the papers away from her and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . you\u2019re going back to the Marines?\u201d Alston stuttered. \u201cI thought SOCOM was defunct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s MARSOC now,\u201d Ty mumbled.</p><p>\u201dBut that\u2019s special operations. You don\u2019t have a choice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d He studied the orders. \u201cI report in forty-eight hours. Immediate deployment.\u201d</p><p>Zane stood. His hands shook as he gripped the edge of the desk. Ty looked up, seeking Zane out. Zane could see it in Ty\u2019s eyes. There was no choice. No way to wriggle out of it. No way for anyone to save him.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Ty,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty stared at him for a moment longer as the others broke into outraged babbling. Then Ty shook himself. He tossed the packet of orders onto the desk and stalked over to Zane.</p><p>He grabbed his face with both hands and kissed him.</p><p>The room spun to a halt. The babble ground to a stunned hush.</p> <p>Ty\u2019s hands moved to the small of his back and he held him tight, bending him just enough for Zane to have to wrap his arms around him to keep from falling. He kissed him again. In front of their coworkers. In front of King and Country and anyone who would watch. It was the first purely honest kiss they\u2019d ever shared.</p><p>And it was a kiss good-bye. </p> </body></html>"]
