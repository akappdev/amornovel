Those bodies...they just kept digging out of their graves.</p><p>And chasing a girl until she was so damn tired of running. So tired that she\u2019d consider trading her own soul, just for a few moments of safety.</p><p>Paige Sloan stared up at the high stone walls of the werewolf compound. It had been ten years since she\u2019d last been inside of those thick walls. Only she hadn\u2019t been looking for protection back then. She\u2019d been looking for love.</p> <p>Will he even remember me?</p><p>Paige stood there, trembling from the cold\u2013she hated the bone-numbing cold of Alaska\u2013and then she heard footsteps coming her way. Strong. Determined. She sucked in a deep breath and straightened her shoulders. Showtime. She just had to play this bit right and get past the guards. Paige lifted her arms into the air. \u201cI\u2019m not carrying a weapon!\u201d Better to just go ahead and get that part out early.</p><p>Werewolves could be too unpredictable. She didn\u2019t want them attacking first, then trying to get answers from her cold, lifeless body later.</p><p>The gate opened with a screech. Two men came rushing out. They weren\u2019t carrying weapons. Then again, they didn\u2019t need to carry extra firepower. If they wanted, she knew those two men could shift into powerful wolves in an instant.</p><p>Most humans didn\u2019t realize the truth about the world that surrounded them. Humans thought monsters were make-believe. Just stories to scare children in the darkness of the night.</p> <p>If only.</p><p>Paige knew monsters were real. They were the nightmares that walked the earth.</p><p>\u201cVampire...\u201d One of the men snarled the accusation at her, and just that quickly, his claws burst from his fingertips.</p><p>Under the moonlight, she saw his nostrils flare and knew the guy had caught the scent that revealed her for exactly what she was.</p><p>A monster. A vampire.</p><p>\u201cYou want to die, vamp?\u201d The other guard demanded. He was the taller of the two, with close-cropped, dark hair, and huge, hulking shoulders. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p> <p>Well, they weren\u2019t trying to rip her open yet, so that was a good sign. Paige cleared her throat and kept her hands up. \u201cTechnically, I\u2019ve already died.\u201d That was how she\u2019d become a vamp and\u2013</p><p>The smaller werewolf lunged at her. Smaller, but still wicked strong. He wrapped his claws around her neck and snapped, \u201cYou\u2019re about to die again.\u201d His dark eyes promised a world of pain.</p><p>She could do without that promise. Been there, done that. Not really interested in that scene again, thanks.</p><p>Paige didn\u2019t fight his hold, not yet. If things got desperate, then she\u2019d be the one delivering the pain. But first... \u201cDrake ...\u201d She whispered the name that had haunted her memories and a small, icy cloud appeared before her mouth. She ignored the cold and focused on what mattered right then. She needed these wolves...and their new alpha. \u201cDrake Wyler.\u201d</p><p>The werewolf holding her leaned in even closer. She could see that his blond hair was long, brushing his shoulders, and his face was all hard angles and lines. \u201cWhat do you want with the alpha?\u201d</p><p>This was the part that would be tricky. Slowly, because she didn\u2019t want to set the guys off, Paige lifted the long necklace that had fallen to rest between her breasts. She saw the blond werewolf\u2019s eyes widen as he stared at the necklace. Stared at it\u2013then hurriedly jumped the hell away from her.</p><p>That was right. No other werewolves were supposed to touch her, not when... \u201cI belong to him,\u201d Paige said simply.</p><p>And in an instant, those werewolves started tripping over themselves as they hurried to open the gate for her. Sure, they might hate her kind, but as long as she had their alpha\u2019s protection, they couldn\u2019t touch her.</p> <p>Well, not if they wanted to keep living.</p><p>Paige stared into that wolf compound. Dark. Dangerous. But, hopefully, not as deadly as what waited behind her.</p><p>And if she could just get the alpha to overlook that little matter of her vanishing for ten years...</p><p>Then maybe she\u2019d have a chance of surviving the coming days and nights.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>The werewolves took her into the heart of the compound. Right inside the big, three story house with heavy stone walls that stood starkly against the night.</p><p>They walked into the foyer, and the tap of her boots seemed to echo on the marble floor. Marble. The wolves were kicking things up a notch. Normally, the vamps were the ones who liked to throw around their money.</p><p>She glanced down at her scuffed boots. Not that I ever had money to toss at anyone or anything.</p><p>But it looked like Drake had plenty of money now. And one big, fancy house. This place wasn\u2019t where she belonged, and soon enough, she\u2019d be leaving. After she took care of a little business.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d The werewolf on her right\u2013the blond one who\u2019d wrapped his claws around her neck moments before\u2013was pointing to the stairs.</p><p>She nodded quickly and followed him up those winding stairs. Then they hurried down a hallway. Turned around a corner. As they headed down that quiet hallway, Paige got a really, really bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. \u201cAre you taking me to Drake\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>The werewolf beside her, the dark-haired one, just grunted.</p><p>That bad feeling got worse. This looked like private quarters to her. Like they were taking her\u2013</p><p>A door jerked open to her left. And then, right there, bigger and even sexier than she remembered, with wide shoulders that brushed the edges of the doorframe, a muscled and bare chest, a wild curl of black hair, and eyes that blazed golden fire...right there stood the werewolf alpha, Drake Wyler.</p><p>The man she\u2019d loved and lost before.</p><p>The man she needed now.</p><p>But at that moment, he stared at her with so much fury she almost felt the heat of his glittering gaze burn her skin.</p><p>\u201cPaige.\u201d Her name was a growl of rage. Okay, so coming here hadn\u2019t been the best idea but\u2013</p><p>His nostrils flared.</p><p>Hell. Her whole body tensed. With werewolves, their sense of smell was so strong that it only took one whiff to realize... \u201cVampire.\u201d The word was a curse.</p><p>She didn\u2019t flinch. Well, perhaps she did. When he\u2019d known her before, his voice had always been softened with need, with love.</p><p>Not hardened with deadly rage.</p><p>He grabbed her, not with his claws out, like the other werewolf had, but Drake wrapped his hands around her shoulders and pulled her over the threshold of the room\u2013and into his arms.</p><p>Then he kissed her. His lips pressed down on hers, and because she\u2019d wanted him, for so long, Paige kissed him back. Her mouth opened beneath his. Her tongue met his, and the desire that only Drake seemed to be able to stir burned through her.</p><p>Her heart raced. Her hips arched toward him even as her nipples tightened against his chest. One kiss...and she craved. It was the way it had always been with them. She\u2019d never wanted anything more than she wanted him.</p><p>And she\u2019d never been meant to have anything less.</p><p>His tongue slid over her lower lip. Stroked into her mouth. Her wolf had become an even better kisser over the years. Seducing, taking, and making her want so much more. Making her\u2013</p><p>Drake\u2019s head lifted. He stared down at her\u2013with that strong, chiseled face that often slipped into her dreams, a face that had a few more fine lines now, but the same square jaw, the same high cheekbones, and the same sensual but slightly cruel lips. His eyes blazed so brightly, and she could see the same raw lust she felt reflected in his stare.</p><p>The years hadn\u2019t changed the way he felt. He still needed, just as much as she did. He still\u2013</p><p>\u201cGuess that means she is yours...\u201d The blond werewolf behind them muttered. \u201cA vampire...with a werewolf, how twisted is\u2013\u201d</p><p>Drake pushed Paige away and grabbed the wolf in one fast, brutal move. \u201cI saw your claw marks on her throat.\u201d</p><p>Paige lifted her hand and touched the skin. She felt the light wetness of her own blood. Huh. She hadn\u2019t even noticed the sting. After all she\u2019d experienced in the last ten years, what did few scratches matter?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ever touch her.\u201d Drake tossed the guy down the hallway. The smaller werewolf\u2019s head thudded into a wall. \u201cYou come at her with your claws again, Michael, and I\u2019ll rip you open.\u201d</p><p>Ah, all right, so Drake thought that the scratches mattered. She hadn\u2019t remembered him being quite so blood-thirsty.</p><p>He swung back toward her. The lust and fury were still battling in his eyes. This wasn\u2019t the man she\u2019d fallen for all those years ago. The guy staring back at her\u2013he was a primal wolf.</p><p>\u201cMake sure no one disturbs me,\u201d Drake ordered and he stalked back toward her. She should speak. Say something. She hadn\u2019t said a word to the guy yet. Maybe she should start with something like...Hi, there, long time, no see. You might wonder why I disappeared without a word. I\u2019ve got a really good story to tell you.</p><p>More like a nightmare tale. A nightmare that she\u2019d just brought to his door.</p><p>And the door closed behind him with a soft click. Her gaze flew around the room. She\u2019d been right. This was definitely a bedroom. Complete with one huge, rumpled bed. But at least it looked like Drake had been sleeping alone. If there\u2019d been a she-wolf in there with him, Paige might have just let her own claws out.</p><p>When he touched her, she jumped. Paige wanted to hide her fear, but being a werewolf, he could probably smell the scent on her. Werewolves had such damn superior senses. Better than anyone or anything else in the world.</p><p>His fingers brushed over the curve of her breasts. The guy had to slow down. This couldn\u2019t happen. Not yet anyway. They had to talk first. \u201cDrake, I\u2013\u201d</p><p>He lifted the necklace. Stared at the heavy gold etched with the carving of a wolf\u2019s head.</p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing this?\u201d Drake asked her, his voice the rumbling mix of darkness and lust that had always been able to make her yearn.</p><p>She was yearning already, but she pushed back the need and focused on what the guy was saying. Her necklace. He\u2019d given it to her when she\u2019d turned nineteen. The day he\u2019d told her what he really was.</p><p>Werewolf.</p><p>That had been the day when her life had started to spiral out of control.</p><p>Time to woman up and talk. She swiped her tongue over her lips, tasted him, and managed to say, \u201cY-you told me...you said a werewolf would never attack me if I wore it.\u201d The necklace had been a sign of pack protection.</p><p>His strong, tanned fingers closed around the necklace. Then he yanked and broke the gold chain in one vicious tug that seemed to claw across her heart. \u201cI told you,\u201d he said, voice even darker, \u201cthat this necklace meant you belonged to me.\u201d</p><p>Ah, right, that rage was burning so bright in him.</p><p>\u201cBut then you left.\u201d A muscle jerked in Drake\u2019s jaw. \u201cDisappeared.\u201d</p><p>Paige backed up a step. When a werewolf this big and angry was coming at you, a smart woman backed the hell up.</p><p>\u201cYou vanished,\u201d his fingers had whitened around the necklace, \u201cwhen you were supposed to be mine.\u201d</p><p>Yes, a human named Paige Sloan had promised to love him, always. But then she\u2019d stopped being a human, and she\u2019d become the one thing that she knew he hated.</p><p>Vampire.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t taste like death,\u201d Drake told her.</p><p>She flinched at the cold and brutal words. Werewolves always were saying that vamps smelled and tasted like death\u2013that was one of their many insults. So why hadn\u2019t she expected that slam from him? Her chin lifted. \u201cAnd right now, you don\u2019t look particularly furry.\u201d She\u2019d never actually seen him shift. She didn\u2019t want to, either. Paige squared her shoulders and held his gaze. \u201cI guess we\u2019re both full of surprises, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can fucking say that again.\u201d</p><p>Her back teeth clenched together. She hadn\u2019t expected the guy to run to her, wrap her in his arms, and immediately swear his undying love. She\u2019d let that dream die a long time ago. But, jeez, did he want to rip her soul out or what? \u201cLook, I know you aren\u2019t exactly happy to see me\u2013\u201d</p><p>He advanced. She backed up once more. The last thing she wanted was for him to put those big, warm hands of his on her again. When he touched her, her body went into sexual overdrive. She\u2019d gone way too long without a lover.</p><p>No one but him.</p><p>Right. Too damn long.</p><p>But lust had to wait. For now.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how long I looked for you?\u201d Drake demanded. She could see the edge of his fangs. Probably not a good sign. What was that saying in the vamp world? When you saw a wolf\u2019s fangs, you were about to see hell. He shook his head slowly and said, \u201cYou vanished.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d wanted to leave him. But he\u2019d been marked to be the next alpha of his pack and she\u2019d been\u2013</p><p>Bitten.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you wanted a vampire turning up on your doorstep.\u201d Some of her own anger\u2013the anger she usually worked so hard to keep in check\u2013broke through her fraying control. \u201cEven if I was a vamp that you used to screw.\u201d</p><p>He pounced. She should have expected the move, but she\u2019d been around humans too long, and werewolves, damn, they could move fast.</p><p>In two seconds, he had her on his bed, sprawled amidst the covers, while he held her arms penned to the mattress. \u201cYou weren\u2019t a vampire then.\u201d</p><p>His muscled body pressed against her. No, correction, his aroused body pressed against her. There was no mistaking the bulge of his cock.</p><p>\u201cYou were human then,\u201d he said, and his hold tightened around her. \u201cNot vampire, not\u2013\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What she\u2019d been didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire now.\u201d His sworn enemy. Only...he still wanted her. She\u2019d thought werewolves were supposed to be repulsed by her kind. She\u2019d sure been told that often enough.</p><p>The voice from her nightmares whispered through her mind, saying, \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll ever want you again? One look, one taste...as soon as he knows what you are, you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t be able to rise again.</p><p>She waited to feel claws at her throat again. Because she didn\u2019t want to see this end, Paige closed her eyes. She\u2019d remember him as he used to be. If only Drake could remember her the same way.</p> <p>Some dreams just weren\u2019t meant to come true.</p><p>Paige took a breath, tasted him\u2013strength, power, man\u2013and waited for her second death to come.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>A ghost lay beneath him. A ghost who\u2019d haunted more nightmares than Drake could count.</p><p>She was as still as a statue, her features pale and perfect. High, curving cheekbones, a small, pert nose, and lush, red lips made for sin. Her hair\u2013dark as the night he\u2019d always loved\u2013tangled around her face.</p> <p>And she didn\u2019t move. Barely seemed to breathe.</p><p>Why?</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Paige whispered, her voice still that same combination of sin and seduction that had driven him to the edge too many times in the past. \u201cJust...make it fast.\u201d</p><p>He really hoped she wasn\u2019t talking about sex. With her, fast hadn\u2019t ever been an option. He\u2019d always needed to take her again and again, to erupt inside of her, to lose himself.</p><p>She lifted one eyelid just a bit. Her green gaze darted over him. \u201cYou\u2019re not...you\u2019re not killing me?\u201d</p><p>What. The. Fuck. It took every ounce of his will-power to hold back the rage that threatened to swamp him. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he managed to snarl.</p> <p>Paige trembled beneath him. Her slender body had trembled beneath his before, but back then, those little shivers had been from pleasure.</p><p>Not fear.</p><p>He could all but smell the fear covering her. He hated that smell on her.</p><p>\u201cHow.\u201d Drake bit off the world. How had she become a vampire? Had she chosen this life? Some humans wanted to be vampires. They went out seeking the bite because they wanted to live forever.</p><p>Fools. The price of forever was a river of blood and death.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought Paige would be like those desperate humans. He also hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d vanish and leave him aching for her\u2013ten damn years.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she told him and both of her eyes opened fully as she gazed up at him. \u201cI can\u2019t change what I am.\u201d</p><p>The scent of her blood filled his nostrils. When he got hold of Michael again, he was gonna give that claw-happy werewolf some marks to remember him by. You don\u2019t touch her.</p> <p>Drake caught both of her wrists in his left hand and raised them over her head. She wasn\u2019t fighting him, and as a vampire, her delicate form was hiding one hell of a lot of strength.</p><p>She just stared up at him, reminding him of all the stupid dreams he\u2019d once had...and lost.</p><p>He\u2019d almost left his pack for her. He\u2019d wanted to be human. For her.</p><p>But now, the beast was in charge. There was no going back. There was only blood, death, and darkness.</p><p>For both of them.</p><p>He gazed down at her, trying to figure out when she\u2019d stopped being human and become a vampire. She\u2019d been nineteen the last time he saw her. He\u2019d been twenty-one.</p><p>Right then, Paige\u2019s skin was still flawless and pure, giving no hint to her real age.</p><p>What did her age matter? She was right. There was no going back. Not for either of them.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to glare at me all night?\u201d Paige asked. \u201cOr do you want to know why I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>Why she was there...and still wearing his medallion. Or she had been wearing it, until he\u2019d taken it from her neck. It was on the floor now. He\u2019d dropped it when he\u2019d pushed her onto the bed. Paige\u2019s neck was bare, and...why the hell did he want to bend down and lick her flesh?</p><p>Because I still want her. More than breath. More than life. He saw her, and he needed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He didn\u2019t lift his body off hers. Paige would feel his aroused flesh pressing against her. So what? If she wanted a favor from him, she\u2019d pay the price he demanded.</p><p>And I demand her.</p><p>Vampire or not, she was still his.</p><p>Even death couldn\u2019t change some things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being hunted,\u201d she told him in that low, husky voice that made his cock swell even more. He could just see the hint of her fangs behind her red lips. The sight should have repulsed him. It didn\u2019t. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help me, I\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already dead.\u201d That knowledge made him feel as if his chest had been ripped open. Since Paige had been human when he\u2019d known her before, she must have been made into a vampire.</p><p>A rare few, the purebloods, were actually born as vamps, but the rest of the parasites out there? They\u2019d been turned. They were bled until the point of death, then brought back as a vampire.</p><p>Drake would kill the one who\u2019d turned her. He couldn\u2019t wait to hear the vampire\u2019s screams.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Paige snapped at him, then she showed him just how strong she really was. She twisted beneath him and yanked her hands free. A fast roll sent them tumbling across the bed. Then she was on top of him. Her knees straddled his hips, and her hands slammed down against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m as alive as you are!\u201d</p><p>Color stained her cheeks. Her breath heaved out. For an instant, they just stared at each other. Then she grabbed his hand and shoved it against her breasts.</p><p>\u201cMy heart still beats,\u201d she told him and he could feel the frantic beat beneath his hand. That fast beat...and that sweet, plump flesh. Paige was curved in all the right places.</p><p>\u201cI breathe,\u201d she told him and he heard the rush of her breath. \u201cI feel. More than you can imagine, all right? So stop treating me like shit!\u201d</p><p>Maybe if she\u2019d stop clawing his heart out...</p><p>But then, she was doing that just by breathing. Just by being there. Close enough to take...</p><p>So take her. The growl was from his beast, one that was never far from the surface these days.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to protect you.\u201d He held the beast back, barely, because they had a deal to strike. He knew how these bargains worked in the supernatural world. So much could be bartered and exchanged. Flesh. Blood. Sex. Souls.</p><p>Sure, humans might be shocked by a deal like this\u2013but then, humans would be shocked to see a man turn into a wolf.</p><p>Deal with it.</p><p>\u201cYou came to me, to my pack,\u201d he said slowly, determined not to let his rage escape, not yet, \u201cbecause you want us to keep you safe.\u201d And he would. He\u2013</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>Drake frowned. If not for protection, then\u2013</p><p>\u201cI want you to kill the bastard after me.\u201d Her fangs seemed to lengthen. \u201cI want you to rip his head off, and I want you to make damn sure that he never rises again.\u201d</p><p>Never rises again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a vampire you want me to fight.\u201d He\u2019d grown used to battling them. In this part of Alaska, where the cold could creep straight to the bone, where darkness could reign for days and days...this part was home to all manner of supernatural beasts.</p><p>The ones at the top of the food chain? The wolves...and the vamps who kept trying to fight them for supremacy. A supremacy they weren\u2019t ever getting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a vampire I want you to behead.\u201d Her breath rushed out. \u201cA vampire named Gabe is the one who made me, he\u2019s\u2013\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s claws burst from his fingertips and sliced into the bedding. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking already dead.\u201d As far as Drake was concerned, the vamp\u2013Gabe\u2013had died the instant he put his fangs in Paige.</p><p>Her gaze held his, and he saw the worry there. \u201cGabe is a pureblood. He\u2019s strong, he\u2019s\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo match for an alpha.\u201d Didn\u2019t she get it? He wasn\u2019t the boy she\u2019d left behind. He was a warrior. A monster. A walking nightmare.</p><p>Since she\u2019d left him, he\u2019d seen more blood and hell than she could possibly imagine. No, he\u2019d always known the blood and hell...Paige had been the only thing that had been good in his life.</p><p>Sweet. Pure.</p><p>Then she\u2019d left him, and he\u2019d gone back to the darkness.</p><p>She won\u2019t leave again.</p><p>He stared up at her. He could move her easily enough, but he didn\u2019t want to do so. He wanted to keep her just where she was, only he\u2019d like to remove a few of her clothes. Or all of them.</p><p>But business came first. \u201cWhat will you do for me?\u201d Drake demanded.</p><p>She blinked. Vampires weren\u2019t supposed to look so innocent. \u201cI...um...\u201d</p><p>He smiled and knew that his own sharpened teeth would flash. \u201cDeath doesn\u2019t come for free. In the supernatural world, there\u2019s always a price.\u201d</p><p>He heard the slight hitch of her breath. \u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d</p><p>You.</p><p>But he wanted to play the game longer and see just what she\u2019d offer him. \u201cWhat have you got?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to his chest, but while she wasn\u2019t looking at him, her slender shoulders straightened in a move he remembered. Pride. \u201cI have some money. Not much, but a few thousand that I can pay\u2013\u201d</p><p>Drake laughed at that. A hard, deep laugh that sent her bouncing on him. Really? A few thousand to take out a vamp? She didn\u2019t quite understand the paranormal market value. Most assassins wouldn\u2019t touch a vamp for less than fifty grand.</p><p>Unless those assassins were werewolves.</p><p>Sometimes we do those hits for free. Depending on the vamp...and the blood and death that the bastard had left in his wake.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t need to know about the free hits. That knowledge wouldn\u2019t work in his favor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2013I can fight with you. Help your pack.\u201d Her gaze rose to meet his and a light flush still covered her cheeks. Her voice had hardened, probably because she was pissed by his laughter. \u201cHaving a vampire on your side wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>The laughter faded away and Drake knew his gaze hardened as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want your strength.\u201d She\u2019d always had strength, even as a human. A solid core that had drawn him to her. Paige\u2019s parents had both been killed when she was just thirteen. They\u2019d only been in Alaska for a little over a year before their accident. Her parents had promised her that they\u2019d all get a fresh start in America\u2019s last frontier.</p><p>They\u2019d only gotten death.</p><p>After their funeral, he knew that she\u2019d bounced around the foster care system and never found a real home. But all that pain, it had never weakened her.</p><p>Wolves were attracted to strength.</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>Did she realize that her nails were digging into his shoulders? The wolf inside growled.</p><p>He liked that.</p><p>Time to take what he wanted. Drake stared up at her and said, \u201cI want to fuck you.\u201d Endlessly. Again and again until the ache for her, that damn gnawing ache that had kept his body tense and hungry for her\u2013for years\u2013finally vanished.</p><p>She stared down at him. Swallowed.</p><p>And nodded.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>So, what? Did the wolf think that she was gonna pull some kind of shocked, Oh, no, you can\u2019t have sex with me! routine on him? When she\u2019d been dreaming about him for so long?</p><p>Guess again, wolf. If he beheaded that sick freak Gabe and gave her the passion that she\u2019d been yearning for, well that was just win-win in her book.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to look too eager. A girl had her pride, after all, and she\u2019d already had to come dragging into his compound looking for some werewolf strength.</p><p>Paige swallowed back that eagerness and slowly said, \u201cWell, I guess once we can\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once, sweet, not even close.\u201d</p><p>Sweet. He\u2019d called her that, so long before. Only then the word had drifted with affection, and not held the tight, tense edge that honed the endearment now.</p><p>\u201cH-how many times?\u201d So she could plan. Savor.</p><p>His eyes burned up at her. His cock was also shoving right at the junction of her legs. It was all she could do not to rub against him. If she told him that there\u2019d never been anyone since him, Drake wouldn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>Even if the words were the truth.</p><p>Her body was starving. She was already wet for him. Just the touch of his hands had sent a shiver sliding over her. She wanted more. Just how much more would she get?</p><p>\u201cAs many times as I want,\u201d Drake told her, voice rough and dark. \u201cUntil you can\u2019t breathe without feeling me on every inch of your body.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples ached. She wanted his hands on them. His mouth.</p><p>Did he smell her arousal? Those wolves...</p><p>His lips curled in the faintest of smiles. Damn him, he did.</p><p>His hands rose and tangled in her hair. He began to pull her toward him. Toward his mouth.</p><p>Her heartbeat drummed in her ears. They had a deal, and finally, she\u2019d have him.</p><p>His lips were so close. She could already taste him on her tongue. Would taste him. And he\u2019d taste her. He\u2019d\u2013</p><p>A shrill alarm cut through the room.</p><p>Sonofbitch.</p><p>She blinked, confused, aroused and\u2013</p><p>Drake pushed her to the side of the bed and jumped to his feet. \u201cStay here,\u201d he ordered and rushed for the door as the alarm kept shrieking.</p><p>Stay? She was a vampire, not a dog. Paige jumped up and raced after him.</p><p>He was already thundering down the stairs. More men and women were out now, all racing toward the main level of the house. She joined them, and hoped no one decided to attack the vamp in their midst. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFire!\u201d Someone shouted even as she caught the scent of smoke drifting in the air.</p><p>Then they were shoving open the front doors and hurrying into the darkness that waited outside of the main house. She saw the flames then, rising quickly, burning right up that thick wall that surrounded their compound. Red and gold flames, burning in a world of snow.</p><p>Paige stumbled to a stop even as the wolves fought the blaze. They had buckets of water. Hoses. The water blasted at the flames, but the fire kept attacking all around the compound walls. To the left. To the right.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t escape me.\u201d Gabe\u2019s words rang in her ears. He\u2019d warned her of this, so many times. He\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019ll find you and destroy anyone who gets in my way.\u201d</p><p>Someone bumped into her and Paige jerked, then she realized\u2013I can\u2019t just stand here. She\u2019d seen this type of attack before. It was Gabe\u2019s specialty. Distract and conquer. He\u2019d been using this technique for centuries.</p><p>Gabe...or rather, Gabriel, had been born long ago, in the midst of battles and carnage. War was what he knew, what he craved.</p><p>When it came to fighting strategies, he liked to think he was a master. The pureblood vamp was always plotting and planning.</p><p>The wolves didn\u2019t realize that this was just a trick. They were scattering. Each going to a different spot to fight the flames. Each\u2013vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d Paige screamed.</p><p>No one listened to her.</p><p>More water. More fire.</p><p>\u201cStop! They\u2019re coming for you!\u201d An attack that had been planned for far too long. She ran forward and grabbed the arm of one woman, a chick with long red hair. \u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d</p><p>The woman spun around and her eyes widened. \u201cVampire.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was. \u201cAnd more of my kind are coming. Move away from the walls! Get ready.\u201d</p> <p>Because Gabe didn\u2019t fight fair. He never had.</p><p>Thunder rumbled. Someone screamed. No, no, that wasn\u2019t thunder. In the wild confusion of the fire, that was someone shooting. A man fell to the ground as blood covered the snow behind him.</p><p>Gabe always planned so well.</p><p>She looked up, her gaze flying along the length of the burning walls. There, to the left. Covered in darkness, she could just see the outline of the shooter.</p><p>Only...he wasn\u2019t the only one up there.</p><p>Paige pushed the woman away. \u201cGet back!\u201d Paige yelled because she knew those guns would be loaded with silver bullets. The fire was just the bait. Carefully placed and targeted to draw out the wolves...</p><p>So they could be taken out easier.</p><p>She raced forward and leapt up that wall. As a human, she never would have been able to make that climb. The wall was at least fifteen feet high. As a vamp\u2013</p> <p>Two seconds. That was all it took.</p><p>The gunman turned on her. Fired.</p><p>The silver bullet tore right through her shoulder. She gasped at the pain, and, somewhere below her, she heard a roar. \u201cTry...harder,\u201d Paige gritted out to the shooter as she snatched the gun from him. Then she shot him, right in the heart.</p><p>He fell off the wall, tumbling down below.</p><p>The vamp wouldn\u2019t be dead, not from a silver bullet hit. He\u2019d just be stunned for a while.</p><p>More gunshots. More screams.</p><p>She whirled around, balancing easily on top of the wall. More vamp shooters had positioned themselves, carefully hiding away from the flames. But the wolves were seeing them now. They were launching at the vamps, trying to take them out.</p><p>They just had to take them out faster.</p><p>Because there was blood on the ground. Injured shifters crying out in pain. And vamps were always attracted to that blood...</p><p>Her fangs burned in her mouth as they stretched and sharpened. An instinctive response to the scent of blood. She hurried along the wall\u2019s edge, being careful to stay away from those flames. She had her eyes on another gunman. That jerk waited just five feet away, aiming down below. Her gaze darted to the right as she tracked his target. The vamp was\u2013</p><p>Aiming at Drake.</p><p>No! Drake was rushing toward her, not even looking over at the gunman. \u201cGet down!\u201d She yelled at Drake, and she slammed her body into the vamp\u2019s.</p><p>His gun fired. The bullet thundered as it exploded from the weapon.</p><p>The vampire laughed. \u201cGot the alpha. Fuckin\u2019 got him in the heart!\u201d</p><p>She drove her fist into his jaw. She heard bones snap and wasn\u2019t sure if that snapping was from the breaking of her own fingers or his jaw.</p><p>Her gaze lifted and flew to the area below. \u201cDrake!\u201d He was on the ground. Not moving.</p><p>The vamp\u2019s gun had fallen into the snow near the bottom of the wall. Didn\u2019t matter. She could deal with this jerk. He\u2019d shot Drake. She grabbed for the stake that she kept in her left boot, strapped to her ankle. The vamp was twisting and fighting, and the ledge of the wall was barely a foot across and\u2013</p><p>They both tumbled off the wall\u2013falling not toward the inside of the compound, with the werewolves, but back outside.</p><p>When they hit the ground, Paige landed on top of the vamp. Even with the snow to cushion them, the thud of the impact shook through her body.</p><p>When she sucked in a deep breath, the vampire drove his knee into her stomach.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d the vamp snarled. But he wasn\u2019t just any vamp. Henry DeVeau. She knew him. Had always hated the prick. He liked to torture his victims. The way he\u2019d tortured her.Henry was Gabe\u2019s number one attack vamp. A sadistic bastard who deserved to burn forever.</p><p>\u201cYou thought you\u2019d be safe,\u201d Henry spat the words at her as he punched out with his ham-like fists. \u201cYou thought he\u2019d save you, but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Paige gasped out because, what did she have to lose now? No one else would hear what she said to Henry. The wolves were too busy fighting the flames and the other shooters. \u201cI thought I\u2019d save him.\u201d Because she\u2019d known that Gabe\u2019s attack on the wolves was coming. She\u2019d known that he was going after Drake.</p><p>So I wanted to be at Drake\u2019s side, to keep him safe.</p><p>The bargain she\u2019d made hadn\u2019t been about her protection, not really. It had been about his.</p><p>But she\u2019d failed him. After only a few damn minutes, she\u2019d failed.</p><p>Henry\u2019s thick brow lowered in confusion. \u201cWhat? You\u2013\u201d</p><p>She had the stake in her hand. She rushed forward\u2013and drove it into Henry\u2019s heart. \u201cI loved him,\u201d she whispered as she twisted that stake. She had once loved him more than anything else in this world, but Henry and Gabe had taken Drake from her. Then, and now. \u201cSo you burn, asshole, burn.\u201d</p><p>Blood dripped from Henry\u2019s mouth, and she saw the light fade from his eyes as the bastard took his last gasp of breath.</p><p>And she smiled. A cold puff of air appeared near her face. She was still breathing. Henry would never breathe again.</p><p>The other vamps were racing away now, disappearing into the surrounding woods as quickly as they could\u2013and vamps could run so very fast.</p><p>Time to chase.</p><p>She\u2019d shown her true allegiance, and if she didn\u2019t give chase, they\u2019d all be coming for her head\u2013or her heart.</p><p>Paige yanked up her stake. Barely glanced at the blood on the wood and\u2013</p><p>Hard arms wrapped her around. She lifted her weapon, ready to take another heart herself.</p><p>But Drake stared down at her. His face was stark white, and his eyes glowed with the power of his beast.</p><p>His wolf wasn\u2019t the only one straining for freedom. Some of the others had already shifted. Paige could hear wolf howls now as the beasts hunted the vampires. Big, furry beasts raced over the snow.</p><p>When had they shifted? She hadn\u2019t even noticed. She\u2019d been too intent on killing Henry. On getting vengeance because he\u2019d shot Drake.</p><p>\u201cGot the alpha. Fuckin\u2019 got \u2018him in in the heart!\u201d Henry had been so certain of his hit. Unlike vampires, wolves couldn\u2019t survive a shot of silver to the heart.</p><p>So how was Drake still alive?</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his chest. A chest he\u2019d clawed open\u2013to get the bullet out.</p><p>Oh, damn. That was just brutal.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d His voice was guttural. His hands locked around her shoulders and pulled her against him. \u201cI saw you go over the wall...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her body was trembling. He\u2019s alive. \u201cI-I was just trying to stop him. I didn\u2019t want him to\u2013\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s lips took hers. Not gentle. Not soft.</p><p>Hard. Wild. Rough.</p><p>There was desperation in his kiss, and so much lust.</p><p>The sounds of the wolves were all around them. The thudding of their paws on the snow. The howls that broke the night.</p><p>It was cold out there, bitterly cold, but she barely felt the ice around her. Right then, she was burning hot.</p><p>Drake lifted his head. Stared down at her. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>Um, that wasn\u2019t a promise she could make. She\u2019d keep fighting, until the threats to him were gone. She wasn\u2019t the running type, not anymore.</p><p>He kept a tight hold on her, smearing his blood over her clothes, and he turned to face the wolves who\u2019d gathered around them. Smoke drifted in the air, but most of the flames were out, for now.</p><p>\u201cFind them,\u201d he shouted. \u201cHunt them!\u201d</p><p>Some wolves were already in the woods, hunting. But vampires were good hunters, too.</p><p>\u201cFind them,\u201d Drake said again, and his voice cut through the night, \u201cand kill them.\u201d</p><p>The wolves howled.</p><p>Paige knew that the final war between the vampires and werewolves had begun.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>She could have fucking died.</p><p>Drake pulled Paige through the main house, making sure not to let her go, not even for an instant. The woman wasn\u2019t getting away from him, hell, no.</p><p>When he\u2019d looked up and seen her on that wall, with that vampire bastard attacking her...</p><p>He\u2019d roared her name.</p><p>Then the vamp had shot him. The silver had burned, ripping and tearing through him as he fell to the ground. When Drake had looked up again, it had been to see Paige tumbling right over the edge of the wall.</p><p>Drake rounded the corner and shoved open the door that led to his quarters.</p><p>\u201cDrake, look, I\u2013\u201d</p><p>In an instant, he spun on her. \u201cYou knew they were attacking.\u201d</p><p>Did she look paler than before? It seemed so. Even the red of her lips had faded to a light pink. She stared up at him and gave a slow nod.</p><p>Shit. Why couldn\u2019t she have lied? He didn\u2019t want to know that she\u2019d set him up.</p><p>Because then he\u2019d have to punish her.</p><p>He headed to the left. He had blood on his hands, and he\u2019d already smeared that blood on her. When he touched her again, he wanted his hands clean.</p><p>All he could smell was blood. His blood. The blood of the wolves who\u2019d been attacked. The blood of the bastard she\u2019d staked. And...</p><p>Her blood.</p><p>She\u2019d seemed paler than before.</p><p>He whirled back to face her. As she stumbled, he picked her up and held her close against his chest. She\u2019s a vampire, but she can still die. The scent of her blood was too strong. \u201cWhere\u2019s the wound?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her arm to her shoulder. Her hair had fallen forward, covering the injury, and he swept the mane back, then cursed at the sight of her flesh.</p><p>A bullet had torn through her shoulder.</p><p>Why the hell wasn\u2019t she healing? Vampires usually healed fast enough when they were injured.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t healing.</p><p>He took her into his bathroom. Put her down next to the shower that could easily hold three people, though he only preferred an intimate two. Then he tore open her shirt and tossed away the scraps of material so that he could see her wound.</p><p>But...it wasn\u2019t the only wound that he found on her body. There were faint white lines on her flesh, snaking up her stomach. Sliding down her left arm. Scars. Old injuries.</p><p>Vampires didn\u2019t scar. Those marks...she must have gotten them while she was still human.</p><p>He knelt on the marble tile so that his eyes were level with hers. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and glanced away. Then, voice whisper-soft, Paige said, \u201cNothing that matters now.\u201d</p><p>Every single thing about her mattered.</p><p>He put his hand on her shoulder, being careful not to touch the bloody wound. She still flinched.</p><p>Because he\u2019d hurt her...or because he\u2019d touched her? She\u2019d once begged for his touch. But that had been long ago.</p><p>Another damn life.</p><p>Locking his back teeth, Drake gritted, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you healing?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and still didn\u2019t look him in the eyes.</p><p>He reached behind her and yanked on the water in the shower. The water thundered out in a hot rush and steam began to drift in the air. He didn\u2019t worry about another attack interrupting them, not then. He\u2019d put extra guards on sentry duty. The vamps wouldn\u2019t be getting close again.</p><p>They\u2019d just be dying soon.</p><p>\u201cToo much blood loss can kill a vamp.\u201d He knew because he\u2019d killed his share that way before. A slow, painful death. Some folks deserved that kind of death.</p><p>Some didn\u2019t.</p><p>The vamps who\u2019d killed his family? They\u2019d deserved every single moment of agony that he\u2019d given to them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost stopped bleeding,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d She glanced toward the water.</p><p>He put his hand on the curve of her waist. \u201cYou need blood.\u201d No way to get around that. She\u2019d been hurt, and she\u2019d bled too much. For a vamp to get her strength back and heal, she\u2019d need to drink.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...\u201d She gave a rough laugh that was nothing like the light, happy peal she\u2019d once had, \u201cSomething tells me that wolves don\u2019t exactly keep extra blood bags around for the vamp company that comes calling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, they didn\u2019t.</p><p>But if she needed blood...his gaze locked on her mouth.

Too many.</p><p>So why was he even thinking about offering her his throat?</p><p>Because it\u2019s her. And because she saved your ass out there. No matter what else she might be doing or planning, Paige had stopped the vamp from firing that silver into his heart. A few more inches to the right, and Drake knew he would\u2019ve been dead.</p><p>She\u2019d saved him and wasn\u2019t that worth a few drops of blood?</p><p>He caught her chin. Lifted her head. Her gaze found his, finally. The water flowed behind her, and that steam heated the air. \u201cTake from me,\u201d he told her. When an alpha gave an order, that order was obeyed. No question.</p> <p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cUm, take what?\u201d</p><p>He caught her fingers\u2013damn, her skin was soft\u2013and lifted them to his throat. \u201cTake.\u201d He could handle this for a few minutes. He\u2019d lock down his mind. Pretend he wasn\u2019t being used as food and\u2013</p><p>She snatched her hand back. Horror had her green eyes widening. \u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>She sure as hell could. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the fangs, sweet, just sink them in.\u201d Not like this was her first bite. She must have bled plenty of humans in her time. Bastards.</p><p>Without blood, vamps would turn to dust.</p><p>But she was shaking her head at him. \u201cI-I\u2019ll just take a quick shower and wash up. I\u2019ll heal soon, and everything will be\u2013\u201d</p> <p>Well, damn, didn\u2019t she want his blood? Now he was starting to feel insulted. \u201cDrink from me.\u201d Her whole body was shaking. She needed blood. Take it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gonna sit there while she got weaker. He could help her. Her fangs would sink into his flesh, and she\u2019d feed on him. The other wolves would think he was insane for offering his neck to her. So what? Screw them.</p><p>This was for her.</p><p>Only she was still shaking her head and looking like he\u2019d just shoved a snake at her face. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got something against shifter blood?\u201d Which wouldn\u2019t make a bit of sense. Paranormals had blood that was far more powerful than that of humans.</p><p>And vamps were always about power.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his throat. He saw her eyes widen. Saw the flicker of raw hunger on her face. She wanted his blood. No missing that.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she taking it?</p> <p>\u201cY-you don\u2019t...understand...\u201d Her gaze was still on his neck. \u201cDrinking is...\u201d</p><p>His hands curled around her waist. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about all the men you\u2019ve tasted.\u201d Because he\u2019d just want to give those jerkoffs a whole world of hurt. Her mouth, on them. His beast roared. Kill. \u201cJust...do it.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter held a wild edge. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me! I can\u2019t!\u201d Her voice dropped as she confessed, \u201cBecause I never have before.\u201d</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>The words were a lie. They had to be. Drake\u2019s hands tightened on her. \u201cYou\u2019re a vamp. You have to drink to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from a live s-source.\u201d Her lips quivered. \u201cI\u2019ve never...When I drink, I-I use blood bags. I don\u2019t take from people! Not directly.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. He\u2019d heard the rumors and whispers about some vamps going all bite-free and trying to blend better with the rest of the world. A newer, more human-friendly vamp.</p><p>He\u2019d thought those stories were bullshit.</p><p>The vamps who\u2019d attacked him tonight sure hadn\u2019t been the blending variety.</p><p>\u201cJust...give me a few minutes,\u201d Paige told him. She pulled away. Stripped off the rest of her clothes\u2013sweet hell\u2013then stepped into the huge shower with its curtain of steam. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>The hell she would.</p><p>She was in his home, back with him, and he was supposed to just stand back while she needed?</p><p>His jaw clenched as he gritted out, \u201cWe don\u2019t have blood bags.\u201d Why would they? It wasn\u2019t like werewolves entertained vamps. No blood bags on the premises, and there wasn\u2019t any damn way to get them right then.</p><p>Her body slid beneath the pounding water. Paige sighed softly and the sound was like a stroke right over his cock.</p><p>As she turned beneath the spray, letting the water pour down her back, her eyes began to drift closed. Did she really think he was just gonna walk away? He hadn\u2019t bothered to put on a shirt when he\u2019d raced outside. No shirt, no shoes. Just a pair of jeans stained with blood. His hands went to the snap.</p><p>When his zipper eased down with a hiss, her eyelids flew back open.</p><p>Ah, heard that, did you? A vamp\u2019s hearing was almost as good as a shifter\u2019s.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>He loved the way she whispered his name.</p><p>He dropped the jeans and stepped into the shower. Then he positioned his body near hers. \u201cYou\u2019re drinking from me.\u201d He\u2019d be her first at this, just as he\u2019d been the first to take her body.</p><p>But she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d He pulled her against him. The water covered them both. Washing away the blood and death. Drake tilted his head to the side. His fingers curled around her chin, and he pulled her toward him. \u201cJust start with a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Her lips feathered over his skin.</p><p>His cock hardened even more\u2013and the damn thing had already been swollen with need.</p><p>Her tongue slid out and licked the side of his neck. The small touch sent a rush of hot need surging through him.</p><p>He was supposed to be suffering through this. Giving her sustenance, nothing more. Dealing with the pain of her bite\u2013</p><p>Only there wasn\u2019t any pain yet.</p><p>Only pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t,\u201d she told him again and tried to pull away.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>His hands locked tighter around her. He pushed her back, caging her against the tiled wall of the shower. Then his mouth took hers.</p><p>He knew one thing about vampires and their bloodlust...sex and blood were always tied for the vamps.</p><p>Sex and blood.</p><p>Her mouth opened beneath his. She kissed him back with a hunger to match his. If this was her when she was weak...</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to see her when Paige was back at full strength.</p><p>His tongue slipped into her mouth. Tasted. Enjoyed the moan that rose in the back of her throat.</p><p>His cock thrust eagerly toward her, pushing hard because he damn well wanted to be inside of her.</p><p>Would be...soon.</p><p>His breath heaved out when he lifted his head. \u201cDrink from me.\u201d</p><p>The edge of her fangs glistened behind her slick lips.</p><p>Drake lifted his hand to his throat. His claws were out, and he sliced a thin line down the side of his throat. The better to tempt his little vamp.</p><p>The darkness of her pupils expanded in her eyes. \u201cDrake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to drink from me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze was on the blood that dripped down his throat. Her fangs were lengthening. \u201cDon\u2019t...don\u2019t let me hurt you.\u201d</p><p>What was a little pain? Sometimes, it could even make the pleasure sweeter. He\u2019d learned that lesson long ago, but he just told her, \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went back to his throat. Kissed the skin. Sucked lightly along his flesh.</p><p>Damn. He held onto his control with every ounce of strength he had. But her body was wet, soft, and smooth. Her silken legs rubbed against his. Her breasts\u2013tight with those pebbled nipples\u2013pushed into his chest.</p><p>Then she licked at the blood on his throat.</p><p>His teeth ground together. His cock was so aroused that he felt like he\u2019d erupt any minute.</p><p>Only in her.</p><p>She moaned low in her throat and licked him again. Again. She sucked his flesh once more, and he felt the score of her teeth on him.</p><p>Okay, this is it. She\u2019ll slice into me, but it won\u2019t last long and\u2013</p><p>And her teeth sank into him.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>This wasn\u2019t about pain and degradation. This wasn\u2019t about a vamp\u2019s bite tearing and slicing prey.</p><p>It was about pleasure.</p><p>Because that was all he could feel then. A white-hot burst of pleasure that seemed to fill his veins and course through his body. So much pleasure that his control shattered in an instant. There was no holding back.</p><p>There was only...Paige.</p><p>He lifted her up against that tiled wall. Spread her legs.</p><p>Her mouth was still on him, lips, tongue, teeth...</p><p>His fingers slid over her core. Pushed inside her sex. So wet. So hot. She clamped down on him and held tight.</p><p>The water thundered down over him. Steam surrounded them.</p><p>In her.</p><p>He positioned his cock. Stroked over her clit. Loved her ragged moan.</p><p>The head of his cock pressed into her. Her sex stretched, straining around him. He wanted to see her, wanted to pull back\u2013</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Drake drove into her as deep and as hard as he could. And it was just like he remembered. Tight. Hot. Heaven.</p><p>He pulled back. Thrust deep. Again and again. He lifted her up, positioning her so that she had to take all that he gave her. There was no hiding or holding back, not for either of them.</p><p>His fingers kept stroking over her clit. The way he knew she liked. The way that would make her\u2013</p><p>Scream.</p><p>Paige lifted her mouth from his neck. Her eyes were wide, wild, and her lips were flushed red. The scream of pleasure slipped past those red lips even as he felt the contractions of her orgasm around his cock.</p><p>So good.</p><p>He kept thrusting. Faster. Harder. Rougher.</p><p>The wolf liked it rough.</p><p>So did the man.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his hips. Wrapped her arms around his shoulders.</p><p>And she kissed him.</p><p>This time, the pleasure was his. A deep, wrenching pleasure that washed over him as he climaxed inside of her. The release blinded him and fucking seemed to gut him as it went on and on, hollowing out his body.</p><p>When the climax ended, he didn\u2019t release her.</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t letting her go, not ever again.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Dawn didn\u2019t bring light. The polar night had come to Alaska weeks before, and now they were lucky if even a faint twilight would brighten the day.</p><p>Just darkness. And more darkness to come.</p><p>It was the kind of darkness most vampires loved.</p><p>Paige knew that she had never been like most vampires. Hell, she wasn\u2019t even a particularly good vampire.</p><p>After dressing, she carefully crept toward the bedroom door. When she\u2019d opened her eyes, she\u2019d been alone. The sheets beside her had been cold. Alone.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d expected Drake to stay with her, just holding her in those quiet hours. Cuddle time wasn\u2019t so big with vamps and werewolves, she got that.</p><p>But had the guy really needed to haul ass so quickly? Would it have killed him to just stay with her for a little while?</p><p>Her hand pressed against the wood of the closed door. She could still taste Drake on her tongue.</p><p>And feel him between her legs.</p><p>The sex had been as good as she remembered. Actually, way better than good. Drake had always been one fantastic lover and\u2013</p><p>Someone was screaming.</p><p>The screams tore through the house, echoing, and her body tensed in instant response.</p><p>She\u2019d screamed before, for Drake, but those screams had been about pleasure. This time, the cries filling the air were from pain.</p><p>Paige yanked open the door. The screams and yells and shouts to \u201cStop!\u201d had her racing down the hallway.</p><p>Faster, faster she went. She bounded down the stairs, taking three at a time, and Paige realized could she smell blood.</p><p>Her fangs were already coming out.</p><p>\u201cStop, dammit, stop!\u201d A man\u2019s ragged plea.</p><p>She rushed down another flight of stairs, one that led to some kind of basement or\u2013</p><p>A line of werewolves blocked her path. Paige stumbled to a halt just seconds before she would have barreled into those guys.</p><p>The screams continued, coming from a room directly behind that living wall of werewolves.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Her gaze darted over the men. She recognized the two werewolves who\u2019d escorted her in...jeez, had that just been last night?</p><p>The smaller one\u2013the guy who\u2019d made the mistake of touching her before\u2013shook his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you going inside.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, screw that. \u201cHe also doesn\u2019t want you touching me.\u201d Drake had been more than adamant on that point the last time he\u2019d squared off with this wolf. What had been the guy\u2019s name? Mark? Matthew?</p><p>Michael. This wolf was Michael.</p><p>Drake had been more than clear when he\u2019d said the guy wasn\u2019t supposed to touch her again. If Michael couldn\u2019t touch her...</p><p>Then you can\u2019t stop me, wolf.</p><p>She marched right ahead. Damn straight that line of wolves backed up. She figured none of them wanted to dare to actually physically try and stop her. \u201cSo I\u2019m betting you\u2019re just gonna get out of my way.\u201d Or else they\u2019d get an ass kicking from Drake.</p><p>Then before one of them could grow some balls and maybe try to stop her, she sprang forward, leapt right over them, and kicked open the door behind the assembled wolves.</p><p>It was a metal door, heavy and huge, but it easily sprang open beneath her booted heel.</p><p>Wow. That blood of Drake\u2019s had really amped her up. She\u2019d always heard werewolf blood was powerful, but...damn. She\u2019d never felt so strong.</p><p>The metal door slammed into the wall and bounced back at her, but she dodged it with a little sidestep, and then she noticed that she was in hell.</p><p>Or as close to hell as she\u2019d been in a few months.</p><p>Cages lined the walls. Cells. Prisons. There was blood on the floor. The coppery scent of blood filled the room. She knew that scent too well. And there, in the middle of the area, strapped to what looked like an operating table, was a vamp that she recognized. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malcolm Douglas. Another one of Gabe\u2019s henchmen.</p><p>Guess you couldn\u2019t run fast enough.</p><p>The wolves had caught him, and now they were making him pay.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Drake grabbed her arms and turned Paige away from the sight of Malcolm\u2019s bleeding body. \u201cDammit, I told them to keep you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also told them not to touch me,\u201d she said, lifting a brow, \u201cso it\u2019s not like they could really stop me.\u201d Not unless they\u2019d wanted to fight the alpha.</p><p>A muscle flexed in Drake\u2019s jaw. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to see\u2013\u201d</p><p>Malcolm started to laugh. \u201cFool. What you\u2019re doing to me...we\u2019ve done so much more...to her.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. Ice flooded through Paige\u2019s body. Malcolm shouldn\u2019t have said\u2013</p> <p>\u201cWe sliced her open...\u201d Malcolm snarled out. She glanced over and saw the wildness in his eyes. \u201cDrained her blood while she screamed\u2013\u201d</p><p>Drake lunged for him. His claws wrapped around the vampire\u2019s neck and ripped the skin. \u201cI won\u2019t make death easy for you.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm just smiled. His fangs were stained with blood. Despite his screams, she knew he didn\u2019t fear death. The guy probably welcomed it.</p><p>Hell...had he been screaming just because he knew that she was in the compound? Had he been trying to draw her down here? So that I\u2019d suffer...and Drake would suffer.</p><p>\u201cWant me to tell you...\u201d Malcolm muttered, \u201call that we did to her?\u201d</p><p>No. She\u2019d never wanted Drake to hear that story. \u201cDrake!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d Drake ordered without looking at her. His claws sank deeper into Malcolm\u2019s throat. Pretty soon, Malcolm wouldn\u2019t be able to talk at all.</p><p>Paige didn\u2019t move. The screams had pulled her in, but she was staying because... \u201cI can help you!\u201d If Drake would just give her the chance.</p><p>Malcolm was the one still doing the talking. \u201cShe was...waiting,\u201d he said, \u201cfor you\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her out, Heath! Now!\u201d Drake snapped and a fair-haired wolf came her way. His hands closed around her arms, but she jerked against him.</p><p>Paige wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Not yet. \u201cDammit, Drake, let me\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was near the lake when we found her...\u201d Malcolm\u2019s blood dripped onto the floor. \u201cYou were supposed...to meet her.\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t the vampire shut the hell up?</p><p>Drake stiffened at the vampire\u2019s words. \u201cI went to the lake.\u201d</p> <p>Lost Lake. A fitting name.</p><p>She\u2019d lost her own life at that lake.</p><p>\u201cYou went later.\u201d Malcolm\u2019s eyes were bright. He liked power. Craved it. Always had, always would. Right then, despite the claws at his throat and the blood around him, Malcolm had the power.</p><p>And she had a stake in her boot. So if she could just get away from Handsy Heath, she\u2019d use it and make sure Malcolm never hurt another human again.</p><p>The way he hurt me.</p><p>\u201cYour alpha...\u201d Malcolm growled, \u201che made sure you went late...to that little rendezvous...\u201d</p><p>His words caused Drake\u2019s hold to loosen, just a bit, but the Malcolm\u2019s revelation didn\u2019t surprise Paige. She\u2019d learned this truth long ago.</p><p>The old alpha, Jeremiah Quintock, hadn\u2019t wanted a human in his pack. He\u2019d thought wolves were far too superior to humans. But Drake had wanted her to be his mate, and he\u2019d been determined to bring Paige into the pack, and it hadn\u2019t mattered to him who he pissed off.</p><p>Drake had thought he was safe because he was the next in line to be alpha. One day, he\u2019d lead the Alaska wolves. He\u2019d known that, even when they\u2019d dated. So he hadn\u2019t thought anyone in the pack would deny him the mate he\u2019d chosen.</p><p>But Jeremiah hadn\u2019t wanted the next alpha to have a human at his side.</p><p>So he\u2019d sent me to die.</p><p>She saw the shock on the faces of the wolves around her. Even Heath eased his grip on her. What? Had they all really not known that old jackass Jeremiah had been dealing with the vamps for years?</p><p>Because Jeremiah had a taste for blood, too. A taste for blood and death and screams and pain. Not the best image when the werewolves in the pack were trying to show that they were more than beasts.</p><p>But Jeremiah had sure liked to play with his prey.</p><p>The vamps had gotten rid of the bodies for Jeremiah, and he\u2019d gotten to pretend he was an evolved, strong alpha.</p><p>An agreement, of sorts, had been reached between Jeremiah and the vamps. But, sooner or later, all good and evil deals came to an end.</p><p>Jeremiah was dead. The old truce was gone. Now the vamps were looking to take back what they thought of as theirs.</p><p>Their land. Their power.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Drake snarled at the vamp. He\u2019d yanked Malcolm right off the table, easily snapping the restraints that had held the guy. Drake lifted the vamp into the air, and Malcolm didn\u2019t even try to break free. He just hung limply, laughing.</p><p>\u201cAsk her...\u201d Malcolm said, choking a bit on blood. \u201cShe begged...for you.\u201d</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>He\u2019d enjoyed it so much when she begged.</p><p>I stopped begging. Stopped crying. Stopped letting him enjoy her pain. In the end, she\u2019d been the stronger one. Damn him, she\u2019d been stronger.</p><p>Heath\u2019s hands slackened even more on her. She yanked away from him. \u201cVamps use distraction as their number one attack method.\u201d That\u2019s what Malcolm was trying to do then. Why didn\u2019t the wolves realize what was happening? \u201cHe wants to buy time, to give the others a chance to regroup and come in again for an attack.\u201d</p><p>Paige inched forward as the wolves glanced around the room. She just needed to get within striking distance. Almost...there.</p><p>Drake swung his gaze back to her. \u201cYou weren\u2019t at the lake.\u201d</p><p>Paige could still smell the lake. That long ago day, the polar night had ended. The darkness had faded and the sunlight had just been about to come her way. Everything had been fresh. New.</p><p>She and Drake had wanted to see the sun together.</p><p>Then start their lives together.</p><p>She\u2019d gone to Lost Lake early because she\u2019d been so excited. She hadn\u2019t cared about what Drake was. She\u2019d just loved him.</p><p>When she\u2019d heard the twig snap and the rustle in the bushes, she\u2019d thought it was him. She\u2019d spun around with a smile on her face.</p><p>Hello, little wolf whore.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered through numb lips as the past and the present fought in her mind, \u201cI wasn\u2019t at the lake.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s claws dug into Malcolm\u2019s neck. More blood flowed. \u201cI waited for you,\u201d Drake told her, sounding lost. She\u2019d been lost, for so long. His eyes were still on her as he said, \u201cI waited for hours. But you never came. You left me. You couldn\u2019t stand what I was.\u201d</p><p>A few more steps, and she\u2019d be at his side. \u201cI left,\u201d Paige agreed softly. Wasn\u2019t that what she wanted him to know?</p><p>\u201cShe screamed,\u201d Malcolm gasped out the words. Damn him. Shut up. Only he wasn\u2019t shutting up. He was saying... \u201cJeremiah had taken you too far away...and you couldn\u2019t hear her. We cloaked our scents, so you never knew we were...at that lake. Then the old alpha came...because he wanted to make sure...she died...\u201d</p><p>You won\u2019t tempt the boy again. Jeremiah\u2019s vow to her. He\u2019d met up with the vamps. In some God-forsaken cabin. A place that had reeked of death and fear.</p><p>But by the time he\u2019d gotten there, she\u2019d stopped screaming. She\u2019d realized her screams were only building the excitement for the vamps. They got off on her pain.</p><p>So the tears had streaked silently down her cheeks, but she\u2019d stopped crying out. Her lips had clamped together. She\u2019d bit through them to hold back her cries.</p><p>Jeremiah had come to kill her. She\u2019d understood that instantly. He\u2019d wanted to be the one to send her to the grave. Personally. Because she\u2019d dared to try and taint his pack with her human blood.</p><p>But Gabe...oh, Gabe, he\u2019d always been so smart. He\u2019d known that Jeremiah wouldn\u2019t be around forever, and with Drake growing bigger and stronger every day...</p><p>A new alpha\u2019s taking over. When he rises, I\u2019ll have what he wants most. Gabe had whispered those words to her. Then kissed her tears away. Don\u2019t be afraid, love. You\u2019re not dying...yet.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t at the lake,\u201d she said again as she tried to push the past back into the dark hole in her mind. Drake needed to remember her leaving him. He had to be strong. He couldn\u2019t have a weakness.</p><p>Gabe was counting on his weakness.</p><p>She blinked. Why were her cheeks wet? Dammit, she was crying, and the wolves were all staring at her, dead silent.</p><p>As silent as she\u2019d been when Jeremiah had raked his claws down her arm. Then her side.</p><p>But Gabe had stopped him before the bastard could rip out her heart.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not yours to kill, Jeremiah.\u201d Gabe\u2019s taunting voice still haunted her mind. \u201cShe\u2019s ours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t turn her right away.\u201d Malcolm\u2019s body trembled and his voice shook. \u201cShe...got away from us...gave us quite a chase...\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t Drake get it? Malcolm was wasting time with this story. Distracting them all.</p><p>Making Drake weak.</p><p>Because Gabe wanted Drake to be weak, distracted...broken when the real attack came.</p><p>She remembered the desperate time she\u2019d spent running. She\u2019d fled through the snow. Hitchhiked. Gotten as far from Alaska as she could.</p><p>Hello, Florida.</p><p>But Gabe had always been chasing her. He hadn\u2019t planned to let her go. Not when she could be such a valuable tool in his battle.</p><p>She\u2019d never called Drake after she escaped. Never so much as spoken his name again. Why? Because Jeremiah had still been there, still wielding his power, and if she\u2019d tried to get close to Drake again...</p><p>The old scars on her body seemed to burn.</p><p>Her heartbeat thudded in her ears. Fast. So fast.</p><p>\u201cAll vampires aren\u2019t sick pricks like him,\u201d she spoke quietly, but her voice filled the room. \u201cThere are others out there who are different. They\u2019re good.\u201d They\u2019d found her. Hurt. Wild. So desperate after her change. And they\u2019d helped her.</p><p>I won\u2019t drink from a human. She\u2019d been starving because she refused to drink. But she hadn\u2019t wanted to attack another person, hadn\u2019t trusted herself to stop once she sank her teeth into prey.</p><p>Gabe had told her that she wouldn\u2019t be able to pull back after she had her first taste of blood.</p><p>\u201cOnce you taste the blood, it\u2019ll drive you wild. You\u2019ll do anything to get more. You\u2019ll drain humans, one after the other, and leave their bodies in your wake.\u201d</p><p>His promise to her, right after he\u2019d turned her. He\u2019d leaned close, pressed a kiss to her cheek and said, \u201cThen you\u2019ll be just like me.\u201d</p><p>Never.</p><p>Drake had dropped Malcolm. The vamp lay sprawled on the floor while her werewolf stared at her with a face gone white. No, he shouldn\u2019t be like this. She hadn\u2019t ever wanted him to know all the secrets she carried.</p><p>\u201cPaige...\u201d Her name was a ragged sound of pain, torn from Drake.</p><p>And Malcolm\u2013his eyes were on her. On her, then Drake. No, not just on Drake...on his neck.</p><p>Malcolm\u2019s smile said he knew what she\u2019d done.</p><p>After resisting for so long, she\u2019d broken down and taken blood from a live source, from him. The one who mattered the most.</p><p>\u201cGuess I am a monster,\u201d she told Malcolm, then she lunged forward. No one tried to stop her. They couldn\u2019t. She was too fast then.</p><p>In an instant, she had the stake out.</p><p>And Malcolm was attacking, too. Not an attack at her, but one aimed at Drake.</p><p>He was distracting you. She\u2019d tried to warn him, but Drake had been too busy listening to Malcolm\u2019s twisted tale. The vamp slashed out with his claws, going for Drake\u2019s back.</p><p>Only she got to Malcolm first. Paige shoved the stake into his chest. \u201cGo to hell, bastard,\u201d she snarled. He\u2019d sure done his best to drag her there and\u2013</p><p>Malcolm ripped the stake right out of his chest. \u201cMissed...heart...bitch...\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t miss,\u201d Drake promised as he yanked her back. Then he attacked, slamming his body into Malcolm\u2019s. And, no, he didn\u2019t miss because one powerful swipe of the razor sharp claws that sprang from Drake\u2019s fingers\u2013well, one swipe took Malcolm\u2019s head.</p><p>And the vampire went to hell.</p><p>The silence in the room was deafening then. All the wolves stood, as still as statues, watching her. Waiting.</p><p>After one glance, she didn\u2019t look at Malcolm again. Her stomach was twisting, her hands shaking. She wanted the nightmare to just end, but for her and for Drake, the end was still too far away. The nightmare wouldn\u2019t stop, not yet.</p><p>Not until Gabe was the one on the floor, stone dead.</p><p>She should say something. Anything. But...</p><p>Her shoulders hunched as Paige turned away. The scent of blood seemed to burn her nostrils, and she just needed to get out of there.</p><p>Away from the blood and death. Escape. She hadn\u2019t known real freedom in so long, and she was so tired of being surrounded by death.</p><p>Constantly.</p><p>Paige shoved the shifters out of her way. Drake called out to her. She didn\u2019t glance back, and she sure as hell didn\u2019t stop. She\u2019d talk with him\u2013later.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t at the lake.</p><p>Her words had been so hollow because, yes, she\u2019d been at Lost Lake. She\u2019d kept her promise to Drake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that promise had cost Paige far more than she\u2019d ever expected\u2013her life.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>She damn well wasn\u2019t getting away from him.</p> <p>Paige had fled the compound and raced away into the night. Sure, he could have gotten his men to track her, but this hunt was personal, and Drake didn\u2019t want the others chasing her.</p><p>If someone hunted Paige, it would be him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d Heath grabbed him just as Drake was about to pass through the compound\u2019 heavy gates. His eyes blazed with fury. \u201cThis could be a vamp trap! She\u2019s luring you outside.\u201d</p><p>Paige hadn\u2019t gone through the gates. She\u2019d just leapt over the wall. So fast and graceful. His blood had sure pumped up her power.</p><p>As for her bite...it had given him so much pleasure. I\u2019ll have more. If she needed blood, he\u2019d be happy to be her personal donor from now on.</p> <p>Her first, her only.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hurting,\u201d Drake said and pain, yeah, that was just what he\u2019d seen in Paige\u2019s eyes. She\u2019d always shown so much with her green gaze. He\u2019d once been able to look right into her eyes and see her soul.</p><p>Heath actually shook him. \u201cShe\u2019s in pain? Fine. Then let her go off and lick her damn wounds.\u201d Heath\u2019s words held a sharp bite. \u201cBut don\u2019t put yourself at risk for her. She\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>The necklace he\u2019d given to her so long ago, the one he\u2019d stupidly taken from her neck just the previous night, was a heavy weight in Drake\u2019s pocket. Give it back to her. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d There wasn\u2019t anything else to say.</p><p>She was his. And she hurt.</p><p>Protect her. An instinct from the wolf and the man.</p> <p>He looked beyond the wall. So much darkness and icy cold waited for him. But that frigid darkness had been his whole life, ever since Paige had left him.</p><p>He wanted more now. He wanted warmth. Light. Paige had always been that to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing her back.\u201d Drake shoved the other wolf aside.</p><p>Heath grabbed his arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring a vampire into the pack.\u201d Low words. Gritted. Burning with intensity. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Very, very slowly, Drake turned his head and stared down at his first in command. He\u2019d been friends with Heath since they were both just boys, but that friendship wouldn\u2019t stop him from kicking the shit out of the guy. \u201cI\u2019m the fucking alpha.\u201d He let the power ring in his voice. He\u2019d fought for the title. Earned it. And since he was alpha, the one they all submitted to... \u201cI can do anything I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremiah\u2013\u201d</p><p>Had that bastard really gone after Paige? Set this whole nightmare in motion? His jaw ached as Drake growled, \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d A very lucky thing for the old wolf right then. Because if he\u2019d still been living, Drake would have ripped him apart. \u201cIt\u2019s my pack now.\u201d If Heath wanted to challenge him...</p><p>Come the hell on.</p> <p>He was more than in the mood for some ass-kicking.</p><p>After he brought Paige back. He had his priorities, and she came first. \u201cSpread the word,\u201d Drake ordered. \u201cAny who want to challenge me...tell them to get the fuck in line.\u201d When he came back, he\u2019d take them all on.</p><p>Because no one was going to keep him from Paige. Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>He turned away from Heath and ran into the night. Vampires were fast, but wolves were faster. Especially when they hunted.</p><p>He shed the form of man with a crack and snap of his bones. The pain of the shift burned over him, familiar, white-hot, and soon he was running on all fours, with paws instead of hands, and he tossed back his head and howled for the one thing he wanted most in the world.</p><p>His mate.</p><p>He had her scent, and he wouldn\u2019t lose it. He flew over the terrain, ignoring the frigid cold temperature\u2013an artic chill that he knew would be cutting into Paige. The cold wouldn\u2019t kill a vamp, but it would make her body tremble and shake. She\u2019d suffer out there.</p><p>She\u2019d already been in pain when she left him.</p><p>And the only damn thing he wanted to do was take that pain away.</p><p>He bounded through the forest and sent snow flying in his wake. The world was a blur of white, but he could just see the imprints of her footsteps.</p><p>He knew where she was going.</p><p>Inside the body of the beast, the man cursed.</p><p>The wolf ran faster, faster...</p><p>She\u2019d never seen him in this form. Before, he\u2019d been ashamed for her to see him transform. He knew what he was...</p><p>\u201cGuess I am a monster...\u201d Her words were burned into his mind.</p><p>But he\u2019d been the monster. Always. The beast who\u2019d taken what he should never have touched.</p><p>He leapt into the air, easily jumping over a fallen tree. Her scent was stronger now. Strawberries. Sex. Woman. He\u2019d never been able to forget that lush scent.</p><p>The small lake was frozen, its surface dark and glistening. Even though it was day, the sky overhead was as dark as the lake. No sunlight.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>Just cold. Just darkness.</p><p>Paige spun at his approach and put her back to the lake. Her eyes widened when she saw him. Swallowing, she backed up a step.</p><p>He froze.</p><p>Then he changed, for her.</p><p>The transformation was brutal to watch. He knew it had to be. His bones shifted and broke, reshaped into a man\u2019s body instead of the form that belonged to the beast. The fur seemed to melt from his body. Soon paws and claws became hands and fingers\u2013fingers that had dug deeply into the snow.</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d</p><p>Her hushed voice pushed through the last of the shift, and, naked, he glanced up at her.</p><p>Paige rushed toward him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither...should you.\u201d He rose before her. Wind whipped against his body, but werewolves always stayed warm no matter what the outside temperature was. The beast burned within.</p><p>Paige shivered.</p><p>He took a step toward her, but she stiffened, and her gaze darted around the small clearing. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. I didn\u2019t think\u2013we need to go back.\u201d</p><p>Drake lifted his hand and offered it to her. \u201cThen come with me.\u201d He knew why she\u2019d run from the compound. Desperation and pain had driven her to flee blindly.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t at the lake.</p><p>But she had been. He knew a lie when he heard it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words were torn from him. Jeremiah had come to him, told him that he had a message from Paige. \u201cYour little human said to meet you in two hours.\u201d Jeremiah had smiled and flashed his fangs. \u201cThat gives us time for a hunt.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d just...gone off with the bastard.</p><p>Paige wasn\u2019t taking his hand.</p><p>Her gaze was on him, sweeping over his body. She hadn\u2019t been disgusted by his shift, and she sure didn\u2019t appear disgusted by what she was seeing right then.</p><p>Lust. He knew that expression well. But he hated the mix of lust and pain in her eyes. He hated to see any pain in her gaze.</p><p>He\u2019d rather just have the lust.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he said again, and he still waited for her to take his hand. There would be no forcing on this. She had to choose to come with him.</p><p>To be with him.</p><p>Her gaze swept around the lake. The woods. She inched toward him. The snow crunched beneath her boots. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t...you shouldn\u2019t have followed me.\u201d Her words rushed out. \u201cI just needed a little time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a vamp hunting you,\u201d he told her. Hell, it was probably a whole gang of vamps now. \u201cYou really think I\u2019d just leave you on your own?\u201d</p><p>No. Her hand lifted and slowly, so slowly, her gaze met his. Her fingers touched his hand. Tentative. Soft. \u201cI lied,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His fingers closed around hers. \u201cWhat?\u201d But he already knew and if she wanted to confess to him, he\u2019d damn well listen.</p><p>He should have met her here, at Lost Lake. He should have told Jeremiah to screw off, that he was still heading out to meet Paige and that he\u2019d just wait for her to show.</p><p>If he\u2019d gone then, they would have been married by now. Had children. Had a fucking perfect life.</p><p>It was all his fault.</p><p>But then he heard the growl of an engine. No, not just one engine. Two. Three.</p><p>Coming close.</p><p>Too fast.</p><p>Far too fast.</p><p>Her eyes still held his. \u201cI lied,\u201d she said again, then she jerked her hand free from his grip and shoved against his chest. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>The vampires were coming.</p><p>\u201cShift! Turn back into a wolf!\u201d Paige yelled at him. \u201cYou can outrun them, you can get away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you.\u201d His claws tore through his flesh. He\u2019d be damned if he left her behind.</p><p>She shook her head and shoved harder against him. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. They don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>But\u2013but she\u2019d told him\u2013the vampire she\u2019d called Gabe\u2013</p><p>\u201cThey want you,\u201d she said, voice stark and sad. Her eyes had never looked bigger. Or sadder. \u201cAnd Gabe always planned to use me...in order to get you.\u201d</p><p>He could see the light from the snowmobiles cutting through the darkness. The vamps were closing in on them.</p><p>The vamps wouldn\u2019t get them, though. Dumbasses. Drake knew this land so well.</p><p>Better than any vampire ever could. His beast ran free often. Knew every fallen tree. Every secret bend. Every dark cave.</p><p>Every hiding spot.</p><p>\u201cRun with me,\u201d he told her. Because right then, it wasn\u2019t about fighting, even though the beast within was roaring for blood. That moment was about protecting Paige. Getting her to safety.</p><p>Then coming back to cut down all the vampires after him.</p><p>She nodded, and they took off, racing not around the lake, but right across it. It was icy and slick beneath their feet, frozen solid, and by going straight across that cold surface, they saved valuable time.</p><p>The ice wouldn\u2019t break. Not for months.</p><p>They cleared the lake. Entered the edge of the forest, where the heavy weight of the snow had bent the trees. Because they\u2019d gone right across the lake then leapt into the woods, they didn\u2019t leave any footprints behind.</p><p>Well, no footprints that would be seen immediately. The vamps would have to search first, scanning every edge of the woods, then if they got lucky, they might see the tracks just past the trees but\u2013</p><p>But it was starting to snow again.</p><p>Hell, yes. The snow came down, brushing against his skin as they ran. The fresh snow would cover any tracks they left behind.</p><p>A wolf would have been able to track them through the snow. Vamps were no match for wolves when it came to stalking prey.</p><p>No match.</p><p>Paige stumbled and would have fallen, but he just grabbed her and hoisted her into his arms. Her weight didn\u2019t slow him. He pushed faster. Held her tighter.</p><p>He leapt easily over the dead trees, the rough rocks. Faster...</p><p>Drake turned abruptly, heading toward the cabin that he knew would be waiting. Small, non-descript, the snow almost hid it completely from view. But he knew the cabin was there, waiting.</p><p>The vamps wouldn\u2019t be so lucky. Unless they knew the specific location of this safe house, they\u2019d never find it in the darkness.</p><p>He punched in the security code, then shouldered open the door. Still holding her tightly, Drake carried Paige inside. The interior was pitch black, and their ragged breathing seemed to echo in the tight space.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here,\u201d Paige said, voice desperate. Her nails sank into his shoulder. \u201cWe need to get back to the compound. They\u2019ll find you here! You can\u2019t face all of them on your own!\u201d</p><p>He put her down beside him. The cabin was sparsely furnished in this area\u2013containing just a bed and an old table. But looks could be deceiving. Drake bent down and yanked back an old rug, a rug that had covered a trapdoor on the floor. When he\u2019d had the cabin built, Drake had made sure that the trapdoor blended seamlessly with the floor. He pressed against the wood, in just the right spot. With a creak, the trapdoor opened, revealing the gaping entrance that led below.</p><p>He\u2019d created this safe house for any wolf shifters who got caught outside the compound during the winter storms. The place was supposed to be a safe harbor for them.</p><p>One with all the benefits and security that a wolf needed.</p><p>Paige crept down the stairs. He shut the door behind her. Bolted it. Then punched in a series of codes on the alarm pad.</p><p>There was a faint hum, then a steel door slid closed above him, covering the wood. Lights flickered on, one after the other, revealing an area twice as big as the cabin above them.</p><p>One wall was composed of monitors. A security station that showed all the area around the cabin, just in case any unwanted guests came calling.</p><p>There was a bed. A desk. A cabinet full of food.</p><p>All the comforts of home and all the security of a mini-fortress.</p><p>Just what he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>Drake headed toward the nearby desk. He lifted up the radio\u2013one that was wired to the compound. \u201cAlpha One.\u201d</p><p>Paige made no sound behind him.</p><p>Static crackled. \u201cReading you sir, over.\u201d</p><p>Drake glanced back at Paige. So still. So beautiful. \u201cSend hunters to Lost Lake. The vamps are out there.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be taking care of this theat. Eliminating the vampires permanently, right after...</p><p>After he settled a few things between him and Paige.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d It was Michael\u2019s voice. Drake caught the eagerness in the guy\u2019s quick reply. Who didn\u2019t enjoy a good hunt?</p><p>No wolf he knew.</p><p>Drake pushed away from the desk. Stalked toward Paige. She was still shivering but she stood straight and tall. She stared at him like she thought he would attack her.</p><p>He did want to pounce.</p><p>He lifted his hand and let it skim down her cold cheek. \u201cTell me about your lies, sweet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned her face into his touch. \u201cYou should...find some clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Wolves had never been concerned with modesty. \u201cI\u2019m about to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p> <p>Now he was the one lying. With her, it wasn\u2019t just fucking. Not just screwing in the dark\u2013or the light. It was more.</p><p>Mating.</p><p>He took a breath and could almost taste her. \u201cTell me the secrets you\u2019ve been keeping...tell me...and I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou know\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampires were watching the compound. They saw you leave.\u201d Obvious. He wasn\u2019t a damn idiot. Desperate for her, yeah, but not stupid. \u201cThen they saw me.\u201d The vamps had given chase, but they would have been watching from a distance, probably using scopes or binoculars, so it had taken them a while to close in. \u201cAnd they came out to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped closer. Pressed his lips against her throat and inhaled her scent. Sex and woman. His. \u201cYou were sweet bait.\u201d He didn\u2019t care. The vampires had hurt her. Tortured her. Used her against him. She\u2019d been sent to lure him out in the open.</p><p>So the fuck what?</p><p>He still wanted her. Always would.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her word was a sigh as her hands lifted to curl around his shoulders. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He licked her neck. Her shiver wasn\u2019t from the cold that time. \u201cMake me understand.\u201d Because he could see a pretty clear picture. She didn\u2019t have a choice. The man understood that, and he was furious at the vamps who\u2019d done this to her. \u201cYou should have just told me, from the start. I could have protected you\u2013\u201d</p><p>Her nails dug into his skin. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Surprised by the fury in that one word, Drake lifted his head and stared down at her.</p><p>Her breath whispered out as she stared at him. Her eyes were chips of green ice. \u201cThis time,\u201d she told him, \u201cI\u2019m protecting you.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Then she wrapped her hand around his neck and pulled him toward her. Her lips were open, slightly cool, and her mouth\u2013perfect.</p><p>His cock was already hard. Like the cold had put a damper on that. He ached for her, and that bed was just waiting for them.</p><p>One step.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Three.</p> <p>They fell onto the bed. His hands fought to remove her clothes even as she kicked away her boots. He wanted in her. The truth, the lies\u2013all that could wait. Right then, he just needed her.</p><p>The lake...</p><p>Waiting...</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gonna wait anymore. They stripped in a tangle of hands. Fabric ripped. Boots and shoes hit the floor.</p><p>He tore her panties and tossed them aside. He pushed open her legs. Found her hot, soft. He pushed her legs farther apart and stared down at her pink flesh. So damn pretty.</p><p>Because he couldn\u2019t resist, Drake bent his head and put his lips against her sex. Her hips rocked up against him.</p><p>\u201cDrake!\u201d</p><p>He loved it when she screamed his name. The room had been sound-proofed. No one outside would hear her. Only him.</p><p>He licked her clit. Tasted her. So delicious. So good.</p><p>So his.</p><p>Her hands were in his hair. Not urging him away, no, his vampiress was asking for more.</p><p>He\u2019d give her more.</p><p>He licked. He tasted.</p><p>She came against his tongue. \u201cDrake.\u201d A whisper now.</p><p>Slowly, he rose above her. Her eyes were wide, shining, and her fangs flashed faintly from behind her red lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a monster.\u201d It pissed him off that she\u2019d said those words before. No fucking way. Not her. Not ever. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him, and her lips curled in a faint smile. The sight nearly broke his heart.</p><p>What was left of the damn thing.</p><p>He thrust into her, driving deep, joining them. His hands locked with hers, their fingers threading together. The bed squeaked beneath him. In and out, he thrust. Again and again. Their eyes held.</p><p>Their breath heaved out.</p><p>Faster, faster now, harder...</p><p>Her legs locked around his hips. Her feet dug into his spine when she arched toward him.</p><p>His claws cut through his fingertips, but he didn\u2019t slice her. Hell, no, he didn\u2019t so much as scratch her with his claws.</p><p>Deeper, deeper.</p><p>He saw her come again. Saw the flash of pleasure on her face as she eyes seemed to go blind. She jerked beneath him and her sex squeezed his cock.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>He was so close to coming. He\u2019d explode in her at any moment when she\u2013</p><p>\u201cMark me.\u201d</p><p>Her husky words had every muscle in his body tightening.</p><p>Wolves marked their mates. He hadn\u2019t marked her before, he\u2019d been waiting. There was an official ceremony, a marking in front of the pack. He\u2019d wanted to do things right with her.</p><p>He\u2019d waited...</p><p>And lost her.</p><p>\u201cMark me,\u201d she whispered again, and dammit, she was asking for his bite. She wanted him as wildly as he wanted her.</p><p>He\u2019d never been able to deny her anything.</p><p>She arched beneath him, offering herself. His teeth closed over her flesh, right where her shoulder curved into her neck. He licked the skin there.</p><p>Mark her.</p><p>It was what the wolf wanted and what the man needed.</p><p>His teeth pressed into her skin, breaking the skin, and the sweet flavor of her blood flowed onto his tongue.</p><p>Even as he tasted her, claimed her, his climax slammed into him. The powerful release crashed through his body as he pumped into her. He lifted his head, stared into her eyes, and, as he drove into her once more, the pleasure tore a roar from him.</p><p>Her name.</p><p>Drake held her tight, didn\u2019t let her go, couldn\u2019t. And he kept thrusting. Because he was still hard for her and growing harder every second.</p><p>He\u2019d finally claimed her as his own, and no one would ever take her from him again.</p><p>\u201cHow do you lose a werewolf?\u201d Gabe asked as his boots sank into the snow. So much damn snow. Bathing everything in white.</p><p>He hated that pure snow.</p><p>It looked much better when it was stained red.</p><p>So he turned to the right and sliced open the stomach of the incompetent newbie vamp next to him.</p><p>The fresh bloods were always so hard to train.</p><p>The guy, a blond with too-soft features, immediately fell to the ground, gasping and bleeding with a bright spray of red.</p><p>\u201cSuck it the hell up,\u201d Gabe snarled at him because the fresh blood\u2019s screams grated. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the wound will kill you.\u201d But he was tempted. Oh, so tempted to finish the job.</p><p>The foolish bastards around him had let the alpha get away. They\u2019d let the prick just vanish into the wilderness.</p><p>\u201cProbably back at his compound by now,\u201d Gabe muttered as he spun away and stared off into the distance. \u201cSurrounded by all those mangy wolves.\u201d</p><p>Gabe had been around a long time. Too long. He\u2019d seen the worst wars and hell that the humans could create.</p><p>That hell...it had made him smart. He\u2019d learned from the mistakes of the others. He knew how to pick his battles. Plan his attacks.</p><p>He wanted this land. The land that was rarely kissed by sunlight. The land with the savage side that loved his darkness.</p><p>The wolves had made a truce with him long ago. Divided the territory. That twisted freak Jeremiah had been all too eager to forge a deal with him.</p><p>But the new alpha wasn\u2019t the same. Gabe had known that for years. Drake Wyler was different. Not so easily manipulated and controlled.</p><p>Drake will come for my head.</p><p>Because Gabe had taken the head of Drake\u2019s father. His mother. And because...</p><p>I took her.</p><p>A wolf howled in the distance. A real beast? Or a shifter out for a run?</p><p>Gabe narrowed his eyes and stared into the darkness. Jeremiah had wanted him to take the little human. To torture her, to kill her.</p><p>He\u2019d had his torturing fun. Oh, he always enjoyed that, but...</p><p>Gabe hadn\u2019t killed Paige Sloan. Death would have been too easy and not at all in line with his plans.</p><p>\u201cWh-what can we do?\u201d One of the vamps asked behind him.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s teeth ground together. \u201cShe stopped screaming,\u201d he gritted out. When she\u2019d finally realized what was happening, when she\u2019d seen Jeremiah and had known why she was taken, Paige had stopped calling out for her lover.</p><p>He\u2019d actually seen the life fade from her eyes, even while she was still breathing.</p><p>That total lack of feeling\u2013he\u2019d seen that look before.</p><p>In my own eyes.</p><p>So he\u2019d stopped Jeremiah from gutting her. Gabe had bitten Paige, transformed her. She\u2019d fled, but he\u2019d watched her. And he\u2019d always known that the perfect time would come to use her.</p><p>That time was now.</p><p>\u201cH-he followed her out to the lake, ran right out...\u201d Ah, this came from the still bleeding blond. John. John Mackenzie. How long had he been in the fold? Two years? Three? It was getting hard for Gabe to remember all the fresh bloods. As he stared at the blond, John gave a quick nod. \u201cHe chased her out...I saw \u2018em...through my binoculars.\u201d</p><p>Because you couldn\u2019t get too close to a wolf\u2019s lair, not without being scented. So the vamps used technology to supplement their already enhanced vision.</p><p>They\u2019d watched. They\u2019d waited. They\u2019d attacked.</p><p>The plan had still gone to hell.</p><p>\u201cHe took her with him.\u201d This came from one of the other vamps. The one with the dark eyes and weathered skin. Lorenzo, the Spaniard. \u201cShe\u2019s probably dead by now.\u201d</p><p>Gabe laughed. They really didn\u2019t understand the wolf at all. He did. \u201cShe\u2019s probably getting fucked.\u201d Because she was the one weakness that Drake possessed. He\u2019d run away from his pack for her. Run into danger for her.</p><p>The wolf was addicted, and Gabe had no doubt that, if necessary, Drake would trade his life for Paige.</p><p>Snow crunched to the left of him. The vamps around him swore and leapt forward.</p><p>Gabe shoved them out of the way. He wanted to see this visitor.</p><p>Curiosity had always been his weakness.</p><p>The white wolf edged from the darkness with his eyes glowing. The beast didn\u2019t attack. He just stared at Gabe with that intense gaze.</p><p>Gabe smiled at him. \u201cAll alone are you?\u201d Because there were no other sounds at that lake. This wasn\u2019t a wolf out leading an attack party.</p><p>This was something altogether different.</p><p>Gabe crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to deal...\u201d So many deals, so many years. He knew just how the devil felt. When will it end? \u201cThen you\u2019re gonna have to shift and talk to me because I don\u2019t fucking speak animal.\u201d</p><p>The white wolf crept forward. His wary gaze darted to each of the vampires.</p><p>\u201cShift,\u201d Gabe snapped, losing patience, \u201cor I can just go ahead and kill you now.\u201d</p><p>The wolf began to shift. Disgusting. Gabe hated the sight of the shifting wolves.</p><p>Even though he did enjoy the sounds of those popping bones.</p><p>But soon enough, a man stood before him. Fury tightened the man\u2019s face and hands. \u201cI know where they are.\u201d</p><p>Fatal mistake. The wolf was just throwing all of his cards out for them to see. Now, they just had to torture the shifter to get that important information.</p><p>No deal. Just pain.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Some blood.</p><p>Snow stained red...It could be so lovely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you there,\u201d the werewolf said, \u201c and get you past the security.\u201d</p><p>Security. So perhaps he would be useful after all. The pain could wait a bit. Gabe lifted a brow but didn\u2019t move forward. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll do this because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to be alpha.\u201d</p><p>Right. Everyone wanted power. But this wolf, with his bitter eyes and snarling arrogance, he wasn\u2019t going to control this land.</p><p>Gabe wasn\u2019t going to sit back and let any animal take control. Not anymore. Those days were over. There\u2019d be no more truces. No more deals.</p><p>Only death.</p><p>But he smiled because he knew how to play the game. He\u2019d made the damn game. \u201cYou want me to kill Drake Wyler.\u201d</p><p>A quick nod. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re planning anyway, right? Kill him...and we\u2013we can have the same arrangement that you had with Jeremiah.\u201d The wolf glanced over his shoulder. What? Was he afraid the rest of his pack would find out that he was a traitor?</p><p>You should be afraid.</p><p>\u201cThe same arrangement I had with Jeremiah.\u201d How the hell did the wolf know about that deal? Gabe cocked his head to the side and studied the wolf with faint interest. \u201cSo you want to kill the humans, too? Want to slice them up and hear them scream until their voices break?\u201d</p><p>Ah, now that was surprise on the shifter\u2019s face. Gabe almost smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2013he did\u2013\u201d A quick swallow and the shifter shook his head. \u201cNo, no, I just want control of the pack. The shifters will leave your men alone, I\u2019ll make them stay away. You can hunt, you can kill...and I won\u2019t do a damn thing to stop you.\u201d</p><p>The whelp was annoying. \u201cCause you\u2019ll control the wolves...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d The shifter threw back his shoulders and stalked forward. Did he realize how close he was to death? The arrogant ones never seemed to understand, not until it was too late. \u201cI\u2019ll keep \u2018em away. I\u2019ll be alpha\u2013I\u2019ll be able to do anything and everything that I want.\u201d</p><p>Provided Drake was dead.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d The werewolf demanded.</p><p>Gabe stared back at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael. Michael Flint.\u201d</p><p>The name meant nothing and that very fact said he was staring at a werewolf no one gave a shit about. \u201cMichael, you\u2019re turning on your alpha so quickly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m stronger. I\u2019m smarter, I can\u2013\u201d</p><p>Gabe barely stifled a yawn. He\u2019d heard this spiel a dozen times. \u201cTake me to him.\u201d Then he\u2019d kill Drake, eliminate this werewolf dumbass, and he\u2019d take all the territory in Alaska.</p><p>Wolves were always weakest without a leader. Without Drake\u2013they\u2019d be easy pickings for his vamps.</p> <p>Michael smiled. No, some arrogant fools never saw death coming.</p><p>Not until the moment death reached up and yanked their beating hearts right out of their chests.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>He\u2019d taken her blood. Euphoria filled Paige\u2019s body. She\u2019d been so afraid she wouldn\u2019t be able to get Drake to take her blood.</p><p>But he had. Her wolf hadn\u2019t even hesitated.</p> <p>He\u2019ll be safe now.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him, holding tight. They\u2019d just climaxed again, and the pleasure still hummed through her body.</p><p>Then an alarm began to beep, a shrill, deep cry that came from the far right of the room. Paige tensed in Drake\u2019s arms because she knew what that sound meant.</p><p>They\u2019re coming.</p><p>Gabe and his vampires had managed to track them through the snow.</p><p>You didn\u2019t find us soon enough, asshole.</p> <p>Drake pulled away from her and stalked, naked, to the line of monitors. She followed him, but paused long enough to yank on her clothes as fast as she could.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see anyone on the monitors, not yet.</p><p>\u201cMotion sensor,\u201d he said, not looking away from that screen. \u201cCould be anything...\u201d</p><p>But the clench in her gut told her that not just anything had triggered that alarm.</p><p>Then she saw the movement of a shadow. No, not a shadow.</p><p>A wolf. A white wolf, running toward the cabin. Paige tensed. \u201cAre we...are we supposed to be having company?\u201d She didn\u2019t see anyone else, just that wolf.</p><p>\u201cMichael.\u201d</p><p>While she watched, the wolf began to shift. As the white fur vanished, it almost looked like snow was dripping away to reveal the man\u2019s flesh. Then he stood, staring up at the camera. Up at them. In that moment, with him back in human form, she recognized the werewolf.</p> <p>Paige\u2019s hand went to her throat. The faint scratches were long gone by now, but she never forgot anyone who gave her pain, no matter how slight the wound was.</p><p>Not until she\u2019d given payback for her injuries.</p><p>The old Paige, the girl she\u2019d been, had never thought of vengeance and punishment.</p><p>The vampire knew there had to be a rough justice in the paranormal world. Only the strong survived.</p><p>She\u2019d survive. So would Drake. She\u2019d make sure of it.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d Drake demanded. \u201cHe should be at the lake, hunting the vampires. He should\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not alone.\u201d Because she\u2019d seen the other shadows. The ones that were closing in on the shifter.</p><p>Michael had to hear the vampires. Had to smell them.</p><p>But he just kept walking toward the cabin like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world. \u201cDoes he know how to get past your security?\u201d Her heart was racing in her chest.</p><p>Michael headed for the cabin. Another camera zoomed in on his face as he approached the front door. For just an instant, Paige caught sight of the smile that curved Michael\u2019s lips.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>\u201cHe brought them here,\u201d she whispered as the cold certainty settled in her gut. Michael was going to lead the vampires inside. Right to her and Drake. They would be sitting ducks for the vamps.</p><p>Their safe house had just become their prison.</p><p>Two of them. Two against\u2013how many vamps?</p><p>The shadows pushed toward the cabin. One. Two. Three. Four...</p><p>Five?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not getting in,\u201d Drake said as he punched a series of codes into the computer. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the right access code. I changed a few days, and, after he hurt you, I didn\u2019t give it to him.\u201d</p><p>Her breath rushed out.</p><p>\u201cNever really trusted him,\u201d Drake muttered as he reached for the radio. He connected almost instantly with the compound. \u201cWolf gone rogue at safe house one,\u201d he said, biting off the words. \u201cSend back up...\u201d</p><p>Michael wasn\u2019t smiling anymore. He was kicking at the door. Punching. Guess he\u2019d realized he didn\u2019t the right code to get inside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s steel, bastard,\u201d Drake said, voice hardening, \u201cReinforced fucking steel, and no, I didn\u2019t tell your ass about that little feature, either.\u201d</p><p>Because Drake had known that Michael might turn on him?</p><p>Another voice crackled over the radio. \u201cComing now, alpha. Two teams. Are there\u2013\u201d</p><p>The vampires closed in on Michael. They grabbed him and hauled him away from the cabin. Michael didn\u2019t fight them. The wolf went with them willingly.</p><p>But she could see he wasn\u2019t smiling anymore.</p><p>Her chest began to burn. She knew what would happen next. Michael might have thought he was working with the vampires. He might have thought that...</p><p>\u201cMichael brought the vampires,\u201d Drake said flatly into the radio, \u201cand, they\u2019re\u2013\u201d</p><p>Killing him.</p><p>Or, they would be, soon enough. Right then, they were holding him down. Slicing into him with their razor-sharp fangs.</p><p>Drinking from him.</p><p>And making sure that the security cameras saw everything.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck here,\u201d Drake snarled and tossed the radio aside. Then he whirled and headed for the stairs.</p><p>Paige grabbed him. \u201cYou can\u2019t go out there.\u201d A glance at the monitors showed her that Michael was fighting back now. Screaming.</p><p>The vampires were still drinking.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t just four vampires any longer.</p><p>Six.</p><p>Her breath caught when she saw Gabe. He wasn\u2019t drinking from the werewolf. Gabe just stood there, staring up at the cabin.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>He\u2019d waited on this one attack for years.</p><p>Secrets. She hadn\u2019t told Drake everything yet. There hadn\u2019t been enough time. There still wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alpha,\u201d he growled as his gaze burned into her. \u201cMichael is one of mine, traitor or not.\u201d</p><p>Um, there was a not portion? That guy was a straight-up traitor. No doubt.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let them drain him,\u201d Drake\u2019s voice rumbled over the beeping alarm. \u201cNot while I just watch.\u201d</p><p>No, Drake wouldn\u2019t do that. He wouldn\u2019t just stand back while another wolf suffered. That wasn\u2019t who her shifter was.</p><p>She knew that...and that was just one of the reasons she\u2019d known that she had to get close to him again.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her blood, but the boost from that blood didn\u2019t happen instantaneously. She\u2019d learned from the vampires in Florida\u2013the vamps that weren\u2019t twisted freaks\u2013that when a vampire offered her blood to a werewolf, well, the result could be pretty damn amazing.</p><p>The wolf could become stronger.</p><p>She wanted Drake as strong as he could possibly be.</p><p>But the boost took a little time. The vampire blood had to work its way through his body.</p><p>I\u2019ll give him the time he needs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered because he\u2019d hate what she was about to do.</p><p>But, sometimes, a vamp just had to do what she had to do.</p><p>Since he wasn\u2019t expecting the attack, Paige had the advantage. She grabbed Drake and shoved him back against the wall. The wall had to be reinforced with steel. The whole place was reinforced.</p><p>This would hurt. But she had to hurt him in order to save him.</p><p>\u201cPaige, what the hell\u2013\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. A deep, hard kiss that held all the passion and longing she felt for him. Did he know that she still loved him? That she always had? There\u2019d never been another in her heart. There wasn\u2019t room for anyone else. Even with all the miles and years between them, Drake had been the only one she wanted.</p><p>He shuddered against her. \u201cPaige.\u201d Lust. Need. Fury. All were in his voice. And he was about to try and break away from her. She knew it.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. The words were only in her mind this time. She brought his lips back to hers. Kissed him again. She knew just what she had to do. Give him an injury that would disable him\u2013for a bit\u2013but allow him to come back even stronger once her blood started pumping fully in his veins.</p><p>A tear leaked down her cheek. His arms were around her. He was holding her tight. Some attacks, you never expected.</p><p>Paige tore her lips from his. In the same instant, she reached up, grabbed his head, and slammed it back against the reinforced wall. The thud of impact had nausea rolling in her gut.</p><p>Her shifter went down with a groan.</p><p>She stared at him, aware that her heart just hurt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. She had to move fast. She knew shifters\u2013no, she knew him\u2013and he\u2019d be recovered in three, four minutes tops.</p><p>He\u2019d come after her.</p><p>He\u2019d go after Michael.</p><p>But Drake wouldn\u2019t die. Because she wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>She spun away. Punched in the codes she\u2019d memorized. She\u2019d watched him so carefully, just in case...</p><p>The steel slid back. The trapdoor opened. She rushed through the opening but took precious seconds to secure the door behind her.</p><p>Her gaze flew around the cabin. She rushed to the left, to the right, and did her best to cover that trapdoor and protect her wolf.</p><p>Then she bent down, and her hand slid inside of her boot. Oh, that sweet weapon. Without a stake, she\u2019d feel naked. She never left home\u2013or her wolf\u2019s compound\u2013without it. Held inside by special straps, the weapon was waiting for her.</p><p>Time to die.</p><p>She ran out of that cabin and raced right toward her worst nightmare.</p><p>The vamps were feeding. Michael was screaming. And Gabe\u2013Gabe opened his arms to her as if he were greeting a lost lover.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he said, voice smooth as silk.</p><p>Paige\u2019s heart raced as she ran into his open arms.</p><p>Fury filled him as Drake\u2019s eyes flew open. What. The. Hell.</p><p>He leapt to his feet. His gaze went to the monitors, and he saw Paige, his Paige, running into the open arms of a vampire.</p><p>The fuck no.</p><p>He leapt up the stairs and punched in the code to open the door. The steel slid back, and he shoved against the wood.</p><p>Only...the wood didn\u2019t move.</p><p>He shoved again. Harder. The wood lifted, then fell back down with a snap. His eyes narrowed. Paige had put something on top of the trapdoor. She\u2019d locked him in.</p><p>His beast didn\u2019t like to be caged.</p><p>With a roar, Drake slammed his shoulders into that wood. He pushed. He heaved.</p><p>The wood broke apart. He leapt up, still shoving\u2013the bed, she\u2019d put the bed on top of the trapdoor\u2013then raced for the front door.</p><p>He could hear the snarls and shouts and they seemed to burn his ears. The image of Paige running into that vampire\u2019s arms was branded into his mind. Why? Why?</p><p>He rushed outside. Saw the blood on the ground. Michael. Still alive. Barely moving.</p><p>Paige\u2013she was...</p><p>\u201cHello, alpha.\u201d The taunting voice came from his left.</p><p>Drake\u2019s claws were out and so ready to claw that SOB apart.</p><p>\u201cDid you lose something?\u201d The vampire asked as Drake turned to face him.</p><p>The vampire was tall. Blond. Bleeding. And he held Paige in his arms. The embrace wasn\u2019t one of a lover, though. One of the vampire\u2019s arms locked around her throat, while the vamp\u2019s other hand held a wooden stake right over Paige\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cBecause it looks like I found something.\u201d The vamp smiled, flashing fangs.</p><p>Drake saw the other vampires stalking toward him. Was he supposed to be intimidated? Scared?</p><p>He was just pissed. \u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2013he had to be the one Paige had told him about, the one she\u2019d called Gabe-shook his head and laughed. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want...she\u2019s already served her purpose.\u201d</p><p>Drake was looking at Paige then. He saw her eyes flare wide in horror, then Gabe spun her around so that she faced the vampire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free now,\u201d the vampire told her, voice soft, almost tender, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what your wolf wants.\u201d</p><p>Paige struggled against him, clawing, punching\u2013</p><p>Drake realized, too late, just what the asshole was doing.</p><p>You\u2019re free now.</p><p>He was killing her.</p><p>Drake roared and lunged forward, forgetting the other vampires, desperate to reach Paige, to help her and\u2013</p><p>Gunfire.</p><p>Bullets. Thudding into his flesh. Burning. Tearing apart muscle and bone.</p><p>His blood spilled onto the ground. His legs stopped working. He wanted to reach Paige, but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He was falling.</p><p>The snow turned red beneath him.</p><p>His claws lifted as he tried to dig out the bullets. So many. In his chest. His back.</p><p>He managed to tilt back his head. He could see Paige. She was still fighting with Gabe. The stake was covered in blood.</p><p>But she was still alive.</p><p>She glanced back at Drake and screamed his name.</p><p>He\u2019d promised to protect her. She\u2019d asked him for just one thing.</p><p>I want you to rip his head off, and I want you to make damn sure that he never rises again.</p><p>Now that vampire was laughing. She was bleeding.</p><p>And I\u2019m dying.</p><p>No, no, he wouldn\u2019t die. He wouldn\u2019t go out like this.</p><p>Drake called on the beast within. Wake up. Drake pushed to his feet. Stumbled. Yanked out the silver in his shoulder and barely felt the burn.</p><p>Wake up.</p><p>The beast hated silver.</p><p>But the wolf loved the woman who was screaming for him.</p><p>A vampire came at him, still with a gun in his hand. Fool. You came too close. Drake grabbed the gun. Shot the vampire in the chest. Swiped out with his claws. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time, it was the vampire that fell.</p><p>Drake dug another bullet from his flesh.

Marked her. And tasted her blood.</p> <p>\u201cYou bitch.\u201d Gabe shook Paige, sending her head snapping back.</p><p>Begging for death. Drake fired the gun. It just clicked. No more bullets. That was all right. He wanted to get his hands bloody.</p><p>\u201cYou did this to him!\u201d Gabe shouted. The guy didn\u2019t even seem to see Drake closing in on him. The stake had fallen from his hand. \u201cYou made him\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStronger,\u201d Paige gasped out as blood dripped from her lips. \u201cI made him strong enough to kill you...just in case I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her words had Drake\u2019s body tensing. He\u2019d kill the vamp for her, all right. A promise is a promise. Drake grabbed Paige and yanked her away from Gabe. Drake\u2019s wolf was snarling, his claws were fully extended, and he was ready to destroy.</p><p>The stake broke beneath his feet, and he broke Gabe\u2019s neck with one twist of his wrist.</p><p>But the vampire just laughed\u2013and his bones snapped back into place almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cTry harder,\u201d Gabe murmured. There was no fear on the vampire\u2019s face or in his eyes. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s see what you can do, alpha. Let\u2019s see if you can fight as hard as you father did.\u201d</p> <p>His father? What did his\u2013</p><p>More laughter from Gabe. Colder than the night that surrounded them. \u201cYou thought that you got all the vamps from that attack, huh? Think again, alpha. Think fucking again.\u201d Gabe barred his teeth. \u201cThose vamps attacked because I gave the order. Only they were supposed to have killed your sorry ass that night, too.\u201d</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t been at home when his family was so brutally attacked. He\u2019d been out, watching Paige as she worked at a little diner. He\u2019d gone to that diner over and over, eager to catch a glimpse of her. That night, he\u2019d finally asked her out. He\u2019d been so excited when he\u2019d gone back home. She\u2019d said yes! Then he\u2019d found the blood and the bodies waiting on him.</p><p>\u201cJeremiah let me in,\u201d Gabe told him as the vamp circled around Drake. \u201cHe knew you\u2019d be the next alpha, and he wasn\u2019t ready to let go of the pack. He let me kill them all...and drink all that shifter blood.\u201d</p><p>Because shifter blood was stronger than human blood. Far more powerful.</p><p>Jeremiah had fed his own pack to this prick? Why?</p><p>\u201cYour bastard alpha was addicted...the same way she wants you to be...to vampire blood.\u201d</p><p>He could taste her...The wolf howled within him, desperate to break free and attack.</p><p>Drake sucked in a deep breath. Paige was on the ground. Still, like a broken, beautiful doll. \u201cIt\u2019s not the blood I\u2019m addicted to,\u201d Drake told Gabe, voice growling. The beast was coming out. The vamp was dying. \u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>He leapt at the vamp even as the shift burned through him. The vamp would get in a few swipes while he transformed, no way around that, because Drake was weak in those moments when he was locked between man and beast.</p><p>But he had to shift. The shift would push the rest of the silver from his body, and the wolf would be stronger than the man.</p><p>The wolf would take the vamp\u2019s head.</p><p>Gabe was smiling as he lunged toward Drake. The vamp\u2019s fangs were barred and\u2013</p><p>\u201cThink fucking again,\u201d Paige shouted, throwing the vamp\u2019s words right back at him. Then gunfire thundered. Once. Twice.</p><p>She had picked up one of the other discarded guns. But, unlike the weapon Drake had chosen, her gun still had ammunition. She filled Gabe\u2019s chest with the silver bullets. He stumbled back, screaming and bleeding.</p><p>Not a broken doll, not anymore.</p><p>Time to die, Gabe.</p><p>In his mind, Drake could see his mother\u2019s broken body. His father\u2019s pale face.</p><p>The shift was over. The wolf growled and charged the vamp. They fell down in a tangle of limbs and claws. The vampire was biting, tearing into the wolf\u2019s body, and punching with his enhanced strength.</p><p>Gabe was too used to pushing around humans. Too used to torturing them.</p><p>Wolves weren\u2019t so easy to take down.</p><p>\u201cK-killed the alpha...\u201d Gabe gritted out as they fought. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll kill you, too.\u201d Blood dripped down his chin. \u201cThe vamps are taking over this\u2013\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s teeth locked around the pureblood\u2019s throat.</p><p>Paige was standing right behind him. He could smell her sweet scent, hear the ragged gasp of her breaths.</p><p>This was it. She\u2019d be free. His parents could rest in peace.</p><p>But Gabe was still laughing. \u201cMine...\u201d Gabe gasped, spitting blood. \u201cShe\u2019ll...always be...mine. The vamps...win. We take...Alaska...\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t win.</p><p>When the wolf\u2019s teeth sank deep, the vamp didn\u2019t speak again.</p><p>He just died.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Paige turned away from the sight of Gabe\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t want to see anymore. She just wanted\u2013</p><p>Wolves surrounded her.</p><p>Oh, crap, when had they arrived? She hadn\u2019t even noticed them. She\u2019d been so intent on fighting Gabe and helping Drake that she hadn\u2019t been aware of the wolves. They could move so quietly as they prepared for an attack.</p><p>A dozen wolves formed a circle around her and Drake. They stood back. Watching, waiting.</p><p>Had they heard Gabe\u2019s final taunt? Hell, she knew the wolves weren\u2019t going to let her stay in the pack, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about her taking over their precious territory.</p><p>The minute Gabe had transformed her, she\u2019d known that her dream of finding Drake and staying with him\u2013forever\u2013well, it had truly just been a dream.</p><p>They might have sex. They might turn to each other in the darkness, but his pack would never accept her.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t ask him to leave the wolves.</p><p>She held up her hands and realized they were stained with blood. Her own. Gabe\u2019s. \u201cEasy...\u201d</p><p>The black wolf near her snarled.</p><p>Great. Just\u2013</p><p>Drake leapt in front of her. He opened his mouth and howled his fury at the pack.</p><p>Paige shivered. She hadn\u2019t been afraid when she faced off against Gabe and the vamps. She\u2019d been too pissed. But now, with the wolves circling, hell, yes, she could admit to fear.</p><p>These wolves would love to rip and tear her apart. Once they found out the truth about what she\u2019d done, the final secret that she\u2019d kept from them...</p><p>They\u2019d want her head, just as she\u2019d wanted Gabe\u2019s.</p><p>Drake was shifting back into the form of a man before her. The snap and crunch of his bones filled her ears.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t wait around for him to finish shifting. Paige knew an exit time when she saw one. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she told the wolves\u2013jeez, it sure looked like they were about to rip her limb from limb. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>She had friends waiting for her. Friends who\u2019d helped her reach Alaska. Friends who\u2019d be glad to welcome her back to the vampire world.</p><p>We\u2019re not all monsters. She\u2019d learned that. Some vampires were more than just predators. Just as the werewolves were more.</p><p>She kept her steps nice and slow. The wolves could probably smell her fear, but a running target\u2013that was prey they\u2019d always instinctively chase. No sense giving them any more reason to want her blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s voice. Guttural. Still more beast than man.</p><p>She froze. \u201cThe deal\u2019s over.\u201d Not the conversation she wanted to have in front of a wolf pack. \u201cGabe\u2019s dead.\u201d You\u2019re safe.</p><p>He grabbed her hand. Pulled her close. She could smell the metallic scent of the silver hanging in the air. She\u2019d come too close to losing him.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t taken her blood...</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cLet me go.\u201d Dammit, the words were a plea. Because she knew he wanted her, just as much as she wanted him.</p><p>I\u2019m addicted to her.</p><p>But sometimes, the things you wanted most were the things that would destroy you.</p><p>His head lowered toward hers. \u201cI killed for you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to kill for him. To protect him, she would have done anything.</p><p>I did.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how your alpha died?\u201d Paige asked him quietly. Maybe he knew some of the details already. There were spies in the vampire covens. For the right price, they\u2019d share any information.</p><p>She\u2019d sure offered up enough money over the years for the Intel they\u2019d given her.</p><p>Drake frowned down at her. The wolves behind him still didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cYour old alpha was fed poisoned vampire blood.\u201d Jeremiah had thought that he\u2019d get stronger by taking the vampire blood. If he\u2019d been given normal vamp blood, he would have become stronger.</p><p>But he\u2019d been ingesting blood laced with silver for years. Poison, building up in his body. Eating away at him from the inside.</p><p>He\u2019d lost his ability to shift. He\u2019d lost his ability to walk. To talk. To breathe.</p><p>Because Gabe had always enjoyed his torture.</p><p>\u201cI knew what was happening to him,\u201d she said. She\u2019d known for a long time. Long enough to save him. Only she hadn\u2019t wanted to save him. She\u2019d wanted him to suffer. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop it because I wanted that bastard dead.\u201d</p><p>A wolf snarled from somewhere behind her.</p><p>Screw them all. She turned and barred her fangs right back at the snarling beast. The wolf shut up. Good. Paige exhaled on a low, rough sigh and turned back to meet Drake\u2019s intense stare. \u201cBut when Jeremiah finally died, I-I knew Gabe would come after you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t gonna let you die. I knew I\u2019d do whatever I had to do...in order to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d done her part. He\u2019d survived.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t ever about me taking his head...to protect you,\u201d Drake muttered.</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t been the one who needed protection.</p><p>\u201cYou tricked me into taking your blood,\u201d Drake said as he towered over her. Eyes so intent. Body naked. Strong. His hand tightened around her wrist. \u201cYou got me to drink, so I\u2019d be strong enough to kill the pureblood when he came after me.\u201d Because despite what Drake had originally thought, even an alpha wasn\u2019t strong enough to take out a vamp like Gabe\u2013not Gabe and his silver wielding buddies. But an alpha pumped up on vamp blood? He could kick ass and destroy any vamp in his path.</p><p>The wolves were shifting around them. Transforming into men and women and the snow was falling again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at the dead body on the ground. And Michael\u2013he was groaning and struggling to his feet. Some of the shifters went to help him.</p><p>\u201cLeave him,\u201d Drake ordered, voice tight with fury. \u201cHe worked with the vampires. He led them right to me.\u201d</p><p>The shifters froze.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s banished from the pack,\u201d Drake said flatly. A judgment. Cold and brutal. \u201cLeave him where the fuck he is.\u201d His head turned as he stared over at Michael. \u201cYou\u2019re still breathing, so count yourself damn lucky.\u201d</p><p>When Drake\u2019s gaze came back to her, Paige forced herself to meet that hard stare. So much fury. How much was for her? For the vamp he\u2019d killed? And for the traitor he\u2019d had in his own midst?</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me,\u201d Drake said. The words were low and all the more lethal for their softness.</p><p>\u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d Paige agreed, her own voice just as soft. But there was no reason for lies anymore. She\u2019d done her job. She\u2019d protected him.</p><p>They\u2019d saved each other.</p><p>Now they could go their separate ways. He\u2019d go back to his pack. She\u2019d go back to the life she\u2019d created in Florida.</p><p>So what if she went back without a heart? She\u2019d been missing that particular organ for years.</p><p>Paige turned away. She had to get out of there. Her chest was burning. Aching. Looking at Drake just hurt too much. Her job was done.</p><p>Time to leave before he saw through her mask.</p><p>I want you. I want to stay.</p><p>Some things just weren\u2019t meant to be.</p><p>But Paige didn\u2019t run away. She walked. One foot in front of the other. Slow. Steady.</p><p>\u201cWas everything a lie?\u201d</p><p>She stopped. Didn\u2019t look back. \u201cNot everything.\u201d Then because\u2013hell, what did she have to lose? Paige glanced back over her shoulder. \u201cI really have always loved you.\u201d From the first moment she saw him. \u201cAnd I always will.\u201d</p><p>Then she kept walking. Because sometimes, love just wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Not when you were a vampire.</p><p>And not when the man you wanted more than blood was a werewolf.</p><p>Did Paige really think that she was just going to walk away? Hell, no. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drake watched her as she left him. The snow drifted over her dark hair. Her steps were slow but certain.</p><p>Not running...just leaving him.</p><p>Right after she\u2019d said she loved him? The woman was about to break him.</p> <p>He inhaled deeply, drawing in her scent. He\u2019d never lose her again.</p><p>Never.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of the bodies.\u201d Easy enough in the wild. \u201cHead back to the compound.\u201d Because the battle wasn\u2019t over. Not for him.</p><p>His gaze swept around the assembled wolves. \u201cThen if there is any one of you who wants to challenge me, take your best shot.\u201d He was ready for a fight with claws and teeth and blood and fury. \u201cBecause my mate is going to be with me, in my pack, by my side, for the rest of my life.\u201d Even if his life was shorter than hers.</p><p>He\u2019d take what he could get.</p> <p>Mate. That was what Paige was. She\u2019d been his mate since she was nineteen.</p><p>She\u2019d be his until he took his last breath.</p><p>Vampire, werewolf\u2013it didn\u2019t matter. She was his.</p><p>He\u2019d fight for her, just as she\u2019d fought for him.</p><p>When the fight was over, he\u2019d find her.</p><p>I\u2019ll come after you, Paige.</p> <p>Always.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Drake stared at the group of shifters who\u2019d assembled in the compound\u2019s courtyard. No one spoke. No one moved.</p><p>They all stood before him. Waiting.</p><p>He wore a pair of jeans, hanging low on his hips, and his claws were out.</p><p>His gaze swept over them all. \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d The wolf inside was already howling.</p><p>He\u2019d fight to give Paige a place at his side because he damn well wasn\u2019t living without her.</p><p>No one stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t meeting his stare. The shifters backed up, showing submission.</p><p>All of them backed up...except for Heath. His first-in-command stepped forward.</p><p>First.</p><p>But Heath lifted his hands and no claws burst from his fingertips. \u201cI have no quarrel with you or your mate.\u201d</p><p>Drake grabbed him. Lifted him into the air. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you said before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore...\u201d Heath swallowed and shook his head. \u201cBefore I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d risk for you.\u201d</p><p>Everything.</p><p>\u201cWe saw the blood. The bodies. We know what she did.\u201d</p><p>Fought. Saved him. Saved the pack.</p><p>Drake dropped the other shifter. Heath scrambled to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll protect her, swear allegiance to her, just as we do to you.\u201d</p><p>There was a murmur or agreement from the shifters. Not silence, not anymore.</p><p>The murmur turned into a growing roar of approval. Determination.</p><p>\u201cSo go get your mate,\u201d Heath told him, voice fierce now. \u201cBring her into the pack. Bring her back where she belongs.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s bare feet sank into the snow as he rushed through the crowd. Paige\u2019s sweet scent still filled his nose. He wasn\u2019t losing her this time.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>Drake ran after his mate, and as he ran, he knew exactly where he\u2019d find her.</p><p>The frozen lake stared back up at her. So still and cold. Paige was shivering and she was hungry and she just ached.</p><p>But she was still alive. Sort of, anyway, and pain was just part of life.</p><p>She turned away from the lake.</p><p>And found Drake watching her.</p><p>She was so surprised to see him that she flinched. \u201cD-Drake?\u201d</p><p>He stood next to an old, twisted tree, one bent beneath the weight of the snow. \u201cI was supposed to meet you here,\u201d he said, voice rumbling. Intense. Dark.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cTh-that was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a necklace from the back pocket of his jeans. Her necklace. The one he\u2019d taken away that first night.</p><p>Her chin lifted.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I gave this to you?\u201d</p><p>She did. She\u2019d known him so well back then. \u201cBecause you loved me.\u201d The words were said with certainty. Once upon a time, a boy had loved a girl.</p><p>Once upon a time...</p><p>He stalked toward her. Didn\u2019t even seem to feel the cold. But then, he wouldn\u2019t. Not like she did.</p><p>He came toward her and lifted the necklace. \u201cI still do love you, sweet.\u201d</p><p>She raised her hand and stopped him before he could slide that necklace over her head. \u201cYou...you took this from me.\u201d</p><p>Because of what she was.</p><p>Not a girl. Not just a boy.</p><p>A vampire. A werewolf.</p><p>\u201cI was going out of my mind that night. I\u2019d missed you for so long...\u201d His breath heaved out in a rush. \u201cI hurt, and I wanted to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>A dark admission.</p><p>His head bowed. \u201cI want to make it up to you. I want to make everything up to you.\u201d</p><p>And there, in the snow, with the lake behind her and too many memories around them, Drake dropped to his knees.</p><p>Her breath rushed out. An alpha should never submit to another like this. It wasn\u2019t the way of the pack. It wasn\u2019t\u2013</p><p>His hand clenched around the necklace. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always wanted him.</p><p>\u201cI never loved anyone else. All those years...the only one to ever touch my heart...was you.\u201d He looked up at her. She saw the beast and the man in his eyes. \u201cStay with me.\u201d A plea, from a man who\u2019d never pleaded for anything before.</p><p>Paige couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cI can make things right for you. I\u2019ll make you happy, I swear. Just give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and tasted the sorrow from the past. \u201cI\u2019m not the same...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stronger. More beautiful. And I fucking love you even more than I did before.\u201d</p><p>Her hands touched his shoulders. Hesitant. Hopeful. \u201cYou...do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Said with a growl. Said as he stared into her eyes. In his gaze, she saw\u2013</p><p>The future.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be with me, for as long as I walk this earth.\u201d Now his words came faster. \u201cI won\u2019t live as long as you, I know that. Just give me those years, just give me\u2013\u201d</p><p>She sank to her knees before him. Kissed him. Kissed him so hard that they tumbled back onto the soft snow.</p><p>And he tasted so good. Like forever. Because that was what she could give to him. Her head lifted slowly. \u201cI can give you more.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d let her.</p><p>His brows pulled low. His arms were around her, holding her so close. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pack\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want you to stay. They want you to come home.\u201d</p><p>Home.</p><p>\u201cFifty years,\u201d he told her, \u201csixty. Give me that, give me\u2013\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and saw the stark pain flash across his face.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her but he sounded...lost.</p><p>She knew because she\u2019d been lost for years. \u201cI can give you more,\u201d Paige promised him. Because she\u2019d learned so much from the vampires who\u2019d helped her in Florida.</p><p>Down there, another werewolf had paired with a vampire female. They\u2019d discovered that if a vampire\u2019s blood was shared, the wolf would become stronger.</p><p>Aging stopped for the wolf. Death was put on hold.</p><p>Jeremiah had thought that he was cheating death by drinking from a vamp, but that blood had been poison.</p><p>She\u2019d never poison Drake. She\u2019d give him her blood, and she\u2019d give him... \u201cForever,\u201d Paige whispered and kissed Drake again.</p><p>As she kissed him, she heard the howl of wolves in the distance.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of that sound. She wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. Not anymore.</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t lost now. She was home and safe...in the arms of her wolf. </p> </body></html>"]
