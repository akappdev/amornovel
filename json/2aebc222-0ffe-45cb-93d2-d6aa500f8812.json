She stared in desperation at the closed door, then pounded it with the flat of her fist.</p><p>\u201cLord Payne,\u201d she shouted, hoping her voice would carry through the thick oak planks. \u201cDo come to the door! It\u2019s Miss Highwood.\u201d After a moment\u2019s pause, she clarified, \u201cMiss Minerva Highwood.\u201d</p> <p>Rather nonsensical, that she needed to state just which Miss Highwood she was. From Minerva\u2019s view, it ought to be obvious. Her younger sister, Charlotte, was an exuberant yet tender fifteen years of age. And the eldest of the family, Diana, possessed not only angelic beauty, but the disposition to match. Neither of them were at all the sort to slip from bed at night, steal down the back stairs of the rooming house, and rendezvous with an infamous rake.</p><p>But Minerva was different. She\u2019d always been different. Of the three Highwood sisters, she was the only dark-haired one, the only bespectacled one, the only one who preferred sturdy lace-up boots to silk slippers, and the only one who cared one whit about the difference between sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.</p><p>The only one with no prospects, no reputation to protect.</p><p>Diana and Charlotte will do well for themselves, but Minerva? Plain, bookish, distracted, awkward with gentlemen. In a word, hopeless.</p><p>The words of her own mother, in a recent letter to their cousin. To make it worse, Minerva hadn\u2019t discovered this description by snooping through private correspondence. Oh, no. She\u2019d transcribed the words herself, penning them at Mama\u2019s dictation.</p> <p>Truly. Her own mother.</p><p>The wind caught her hood and whisked it back. Cold rain pelted her neck, adding injury to insult.</p><p>Swiping aside the hair matted to her cheek, Minerva stared up at the ancient stone turret\u2014one of four that comprised the Rycliff Castle keep. Smoke curled from the topmost vent.</p><p>She raised her fist again, pounding at the door with renewed force. \u201cLord Payne, I know you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><p>Vile, teasing man.</p><p>Minerva would root herself to this spot until he let her in, even if this cold spring rain soaked her to the very marrow. She hadn\u2019t climbed all this distance from the village to the castle, slipping over mossy outcroppings and tracing muddy rills in the dark, just to trudge the same way back home, defeated.</p> <p>However, after a solid minute of knocking to no avail, the fatigue of her journey set in, knotting her calf muscles and softening her spine. Minerva slumped forward. Her forehead met wood with a dull thunk. She kept her fist lifted overhead, beating on the door in an even, stubborn rhythm. She might very well be plain, bookish, distracted, and awkward\u2014but she was determined. Determined to be acknowledged, determined to be heard.</p><p>Determined to protect her sister, at any cost.</p><p>Open, she willed. Open. Open. Op\u2014</p><p>The door opened. Swiftly, with a brisk, unforgiving whoosh.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of tits, Thorne. Can\u2019t it wait for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAck.\u201d Caught off balance, Minerva stumbled forward. Her fist rapped smartly against\u2014not the door, but a chest.</p><p>Lord Payne\u2019s chest. His masculine, muscled, shirtless chest, which proved only slightly less solid than a plank of oak. Her blow landed square on his flat, male nipple, as though it were the Devil\u2019s own door-knocker.</p><p>At least this time, the Devil answered.</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d The dark word resonated through her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not Thorne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re not clothed.\u201d And I\u2019m touching your bare chest. Oh . . . Lord.</p><p>The mortifying thought occurred to her that he might not be wearing trousers either. She righted herself. As she removed her spectacles with chilled, trembling fingers, she caught a reassuring smudge of dark wool below the flesh-colored blur of his torso. She huffed a breath on each of the two glass discs connected by brass, wiped the mist from them with a dry fold of her cloak lining, and then replaced them on her face.</p><p>He was still half naked. And now, in perfect focus. Devious tongues of firelight licked over every feature of his handsome face, defining him.</p><p>\u201cCome in, if you mean to.\u201d He winced at a blast of frost-tipped wind. \u201cI\u2019m shutting the door, either way.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward. The door closed behind her with a heavy, finite sound. Minerva swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cI must say, Melinda. This is rather a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Minerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize your face without the book in front of it.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled, letting her patience stretch. And stretch. Until it expanded just enough to accommodate a teasing rake with a sieve-like memory. And stunningly well-defined shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is hardly the first time I\u2019ve answered the door in the middle of night and found a woman waiting on the other side. But you\u2019re certainly the least expected one yet.\u201d He sent her lower half an assessing look. \u201cAnd the most muddy.\u201d</p><p>She ruefully surveyed her mud-caked boots and bedraggled hem. A midnight seductress she was not. \u201cThis isn\u2019t that kind of visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment to absorb the disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather give you a moment to dress.\u201d Minerva crossed the round chamber of windowless stone and went straight for the hearth. She took her time tugging loose the velvet ties of her cloak, then draped it over the room\u2019s only armchair.</p><p>Payne hadn\u2019t wasted the entirety of his months here in Spindle Cove, it seemed. Someone had put a great deal of work into transforming this stone silo into a warm, almost comfortable home. The original stone hearth had been cleaned and restored to working order. In it blazed a fire large and fierce enough to do a Norman warrior proud. In addition to the upholstered armchair, the circular room contained a wooden table and stools. Simple, but well made.</p><p>No bed.</p><p>Strange. She swiveled her gaze. Didn\u2019t an infamous rake need a bed?</p><p>Finally, she looked up. The answer hovered overhead. He\u2019d fashioned a sort of sleeping loft, accessible by a ladder. Rich drapes concealed what she assumed to be his bed. Above that, the stone walls spiraled into black, cavernous nothingness.</p><p>Minerva decided she\u2019d given him ample time to find a shirt and make himself presentable. She cleared her throat and slowly turned. \u201cI\u2019ve come to ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was still half naked.</p><p>He had not used the time to make himself presentable. He\u2019d taken the chance to pour a drink. He stood in profile, making scrunched faces into a wineglass to assess its cleanliness.</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. Thanks to his indecent display, a ferocious blush was already burning its way over her skin. Up her throat, over her cheeks, up to her hairline. She hardly needed to throw wine on the flames.</p><p>As he poured a glass for himself, she couldn\u2019t help but stare at his leanly muscled torso, so helpfully limned by firelight. She\u2019d been used to thinking him a devil, but he had the body of a god. A lesser one. His wasn\u2019t the physique of a hulking, over-muscled Zeus or Poseidon, but rather a lean, athletic Apollo or Mercury. A body built not to bludgeon, but to hunt. Not to lumber, but to race. Not to overpower unsuspecting naiads where they bathed, but to . . .</p><p>Seduce.</p><p>He glanced up. She looked away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to wake you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d She frowned at him. \u201cThen . . . for as long as it took you to answer the door, you might have put on some clothes.\u201d</p><p>With a devilish grin, he indicated his trousers. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Well. Now her cheeks all but caught fire. She dropped into the armchair, wishing she could disappear into its seams.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, Minerva, take hold of yourself. Diana\u2019s future is at stake.</p><p>Setting the wine on the table, he moved to some wooden shelves that seemed to serve as his wardrobe. To the side, a row of hooks supported his outerwear. A red officer\u2019s coat, for the local militia he led in the Earl of Rycliff\u2019s absence. A few finely tailored, outrageously expensive-looking topcoats from Town. A greatcoat in charcoal-gray wool.</p><p>He passed over all these, grabbed a simple lawn shirt, and yanked it over his head. Once he\u2019d thrust his arms through the sleeves, he held them out to either side for her appraisal. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>Not really. The gaping collar still displayed a wide view of his chest\u2014only with a lascivious wink instead of a frank stare. If anything, he looked more indecent. Less of an untouchable, chiseled god and more of a raffish pirate king.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He took the greatcoat from its hook and brought it to her. \u201cIt\u2019s dry, at least.\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019d settled the coat over her lap, he pressed the glass of wine into her hand. A signet ring flashed on his little finger, shooting gold through the glass\u2019s stem.</p><p>\u201cNo arguments. You\u2019re shivering so hard, I can hear your teeth chatter. The fire and coat help, but they can\u2019t warm you inside.\u201d</p><p>Minerva accepted the glass and took a careful sip. Her fingers did tremble, but not entirely from the cold.</p><p>He pulled up a stool, sat on it, and fixed her with an expectant look. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she echoed, stupidly.</p><p>Her mother was right in this respect. Minerva considered herself a reasonably intelligent person, but good heavens . . . handsome men made her stupid. She grew so flustered around them, never knew where to look or what to say. The reply meant to be witty and clever would come out sounding bitter or lame. Sometimes a teasing remark from Lord Payne\u2019s quarter quelled her into dumb silence altogether. Only days later, while she was banging away at a cliff face with a rock hammer, would the perfect retort spring to mind.</p><p>Remarkable. The longer she stared at him now, the more she could actually feel her intelligence waning. A day\u2019s growth of whiskers only emphasized the strong cut of his jaw. His mussed brown hair had just a hint of roguish wave. And his eyes . . . he had eyes like Bristol diamonds. Small round geodes, halved and polished to a gleam. An outer ring of flinty hazel enclosed cool flashes of quartz. A hundred crystalline shades of amber and gray.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. Enough dithering. \u201cDo you mean to marry my sister?\u201d</p><p>Seconds passed. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana,\u201c she exclaimed. \u201cDiana, of course. Charlotte being all of fifteen.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSome men like a young bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men have sworn off marriage entirely. You told me you were one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you remember. That night.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, obviously nonplussed. \u201cWe had \u2018a night\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot how you\u2019re thinking.\u201d Months ago now, she\u2019d confronted him in the Summerfield gardens about his scandalous indiscretions and his intentions toward her sister. They\u2019d clashed. Then they\u2019d somehow tangled\u2014bodily\u2014until a few cutting insults severed the knot.</p><p>Curse her scientific nature, so relentlessly observant. Minerva resented the details she\u2019d gleaned in those moments. She did not need to know that his bottom waistcoat button was exactly in line with her fifth vertebra, or that he smelled faintly of leather and cloves. But even now, months later, she couldn\u2019t seem to jettison the information.</p><p>Especially not when she sat huddled in his greatcoat, embraced by borrowed warmth and the same spicy, masculine scent.</p><p>Naturally, he\u2019d forgotten the encounter entirely. No surprise. Most days, he couldn\u2019t even remember Minerva\u2019s name. If he spoke to her at all, it was only to tease.</p><p>\u201cLast summer,\u201d she reminded him, \u201cyou told me you had no intentions of proposing to Diana. Or anyone. But today, gossip in the village says different.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d He twisted his signet ring. \u201cWell, your sister is lovely and elegant. And your mother\u2019s made no secret that she\u2019d welcome the match.\u201d</p><p>Minerva curled her toes in her boots. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>Last year, the Highwoods had come to this seaside village for a summer holiday. The sea air was supposed to improve Diana\u2019s health. Well, Diana\u2019s health had long been improved and summer was long gone, yet the Highwoods remained\u2014all because of Mama\u2019s hopes for a match between Diana and this charming viscount. So long as Lord Payne was in Spindle Cove, Mama would not hear of returning home. She\u2019d even developed an uncharacteristic streak of optimism\u2014each morning declaring as she stirred her chocolate, \u201cI feel it, girls. Today is the day he proposes.\u201d</p> <p>And though Minerva knew Lord Payne to be the worst sort of man, she had never found it in herself to object. Because she loved it here. She didn\u2019t want to leave. In Spindle Cove, she finally . . . belonged.</p><p>Here, in her own personal paradise, she explored the rocky, fossil-studded coast free from care or censure, cataloging findings that could set England\u2019s scientific community on its ear. The only thing that kept her from being completely happy was Lord Payne\u2019s presence\u2014and through one of life\u2019s strange ironies, his presence was the very reason she was able to stay.</p><p>There\u2019d seemed no harm in allowing Mama to nurse hopes of a proposal from his lordship\u2018s quarter. Minerva had known for certain a proposal wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>Until this morning, when her certainty crumbled.</p><p>\u201cThis morning, I was in the All Things shop,\u201d she began. \u201cI usually ignore Sally Bright\u2019s gossip, but today . . .\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cShe said you\u2019d given directions for your mail to be forwarded to London, after next week. She thinks you\u2019re leaving Spindle Cove.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you concluded that this means I\u2019ll marry your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone knows your situation. If you had two shillings to rub together, you\u2019d have left months ago. You\u2019re stranded here until your fortune\u2019s released from trust on your birthday, unless . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cUnless you marry first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all true.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward in her chair. \u201cI\u2019ll leave in a heartbeat, if you\u2019ll only repeat your words to me from last summer. That you have no intentions toward Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was last summer. It\u2019s April now. Is it so inconceivable that I might have changed my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cI know. You think I don\u2019t possess a mind to change. Is that the sticking point?\u201d</p><p>She sat forward in her chair. \u201cYou can\u2019t change your mind, because you haven\u2019t changed. You\u2019re a deceitful, insincere rake who flirts with unsuspecting ladies by day, then takes up with other men\u2019s wives by night.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cListen, Miranda. Since Fiona Lange left the village, I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Minerva held up a hand. She didn\u2019t want to hear about his affaire with Mrs. Lange. She\u2019d heard more than enough from the woman herself, who\u2019d fancied herself a poetess. Minerva wished she could scrub her mind of those poems. Ribald, rhapsodic odes that exhausted every possible rhyme for \u201cquiver\u201d and \u201cbliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t marry my sister,\u201d she told him, willing firmness to her voice. \u201cI simply won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>As their mother was so fond of telling anyone who\u2019d listen, Diana Highwood was exactly the sort of young lady who could set her cap for a handsome lord. But Diana\u2019s external beauty dulled in comparison to her sweet, generous nature and the quiet courage with which she\u2019d braved illness all her life.</p><p>Certainly, Diana could catch a viscount. But she shouldn\u2019t marry this one.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve her,\u201d she told Lord Payne.</p> <p>\u201cTrue enough. But none of us get what we truly deserve in this life. Where would God\u2019s sport be in that?\u201d He took the glass from her hand and drew a leisurely sip of wine.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t dislike me. Love\u2019s hardly required.\u201d Leaning forward, he propped an arm on his knee. \u201cDiana would be too polite to refuse. Your mother would be overjoyed. My cousin would send the special license in a trice. We could be married this week. You could be calling me \u2018brother\u2019 by Sunday.\u201d</p><p>No. Her whole body shouted the rejection. Every last corpuscle.</p><p>Throwing off the borrowed greatcoat, she leaped to her feet and began pacing the carpet. The wet folds of her skirt tangled as she strode. \u201cThis can\u2019t happen. It cannot. It will not.\u201d A little growl forced its way through her clenched teeth.</p><p>She balled her hands in fists. \u201cI have twenty-two pounds saved from my pin money. That, and some change. It\u2019s yours, all of it, if you promise to leave Diana alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two pounds?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYour sisterly sacrifice is touching. But that amount wouldn\u2019t keep me in London a week. Not the way I live.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. She\u2019d expected as much, but she\u2019d reasoned it couldn\u2019t hurt to try a bribe first. It would have been so much easier.</p><p>She took a deep breath and lifted her chin. This was it\u2014her last chance to dissuade him. \u201cThen run away with me instead.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s stunned pause, he broke into hearty laughter.</p><p>She let the derisive sounds wash over her and simply waited, arms crossed. Until his laughter dwindled, ending with a choked cough.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly serious. Leave Diana alone, and run away with me.\u201d</p><p>He drained the wineglass and set it aside. Then he cleared his throat and began, \u201cThat is brave of you, pet. Offering to wed me in your sister\u2019s stead. But truly, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Minerva. I\u2019m not your pet. And you\u2019re deranged if you think I\u2019d ever marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun away with you, yes. Marry you?\u201d She made an incredulous noise in her throat. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cI can see you\u2019re baffled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. I would have admitted as much, but I know what pleasure you take in pointing out my intellectual shortcomings.\u201d</p><p>Rummaging through the inside pockets of her cloak, she located her copy of the scientific journal. She opened it to the announcement page and held it out for his examination. \u201cThere\u2019s to be a meeting of the Royal Geological Society at the end of this month. A symposium. If you\u2019ll agree to come with me, my savings should be enough to fund our journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA geology symposium.\u201d He flicked a glance at the journal. \u201cThis is your scandalous midnight proposal. The one you trudged through the cold, wet dark to make. You\u2019re inviting me to a geology symposium, if I leave your sister alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you expecting me to offer? Seven nights of wicked, carnal pleasure in your bed?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d meant it as a joke, but he didn\u2019t laugh. Instead, he eyed her sodden frock.</p><p>Minerva went lobster red beneath it. Curse it. She was forever saying the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have found that offer more tempting,\u201d he said.</p><p>Truly? She bit her tongue to keep from saying it aloud. How lowering, to admit how much his offhand comment thrilled her. I\u2019d prefer your carnal pleasures to a lecture about dirt. High compliment indeed.</p><p>\u201cA geology symposium,\u201d he repeated to himself. \u201cI should have known there\u2019d be rocks at the bottom of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rocks at the bottom of everything. That\u2019s why we geologists find them so interesting. At any rate, I\u2019m not tempting you with the symposium itself. I\u2019m tempting you with the promise of five hundred guineas.\u201d</p><p>Now she had his attention. His gaze sharpened. \u201cFive hundred guineas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the prize for the best presentation. If you take me there and help present my findings to the Society, you can keep it all. Five hundred guineas would be sufficient to keep you drunk and debauched in London until your birthday, I should hope?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWith a bit of judicious budgeting. I might have to hold off on new boots, but one must make some sacrifices.\u201d He came to his feet, confronting her face-to-face. \u201cHere\u2019s the wrinkle, however. How could you be certain of winning the prize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll win. I could explain my findings to you in detail, but a great many polysyllabic words would be involved. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re up to them just now. Suffice it to say, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a searching look, and Minerva marshaled the strength to hold it. Level, confident, unblinking.</p><p>After a moment, his eyes warmed with an unfamiliar glimmer. Here was an emotion she\u2019d never seen from him before.</p><p>She thought it might be . . . respect.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainty becomes you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave a queer flutter. It was the nicest thing he\u2019d ever said to her. She thought it might be the nicest thing anyone had ever said to her.</p><p>Certainty becomes you.</p><p>And suddenly, things were different. The ounce of wine she\u2019d swallowed unfurled in her belly, warming and relaxing her. Melting away her awkwardness. She felt comfortable in her surroundings, and more than a little worldly. As though this were the most natural thing in the world, to be having a midnight conversation in a turret with a half-dressed rake.</p><p>She settled languidly into the armchair and raised her hands to her hair, finding and plucking loose her few remaining pins. With slow, dreamy motions, she finger-combed the wet locks and arranged them about her shoulders, the better to dry evenly.</p><p>He stood and watched her for a moment. Then he went to pour more wine.</p><p>A sensuous ribbon of claret swirled into the glass. \u201cMind, I\u2019m not agreeing to this scheme. Not by any stretch of the imagination. But just for the sake of argument, how did you see this proceeding, exactly? One morning, we\u2019d just up and leave for London together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not London. The symposium is in Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdinburgh.\u201d Bottle met table with a clunk. \u201cThe Edinburgh in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said this was the Royal Geological Society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She waved the journal at him. \u201cThe Royal Geological Society of Scotland. Didn\u2019t you know? Edinburgh\u2019s where all the most interesting scholarship happens.\u201d</p><p>Crossing back to her, he peered at the journal. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this takes place less than a fortnight from now. Marietta, don\u2019t you realize what a journey to Scotland entails? You\u2019re talking about two weeks\u2019 travel, at the minimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s four days from London on the mail coach. I\u2019ve checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mail coach? Pet, a viscount does not travel on the mail coach.\u201d He shook his head, sitting across from her. \u201cAnd how is your dear mother going to take this news, when she finds you\u2019ve absconded to Scotland with a scandalous lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be thrilled. So long as one of her daughters marries you, she won\u2019t be particular.\u201d Minerva eased her feet from her wet, muddy boots and drew her legs up beneath her skirts, tucking her chilled heels under her backside. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, don\u2019t you see? We\u2019ll stage it as an elopement. My mother won\u2019t raise any protest, and neither will Lord Rycliff. He\u2019ll be only too happy to think you\u2019re marrying at last. We\u2019ll travel to Scotland, present my findings, collect the prize. Then we\u2019ll tell everyone it simply didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>The more she explained her ideas, the easier the words sprang to her lips and the more excited she grew. This could work. It could really, truly work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll just return to Spindle Cove unmarried, after weeks of travel with me? Don\u2019t you realize you\u2019d be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuined in good society? I know.\u201d She looked into the roaring fire. \u201cI\u2019m willing to accept that fate. I had no desire for a society marriage, anyhow.\u201d No hopes of one, to put it finely. She didn\u2019t relish the thought of scandal and gossip. But could it really be so much worse to be cut off from fashionable society than to feel forever squeezed to its margins?</p><p>\u201cBut what of your sisters? They\u2019ll be tainted by association.\u201d</p> <p>His remark gave her pause. It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t thought about this possibility. To the contrary, she\u2019d considered it very carefully.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte has years before her debut,\u201d she said. \u201cShe can weather a bit of scandal. And as for Diana . . . sometimes I think the kindest thing I could do for my sister is ruin her chances of making a \u2018good\u2019 marriage. Then she might make a loving one.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his wine thoughtfully. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve worked all this out to your satisfaction. You have no compunction ruining your reputation, nor those of your sisters. But have you given a moment\u2019s thought to mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your what? Your reputation?\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut your reputation is terrible.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks colored, slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p> <p>She put her left forefinger to her right thumb. \u201cPoint the first. You\u2019re a shameless rake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He drew out the word.</p><p>She touched her index finger. \u201cPoint the second. Your name is synonymous with destruction. Bar fights, scandals . . . literal explosions. Wherever you go, mayhem follows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really try at that part. It just . . . happens.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you worry this scheme would tarnish your reputation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He leaned forward and braced his elbows on his knees. He gestured with the hand holding the wineglass. \u201cI\u2019m a lover of women, yes.\u201d Then he lifted his empty hand. \u201cAnd yes, I seem to break everything I touch. But thus far I\u2019ve succeeded in keeping the two proclivities separate, you see. I sleep with women and I ruin things, but I\u2019ve never yet ruined an innocent woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeems like a mere oversight on your part.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cPerhaps. But it\u2019s not one I mean to remedy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers, unguarded and earnest. And a strange thing happened. Minerva believed him. This was one snag she never would have considered. That he might object on principle. She hadn\u2019t dreamed he possessed a scruple to offend.</p><p>But he did, evidently. And he was baring it to her, in an attitude of confidence. As though they were friends, and he trusted her to understand.</p><p>Something had changed between them, in the ten minutes since she\u2019d pounded on his door.</p><p>She sat back in the chair, regarding him. \u201cYou are a different person at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he agreed simply. \u201cBut then, so are you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m always this person, inside. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d Somehow, I can never manage to be this person with you. The harder I try, the more I get in my own way.</p> <p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m honored by your invitation, but this excursion you suggest can\u2019t happen. I\u2019d return looking like the worst sort of seducer and cad. And justly so. Having absconded with, then callously discarded, an innocent young lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I be the one to discard you?\u201d</p><p>A little chuckle escaped him. \u201cBut who would ever believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut off his reply. A moment too late.</p><p>\u201cWho would ever believe that,\u201d she finished for him. \u201cWho indeed.\u201d</p><p>Cursing, he set aside the wineglass. \u201cCome now. Don\u2019t take offense.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes ago, she would have expected him to laugh. She would have been prepared for his derision, and she wouldn\u2019t have allowed him to see how it hurt. But things had changed. She\u2019d accepted his coat and his wine. More than that, his honesty. She\u2019d let down her guard. And now this.</p><p>It cut her deep.</p><p>Her eyes stung. \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable. I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. What everyone would say. It\u2019s inconceivable that a man like you could be in\u2014\u201d She swallowed. \u201cCould be taken with a girl like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. It\u2019s preposterous. Laughable. The idea that you might want me, and I might spurn you? I\u2019m plain. Bookish, distracted, awkward. Hopeless.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cIn a geologic age, no one would believe it.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled her feet into her boots. Then she pushed to her feet and reached for her cloak.</p><p>He rose and reached for her hand. She pulled away, but not fast enough. His fingers closed around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cThey would believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cI could make them believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou horrid, teasing man. You can\u2019t even remember my name.\u201d She wrestled his grip.</p><p>He tightened it. \u201cMinerva.\u201d</p><p>Her body went still. Her breath burned in her lungs, as though she\u2019d been fighting her way through waist-deep snow.</p><p>\u201cListen to me now,\u201d he said, smooth and low. \u201cI could make them believe it. I\u2019m not going to do so, because I think this scheme of yours is a spectacularly bad idea. But I could. If I chose, I could have all Spindle Cove\u2014all England\u2014convinced that I\u2019m utterly besotted with you.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo, truly. It would be so easy. I\u2019d begin by studying you, when you aren\u2019t aware of it. Stealing glances when you\u2019re lost in thought, or when your head\u2019s bent over a book. Admiring the way that dark, wild hair always manages to escapes its pins, tumbling down your neck.\u201d With his free hand, he caught a damp strand of her hair in his fingertips and smoothed it behind her ear. Then he brushed a light touch over her cheek. \u201cNoting the warm glow of your skin, where the sun has kissed it. And these lips. Damn. I think I\u2019d have to develop quite a fascination with your lips.\u201d</p><p>His thumb hovered over her mouth, teasing her with possibilities. She ached for his touch, until she was miserable with it. This . . . unwanted wanting.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long. Soon everyone around us would take note of my interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d believe my attraction to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been mercilessly teasing me for months now. No one would forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll part of the infatuation. Don\u2019t you know? A man might engage in flirtation with disinterest, even disdain. But he never teases without affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. Others would.\u201d He placed his hands on her shoulders. His gaze swept her body from boots to unbound hair. \u201cI could have them all believing I\u2019m consumed by a savage, visceral passion for this enchantress with raven\u2019s-wing hair and sultry lips. That I admire her fierce loyalty to her sisters, and her brave, resourceful spirit. That I\u2019m driven wild by hints of a deep, hidden passion that escape her sometimes, when she ventures out of her shell. \u201c His strong hands moved to frame her face. His Bristol-diamond eyes held hers. \u201cThat I see in her a rare, wild beauty that\u2019s been overlooked, somehow, by other men. And I want it. Desperately. All for myself. Oh, I could have them believing it all.\u201d</p><p>The rich, deep flow of words had worked some kind of spell on her. She stood transfixed, unable to move or speak.</p><p>It\u2019s not real, she reminded herself. None of these words mean a thing.</p><p>But his caress was real. Real, and warm, and tender. It could mean too much, if she let it. Caution told her to pull away.</p><p>Instead, she placed a light, trembling touch to his shoulder. Foolish hand. Foolish fingers.</p><p>\u201cIf I wished,\u201d he murmured, drawing her close and tilting her face to his, \u201cI could convince everyone that the true reason I\u2019ve remained in Spindle Cove\u2014months past what should have been my breaking point\u2014has nothing to do with my cousin or my finances.\u201d His voice went husky. \u201cThat it\u2019s simply you, Minerva.\u201d He caressed her cheek, so sweetly her heart ached. \u201cThat it\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were sincere, unguarded. No hint of irony in his voice. He almost seemed to have convinced himself.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest with violent force. That mad, hammering beat was all she could hear.</p><p>Until another sound intruded.</p><p>Laughter. A woman\u2019s laughter. Trickling down from above, like a cascade of freezing water. A brisk, dousing shock.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d He looked up, to the sleeping loft.</p><p>Minerva followed his gaze. From behind the draped bed hangings, the unseen woman laughed again. Laughed at her.</p><p>Oh God. Oh God.</p><p>How could she have been so stupid? Naturally, he wasn\u2019t alone. He\u2019d all but told her as much. He\u2019d taken forever to open the door, but he hadn\u2019t been sleeping. He\u2019d paused first to . . .</p><p>To put on trousers.</p><p>Oh God oh God oh God.</p><p>The whole time. Whoever she was up there, she\u2019d been listening the whole time.</p><p>Minerva groped numbly for her cloak, jerking it on with shaking fingers. The fire\u2019s smoky heat was suddenly cloying and thick. Suffocating. She had to leave this place. She was going to be ill.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, following her to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s not how it looks.\u201d</p><p>She cut him a freezing glare.</p><p>\u201cVery well, it\u2019s mostly how it looks. But I swear, I\u2019d forgotten she was even here.\u201d</p><p>She ceased struggling with the door latch. \u201cAnd that\u2019s supposed to make me think better of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to make you think better of you. That\u2019s all I meant. To make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Amazing, then, how with that one remark, he made a mortifying situation thirteen times worse.</p><p>\u201cI see. Normally you reserve the insincere compliments for your lovers. But you thought to take on a charity case.\u201d He started to reply, but she cut him off. She glanced up at the loft. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She wrenched the door open. \u201cGood Lord. Are women so interchangeable and faceless to you? You just . . . lose track of them under the bed cushions, like pennies? I can\u2019t believe I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hot tear spilled down her cheek. She hated that tear. Hated that he\u2019d seen it. A man like this wasn\u2019t worth weeping over. It was just . . . for that moment by the fire, after years of being overlooked, she\u2019d finally felt noticed. Appreciated.</p><p>Wanted.</p><p>And it had all been a lie. A ridiculous, laughable joke.</p><p>He pulled on his greatcoat. \u201cLet me see you home, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay back. Don\u2019t come near me, or my sister.\u201d She held him off with a hand as she backed through the door. \u201cYou are the most deceitful, horrid, shameless, contemptible man I have ever had the displeasure to know. How do you sleep at night?\u201d</p><p>His reply came just as she banged the door closed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>He didn\u2019t sleep that night.</p><p>After Minerva Highwood stormed off into the rain, even a dissolute, soulless rake like Colin couldn\u2019t simply continue where he\u2019d left off. He roused the widow from his bed, put her in her clothes, and saw her back to the village. Once he\u2019d satisfied himself that Minerva had made it home safe\u2014by glimpsing her muddied boots outside the rear door of the rooming house\u2014he returned to his quarters at the castle and uncorked a new bottle of wine.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t sleep a wink.</p><p>He never did. Not at night, not alone.</p><p>God, he hated the country. All the sunshine and sea air in Sussex couldn\u2019t make up for the dark, quiet nights. Lately, Colin thought he\u2019d give his left nipple\u2014bollocks were never up for negotiation\u2014for a decent night\u2019s sleep. Ever since Fiona Lange had left the village, at best he\u2019d been able to cobble together a few hours in the early dawn. For most of the winter, he\u2019d taken to drinking himself into a nightly stupor. But his body, already taxed from lack of rest, was beginning to fray from the volume of liquor required. If he wasn\u2019t careful, he\u2019d become a habitual drunk. He was too young for that, damn it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So he\u2019d finally given in and accepted the clear invitation Mrs. Ginny Watson\u2019s smiles and cocked hips had been making for some time. He\u2019d resisted the young widow for months now, not wanting to entangle himself with a village resident. But he\u2019d be leaving in a matter of days. Why not make his last few nights bearable? Who could it possibly hurt?</p><p>Who, indeed.</p><p>In his mind\u2019s eye, he saw Minerva Highwood. That single tear streaking down her face.</p> <p>Poorly done, Payne. Poorly done.</p><p>He should have sent her away at once. He had no intention of marrying Diana Highwood, never had. But Minerva had been cold and wet, in need of some time before the fire. And he\u2019d found it perversely amusing, teasing out her little chain of conclusions to its wild, illogical end.</p><p>Of all the mad schemes to propose . . . a fake elopement to win a geology prize? She\u2019d never win any points on elegance. But Colin had to admit, that kind of girl didn\u2019t knock on his door every night.</p><p>The worst of it was, that seductive claptrap he\u2019d spooned her . . . it hadn\u2019t all been lies. She wasn\u2019t without her peculiar brand of allure. Her dark hair, when unbound and spilling in heavy waves to her waist, was seduction itself. And her mouth truly did fascinate him. For a sharp-tongued bluestocking, she had the most full, ripe, sultry lips he\u2019d ever seen. Lips copied from some Renaissance master\u2019s Aphrodite. Dark red at the edges, and a paler hue toward the center\u2014like two slices of a ripe plum. Sometimes she caught her lower lip beneath her teeth and worried it, as though savoring some hidden sweetness.</p><p>Was it any wonder then, that for several minutes, he truly had forgotten Ginny Watson upstairs?</p> <p>Minerva had paid the price for his thoughtlessness.</p><p>This was why he needed to be back in London. There, habitual debauchery kept him out of this sort of trouble. He and his friends roved from club to club like a pack of nocturnal beasts. And when he tired of the revelry, he had no problem finding worldly, willing women to share his bed. He gave them exquisite physical pleasure, they gave him some much-needed solace . . . everyone parted ways satisfied.</p><p>Tonight, he\u2019d left two women profoundly dissatisfied. And he kept vigil with that old, familiar bitch, regret.</p><p>At least his days here were numbered. Bram was set to arrive at the castle tomorrow. Ostensibly, he was making the trip to inspect his militia after several months\u2019 absence. However, Colin knew from his cousin\u2019s express\u2014he had other business in mind. After long months, Colin would have his reprieve.</p><p>Farewell, stone-cold quarters.</p><p>Farewell, torturous country nights.</p> <p>In a matter of days, he would be gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, I\u2019m staying here?\u201d Colin stared at his cousin, feeling as though he\u2019d just taken a punch to the gut. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain.\u201d Bram gestured mildly. \u201cThis is the normal way with birthdays, see? Amazingly enough, they arrive on the same day, every year. And yours is still two months away. Until then, I\u2019m trustee of your fortune. I control your every last ha\u2019penny, and you\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head. \u201cThis makes no sense. He\u2019s surrendered. You just announced it to the whole village. The war is over.\u201d</p><p>They stood in front of the Bull and Blossom, Spindle Cove\u2019s one and only tavern. After overseeing the afternoon militia drill, Bram had invited all the volunteers to gather for a pint. There he\u2019d announced the latest word from France, sure to blaze across every broadsheet in England tomorrow morning. Napoleon Bonaparte had renounced the throne, and now it was merely a matter of paperwork.</p><p>Victory was theirs.</p><p>Jubilation shook the tavern to its timber frame. Children ran to St. Ursula\u2019s to ring the church bell. The first pint quickly became two, then three. As afternoon faded to twilight, wives and sweethearts filtered in from the village lanes, carrying with them dishes of food. Someone brought out a fiddle. Before long, the dancing would begin. All Spindle Cove\u2014all England\u2014had reason to celebrate.</p><p>By all rights, Colin ought to be rejoicing, too.</p> <p>Instead, he felt dead inside. It was an all-too-familiar sensation.</p><p>\u201cBram, you needed me to oversee the militia in your absence, and I\u2019ve done that duty.\u201d At no small cost to my sanity. \u201cI\u2019ve even looked out for your damn pet sheep. But if the war is over, there\u2019s no further need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether there\u2019s a need or not, the militia remains embodied until the Crown decrees otherwise. I can\u2019t just disband it when the whim strikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Thorne can oversee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Thorne, anyway?\u201d Bram scanned the environs for his corporal.</p><p>Colin gestured vaguely. \u201cOff doing whatever it is he does. Shaving with a rusted field scythe. Skinning eels with his bare hands, perhaps. He actually likes this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Bram. \u201cBut you need this place.\u201d</p><p>Colin scrubbed his face with both hands. He knew Bram meant well. His cousin truly believed stranding Colin penniless in the Sussex countryside to oversee a local militia was his best chance at redeeming a dissolute existence. What Bram didn\u2019t understand was that they were different kinds of men. Military discipline and rural life may have tamed Bram\u2019s demons, but they were only feeding Colin\u2019s.</p><p>There was no way to explain that in terms Bram could understand. And what was Colin supposed to say, anyhow? Thank you very much for giving a damn, but I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t? Bram was his only family now. Over the past year, they\u2019d forged a tenuous bond of brotherly affection, and Colin didn\u2019t want to muck that up.</p><p>\u201cColin, if you want to leave Spindle Cove, you have options. You know the trust ends if you marry. The right wife could be good for you.\u201d</p><p>He quietly groaned. Again and again, he\u2019d witnessed this phenomenon with his friends. They got married. They were happy in that sated, grateful way of infrequently pleasured men with a now-steady source of coitus. Then they went about crowing as if they\u2019d invented the institution of matrimony and stood to earn a profit for every bachelor they could convert.</p><p>\u201cBram, I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re happy with Susanna and the babe on the way. But that doesn\u2019t mean marriage is a good thing for me. In fact, I think it would be a very bad thing for the woman I happened to marry.\u201d He tapped his fist against the building. \u201cListen, I need to go to Town. I made a promise to Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised Finn what, precisely?\u201d Bram looked through the window, scanning the assembled militiamen for the fifteen-year-old drummer boy.</p><p>\u201cI lost a bet to him, see. At stake was a pair of boots. I\u2019d hand over my own Hobys, but they\u2019re several sizes too large yet. So I said I\u2019d take him to London for a new custom pair. And then I figured we\u2019d make some trips to schools, so we can have that sorted out before autumn term begins.\u201d</p><p>Bram shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve already found Finn a school here in Sussex. Flintridge School for Boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlintridge? What about Eton? We told his mother we\u2019d give him the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best for Finn. Flintridge offers an excellent education, closer to home. Besides, the Brights own a dry-goods shop, and you want to send him to Eton? You know he\u2019d feel out of place.\u201d</p><p>Colin knew all about Eton and feeling out of place. He\u2019d arrived there a young tragedy at the age of eight. Freshly orphaned, still reeling from the loss of his parents. At that time, small for his age. He would have been a favorite target even without the nightmares. The nightmares just added verbal taunts to the bullies\u2019 arsenal. He could still hear their mocking falsetto.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d they\u2019d squawk down the corridors. \u201cMother, wake!\u201d</p><p>The first year had been torture. But he\u2019d done well in the end.</p><p>\u201cI know the adjustment won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Colin said. \u201cBut I can teach Finn how to hold his own. He needs to see a bit more of the world, lose that wide-eyed country wonder. He should have a tutor, so he\u2019s not lagging behind in his studies. And if I outfit him with a fine pair of Hobys and take him round to the boxing club, he can dazzle the impressionable boys and kick the obstinate ones in the arse.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared through the window of the Bull and Blossom, to where Finn Bright leaned against the wall, grazing elbows with his twin brother, Rufus. From their shocks of white-blond hair to their gangly arms and mischievous smiles, the Bright twins were identical. Or at least they had been, until last summer\u2014when an artillery blast had taken Finn\u2019s left foot.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Bram said, reading his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOne I might have prevented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have prevented it, too.\u201d</p><p>Colin tapped a finger against the window. \u201cLook at him. He\u2019s healed, but he\u2019s restless. The weather\u2019s growing warm. He sees the rest of the youths his age all running off to play cricket, work the fields, chase the girls . . . It\u2019s sinking in, for the first time, what this means. What it will mean, for the rest of his life. I know you have to understand.\u201d</p><p>Bram had taken a shot to the knee in Spain, over a year ago now. He\u2019d kept the leg, but he still walked with a limp, and the injury had ended his career in field command. One would think his resistance to the idea should soften.</p><p>One would be wrong. Bram\u2019s expression looked every bit as soft as granite.</p><p>\u201cColin, you shouldn\u2019t have made the boy such promises. You\u2019re always doing this. I\u2019ve no doubt you meant well, but your good intentions land like mortar shells. Again and again, you fire off that mouth of yours, and the innocents around you get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Colin winced, thinking of Minerva Highwood last night. That single tear streaking down her face.</p><p>\u201cThis is precisely why I can\u2019t release you any funds,\u201d Bram went on. \u201cYou\u2019ll spin a fine tale about wholesome days spent mentoring Finn, and by night I know you\u2019ll end right back in the clubs and hells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, how I spend my nights is my own concern. I can\u2019t stay in this place, Bram. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do. I have a very good idea.\u201d Bram stepped closer and lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve commanded regiments in battle. Do you think I don\u2019t know what witnessing death and bloodshed does to a man? The nightmares, the restlessness. The drinking. The shadow that lingers years, even decades later. I\u2019ve known many a battle-shocked soldier.\u201d</p><p>As he absorbed his cousin\u2019s meaning, Colin\u2019s pulse pounded. Naturally, Bram knew about the accident. Almost everyone in his social circle knew about the accident. But the rest were well-mannered enough to understand\u2014Colin didn\u2019t discuss it. Ever.</p><p>He said, \u201cI\u2019m not one of your battle-shocked soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re my family. Can\u2019t you understand? I want to see you move past this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove past it?\u201d Colin laughed bitterly. \u201cWhy hadn\u2019t I ever thought of that?\u201d He slapped his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll simply move past it. What a bloody brilliant idea. Here\u2019s one for you, Bram. Just straighten up and stop limping. And Finn . . . well, Finn can just grow a new foot.\u201d</p><p>Bram sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend to know exactly what it is you need,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know you won\u2019t find it in the gaming hells and opera houses. These next months are my last chance to turn you around. After your birthday, the accounts, properties, Riverchase . . . they\u2019ll all be yours for the keeping. Or for the losing.\u201d</p><p>Colin sobered, instantly. \u201cI would never risk Riverchase. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even been there in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no wish to go.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cToo quiet. Too remote.\u201d</p><p>Too many memories.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to manage the place,\u201d Bram said.</p><p>Colin countered, \u201cThe land stewards have managed it well enough for years. They don\u2019t need me there. And I\u2019m happy living in Town.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat debauched, aimless existence you had in Town . . . You call that \u2018happy\u2019?\u201d Bram frowned. \u201cChrist, man. You can\u2019t even be honest with yourself.\u201d</p><p>Colin made a fist and checked the urge to use it.</p><p>He lowered his voice as Finn emerged from the tavern. \u201cThe boy has his things all packed, Bram. You can\u2019t disappoint him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I won\u2019t disappoint him. I\u2019ll leave that to you.\u201d</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>Finn crutched his way over to join them. \u201cWell, my lords?\u201d</p><p>Colin could tell the youth was struggling not to look too hopeful. That was Finn. Whether he\u2019d lost a game of darts or his whole left foot, he always put a brave face on disappointment. He was stronger than he let on, had more ambition than anyone guessed. This boy would truly be someone, someday. And he deserved better than bloody Flintridge School for Boys.</p><p>\u201cFinn, there\u2019s been a change of plans. We won\u2019t be going to London this week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cW-we won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be going to Town with Lord Rycliff instead.\u201d</p><p>Bram turned to him, stunned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs we agreed would be best.\u201d Colin shot his cousin a pointed look.</p><p>In return, Bram threw him a gaze that would pulverize walnuts in their shells.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . I thought I\u2019d be staying with you, Lord Payne.\u201d Finn looked to Colin, confused. \u201cWe were going to set up bachelors\u2019 lodgings in Covent Garden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, well. My cousin and I agree you need a wholesome family environment. For a while, at least. Isn\u2019t that right, Bram?\u201d</p><p>Come on, man. You can\u2019t refuse. Don\u2019t be an ass.</p><p>His cousin finally relented. \u201cWe\u2019ve just moved into the new town house, Finn. Susanna will be glad to have her first houseguest.\u201d</p><p>Colin drew Finn aside. \u201cI\u2019ll be along this summer, don\u2019t worry. Just in time for boating on the Thames.\u201d He leaned in to murmur, \u201cAnd the boxing, never you fear. There are tickets to a prize match in your future, if I hear good reports from your tutors.\u201d</p><p>The youth smiled. \u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><p>Bram said, \u201cGet your things, Finn. Meet me at the mews, and we\u2019ll see them stowed in the carriage. We leave at dawn.\u201d The two of them walked off together, making plans that didn\u2019t include Colin.</p><p>He tried to tell himself it had all worked out for the best. If he\u2019d taken Finn to London himself, Colin would have found some way to cock it up. Bram was right. Every time he tried to do something good, it had a way of going bad.</p><p>Strolling away from the tavern and onto the green, Colin brought out the flask from his breast pocket. He uncapped it and tossed back a quick draught. It burned going down\u2014as did the knowledge that it would be the first drink of many. Already, night was drawing her purple spangled veil over the cove. How he\u2019d survive the next few months without pickling his brain, he didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>A group of ladies approached, walking across the green on the path that led from the Queen\u2019s Ruby to the tavern. No surprise that the rooming-house residents would be enticed by the strains of dancing music. Colin faded into the shadows of the chestnut tree, feeling unequal to polite conversation at the moment.</p><p>As the ladies drew closer, he recognized them.</p><p>The Highwoods. The widowed matron took the fore, and her three daughters followed. First Charlotte, then Diana . . . finally, the lagging Minerva, her face predictably buried in a book. The evening breeze flirted with their skirts and shawls.</p><p>If he wanted to leave Spindle Cove, he did have options. Here came two of them now.</p><p>He could marry Diana.</p><p>Or he could run away to Scotland with Minerva.</p><p>Fine options, those. Would he prefer to destroy one sister\u2019s reputation, or ruin the other\u2019s future happiness? To be sure, he wanted to leave this place. But he\u2019d rather do so with some shred of decency intact.</p><p>Colin tossed back another swallow of liquor.</p><p>Diana Highwood would make some man a lovely bride. She was beautiful, elegant, refined, good-hearted. She could hold her own in the ton, no question, and she\u2019d tolerate Colin\u2019s excesses better than most. Which meant her sharp-tongued, bespectacled sister was absolutely right.</p><p>Diana deserved better.</p><p>As for the bespectacled sister in question . . . As he stared at the group crossing the green, Colin scarcely recognized her as the girl who\u2019d visited him last night. The bold, witty young woman who\u2019d let down her hair by his hearth and spoken with such captivating self-assurance. Where had that girl been, all these months?</p><p>More to the point, where was that girl now? The sprigged muslin gown she wore was neither flattering nor hideous. It could best be described as wholly unremarkable. As she walked, her shoulders were hunched, as though she could curl into herself. Taken together with the book shielding her face, she\u2019d done her level best to disappear.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood barked, \u201cMinerva! Posture.\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head. Considering the constant abuse she took from her mother, was it any wonder she wanted to hide?</p><p>Last night, she\u2019d ventured out of that shell. She\u2019d slogged all the way to the castle in the rain, pounded on his door until he let her in, and then offered to ruin herself to protect her sister. And what reward did she get for her pains? Humiliation. Derision. And more scolding from her mother.</p><p>He\u2019d never dreamed he\u2019d say this about the bluestocking who\u2019d spent the past several months skewering him with sharp glances and cutting remarks. But it was true.</p><p>Minerva deserved better.</p><p>Colin capped his flask and jammed it in his pocket. He might have to wait a few months to make his amends to Finn Bright. And even then, he\u2019d never be able to replace the youth\u2019s foot.</p><p>But he was going to settle this business with the Highwoods.</p><p>Tonight.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>When Minerva lost herself in a book, her late father had once remarked, a man needed hounds and a search party to pull her back out.</p><p>Alternatively, a low-hanging tree branch could do the trick.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Pulling up short, Minerva rubbed her smarting temple and adjusted her spectacles with one hand. With the other, she kept her page marked.</p><p>Charlotte gave her a pitying tilt of the head. \u201cOh, Min. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you injured?\u201d Diana asked, concerned.</p><p>Ahead of them, their mother wheeled and gave a despairing sigh. \u201cMinerva Rose Highwood. For all your unnatural love of education, you can be remarkably stupid.\u201d She walked over and grasped Minerva by the elbow, tugging her across the village green. \u201cI will never understand how you came into being.\u201d</p><p>No, Mama, Minerva thought, trudging her way along the path. I doubt you ever will.</p><p>Most people didn\u2019t understand her. Even before last night\u2019s humiliation, she\u2019d long reconciled herself to the fact. Lately, it seemed the one who best understood Minerva wasn\u2019t a person at all, but a place. Spindle Cove, this seaside resort for young ladies of gentle breeding and, well, interesting character. Whether sickly, scholarly, or scandalous\u2014the young women here were all misfits of one kind or another. The villagers didn\u2019t care if Minerva dug in the dirt, or wandered down the country paths with the breeze whipping through her hair and an open book before her face.</p><p>She\u2019d felt so at home here, so comfortable. Until tonight.</p><p>The closer they drew to the tavern and the revelry within, the more her sense of dread increased. \u201cMama, can\u2019t we go back to the rooming house? The weather\u2019s so dire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mild, compared to last week\u2019s rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of Diana\u2019s health. She\u2019s just recovered from a cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPish. That was weeks ago now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mama . . .\u201d Desperate, Minerva cast about for some other excuse. \u201cWhat of propriety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPropriety?\u201d Mama held up Minerva\u2019s ungloved hand, displaying the earth embedded under her fingernails. \u201cYou would speak to me of propriety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well. It\u2019s one thing to frequent the Bull and Blossom in the afternoon, when it\u2019s a ladies tea shop. But after dark, it\u2019s a tavern.\u201d Minerva wouldn\u2019t mention where she\u2019d been last night.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s an opium den. It\u2019s the only hope of dancing in ten miles,\u201d her mother replied. \u201cAnd Payne is certain to be there. We\u2019ll have a proposal tonight. I feel it in my bones.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps Mama felt it in her bones, but Minerva\u2019s reaction was more visceral. Her heart and stomach switched places, jostling inside her.</p><p>As they approached the tavern door, Minerva buried her face in her book. Be they novels or histories or scientific treatises, books were frequently her refuge. Tonight, the book was her literal shield, her only barrier against the world. She didn\u2019t dare leave Diana alone tonight, but she didn\u2019t know how she could bear to face Lord Payne again. Not to mention the hidden lover who\u2019d laughed at Minerva\u2019s foolish hopes. His \u201cfriend\u201d could have been any woman in this crowded room. And whoever she was, she might have already related the story to everyone else.</p><p>As they entered the establishment and made their way through the throng, Minerva was certain she heard someone laughing.</p><p>Laughing at her.</p><p>This was the worst result of that disastrous midnight visit. For months now, Spindle Cove had been Minerva\u2019s safe haven. Now she\u2019d never feel comfortable here again. The echo of that cruel laughter would follow her down every country path and cobbled lane. He\u2019d ruined this place for her.</p><p>Now he threatened to ruin the rest of their lives.</p><p>You could be calling me \u201cbrother\u201d by Sunday.</p><p>No. She couldn\u2019t let it happen. She wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d stop it somehow, even if she had to hurl her book at the man\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s plaintive comment gave her hope. Minerva lowered her book and scanned the crowd. The militia volunteers filled the establishment, splashing bright red and gold against the lime-washed walls. She dipped her chin and peered over the lenses, focusing on the distant side of the room, where men and women crowded at the bar.</p><p>No Lord Payne.</p><p>Her breath came easier. She pushed the spectacles back up her nose, and she felt the corners of her mouth relax into some semblance of a smile. Perhaps he\u2019d experienced an attack of conscience. More likely, he\u2019d stayed behind in his turret to entertain his easily amused lady friend. It hardly mattered where he was, so long as he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>\u201cOh, there,\u201d Mama said, swiveling. \u201cThere he is. He\u2019s just come in the back way.\u201d</p><p>Drat.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s heart sank when she caught her first glimpse of him. He did not look like a man who\u2019d experienced an attack of conscience. He looked dark and more dangerous than ever. Though he\u2019d only just come through the door, he\u2019d instantly changed the room\u2019s atmosphere. A palpable, restless energy radiated from his quarter, and everyone could feel it. The whole tavern went on alert. An unspoken message relayed from body to body.</p><p>Something is about to happen.</p><p>The musicians struck up the prelude to a country dance. Around the room, couples began pairing off.</p><p>Lord Payne, however, was in no hurry. He raised a flask to his mouth and tipped it. Minerva swallowed instinctively, as though she could feel the liquor burning down her own throat.</p><p>He lowered the flask. Capped it. Replaced it in his pocket. And then his gaze settled, hot and unwavering, on the Highwoods.</p><p>The little hairs on the back of her neck stood on end.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking at you, Diana,\u201d their mother murmured with excitement. \u201cHe\u2019s sure to ask you to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana shouldn\u2019t dance,\u201d Minerva said, unable to take her eyes off him. \u201cNot a reel like this. Her asthma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPish. The sea air has worked its benefit. She hasn\u2019t had an attack in months now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. But the last one was brought on by dancing.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhy must I always be the one to look out for Diana\u2019s well-being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m looking out for yours. Ungrateful thing.\u201d</p><p>Mama\u2019s gaze pierced her. As a girl, Minerva had envied her mother\u2019s blue eyes. They\u2019d seemed the color of tropical oceans and cloudless skies. But their color had faded over the years since Papa\u2019s death. Now their blue was the hue of dyed cambric worn three seasons. Or brittle middle-class china.</p> <p>The color of patience nearly worn through.</p><p>\u201cThere are four of us, Minerva. All women. No husband, father, or brother in the portrait. We may not be destitute, but we lack true security. Diana has the chance to catch a wealthy, handsome viscount, and I won\u2019t allow you to stand in her way. Who else is going to save this family? You?\u201d She laughed bitterly.</p><p>Minerva couldn\u2019t even summon a response.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s coming,\u201d Charlotte squeaked. \u201cHe\u2019s coming this way.\u201d</p><p>Panic fluttered in Minerva\u2019s breast. Did Payne truly mean to propose tonight? Any man with sense would. Diana was always beautiful, but tonight she looked radiant, dressed in an emerald silk gown with ivory lace trim. Her flaxen hair glowed incandescent in the candlelight, and her ethereal composure gave her the air of a lady.</p> <p>She looked like a viscountess.</p><p>And Lord Payne looked every inch the powerful lord. The man strode across the room toward them, cutting his way through the crowd in a straight, unswerving path. People leaped out of his way, like startled crickets. His gaze was intent, determined, focused on . . .</p><p>On her. On Minerva.</p><p>Don\u2019t be a ninny.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. Surely it was just a trick of her spectacles. He was coming for Diana, naturally. Obviously. And she hated him for it. He was a horrid, horrid man.</p><p>But her heart would not stop pounding. Heat gathered between her breasts. She\u2019d always wondered what it would feel like to stand on one end of a ballroom and watch a handsome, powerful man make his way to her. This was as close as she\u2019d ever come to it, she supposed. Standing at Diana\u2019s side. Imagining.</p> <p>Suddenly anxious, she looked to the floor. Then the ceiling. Then she chided herself for her cowardice and forced herself to look at him.</p><p>He drew to a halt and bowed, then offered a hand. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>Minerva\u2019s heart stalled. The book slipped from her hand and fell to the floor.</p><p>\u201cDiana, pass me your reticule,\u201d Mama whispered. \u201cQuickly now. I\u2019ll hold it while you dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that will be necessary,\u201d Diana answered.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s necessary. You can\u2019t dance with that bulky reticule dangling from your wrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to dance at all. Lord Payne has invited Minerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvited Minerva. Of all the ideas.\u201d Mama made a disbelieving, indelicate snort. Which became a strangled gasp, when the woman looked up and finally noticed that Lord Payne\u2019s hand was indeed outstretched to Minerva. \u201cBut . . . why?\u201d</p> <p>He said simply, \u201cBecause I choose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Truly? As in, had Minerva truly just said that aloud?</p><p>At least she\u2019d stopped herself from voicing the rest of the thoughts running through her addled brain, which went something like, Truly? That whole determined, dangerous saunter across the room was for me? In that case, would you mind going back and doing it all over again? Slowly this time, and with feeling.</p><p>\u201cMiss Minerva,\u201d he said, in a voice smooth and dark as obsidian, \u201cmay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>She watched, mute and entranced, as his ungloved hand clasped hers. His grip was warm and strong.</p><p>She held her breath, feeling the eyes of the whole village on them.</p><p>Please. Please, don\u2019t let anyone laugh.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she forced herself to say. \u201cI would be most . . . relieved.\u201d</p><p>He led her to the floor, where they queued up for the country dance.</p><p>\u201cRelieved?\u201d he murmured with amusement. \u201cLadies usually find themselves \u2018delighted\u2019 or \u2018honored\u2019 to dance with me. Even \u2018thrilled.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She shrugged helplessly. \u201cIt was the first word that came to mind.\u201d</p><p>And it had been honest, at the time. Though as she took her place across from him and the first bars of the music began, her relief evaporated. Fear took its place.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t dance,\u201d she confessed, stepping forward.</p><p>He took her hands and twirled her round. \u201cBut you\u2019re already dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very well.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow quirked. \u201cThis is true.\u201d</p><p>Minerva curtseyed to the wrong corner, colliding with the lady her to her left. Offering the woman a breathless apology, she overcorrected\u2014and stomped on Lord Payne\u2019s foot.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, holding her close to his side as they moved forward and back. \u201cYou weren\u2019t exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never exaggerate. I\u2019m hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hopeless. Stop trying so hard. If we\u2019re going to manage this, you must let me lead.\u201d</p><p>The dance parted them, and Minerva was left reeling. She tried to convince herself this meant he\u2019d agreed to her plan. He would take her to Scotland, because he chose her. He chose her over Diana. Why else would he offer to dance with her, but to create the impression of some attraction between them? But her thoughts were quickly plowed under by thunderous footfalls and wild fiddling.</p><p>She bumbled her way through another series of steps. Then came a lovely few measures where she didn\u2019t need to do anything but stand still and clap.</p><p>Then it was forward again. To him.</p><p>He pulled her close. Indecently close.</p><p>\u201cSay ouch,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She blinked up at him. What?</p><p>He pinched the tender underside of her arm, hard.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhy would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slid an arm around her waist. Then flexed it, causing her to stumble. Her spectacles went askew.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Miss Highwood?\u201d he said loudly, theatrically. \u201cYou\u2019ve turned your ankle? What a pity.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, he had her stumbling through the Bull and Blossom\u2019s red-painted front door. They made it a few steps away from the entrance. He rushed her so, her slipper caught on a rock and she tripped in earnest.</p><p>He caught her just before her knee hit the turf.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing bruised but my pride.\u201d</p><p>He helped her steady herself. But he didn\u2019t release her. \u201cThat didn\u2019t go as I planned. I didn\u2019t realize your . . . difficulty with dancing. Had I known, I would have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is fine. This is good. The dance, our leaving it. You . . . embracing me in plain view.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His arms felt good indeed, wreathed about her waist. And the complex, fiery warmth in his hazel eyes was swiftly melting her intelligence to slag. One more minute of this, and she\u2019d be a certifiable simpleton.</p><p>She cast a glance at the door. Surely someone would follow them. Or peep out the window, at least. Weren\u2019t they the least bit concerned for her reputation? Or her ankle, if nothing else? Someone needed to see them together, if they were going to make a convincing elopement. Otherwise, this dangerous, confusing embrace would be for nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, unable to help herself. \u201cYou could have Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could. And if I decided marry her, you could not stop me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded so fiercely in her chest, she was sure he must feel it. \u201cBut you chose me tonight. Why?\u201d</p><p>An ironic smile tugged at his mouth. \u201cYou want me to explain it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And do it honestly, not . . .\u201d Not like last night.</p><p>\u201cHonestly.\u201d He mused on the word. \u201cHonestly, your sister is lovely, elegant, demure, kind. It\u2019s easy for a man to look at her and imagine a whole lifetime stretched out before him. Wedding, house, china, children. It\u2019s not an unappealing prospect. But it all looks very settled and fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you look at me? What do you see then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? When I look at you . . .\u201d His thumb stroked her lower back. \u201cI think to myself something like this: God only knows what trials lie down that path.\u201d</p><p>She twisted in his embrace, pushing against his arm. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked for honesty.\u201d He chuckled, but kept her close. \u201cThis . . . this struggle is precisely my point. No, you don\u2019t fit the beautiful, elegant, predictable mold. But take heart, Marissa. Some men like to be surprised.\u201d</p><p>Marissa?</p><p>She stared at him, horrified. And thrilled. And horrified at being thrilled. \u201cYou. Are. The most\u2014\u201d</p><p>A bell jingled. The Bull and Blossom\u2019s door swung open, and a handful of giggling village girls tumbled forth, riding a wave of music and warmth. Minerva\u2019s breath caught. If the girls turned this way, she and Payne would be seen. Together.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Then she pressed her lips to his.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Surprise, she said.</p><p>Surprise indeed.</p><p>Sweetness. That was the first surprise. He\u2019d heard so many tart words from these lips . . . but her kiss was sweet. Cool and sweet, with a hint of true decadence beneath. Like a sun-ripened plum at the height of summer. Ready to fall into his hand at the slightest inducement.</p><p>The falling. That was surprise the second. As she leaned into the kiss, she fell into him. He tightened his arms around her waist, pulling her close.</p><p>Their bodies met.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the right word. Their bodies had \u201cmet\u201d some months ago, that night in the Summerfield gardens. Now their bodies renewed the acquaintance. The sense of intimacy was immediate, startling. The jasmine scent of her hair cocked a trigger, deep inside him. A memory stored not in his mind, but in his blood.</p><p>Which brought him to surprise the third.</p><p>Pleasure. Triumph. Damn, he\u2019d been wanting this. He hadn\u2019t known it. Would have gone to his grave before admitting it. But a part of him had been wanting this. Badly, and for quite some time. He wasn\u2019t learning her through this kiss, so much as confirming long-suspected truths. That for all her unfeminine interests and education, she was pure woman beneath. That she didn\u2019t feel prickly and stubborn in his arms, but warm and pliant, her curves molding to his strength.</p><p>That he could make her melt. Sigh. Tremble.</p><p>That one taste of her wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>He ran his tongue over her closed lips, seeking more. It had been ages since he\u2019d kissed a girl simply for kissing\u2019s sake, and he\u2019d forgotten what a pure, heady pleasure it could be. He wanted to sink into that cool sweetness. Get drunk on it, bathe in it. Utterly lose himself in a fathoms-deep kiss.</p><p>Open. Open for me.</p><p>A little sound escaped her. Something like a squeak. Her lips remained sealed under his.</p><p>He tried again, lightly dragging his tongue toward the corner of her mouth. Slowly, reverently\u2014the way he knew a woman enjoyed being licked, just about anywhere.</p><p>Finally, her lips parted. He swept his tongue between them, tasting her. God, she was so sweet and fresh. But utterly still. Unmoving. Unbreathing. He paused to sip at her plump lower lip before trying again. He pressed a little deeper this time, swirling his tongue before retreating.</p><p>The sweet sigh of her breath whispered against his cheek. It was a confession, that sigh. It told him two things.</p><p>First, she had no earthly idea how to kiss him back.</p><p>But, secondly? She wanted to. She\u2019d been waiting for this, too.</p><p>As they broke apart, a sense of mutual disbelief wavered in the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy\u2014?\u201d Her hands pressed flat against her belly. For a moment, she looked everywhere but at him. Then she lowered her voice and asked, \u201cWhyever would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, chuckling. \u201cYou kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why would you do . . .\u201d Her face twisted. \u201cThe rest of it.\u201d</p> <p>Colin paused. \u201cBecause . . . that\u2019s the way a grown man kisses a woman?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, she couldn\u2019t be that na\u00efve.</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t have had much experience, but surely someone\u2019s explained the natural way of things between the sexes?\u201d He held out his hands in an attitude of illustration and cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s like this, you see. When a man cares for a woman very, very much . . .\u201d</p><p>She buffeted his shoulder with her fist, once. Then barely restrained herself from a second blow. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, and you know it.\u201d She lowered her voice and slid a glance toward the group of girls, who were now disappearing into the rooming house, still absorbed in their own conversation. \u201cWhy would you do that with me? A simple kiss was enough. What could you be thinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat indeed.\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair, more than a little offended at her accusatory tone. \u201cI\u2019m male. You rubbed your . . . femaleness all over me. I didn\u2019t think. I reacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou reacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo . . .\u201d She shifted her weight from one foot to the other. \u201cTo me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a natural response. Aren\u2019t you a scientist? Then you should understand. Any red-blooded man would react to such stimulus.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. She dipped her chin and peered at him over her spectacles. \u201cSo you find me stimulating.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d He bit off the rest of that sentence. The only way to end a nonsensical conversation was to simply cease talking.</p><p>Colin drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders. He closed his eyes briefly. And then he opened them and looked at her. Really looked at her, as though for the first time. He saw thick, dark hair a man could gather by the fistful. Prim spectacles, perched on a gently sloped nose. Behind the lenses, wide-set eyes\u2014dark and intelligent. And that mouth. That ripe, pouting, sensual mouth.</p><p>He let his gaze drift down her form. There was a wicked thrill to knowing lushness smoldered beneath that modest sprigged muslin gown. To having felt her shape, scouting and charting her body with all the nerve endings of his own.</p><p>Their bodies had met. More than that. They\u2019d grown acquainted.</p><p>Nothing more would come from it, of course. Colin had rules for himself, and as for her . . . she didn\u2019t even like him, or pretend to. But she showed up in the middle of the night, hatching schemes that skirted the line between academic logic and reckless adventure. She started kisses she had no notion how to continue.</p><p>Taken all together, she was simply . . .</p><p>A surprise. A fresh, bracing gust of the unexpected, for good or ill.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said cautiously, \u201cI do find you stimulating.\u201d</p> <p>Suspicion narrowed her gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I should take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it how you will.\u201d</p><p>She stared in the direction of the Queen\u2019s Ruby. The group of girls had disappeared. \u201cDrat. I\u2019m not sure anyone even noticed the kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed it.\u201d He rubbed his mouth with the side of his hand. The taste of ripe plums still lingered on his lips. He found himself unaccountably thirsty.</p><p>\u201cSo when do we leave?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave for where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland?\u201d He laughed, surprised. \u201cI\u2019m not taking you to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d She blinked furiously. \u201cBut just now, inside. You said you chose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo dance with. I chose you as my dancing partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Precisely. You chose to dance with me, in front of all those people. To pull me outside and hold me improperly close. To kiss me, in the middle of the lane. Why would you do all that if you didn\u2019t mean to elope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, you kissed me. As for the rest . . . I regretted that scene last night in my quarters. I felt I owed you some apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh no.\u201d She pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me it was a pity dance? A pity kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNot entirely. I just thought you deserved to feel appreciated and admired. In front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now, for a second time in as many nights, you\u2019re revealing that it was all deceit. So I can feel rejected and humiliated. In front of everyone.\u201d Red rimmed her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t be doing this to me again.\u201d</p><p>Oh, for the love of tits. How did this happen to him? He had the best of intentions, and then somehow . . .</p><p>Your good intentions have the impact of mortar shells.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she said, balling her hands in fists. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you out of it this time. I insist that you take me to Scotland. I demand you ruin me. As a point of honor.\u201d</p><p>The bell on the tavern door jingled. They jumped back from each other a pace.</p><p>The party had outgrown the tavern, it seemed. Merrymakers spilled out from the Bull and Blossom, taking to the green.</p><p>Sniffing, Minerva crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said low. \u201cIs there some time and place we can talk? Someplace that\u2019s not my quarters at midnight.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, she straightened her spectacles. \u201cMeet me at the head of the beach path tomorrow morning, just before dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore dawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo early for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m a very early riser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, the next morning. The first rays of dawn glinted off her spectacles. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Marianna.\u201d Colin rubbed his bleary eyes, then his unshaven jaw. \u201cI had to bid my cousin farewell.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid over her frock\u2014a murky, shapeless abomination of gray fabric, buttoned to the hollow of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you wearing? Did you take orders in a convent since we spoke last? Little Sisters of the Drab and Homely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cIt probably would have been the wise course of action. But no. This is my bathing costume.\u201d She raked him with a look. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have one.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to strip partway, I suppose. Come along, then.\u201d</p><p>He followed her down the rocky path to the cove, bemused but undeniably intrigued. \u201cIf I\u2019d known disrobing would be involved, I would have been more punctual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuickly, now. We must hurry, or the fishermen will see us.\u201d</p><p>They reached the beach. The air whipping off the sea had a bracing, sobering effect, clearing some of the cobwebs from his brain. The world began to take on crisper edges.</p><p>He stopped at the water\u2019s edge. The sea lapped at his boots. He took a long moment to inhale deeply, then surveyed the boulder-studded cove in the misty dawn. He\u2019d never appreciated this view before, at this hour of morning.</p><p>It looked timeless. Almost mystical.</p><p>Seawater splashed him in the face.</p><p>\u201cWake up,\u201d she said, removing her spectacles and placing them into a small oilcloth pouch looped over her wrist. She strode past him into the gentle waves. \u201cTime\u2019s wasting.\u201d</p><p>He watched, incredulous, as the stark raving mad girl sank into the water. Knee-deep. Then waist-deep. Then all the way to her neck.</p><p>\u201cCome out of there,\u201d he said, sounding distressingly like a nursemaid, even to his own ears. \u201cThis instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s April. And freezing.\u201d And because I\u2019m suddenly curious to see you wet, without the mud. I didn\u2019t have a chance to appreciate the view the other night.</p><p>Her shoulders lifted in a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, once you grow used to it.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, look at the girl. Teeth chattering, lips turning blue. Beneath that horrid garment, her nipples were probably freezing to little icicles. And she seriously expected him to join her? Him, and all his precious, highly-susceptible-to-extreme-temperatures bits?</p><p>\u201cListen, Madeline. There\u2019s been some misunderstanding. I\u2019m not here for a swim. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need to show you an inlet, around those rocks. There\u2019s no other way to get there but to swim. We\u2019ll talk when we arrive.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not frightened, are you?\u201d</p><p>Frightened. Ha. What was that he heard, splashing into the water? Must have been a gauntlet.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Colin pried off his boots. He laid aside his coat. Then he rolled up his trouser legs, cuffing them at the knees, and likewise turned up his sleeves to the elbow.</p><p>He girded his loins.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Here I come.\u201d He winced, plowing into the frigid depths. When the waterline reached his navel, he swore aloud. \u201cThis is true valor, I hope you know. Legends have sprung from less. All Lancelot did was paddle about in a balmy lake.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLancelot was a knight. You\u2019re a viscount. The bar is higher.\u201d</p><p>He gave a raspy chuckle, breathless from the cold. \u201cWhy is it,\u201d he asked, nearing her, \u201cthat you only display that delightfully wicked sense of humor when you\u2019re chilled and wet through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her eyelashes fluttered so fast and so hard, she might have been trying to take flight with them. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Even though she was submerged in icy water, she blushed crimson. All her invisible barriers went back up, instantly. So odd. Most women of his acquaintance relied on physical beauty and charm to mask their less-pleasant traits. This girl did the opposite, hiding everything interesting about herself behind a prim, plain fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>What other surprises was she concealing?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep moving,\u201d she said. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Swimming in easy, unhurried strokes, she led him around an archipelago of boulders, into a small inlet bounded by steep cliffs.</p><p>Colin craned his neck, looking up at the rocky bluffs. And he knew, right then, that so long as he lived, he would never understand what made a man\u2014or woman\u2014look at a stone wall and think, I believe I\u2019d enjoy attending a symposium on these.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are we looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot up there,\u201d she said. \u201cDown here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown where?\u201d He looked around him. He saw nothing but water.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cave. The entrance is hidden at high tide. I\u2019ll show you. Hold my arm.\u201d</p><p>She extended her arm, and he clasped it above the elbow. She clasped his arm in similar fashion.</p><p>She said, \u201cNow take a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What are we\u2014\u201d</p><p>He never took that deep breath she\u2019d suggested. Down she went, before he had any chance. Colin found himself being dragged by his arm, completely submerged beneath the water\u2019s surface. She propelled them forward, kicking her feet like little fins.</p><p>They\u2019d entered some sort of tunnel, it seemed.</p><p>He felt rock scrape against his back. He kicked, and bashed rock with his foot. He reached up, where the water\u2019s surface ought to be.</p><p>Rock there, too. He was trapped.</p><p>He opened his eyes underwater. All was dark. Nothing to see. Murky as pitch. Walled in by stone. No air. No air, only water.</p><p>He tried to swim back. She pulled him forward. Then they stopped altogether, trapped in that narrow passage of rock. His lungs burned. His limbs tingled. His ears filled with the roar of water and the frantic pounding of his heart, trapped and thrashing against his ribs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could die here.</p><p>Perversely, his greatest fear was that he wouldn\u2019t. That his lungs would somehow learn to do without air, and he would simply remain down here\u2014trapped in an endless, dark, watery silence. Reliving that hellish night forever.</p><p>This is death. I am alone.</p> <p>But he wasn\u2019t alone. Her grip locked around his arm, like a manacle. Her other hand closed around his wrist, and she gave a hard pull. He shot through the remainder of the rock tunnel and surfaced, gasping, on the other side.</p><p>More darkness greeted him. There was air to breathe, but he had to work for it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he finally managed, pushing water off his face. \u201cJesus Christ and John the Baptist. For that matter, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.\u201d Still not enough. He needed to reach back to the Old Testament for this. \u201cObadiah. Nebuchadnezzar. Methuselah and Job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe calm,\u201d she said, taking him by the shoulders. \u201cBe calm. And there are women in the Bible, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. As I recall it, they were trouble, every last one. What is this place? I can\u2019t see a bloody thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s light. Give it a moment, and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. Light shone through a few lacy openings in the rock overhead. Meager white pinpricks against a blanket of jet.</p><p>She grasped his chin and swiveled his face away from the light, down to meet hers. \u201cDon\u2019t look directly at it, or your eyes will never adjust. Just focus on me and take slow breaths. That\u2019s it. In . . . and out.\u201d</p><p>She spoke in a calm, soothing voice. Likely the same tone she employed to soothe her sister through a breathing crisis. Colin\u2019s pride bristled. He didn\u2019t need coddling. But he quite enjoyed the smoky, entrancing quality of her voice and her tender touch against his cheek. His pounding heart began to slow.</p><p>Eventually the white specks overhead diffused to a faint, milky glow that illuminated her features. Soft, dark calf eyes with inky lashes. Rounded cheeks and pale skin. Those lips, wet with seawater.</p> <p>\u201cYou see me now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nodded. And it was surely that brush with death coloring his perception, or perhaps the dim light\u2014but he found her lovely.</p><p>\u201cI see you.\u201d Sliding his arms around her waist, he pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did you lose your bearings underwater?\u201d She pushed a damp strand of hair from his brow. \u201cShould I be worried about you?\u201d</p><p>What a question, asked in such a sweet, husky voice. Something made him delay answering.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He dropped a firm kiss on her brow. \u201cNo, pet. Don\u2019t spare a moment\u2019s concern for me.\u201d</p><p>He released her then, and she drifted away.</p><p>\u201cThis way, then.\u201d She led him to a shelf of rock, and he gave her a boost as she struggled onto it. It felt good to retake the strong, manly role. It also felt good to cup her thigh.</p> <p>Once they\u2019d both pulled themselves onto the ledge, she felt her way along the cave\u2019s wall and reached into a high niche to withdraw some sort of box. From it, she took a candle and tinderbox. The flare of warm, waxy light revealed the cave, letting him know that it was just as small and suffocating as he\u2019d suspected. But that candle\u2019s glow also created a small, intimate space within its golden circumference. Colin thought he would be content to stay within its borders for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Shadows played over her face as she retrieved and put on her spectacles. She held the candle up to the rocky wall at his back.</p><p>\u201cSo what is this place?</p><p>\u201cA cave of wonders. Look. The entire exposed surface is a compressed layer of fossilized marine life.\u201d She skipped her fingertips over the rugged surface. \u201cI\u2019ve spent hours making casts and rubbings and drawing sketches. Chipping away specimens where I can. Here\u2019s an echinoid, see? Next to it, a trilobite. And just a few inches over, this is a fossilized sea sponge. Look.\u201d</p><p>Colin looked. He saw rocks, bumps, and bumpy rocks. \u201cFascinating. So this is the topic of your paper for the symposium? Echy-things and troglodytes. Hard to see how they\u2019d be worth five hundred guineas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not, not on their own. But this is truly priceless.\u201d</p><p>She crawled sideways back into the cave, some half-dozen feet. Because she seemed to expect it, he followed. The farther back they went, the more the cave shrank around him, constricting his lungs. Even though he was dripping with seawater, a fine sheen of sweat pressed to his brow.</p><p>\u201cSee here?\u201d she asked, lifting the candle. \u201cThis depression in the stone?\u201d</p><p>He focused on it, glad for any distraction. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a footprint,\u201d she said, in a hushed, reverent tone. \u201cUntold ages ago, some creature walked in the mud here. And the print was preserved, compressed into stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And this excites you because . . . footprints are rare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFossilized footprints are rare. And no one\u2019s ever recorded a footprint like this one before. There are three toes spread wide, see?\u201d</p><p>Colin did see. His entire boot could have fit in any one of the individual \u201ctoe\u201d impressions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a lizard\u2019s foot,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWith a footprint that size, that deep? That would have to be one bloody large lizard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Even in the dark, her eyes gleamed with excitement. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? Mr. James Parkinson has published three volumes of fossil plates, from vegetables to vertebrates. He\u2019s documented dozens of larger animals, including an ancient alligator and a primeval elephant. But this footprint doesn\u2019t meet any description found in his volumes. This is evidence of an entirely new creature, unknown to modern science until now. A giant prehistoric lizard.\u201d</p><p>Colin blinked. \u201cWell. That is most . . . remarkable.\u201d</p><p>A giant prehistoric lizard. This was the great scientific discovery that was guaranteed to win five hundred guineas. She wanted to travel all the way to Edinburgh to argue the existence of dragons. No scientists in their right minds would award a prize for that.</p><p>\u201cThis footprint,\u201d she said excitedly, \u201cchanges everything. Everything.\u201d</p><p>He could only stare at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot . . . really.\u201d</p><p>Unable to take the closeness any longer, he made his way back to the larger mouth of the cavern. He sat near the shelf\u2019s edge. Black water lapped at his fingertips.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cIs there some other way out of here?\u201d</p><p>Dropping to sit across from him, she exhaled. \u201cI should have known this wouldn\u2019t work. You\u2019re right, the whole elopement business was a stupid idea. I thought maybe if you had a chance to see it, you\u2019d understand the implications. And you\u2019d see how certain you are to take home five hundred guineas. But apparently, you\u2019re incapable of grasping the scientific significance.\u201d</p><p>He made a conscious decision to let the insult slide. \u201cApparently I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention, I expected you\u2019d contribute something to the journey other than snide commentary. But I see I was wrong on that score, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?</p><p>\u201cYou know. Brawn, if not brains. Protection. Strength. But after that situation with the tunnel . . . I can\u2019t be dragging you kicking and flailing all the way to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a moment,\u201d he interrupted. He cleared his throat and lowered his voice a half octave. \u201cI have strength of all sorts in abundance. I box. I fence. I ride. I shoot. I am the first lieutenant of a small yet plucky militia. I\u2019m certain I could bodily lift this giant lizard of yours and toss him off the nearest balcony. I just don\u2019t have any patience for underwater tunnels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr caves.\u201d To his offended silence, she replied, \u201cDon\u2019t deny it. I can tell how hard you\u2019re breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake. You\u2019re fogging my spectacles from here. Do you have a fear of small spaces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fear of them,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her silence communicated skepticism.</p><p>He muttered, \u201cA dislike. I dislike small, dark spaces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have mentioned this before we entered a cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t give me much opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go back out the way we came?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d In this larger chamber, with the benefit of candles, the cave wasn\u2019t so bad. But he was not swimming through that tomb of a tunnel again. \u201cYou say the entrance is above water at low tide? Then I\u2019ll wait for low tide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be hours. People will wonder what\u2019s become of us.\u201d</p><p>He marveled at the \u201cus\u201d in that sentence\u2014that it hadn\u2019t even occurred to her she might swim back and leave him there alone. He\u2019d noticed this about her, over the months. She couldn\u2019t even contemplate the idea of disloyalty. Which was why she so disdained him, he supposed.</p><p>She pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cOh dear. We\u2019ll have to go to Scotland now. If anyone notices we\u2019ve disappeared together this morning . . . if anyone saw us kiss last night . . . if your lover decides to gossip . . .\u201d She lowered her hand. \u201cSeparately, those things might go unobserved, but all three of them? In all likelihood, I\u2019m already ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an extreme conclusion,\u201d he said, ignoring that each separate event looked rather damning. \u201cLet\u2019s take this one crisis at a time. How many candles do you have?</p><p>\u201cThis, and one other.\u201d</p><p>Colin did a swift mental estimate. Three, four hours of light, perhaps. More than enough. A violent shiver wracked his body. \u201cAre you chilled?\u201d He could think of worse ways to pass a few hours than huddling with a woman for warmth.</p><p>She reached into a rocky niche. \u201cI keep a blanket here.\u201d Crouching beside him, she shook it out and draped it over them both. She kept a buffer of several inches between their bodies.</p><p>The warmth seeped through his wet clothing. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you keep any whiskey here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. But still\u2014candles, blanket. You must spend a great deal of time in this . . . place,\u201d he said, after fumbling several moments for a more diplomatic word than \u201chellhole.\u201d</p><p>He felt her shoulders lift in a shrug. \u201cGeology is my life\u2019s work. Some scientists have a laboratory. I have a cave.\u201d</p><p>A dozen mocking rejoinders jostled for prominence in Colin\u2019s mind, but he sensed that teasing her on this point would leave him too vulnerable. She was a scientist. She had a cave. And he was an aimless aristocrat who had . . . nothing.</p><p>She said, \u201cI had it all sorted out. There\u2019s a stagecoach that runs between Eastbourne and Rye. It passes by on Tuesdays and Fridays, just around six. If we walked to the main road, we could flag the coach down. Take it to the next town, and from there go north. We\u2019d reach London tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Ah, to be in London tomorrow night. Bustle. Commerce. Society. Clubs. Glittering balls and gilded opera houses. Skies choked with coal dust. Lamps shining in the darkened streets.</p><p>\u201cFrom there,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019d catch the mail coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. I told you the other night, a viscount doesn\u2019t travel on the mail coach. And this particular viscount doesn\u2019t travel in any coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold a moment.\u201d The candle bobbed. \u201cHow did you think we\u2019d be traveling to Edinburgh, if not by public coach?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re not traveling to Edinburgh at all. But if we were, we\u2019d have find some other conveyance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as what? A magic carpet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as a private post-chaise, with hired postilions. You\u2019d ride in, and I\u2019d ride out on horseback.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat would cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhen it comes to travel, I have conditions. I don\u2019t ride in coaches, and I don\u2019t travel by night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo night travel either? But the fastest coaches all travel by night. The journey would take us twice as long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re not going, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She lifted the candle and peered into his face. \u201cYou\u2019re just making excuses. You want out of our agreement\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat agreement? There was never any agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014so you\u2019re plucking these ridiculous \u2018conditions\u2019 out of the air.\u201d She ticked items off on one hand. \u201cNo closed carriages. No travel by night. What kind of grown man has such rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne who narrowly survived a carriage accident,\u201d he said testily. \u201cAt night. That\u2019s what kind.\u201d</p> <p>Her face softened. So did her voice. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Colin drummed his fingers on the stone. He\u2019d forgotten that she wouldn\u2019t know this. In London, everyone knew. The story passed around ballrooms and gaming hells every season. Skipped from matron to debutante, gambler to opera singer\u2014always in mournful whispers. Have you heard about poor Lord Payne. . . .</p><p>\u201cWas this recent?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Sighing roughly, he rested his head against the uneven, clammy stone. \u201cI was a boy, traveling with my parents. An axle snapped, and the coach overturned. I survived the accident largely unharmed. But my mother and father weren\u2019t so fortunate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died. There, in the carriage, right in front of me. My father went almost instantly. My mother, slowly and in tremendous agony.\u201d He paused. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out, you see. The way the carriage had landed on its side, the door was barred shut. I couldn\u2019t run for help, couldn\u2019t escape. I lay trapped there, all night long. Alone. A passing farmer found me the next morning.\u201d</p><p>There. That would teach her to press him for honesty.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She gripped his arm. \u201cOh God. I\u2019m so sorry. I can see why you\u2019d be afra\u2014 er, why you would dislike dark, enclosed spaces. How dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Exceedingly.\u201d He rubbed his temple. \u201cSuffice it to say, I\u2019ve no desire to relive such a situation. So I have a few simple rules. I don\u2019t travel at night. I don\u2019t ride in enclosed carriages. Oh, and I don\u2019t sleep alone.\u201d A grimace tugged his mouth sideways. \u201cThat last is less of a rule and more a statement of fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Colin hesitated briefly. He\u2019d revealed this much. There seemed no point in denying the rest. \u201cI simply don\u2019t sleep alone. If I don\u2019t have a bed companion, I lie awake all night.\u201d</p><p>He nudged toward the soft heat of her body and gathered the blanket close around them. \u201cSo you may want to rethink your plans, pet. If we did undertake this journey . . . I\u2019d need you in my bed.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Somewhere in the back of the cave, a drip counted out Minerva\u2019s stunned silence.</p><p>One, two, three . . .</p><p>. . . ten, eleven, twelve . . .</p><p>He needed her? In his bed? It was too much to be believed. She reminded herself it wasn\u2019t her he needed. Apparently, any woman would do.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that this accident . . . this tragic night in your youth . . . is the reason for your libertine ways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This is my curse.\u201d He gave a deep, resonant sigh. A sigh clearly meant to pluck at her heartstrings.</p><p>And it worked. It really worked.</p><p>\u201cSweet heaven.\u201d She swallowed back a lump in her throat. \u201cYou must do this all the time. Night after night, you tell women your tale of woe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. The tale of woe precedes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c . . . and then they just open their arms and lift their skirts for you. \u2018Come, you poor, sweet man, let me hold you\u2019 and so forth. Don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He hedged. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>Minerva knew they did. They must. She felt it happening to her. As he\u2019d related his story, a veritable fount of emotion had welled in her chest. Sadness, sympathy. Her womb somehow became involved, sending nurturing impulses coursing through her veins. Everything feminine in her responded to the call.</p><p>Then came the lies. Her heart told her lies. Wicked, insidious falsehoods, resounding with every beat.</p><p>He\u2019s a broken man.</p><p>He needs you.</p><p>You can heal him.</p><p>Rationally, she knew better. Untold numbers of women had already tried their hands\u2014among other body parts\u2014at \u201chealing his broken soul,\u201d with no success.</p><p>And yet . . . although her mind knew it to be foolishness, her body ached with the desire to hold him. Soothe him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d she breathed, mostly to herself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re working this spell on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not working any spell. I\u2019m giving you the facts. Aren\u2019t you fond of those? If you\u2019re harboring any thought of compelling me to make this journey, you should know my conditions. I don\u2019t ride in coaches, which means I\u2019d be on horseback all day. I can\u2019t ride on horseback all day unless I\u2019m sleeping well at night. And I don\u2019t sleep alone. Ergo, you\u2019d have to share my bed. Unless you\u2019d prefer me to search out random serving girls at each coaching inn.\u201d</p><p>A wave of nausea rocked her. \u201cUgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t relish the thought either. Bedding my way along the Great North Road might have sounded like a grand time five years ago. Not so much, anymore.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s more the rest I\u2019m after. I don\u2019t even bed half the women I sleep with. If that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that makes sense? Nothing about this makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand it. God knows, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She sat next to him, reclining against the wall. Beneath the blanket, their arms touched. Even through that slight contact, she could sense the restlessness in his body. He was struggling to conceal his unease, but after years of vigilance with an asthmatic sister, Minerva was acutely attuned to small signs of distress. She couldn\u2019t ignore the raspy quality of his breathing, nor the way his muscles hummed with a desperate wish to be quit of the place.</p><p>And when presented with a complexity, she wasn\u2019t the sort to give up on understanding it. She was a scientist, after all.</p><p>\u201cIs it just the cave?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is it like this every night?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYou say it\u2019s persisted since childhood. Is it getting better or worse with time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. All right.\u201d</p><p>How sad, that he suffered so. How pathetic, that he turned to an endless chain of women to ameliorate his suffering. The idea made her nauseous. Irrationally envious. And just a little flushed, beneath her bathing costume.</p><p>A question burned inside her. She couldn\u2019t help but ask. \u201cWho was she, the other night? It wouldn\u2019t matter, except . . .\u201d Except whoever she was, she has the power to make my life utter misery.</p><p>After a moment, he reluctantly answered. \u201cGinny Watson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Minerva knew the cheery young widow. She took in washing from the rooming-house residents. Apparently, she took in washing\u2014and other things\u2014from the castle residents, too. But she didn\u2019t seem the sort to spread tales.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s the worst part.\u201d She moved away from the wall and turned to face him. The wet fabric of her bathing costume scraped over the rough stone. \u201cInsomnia isn\u2019t an uncommon condition, you know. Surely there must be some solution. If you can\u2019t sleep at night, why don\u2019t you light some lamps? Read some books. Warm some milk. See a doctor for a sleeping powder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t new ideas. I\u2019ve tried them all, and then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing works?\u201d</p><p>Those drips counted the silence again. One, two, three . . .</p><p>He trailed a light touch up her arm. Then\u2014slowly\u2014he leaned forward.</p><p>And whispered in her ear, \u201cOne thing works.\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed her cheek.</p><p>Minerva stiffened. Her every nerve ending jumped to attention. She didn\u2019t know whether to be appalled or thrilled that he would make her another link in his amatory chain.</p><p>Appalled, she told herself. She ought to be appalled.</p><p>\u201cYou are shameless,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather a shock to me, too.\u201d His lips grazed her jaw. \u201cBut you are a most surprising girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being opportunistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t deny it. Why don\u2019t you seize the opportunity, as well? I want to kiss you. And you need kissing, desperately.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand to his shoulder and pushed him away. The cave filled with her affronted silence. \u201cWhy would you suggest such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause last night you wanted to kiss me back. But you didn\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>Her heart jumped into her throat. So mortifying. How could he tell?</p><p>Wordlessly, he removed the spectacles from her face, folded them, and set them aside.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cSo you keep saying.\u201d He inched closer, eliminating the distance between them. \u201cBut you know, Matilda, what you haven\u2019t said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said no.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her in the dark, skimming a touch over her cheek, sliding down to cup her chin. With his hand anchored there, he stroked his thumb in ever-widening circles, until he grazed her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYou have a mouth made for kissing,\u201d he murmured, angling her to face him. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSo soft and generous.\u201d Leaning in, he tipped her chin with the heel of his hand. \u201cSweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo man\u2019s ever called me sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas any other man kissed you?\u201d</p><p>Again, she gave a little shake of the head.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. That\u2019s why.\u201d He brushed his lips over hers, just lightly, sending pure sensation fizzing through her veins. He hummed with satisfaction. \u201cYou taste of ripe plums.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She laughed. \u201cNow that\u2019s just absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s too early in the year for ripe plums.\u201d</p><p>His husky chuckle shook them both. \u201cYou\u2019re entirely too logical for your own good. A thorough kissing can mend that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want mending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not. But I think you do want kissing.\u201d He nuzzled the curve of her cheek, and his voice dropped to a sensual whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She did. Oh, she did.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny it. Not when he touched her like this. She wanted to be kissed, and to kiss him in return. She wanted to touch him, stroke him, hold him tight. All those tender, nurturing impulses still pulsed within her, despite all her efforts to reason them away. Her heart kept pumping those lies through her body.</p><p>He needs you.</p><p>You can heal him.</p><p>She had feminine warmth in abundance, and he needed comfort right now. In return, she could glimpse what it felt like to be needed. To be kissed. To be called sweet, and compared to a ripened plum.</p><p>To be desired by a desirable man.</p><p>\u201cJust this once?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cJust this once.\u201d</p><p>So long as they both knew it was all mere diversion . . . a harmless way to pass the time . . . It couldn\u2019t hurt to pretend, could it? Not in secret, in the dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Here, there was no one to laugh.</p><p>Her breath caught as he pressed a chaste kiss to her forehead. Then her cheek. Then her jaw.</p><p>Then her lips.</p> <p>He pressed the tip of his tongue to that vulnerable hinge at the corner of her mouth, coaxing her lips to part. She gasped a little, and he took advantage of the moment, sweeping his tongue inside her mouth.</p><p>She froze instantly, pressing her hand flush against his chest. Then she pushed him away. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d She made a fist, clutching his wet shirtfront. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you do that. I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m supposed to do in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d He stroked her hair, dragging his fingers through the heavy, damp strands to untangle them. \u201cKissing\u2019s like any skill. It takes a bit of practice. Think of it . . . think of it like dancing.\u201d He paused to kiss her neck, her earlobe. \u201cJust surrender to the rhythm of it. Follow my lead.\u201d</p><p>They tried again. This time, he sucked her upper lip between his and worried it a little. Then he repeated the attentions with her lower lip.</p><p>And then he swept his tongue between the two.</p> <p>His tongue rubbed over hers. She cautiously stroked back with her own, earning a little growl of approval. A thrill chased over her skin. Heat built between their bodies, melting away some of her anxiety.</p><p>He tilted his head, exploring her mouth from a new angle.</p><p>She understood now why he\u2019d compared kissing to dancing. He had moves. A great many of them. Not just thrusting his tongue in and out, but swirling and toying and subtle coaxing. And just as she always did on a dance floor, Minerva quickly grew faint, dizzy. She felt overwhelmed and out of her depth. Always a step behind.</p><p>Once again, she broke away.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t work,\u201d she said, wilting inside. \u201cI\u2019m hopeless at dancing. It simply won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t say that.\u201d His labored breaths raced hers. \u201cIt was a bad example on my part. Don\u2019t think of it like dancing. Kissing\u2019s nothing like dancing. Think of it as you would . . .\u201d He flicked a glance to the fossil-studded cave wall. \u201cAn excavation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn excavation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A proper kiss is like an excavation. When you\u2019re digging up your little troglodytes, you don\u2019t just go plunging your shovel into the soil higgledy-piggledy, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her wariness stretched the word.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. A proper excavation takes time and care. And very close attention to detail. Slowly sifting through the layers. Unearthing surprises as you go.\u201d</p><p>That sounded much more promising. After a long moment\u2019s reflection, she asked, \u201cSo who is excavating whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdeally, it\u2019s a bit of both. We sort of . . . take turns.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a long moment. Something about the air around them changed. Heated.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cMay I go first?\u201d</p> <p>Colin struggled to suppress his triumphant grin. It would have ruined everything. He made his voice solemn. \u201cBut of course.\u201d</p><p>She rose up to sit on her knees, positioning herself to face him. The dim glow allowed him to see her in silhouette. Just an enticing hourglass of shadow with a halo of curling hair. He wanted to reach for her, pull her close again. Give his pulse some better reason to pound. Ease his soul with the warm, human contact he craved. At times like these, patience came at a premium.</p><p>But its reward was great. Her hand reached out to him, swimming through the dark to caress his face.</p><p>God, she was such a surprise.</p><p>Her curiosity marked her apart from other girls. She didn\u2019t concentrate on the features one would suppose\u2014eyebrows, cheekbones, lips, the line of his nose. All the features that comprised \u201ca face\u201d in a schoolgirl\u2019s sketch. No, her touch was thorough, indiscriminate, searching out every detail. The flat of her palm scraped over his unshaven jaw. She smoothed a narrow furrow between his brows and stroked a light caress under his eyes, where the sleepless nights weighed heavy. He found himself nuzzling into the touch. He exhaled until his lungs were empty.</p><p>She brushed the fringe of his eyelashes with one fingertip, and a delicate cascade of pleasure rippled through him. What a revelation that was. He\u2019d have to add eyelash caresses to his own repertoire.</p><p>When her fingers pushed into his hair, he moaned. Women always loved his wavy hair, and he always loved the attention they paid it. Pleasant sensations raced over his scalp as she sifted through the wet locks, teasing them back from his forehead. Her fingertip found his scar and traced it\u2014the thin, pale ridge that began at his temple and curved back over his ear. His only physical souvenir of the carriage accident, it was undetectable to the casual observer.</p><p>But she found it, easily. Because finding buried things was what she did best, he supposed. A proper excavation left no secret hidden.</p><p>He began to wonder about the wisdom of this exercise.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be kissing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to it.\u201d Her voice betrayed a hint of nerves. She moved closer, drawing her knees between his splayed thighs. Leaning forward, she brushed her lips over his.</p><p>The blissful shock of it rattled his very bones. But as she receded, he kept his tone glib. \u201cYou can do better.\u201d</p><p>She took the challenge and kissed him again, more firmly this time. Her tongue flicked out, nimble and curious. And all too fleeting. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Almost too good.</p><p>\u201cHmm. You taste of spirits here.\u201d Her tongue traced the edge of his lip. \u201cBut here\u201d\u2014she dipped her head to nuzzle the underside of his jaw\u2014\u201cyou smell of spice. Cloves.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. Colin\u2019s eyes went wide in the dark as she sipped at his skin, over and over, tracing the curve of his throat. When she reached the center, she brushed her lips over his Adam\u2019s apple. His breath was a painful rasp in his throat. He couldn\u2019t take much more of this.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t properly kissed me,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are.\u201d I think I might be, too, just a little.</p><p>And for good reason. Her mouth found his, and her parted lips pressed against his own. And there they stayed. Soft, sweet. Warming in the heat of their mingled breath. All the while, a snarling, feral need clawed him from the inside out, fighting its leash of gentlemanly restraint. He\u2019d lose the battle if she didn\u2019t move soon.</p><p>This was more than an excavation. She was turning him inside out. Exposing the base, desperate needs studded in the deepest layer of his being. Until he felt not merely naked before her, but stripped bare. Cold and shivering and defenseless in the dark.</p><p>Kiss me, he willed, underscoring the message with a flex of his knee against her thigh. Kiss me now, or suffer the consequences.</p><p>At last. Her fingers twisted in his hair, drawing him close. Her teeth skimmed the ridge of his lower lip. And then she slid her tongue into his mouth. Just a shallow, teasing pass the first time. Then a bit deeper, on the second attempt. Then deeper still, again and again, by slow, tantalizing degrees.</p><p>She sighed into the kiss, just a little. The faint sound blazed through him, kindling his every nerve ending like a fuse.</p><p>Her fingers left his hair, and he worried for a moment that this all might stop.</p><p>Don\u2019t stop. God, don\u2019t stop.</p><p>But then she braced her hands on the cave wall, bracketing his shoulders, and pressed him against the rocky surface. With her breasts. So soft and round against his chest, tipped with the deliciously hard darts of her chilled nipples. She pinned him to the wall, using the leverage to make the kiss deeper, stroking deep with her tongue.</p><p>And just like that, his control was gone.</p><p>He reached for her, gripping her by the thighs. Holding her close and tight as she plundered his mouth with bold, innocent abandon. With her kiss, his whole body came alive. Not just his body. Something stirred in the region of his heart, as well.</p><p>Jesus. Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. Delilah, Jezebel, Salome, Judith, Eve. Trouble, every last one. Add Minerva Highwood to the list.</p><p>A woman like this could ruin him. If he didn\u2019t ruin her first.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d Her breath came hot against his ear. \u201cWhen . . . when we\u2019re doing this, what do I call you?\u201d</p><p>He fisted his hands in the fabric at the small of her back. \u201cYou must call me by my Christian name. Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she whispered, tentative at first. Then with feeling, as she pressed an openmouthed kiss to his temple. \u201cOh, Colin.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. He could hear her moan his name a hundred times, and it wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>As they kissed, he rubbed his hands up and down her back. Keeping her close. Warming them both. But after several passes traveling the length of her spine, he couldn\u2019t help but venture further. She still owed him his chance to explore.</p><p>He had to get to her. He had to get to the soft, secret part of her, the way she was getting to him.</p><p>He slid a palm down her hip, cupping her backside and giving it a brief squeeze. Then he brushed the same hand up her side, slowly dragging his touch over the curve of her hip, the indentation of her waist, the endless ridges of her ribs . . . he could have sworn he counted thirty-four or so . . . and then, at last, the soft, round swell of her breast.</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d Her gasp told him he\u2019d gone too far.</p><p>\u201cMin, I . . .\u201d He rested his brow against hers. He didn\u2019t know how to apologize. He wasn\u2019t sorry for any of it. Not in the least.</p><p>She pulled away, blinking at him. \u201cColin. I can see you.\u201d</p><p>The way she spoke the words, in such an awestruck tone, made him wonder for a moment if their kiss had actually cured her weak eyes. That would have been quite a miracle, but he\u2019d be inclined to believe it. He felt rather changed by that kiss, himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s light in here,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see you now.\u201d She moved away, reaching for her spectacles.</p><p>And he instantly understood what she meant. Without her silhouette blocking his view, he too could see that the tide had receded. Enough so the apex of the underwater entrance was revealed. A beam of sunlight shot through, like gold floss threading the eye of a needle\u2014stabbing Colin straight in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He lifted his hand, shielding his eyes from the piercing dawn.</p><p>Now that he had a proper look at his surroundings, he could judge that the black, \u201cendless\u201d underwater tunnel he\u2019d been so certain he\u2019d die inside was actually . . . no more than three feet long.</p><p>Good God. He rolled his eyes at his own ridiculousness. No wonder she\u2019d doubted his mettle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to leave soon,\u201d she said, already up and bustling about. She pursed her lips and blew out the candle. \u201cIt\u2019s better that we waited, anyhow. Now I don\u2019t have to trust the oilcloth to keep my notes and papers dry.\u201d</p><p>As Colin watched her go about her preparations, he reeled with the strangest emotion. Disappointment. A forceful pang of it.</p><p>That made no sense. Light had made its way into the cave. The space was no longer dark. He was going to leave this cramped, miserable hole in the earth in a just a few minutes\u2019 time. And he was disappointed. Disappointed that he couldn\u2019t stay here and kiss her a few hours longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d She folded the blanket with efficient snaps. \u201cAnd I may be joining you, after what we just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself. We were merely kissing.\u201d Though he knew there was nothing \u201cmere\u201d about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, it can\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Colin pressed a hand to his solar plexus. There it went. That sharp pang of disappointment. This cave was just full of surprises.</p><p>She stared at the footprint and her notes. Then she looked up at him, deftly winding her hair into a knot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave tomorrow,\u201d she said, speaking around a mouthful of hairpins. \u201cWe must, if we\u2019re to have any hope of reaching Edinburgh in time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cPet, I thought I\u2019d made myself understood. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree to your conditions. All of them. You can ride out. We won\u2019t travel at night. And the part about the bed . . . ?\u201d A faint wash of pink touched her cheeks. \u201cThat too. But we\u2019ll need to leave tomorrow, if we\u2019re going to make the symposium.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. The part about the bed . . . ? He really wished she hadn\u2019t said that.</p> <p>Colin had rules for himself where women were concerned. So far he\u2019d always followed them, and his remaining self-respect dangled on that slim cord. But this was different. She was different, in ways he couldn\u2019t yet define. He usually didn\u2019t find innocence so alluring, but in her case it was sweetened by bold, unabashed curiosity. Given the opportunity, he wasn\u2019t sure he could resist. And weeks of travel would present many, many opportunities.</p><p>Right this moment, he was entertaining a quite vivid fantasy of unwinding that knot in her hair, stripping that drab linen from her body, peeling away any layers of modesty beneath . . . and leaving those spectacles on. So she\u2019d see him. So she\u2019d know just who was making her twist and pant and moan with pleasure. So she\u2019d watch each and every wince of pleasure on his face as he pushed into\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come for me at the rooming house,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much chance of being intercepted. I\u2019ll walk out and meet you by the road.\u201d</p><p>Colin massaged his jaw, releasing a faint groan. He was a libertine with prodigious experience. She was a na\u00efve bluestocking still tasting her first kiss. This was an exceedingly bad idea. No matter how much he wanted to leave Spindle Cove, no matter how much she claimed to want this journey . . .</p><p>It could not happen. Because now he wanted her.</p> <p>\u201cColin?\u201d</p><p>He shook himself. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze. The vulnerability shining in her eyes plucked at his conscience.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be there, won\u2019t you? You won\u2019t play me another cruel trick and leave me the laughingstock, standing all by myself while the coach passes by?\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cShould I be worried about you?\u201d</p><p>Yes, pet. That\u2019s just it. You should be worried indeed.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>Minerva stared off in the direction of the castle. Then she checked her timepiece for the fourth time in as many seconds. Two . . . no, three minutes past six.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>She should never have dreamed otherwise. She ought to have known he\u2019d let her down.</p><p>The ground shivered beneath her. A rumble of hoofbeats reached her ears. Here it came, the coach. And it would pass her by. Leave her standing on the side of the road\u2014an awkward fool of a girl, all dressed up with nowhere to go.</p><p>Hopeless.</p><p>She stared down the road, just waiting for the black shadow of the coach to crest the distant hill. So strange. The hoofbeats grew louder and louder, but no carriage appeared. By this point, she could actually feel the earth\u2019s low rumble in her shinbones. Still no coach. She whirled, feeling confused and frantic.</p><p>And there he was. Lord Payne.</p> <p>Colin.</p><p>Charging toward her on horseback, dashing through the early-morning mist. The wind rippling through his wavy hair. The sight was just like something from a fairy tale. Oh, he wasn\u2019t riding a white stallion, but rather a serviceable, sturdy bay gelding. And he was dressed not in shining armor or regal attire, but in a simple, well-tailored blue topcoat and buckskin riding breeches.</p><p>No matter. He still took her breath away. As he slid from his horse, he was magnificent. Resplendent. Without a doubt, the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>And then he spoke.</p><p>\u201cThis is a mistake.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cA mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I should have said as much yesterday, but better late than never. This journey would be a mistake, of catastrophic proportions. It can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Looking around, she realized he had nothing with him. No valises. No bags of any kind. Her heart sank. \u201cYesterday, in the cave. Colin, you promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d be here at six. I didn\u2019t promise I\u2019d leave with you.\u201d</p><p>Minerva reeled in her half boots. Deflated and numb, she dropped to sit on the edge of her largest trunk.</p><p>He surveyed her baggage. \u201cGood God. How did you bring three trunks all the way up here by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made three trips,\u201d she said weakly. Three cold, hard slogs through the mist. For nothing.</p><p>\u201cThree trunks,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat could possibly be in them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care? You\u2019ve just said you won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>He crouched in front of her, sinking to her eye level. \u201cListen, Michaela. This is for your own good. Did anyone notice we\u2019d gone missing yesterday? Did anyone see us kiss the other night?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>No one seemed to suspect a thing. Which ought to have made her feel better, but was somehow the most humiliating part yet.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re safe, so far. And there\u2019s too much at risk for you in this undertaking. Not just your reputation, but your safety. Your happiness. And it all might come to naught.\u201d He tipped her chin.</p><p>She stared into his eyes. They were red-rimmed and weary. Little lines creased the space between his eyebrows. He hadn\u2019t shaved. From a distance, he\u2019d appeared handsome and dashing, but up close . . . \u201cGoodness. You look horrible.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face. \u201cYes, well. I had a hard night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I did try to sleep. That\u2019s the problem. I ought to know by now, that never ends well.\u201d</p><p>Here it came again, that wave of sympathy rolling through her chest. She wanted to touch his hair, but settled for plucking a little burr from his coat sleeve.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason you should want to come with me.\u201d She tried to make it sound like the only obvious and logical solution, though she knew it really wasn\u2019t. \u201cBefore the fortnight\u2019s out, you could have enough money to return to London and live as you please.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this kindly, so I\u2019ll just put it bluntly. Forget about me. Never mind your sister. To the devil with the five hundred guineas. Think of yourself. You\u2019re betting your reputation, your family harmony\u2014your entire future\u2014on a queer-shaped hole in the ground. I\u2019m a gambler, pet. I know a bad wager when I see one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t believe in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. I just don\u2019t believe in dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all? You think I\u2019m fanciful?\u201d She stood and began pulling at the fastened straps of her trunk. \u201cThis creature was not a dragon. Not a mythical beast of any kind, but a real, living animal. And I\u2019ve based my conclusions on years of scientific study.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes\u2019 fumbling, she finally got the trunk open. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, lifting out stacks of journals and setting them atop the other trunk. \u201cAll my personal writings and findings. Months of notes, sketches, measurements.\u201d She held up a thick leather-bound diary. \u201cThis entire journal is filled with my comparisons from the available fossil record. Verifying that no similar creature has been recorded to date. And if all that fails to convince them . . .\u201d</p><p>She pushed aside a layer of fabric padding. \u201cHere. I\u2019ve brought this.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared at the object in the trunk. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s the footprint.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI made a casting, from plaster of Paris.\u201d</p><p>He stared at it some more. In the cave, in the dark, the \u201cprint\u201d had looked like a random, three-pronged depression in the ground. The work of time and chance, not some primeval creature.</p><p>But now in the sunlight, cast in plaster relief\u2014he could see it clear. The edges were defined and smooth. Just as with a human footprint, the toe prints were individual and separate from the sole. It really looked like a foot. An enormous reptilian foot. The print of a creature that could send a man running and screaming for his life.</p><p>Colin had to admit, it was rather impressive.</p><p>But not nearly as impressive as Minerva herself.</p><p>At last, here was a glimmer of that confident, clever woman who\u2019d visited his quarters. The woman he\u2019d been waiting to see again.</p><p>The brisk morning air lent her skin a pretty flush, and the misty sunlight revealed it to lovely effect. She\u2019d coiled all that dark, heavy hair and tightly pinned it for the journey\u2014save a few fetching tendrils that spiraled lazily from her temple to her cheek. Doeskin gloves hugged her fingers like a second skin. Her traveling gown was velvet. Exquisitely tailored and dyed in a lush, saturated hue that danced the line between red and violet. Depending on how the sunlight caught the velvet\u2019s thick nap, that gown was either the blaring color of alarm\u2014or the hue of wild, screaming pleasure.</p><p>Either way, Colin knew he ought to lower his gaze, back away slowly, and be done with this.</p><p>\u201cI will win the prize,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you still don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, you don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only me who believes it. I know you think I\u2019m mad, but he\u2019s not.\u201d She rummaged through the trunk\u2019s interior side pocket and withdrew an envelope. \u201cHere, read it.\u201d</p><p>He unfolded the letter, holding it carefully by its edges. The message was penned in a crisp, masculine hand.</p><p>\u201c \u2018My dear friend and colleague,\u2019 \u201d he read aloud. \u201c \u2018I have read with great interest your latest reports from Sussex.\u2019 \u201d He skimmed the letter. \u201cSo on and so forth. Something about rocks. More about lizards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust skip to the end.\u201d She jabbed a finger at the last paragraph. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018These findings of yours are exciting indeed,\u2019 \u201d Colin read. \u201c \u2018I wish you would reconsider your plans and make the journey to Edinburgh for the symposium. Surely the prize would be yours, without contest. And though it be paltry inducement compared to a purse of five hundred guineas, I would add that I\u2019m most eager to further our acquaintance. I find myself growing most impatient to meet, face-to-face, the colleague whose scholarship I have long admired and whose friendship I have . . .\u201d His voiced trailed off. He cleared his throat and resumed reading. \u201c \u2018Whose friendship I have come to hold so very dear. Please . . .\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Colin paused. So very dear? In correspondence between a gentleman and an unattached young lady, that was practically a declaration of love.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Please make the journey. Yours in admiration, Sir Alisdair Kent,\u2019\u201d he finished.</p><p>He\u2019d be damned. The awkward bluestocking had an admirer. Perhaps even a sweetheart. How quaint. How precious. How unspeakably irritating.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certain to win the prize. Do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. I see your little plan now.\u201d He took a few aimless paces, chuckling to himself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. I\u2019m being used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed? What can you mean? That\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p><p>He made a dismissive noise. \u201cPlease. Here I was so concerned that if I consented to this trip, I\u2019d be using you ill.\u201d He held up the letter. \u201cBut this is all about Sir Alisdair Kent. You were going to pretend to elope with me, on the hopes of seeing him. You\u2019re the one using me.\u201d</p><p>She snatched the letter from his grip. \u201cI\u2019m not using you. You would come out richer for this, while I would be utterly ruined. I\u2019m offering you the entire prize. Five hundred guineas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine price for my tender heart.\u201d He pressed a hand over the offended organ. \u201cYou meant to ruthlessly toy with my affections. Suggesting we travel together for weeks. An unmarried man and an unmarried woman, trapped in close quarters for all those days.\u201d He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cAll those nights. You\u2019ll be casting glances at me over those coy little spectacles, driving me wild with all your polysyllabic words. Sharing my bed. Kissing me like a brazen temptress.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lashes worked furiously as she refolded her precious letter. \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t enough. Not nearly. Colin knew she didn\u2019t respect him. But now that he was seized with lust for her, she ought to at least reciprocate with a grudging-yet-helpless infatuation. So much would only be polite. But no, she\u2019d been pining all along for another man. When they\u2019d kissed, had she been practicing for this geologist toad?</p><p>She said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to mock me. There\u2019s no call to be cruel. Sir Alisdair Kent is a colleague, nothing more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe holds you dear, that letter says. Not just dear. \u2018So very dear.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even\u2014\u201d She made a fist and drew a slow breath. When she spoke again, she\u2019d tempered her voice. \u201cHe is a brilliant geologist. And any admiration he feels for me is strictly based on my work. He believes the creature that left this footprint will be recorded as a new species. I\u2019ll even get to name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it?\u201d Colin eyed the plaster cast. \u201cWhy go to Scotland for that? We can name it right here. I suggest \u2018Frank.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNot name it that way. I\u2019ll be the one to give the species a scientific name. Besides, this lizard was female.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and stared at the print. \u201cIt\u2019s a footprint. How on earth do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just know. I feel it.\u201d With her fingertips, she reverently traced the three-toed shape. \u201cThe creature who left this mark\u2014she was definitely not a \u2018Frank.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancine, then.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled forcefully. \u201cI know this is all a joke to you. But it won\u2019t be to my colleagues.\u201d She replaced the rolls of fabric around the plaster, packing it tight. \u201cWhatever this creature was, she was real. She lived and breathed, and she left this mark. And now, untold eons later . . . she just might change the way we understand the world.\u201d</p><p>She shut and locked the trunk, propping one foot atop the baggage to tighten the leather straps. Her trim, stockinged ankle was revealed to his view. So pale and sweetly curved. He didn\u2019t know which he found more appealing\u2014the erotic glimpse of her ankle, or the determined set of her brow.</p><p>\u201cCome. Give it here.\u201d Colin reached to help with the buckles.</p><p>At his urging, she ceased wrestling with the straps and surrendered the task to him. In the transfer, the back of his hand brushed her calf. A jolt of desire rocked him in his boots. Lord. This was precisely why he couldn\u2019t agree to this wild scheme.</p> <p>He finished fastening the buckles and stood tall, clapping dust from his gloved hands. \u201cHe\u2019s probably ancient, you know. Or warty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Sir Alisdair fellow.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks blushed crimson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, he\u2019s likely older than Francine. And less attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s ancient and warty and leprous and hunchbacked. He would still be learned, intelligent. Respected and respectful. He would still be a better man than you. You know it, and you\u2019re envious. You\u2019re being cruel to me to soothe your pride.\u201d She looked him up and down with a contemptuous glare. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to catch flies in your mouth, if you don\u2019t shut it.\u201d</p><p>For once, Colin found himself without words. The best he could do was take her advice and hoist his dropped jaw.</p><p>An air of determination settled on her. The curves of her face became decisive angles. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to Edinburgh, with or without you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? You mean to travel almost five hundred miles alone? No. I can\u2019t let you do that. I . . . I forbid you.\u201d</p><p>It was Colin\u2019s first attempt at forbidding anyone to do anything, and it worked about as well as he\u2019d expected it to. Which was to say, not at all.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cStay here and marry Diana if you must, but I won\u2019t be a party to it. I can\u2019t simply stand by and watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, is that all that\u2019s worrying you?\u201d He put his hands on her shoulders to make sure she was paying attention. \u201cI won\u2019t marry Diana. I never had any plan to marry Diana. I\u2019ve been trying to tell you as much for days.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>The distant rumble of hoofbeats and carriage wheels shook the ground. As they stared at each other, it gathered strength.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the coach,\u201d she said.</p><p>Colin glanced down the road. Yes, here it came. The moment of decision.</p><p>\u201cCome now,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me help you take your things back to the rooming house.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t go back. I just can\u2019t. I left a note, saying we\u2019ve eloped. By now, they\u2019re probably awake and reading it. I can\u2019t be the girl who cried \u2018elopement.\u2019 The pathetic thing who gathered all her hopes and packed three trunks, and went out to stand at the road at dawn only to slink back home defeated and hopeless. My mother would . . .\u201d She drew a deep breath, stood tall, and lifted her chin. \u201cI just can\u2019t be that girl anymore. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As he watched her, Colin was visited by the strangest feeling, unfurling warm and buttery inside him. It was a sense of privilege and mute wonder, as though he\u2019d witnessed one of those small, everyday miracles of spring. Like a licked-clean foal taking its first steps on wobbly legs. Or a new butterfly pushing scrunched, damp wings from a chrysalis.</p><p>Before his eyes, she\u2019d transformed into a new creature. Still a bit awkward and uncertain, but undaunted. And well on her way to being beautiful.</p><p>Colin scratched his neck. He wished there were someone nearby he could turn to and say, Would you look at that?</p><p>\u201cYou truly want this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that much to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her eyes were clear and unblinking.</p><p>\u201cIf we embark on this journey, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you comprehend all the implications. Everything you\u2019ll put at risk. Hell, everything you\u2019ll outright sacrifice, the moment you leave with me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m exchanging my acceptance in fashionable society for standing within the Royal Geological Society. I understand this perfectly, and I think it a rather good trade. You told me to think of myself, Colin. Well, I\u2019m doing just that.\u201d</p><p>Turning from him, she popped up on her toes and waved her arms, signaling the coachman. \u201cStop! Stop, please!\u201d</p><p>He stood by and watched her desperate gesticulations, absurdly enchanted by them. Good for you, pet. Good for you.</p><p>As the carriage rolled to a halt, she reached for her smallest trunk. She looked to him, smiling. \u201cLast chance. Are you coming or aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The road to London was dusty, rutted, bumpy, and miserable.</p><p>And Minerva rejoiced in every passing mile.</p><p>That was to say, she rejoiced quietly, and without moving so much as a muscle. She hadn\u2019t any space to move at all.</p><p>Inside the coach, they were packed four to a seat. Two more passengers shared space with the driver. Minerva was almost afraid to count how many people rode atop the carriage. From her view through the carriage window, their legs hung down like stalactites. Beyond them, she caught the occasional glimpse of Colin, riding on horseback alongside the coach. She envied him the fresh air and freedom of movement.</p><p>But all in all, she was thrilled. The agonized decisions and frantic preparations were behind her, and now she could simply bask in the exhilaration of having done it. After spending all of her girlhood fervently wishing she could run away from home\u2014she\u2019d actually done it. And this wasn\u2019t a childish dash into the forest with a hastily packed picnic basket and petulant note reading simply, \u201cAdieu.\u201d This journey had serious, professional significance. It was practically a business trip.</p><p>This morning, she\u2019d taken her life into her own hands.</p><p>But she was glad she wasn\u2019t making the journey alone.</p><p>When they stopped to rest or change horses, Colin excelled at playing the attentive, would-be bridegroom. He stayed by her side and looked out for her in small ways, such as procuring their refreshments or keeping a watchful eye on her trunks. He made a point of touching her often. Subtly laying a hand to her elbow, handing her into the coach.</p><p>She knew the touches weren\u2019t for her pleasure or his, but for the benefit of those around them. Those small physical cues made a point. Every time he touched her, he said without words, This woman is under my protection.</p><p>And every time he sent that message, she felt a little thrill.</p><p>Minerva was especially grateful for the protection when they arrived in London late that afternoon and reached the coaching inn. She was so road weary, she could scarcely stand. Colin dealt with the innkeeper, registering the two of them under a fictitious name without so much as a blink. He made certain all her trunks came upstairs, ordered a simple dinner, and even sent an errand boy to procure his traveling necessities\u2014a few clean shirts, a razor, and so forth\u2014rather than do his own shopping and leave Minerva alone.</p><p>In fact, he made her feel so safe and comfortable, they were halfway through their meal of roast beef and boiled carrots when Minerva felt suddenly struck\u2014smacked in the face\u2014by reality. She was in a small bedchamber, with a single bed. Alone with a man who was not her relation, nor her husband.</p><p>She put down her fork. She chased her last bite of food with a healthy swallow of wine. She took a slow look around at the room.</p><p>This was it. This was ruination in the making. Roast beef and boiled carrots and ugly, peeling wallpaper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even teased me all day.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his plate. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m waiting for you, Morgana.\u201d</p><p>She set her teeth. Really, she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to correct him anymore. \u201cWaiting for me to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to your senses.\u201d He gestured about the room. \u201cCall this all off. Demand I take you straight back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not having any second thoughts?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>He poured them both more wine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you at all anxious, to share this room with me tonight and know what it will mean for you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d been nothing but solicitous and protective since they\u2019d left Spindle Cove, she couldn\u2019t help but feel anxious in his presence. He was so handsome, so blatant, so . . . so very male. His personality seemed to take up the entire room.</p><p>And heavens, she\u2019d agreed to share a bed with him. If his idea of \u201csharing a bed\u201d entailed more than simply lying next to each other, she didn\u2019t know what she would do. Fear and curiosity battled within her, as she remembered his skillful, arousing kisses in the cave.</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t dissuade you . . .\u201d he said.</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled expansively. \u201cThen in the morning, I\u2019ll see about finding space in a coach headed north. We should try to sleep as early as possible.\u201d</p><p>She gulped.</p><p>While he finished eating, Minerva decided to seek a familiar refuge. Excusing herself from the small dining table, she went to her trunks and opened the smallest\u2014the one that held all her books. She pulled out her journal. If she\u2019d be presenting at the symposium in a week or so, she needed to organize all her most recent findings and add them to the paper.</p><p>Taking a pencil and clenching it between her teeth, she shut the trunk and brought the journal back to the table. She moved her empty dishes of food aside and adjusted her spectacles, settling in to work.</p><p>She flipped open the journal to the last filled page. What she saw there horrified her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart squeezed. \u201cOh no. Oh no.\u201d</p><p>Across the table, Colin looked up from his food.</p><p>She fanned through the pages in dismay. \u201cOh no. Oh God. I couldn\u2019t possibly be so stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t limit yourself. You can be anything you wish.\u201d To her annoyed glance, he replied, \u201cWhat? You complained that I hadn\u2019t been teasing you.\u201d</p><p>She stacked her arms on the table and rested her head on them. Slowly raising and lowering her brow, thunking her forehead against her wrist. \u201cSo. So. Stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now. Surely it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d He put aside his cutlery and wiped his mouth on a napkin. Then he slid his chair around the table, so that he sat beside her. \u201cWhat can possibly have you so upset?\u201d He reached for the journal.</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Too late. He already held it in his hands. He flipped through the pages, skimming the text.</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t read it. It\u2019s all lies, all foolishness. It\u2019s a false journal, you see. I stayed up all night writing it. I meant to leave it behind, to give my mother and sisters the impression that we\u2019d been falling in l\u2014\u201d She bit off the foolish words. \u201cThat we\u2019d been carrying on for some time now. So they\u2019d believe in our elopement. But obviously, I made a mistake. I brought the false journal with me and left the real one at the Queen\u2019s Ruby.\u201d</p><p>He lingered on one particular page, chuckling to himself.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s face burned. She wanted to disappear.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I beg you, don\u2019t read it.\u201d Desperate, she made a wild grab for the journal.</p><p>He held it back, rising from his chair. \u201cOh, this is brilliant. Utterly brilliant. You sing my praises so convincingly.\u201d He cleared his throat and read aloud in an affected tone. \u201c \u2018My mother always says, Lord Payne is all that her future son-in-law should be. Wealthy, titled, handsome, charming. I confess . . .\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it here.\u201d</p> <p>She chased him, but he backed away, scrambling over the bed and continuing from the other side.</p><p>\u201c \u2018I confess,\u2019 \u201d he continued in that tone of declamation, \u201c \u2018I was slower than most to admit it, but even I am not immune to Payne\u2019s masculine appeal. It\u2019s so difficult to recall the defects in his character, when confronted so closely by his . . .\u2019 \u201d He lowered the journal and drawled, \u201c \u2018By his physical perfection.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a horrid, horrid man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now. Let\u2019s see how your tune changes when you\u2019re closely confronted by my physical perfection.\u201d He strolled back around the bed, toward her.</p><p>Now Minerva was the object of pursuit.</p><p>She walked in reverse until her back collided with the wall. Like a child with nowhere to hide, she closed her eyes. \u201cStop reading. Please.\u201d</p><p>He flipped through the book as he ambled toward her. \u201cGood God. There are whole pages of description. The roguish wave of my hair. My chiseled profile. I have eyes like . . . like diamonds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot real diamonds. Bristol diamonds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are Bristol diamonds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a kind of rock formation. On the outside, they look like ordinary pebbles. Round, brownish gray. But when you crack them open, inside they\u2019re filled with crystals in a hundred different shades.\u201d</p><p>Why did she bother? The man wasn\u2019t even listening.</p><p>\u201c \u2018No one around us could guess our connection,\u2019 \u201d he read on. \u201c \u2018To the observer, it would seem he only speaks to me to tease. But there is a deeper sentiment beneath his teasing, I know it. A man might engage in flirtation with disinterest, or even disdain. But he never teases without affection.\u2019 \u201d He speared her with a look. \u201cThose are my words. That is blatant plagiarism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Falsehood doesn\u2019t come so easily to me as it does to you.\u201d She threw up her hands. \u201cWhat does it matter? The words were a lie when you spoke them, and they were a lie when I wrote them. Don\u2019t you understand? It\u2019s a false journal, all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this part.\u201d He pointed a single finger in the center of a page. \u201c \u2018We have kissed. He has bade me call him by his Christian name, Colin.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He fixed her with an inscrutable look. Her heart pounded in her chest, and she found herself swaying toward him. For a dizzying moment, she thought he might kiss her again.</p><p>She hoped he would kiss her again.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. And she was sure she heard someone, somewhere laughing.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve bade me call you by your Christian name. And yet, you can\u2019t even recall mine.\u201d She wrenched the book from his hand. \u201cI think you\u2019ve more than made up for lost time now. In fact, I\u2019m certain you\u2019ve exceeded your teasing quota for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t borrow against tomorrow\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She snapped the journal shut and tucked it firmly back in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cCome along. Don\u2019t be upset. You said yourself, it was purposely ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s not what has me so upset.\u201d Not entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that I left behind the other diary. The real one, with all my latest measurements and observations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had reams of findings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But my presentation will be weaker for not having those.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cHow much weaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She forced a smile and patted the plaster cast in the trunk. \u201cYour five hundred guineas are assured. So long as we still have this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cThank heaven for Francine.\u201d</p><p>Colin sighed heavily and pushed a hand through his hair. What the hell was he doing? When she\u2019d made her little ultimatum by the road, she\u2019d left him no choice but to accompany her. Simple decency demanded it. But he\u2019d spent the entire day expecting her to come to her senses. To call off the whole mad journey and demand he return her to Spindle Cove, straightaway. Thus far, however, her determination had not wavered. And some strange force wouldn\u2019t let him leave her side.</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t know what the hell that force was. He was here in a coaching inn with her, so he couldn\u2019t very well call it honor or duty. Protectiveness, perhaps? Pity? Sheer curiosity? He knew one thing. It damn well wasn\u2019t five hundred guineas.</p><p>From her trunk, she unpacked a stout roll of something white.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBed linens. I\u2019m not sleeping atop that.\u201d She indicated the dingy straw-tick bed.</p><p>As he watched, she unfurled the roll atop the sagging mattress, stretching and leaning in her efforts to spread the crisp, white linen to all four corners of the bed. Colin noted the edges of the sheet were neatly hemmed, and embroidered with a delicate, stylized pattern that he couldn\u2019t quite make out.</p><p>She reached for a second roll. The coverlet, he assumed. This one featured the same repeating border. In the center, the fabric was emblazoned with an odd, roundish design the size of a dog-cart wheel. While she smoothed the creases, he cocked his head and stared at it. The careful, embroidered stitches delineated a coil of some sort. It looked rather like a halved snail shell, but the interior was divided into dozens of intricate chambers.</p><p>\u201cIs that a nautilus?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cClose, but no. It\u2019s an ammonite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ammonite? What\u2019s an ammonite? Sounds like an Old Testament people overdue for smiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmmonites are not a biblical people,\u201d she replied in a tone of strained forbearance. \u201cBut they have been smited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmote.\u201d</p><p>With a snap of linen, she shot him a look. \u201cSmote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrammatically speaking, I think the word you want is \u2018smote.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cScientifically speaking, the word I want is \u2018extinct.\u2019 Ammonites are extinct. They\u2019re only known to us in fossils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bedsheets, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know . . .\u201d She huffed aside a lock of hair dangling in her face. \u201cYou could be helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m so enjoying watching,\u201d he said, just to devil her. Nonetheless, he picked up the edge of the top sheet and fingered the stitching as he pulled it straight. \u201cSo you made this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Though judging by her tone, it hadn\u2019t been a labor of love. \u201cMy mother always insisted, from the time I was twelve years old, that I spend an hour every evening on embroidery. She had all three of us forever stitching things for our trousseaux.\u201d</p><p>Trousseaux. The word hit him queerly. \u201cYou brought your trousseau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I brought my trousseau. To create the illusion of an elopement, obviously. And it made the most logical place to store Francine. All these rolls of soft fabric made for good padding.\u201d</p><p>Some emotion jabbed his side, then scampered off before he could name it. Guilt, most likely. These were sheets meant to grace her marriage bed, and she was spreading them over a stained straw-tick mattress in a seedy coaching inn.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow,\u201d she went on, \u201cso long as my mother forced me to embroider, I insisted on choosing a pattern that interested me. I\u2019ve never understood why girls are always made to stitch insipid flowers and ribbons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just to hazard a guess . . .\u201d Colin straightened his edge. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s because sleeping on a bed of flowers and ribbons sounds delightful and romantic. Whereas sharing one\u2019s bed with a primeval sea snail sounds disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw firmed. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to sleep on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say disgusting? I meant enchanting. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to bed with a primeval sea snail.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI worked hard on this. The calculations were intricate. I counted hundreds of stitches to get every last chamber right.\u201d She ran a fingertip over the ridges of thread, spiraling out from the center. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a haphazard pattern, you realize. Nature adheres to mathematical principles. Each chamber of the ammonite\u2019s shell expands on the last, according to a precise, unchanging exponent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. I understand. It\u2019s a logarithm.\u201d</p><p>Her head whipped up. She adjusted her spectacles and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cthis design begins to appeal to me after all. Sea slugs aren\u2019t the least bit arousing, but logarithms . . . I\u2019ve always thought that word sounded splendidly naughty.\u201d He let it roll off his tongue with ribald inflection. \u201cLogarithm.\u201d He gave an exaggerated shiver. \u201cOoh. Yes and thank you and may I have some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of mathematical terms sound that way. I think it\u2019s because they were all coined by men. \u2018Hypotenuse\u2019 is downright lewd.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Quadrilateral\u2019 brings rather carnal images to mind.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a long time. Then one of her dark eyebrows arched. \u201cNot so many as \u2018rhombus.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Good Lord. That word was wicked. Her pronunciation of it did rather wicked things to him. He had to admire the way she didn\u2019t shrink from a challenge, but came back with a new and surprising retort. One day, she\u2019d make some fortunate man a very creative lover.</p><p>He chuckled, shaking off the sudden grip of lust. \u201cWe have the oddest conversations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find this conversation more than odd. It\u2019s positively shocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I understand the principle of a logarithm? I know you\u2019re used to speaking to me in small, simple words, but I did have the finest education England can offer a young aristocrat. Attended both Eton and Oxford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . . somehow, I never pictured you earning high marks in maths.\u201d She reached both hands behind her back, undoing the closures at the back of her gown. As if she\u2019d forgotten he was even there, or felt no compunction about disrobing in front of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin felt like carving a hashmark in the bedpost. Surely this marked a new level of achievement in his amatory career. Never before had he charmed the frock off a woman with talk of mathematics. Never before would he have thought to try.</p><p>Loosening his own cravat, he said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, I did not earn high marks in maths. I could have done. But I made certain not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you joking? Because no one likes boys who excel in maths. Priggish little bores, always hunched over their slates. They all have four eyes and no friends.\u201d</p><p>He winced, realizing instantly what he\u2019d said. But it was already too late.</p><p>She froze, arms bent in the act of undoing her gown. All amusement fled her expression. She sniffed and stared at the corner.</p><p>Damn it, he was always hurting her.</p><p>\u201cMin, I didn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d she said, waving him off. \u201cIt\u2019s late, and I\u2019m fatigued. Spare me the apologies and turn around while I undress. I\u2019ll tell you when my four priggish eyes are safely beneath the disgusting sea snail.\u201d</p><p>He did as she asked, turning away. While he worked his cuffs loose, he tried to close his ears to the rustle of fabric. It didn\u2019t work. He couldn\u2019t stop his imagination from running wild, painting image after image of her stepping free of her gown, freeing the laces of her stays. He heard a rush of breath, and a thrill raced down his spine as he recognized it as that deep, arousing sigh a woman gave when her breasts were unbound at the end of the day.</p><p>Blood rushed to his groin, and he strangled a sigh of his own. He was a man, he told himself. There was an unclothed woman in the room. His physical reaction couldn\u2019t be helped. It was simple biology. Birds felt it. Bees felt it. Even primeval sea snails felt it.</p><p>He heard soft splashes from the washstand, as she dragged a wet cloth over her every lush, naked curve. Really, she was just torturing him now. He probably deserved it.</p><p>At long last, he heard the bed creak. \u201cYou may turn now.\u201d</p><p>He turned, fully assuming he\u2019d find her huddled under the covers, facing the wall. Instead, she lay on her side, looking directly at him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to disrobe,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to turn away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d She propped her head on her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man naked. Not a real one, not up close. Call it indulging my scientific curiosity.\u201d Her gaze sharpened. \u201cOr call it an apology, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was a clever one indeed. So, he was to pay for all his teasing and unthinking insults with naked humiliation. Even Colin had to admit, the penalty was just.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to let you survey my physical perfection in its entirety. But only if I get to see you, too.\u201d To her shocked silence, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s only fair. Tit for tat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that fair? You\u2019ve seen countless tits.\u201d</p><p>Damn, the way she said that word. So plainly, without any hint of missishness. Just when he\u2019d regained control of himself, she had him instantly, throbbingly aroused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d need a peep at mine,\u201d she went on. \u201cAnd since you\u2019ve proudly waved your . . . tat . . . before half the women in England, I find it odd that you\u2019d claim modesty now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he said evenly, \u201cthat I\u2019ve been blessed to view a great many bosoms in my life. But every pair is different, and I haven\u2019t seen yours.\u201d</p> <p>She shrank in the bed linens, curling into that embroidered shell. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing out of the ordinary, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cVery well. Here is my best offer. Half of my nakedness, for all of yours.\u201d</p><p>He pretended to think on it. \u201cIt\u2019s a bargain.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up in bed, she unbuttoned the front of her chemise. Then she drew the sleeves down each shoulder, carefully shielding her breasts with her folded legs. Her forearms were toasted by the sun, but her shoulders were pale, swannish curves of loveliness.</p><p>Once she\u2019d bared herself to the waist, she hunched behind that wall of knees and issued a challenge. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his shirt over his head and cast it aside. Then he undid his buttons and dropped his breeches without ceremony.</p><p>Well, not entirely without ceremony. There was a certain amount of fanfare. His rapidly growing erection all but trumpeted for attention, jutting out from its nest of dark hair. Waving in an embarrassing, adolescent way.</p><p>\u201cNow you,\u201d he said.</p><p>True to her word, she lowered her knees and revealed her bare torso.</p><p>They took each other in.</p><p>She was right, he told himself. Her breasts were nothing out of the ordinary. To begin with, there were two of them. The usual number. They were round and just on the plump side of average, capped with prominent nipples. The room was too dark to discern those puckered nubs\u2019 precise shade, but he wasn\u2019t choosy. Pink, berry, tawny, brown . . . they all tasted the same in the dark.</p><p>No, her breasts, while attractive, were not empirically more or less enticing than most bosoms he\u2019d seen. But what quite stole his breath away was the entirety of her. The picture she made, sitting there half-nude in a rumpled nest of fresh white sheets. Her dark hair tumbling about her shoulders, and those spectacles perched\u2014fetchingly askew\u2014at the tip of her nose. Those lush, plum-colored lips oh-so-slightly parted.</p><p>She looked like a memory, interrupted. A torrid dream. Or a glimpse of the future, perhaps.</p><p>Stop. Don\u2019t think such things.</p><p>\u201cSurely it\u2019s not always like that?\u201d she asked, leaning forward and peering intently.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . big. And active.\u201d</p><p>His straining cock gave another eager leap. Like a poorly trained hound.</p><p>\u201cDid you do that on purpose?\u201d she asked, sounding amazed.</p><p>Oh, the devious things Colin suddenly longed to do on purpose. With purpose. For the explicit purpose of steaming those spectacles and making her mewl with unfettered delight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to seduce you,\u201d he said.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s delay, she gave her head a brisk little shake. Her gaze wandered back up to his face. With a single fingertip, she pushed her spectacles up on her nose. \u201cExcuse me, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to seduce you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cNot tonight, or at all. I just thought I should say that.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI mean what I said, that first night at the castle. About not ruining innocent girls. You see, I have rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have rules. For the women you seduce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. For myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s an . . . an etiquette to raking. Some seducer\u2019s code of honor. Is this what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way. You see, your average fellow who merely sets out to bed the girls he fancies . . . well, he wouldn\u2019t need rules, perhaps. But when a man ventures forth with the quite serious goal of never spending a single night alone . . . a set of guidelines just evolves. Believe it or not, I do have some principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd these rules are . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey start with basic good manners, of course. Saying please and thank you, and adhering to the dictum, Ladies first. I\u2019m not particular about locations, but I do have some prohibitions on ropes and scarves.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cRopes and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no qualms about tying, but I won\u2019t be tied. Beyond that . . .\u201d He ticked off the limits on his fingers. \u201cNo virgins. No prostitutes. No women in dire financial straits. No sisters of former lovers. No mothers of former lov\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMothers?\u201d she squawked.</p><p>He shrugged. There was a rather amusing story behind that one.</p><p>He said, \u201cListen, it\u2019s not important that you hear all the rules. The point is that I have some. As I\u2019ve already explained, seducing you would break them. So it\u2019s not going to happen. And I thought it best to broach the topic now, while I\u2019m standing here naked. Because if I brought it up at any other time, you might take offense and assume I\u2019m just not attracted to you.\u201d He indicated his full, turgid, ridiculously optimistic erection. \u201cAs you can plainly observe, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p><p>She went silent for several moments. Observing.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she told his cock. \u201cWe do have the oddest conversations.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face with both hands and released a slow, deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to save your reputation, you know. I could take you to Bram and Susanna\u2019s town house right now, and you could roll up those sheets and save them. You know, for a man who might be able to fully appreciate . . . the work you put into them. The significance. They\u2019re part of your trousseau. They should be special.\u201d</p><p>If they stayed alone in this room\u2014an unmarried gentlewoman and a known rake\u2014it made no difference what they actually did on these embroidered sheets tonight. Even if the linens remained unsullied by their sweat or his seed or her virgin\u2019s blood, they were ruined. When she returned from this adventure unmarried, she would be ruined. Unmarriageable, in good society.</p><p>She rolled onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s done now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He pushed aside the surge of guilt, reminding himself this entire trip was her idea, and she knew full well the consequences. She\u2019d literally made her bed, and now she was lying in it. Colin was going to share it with her. That was the bargain.</p><p>\u201cI always sleep atop the bedclothes,\u201d he said, sitting down on the mattress edge. \u201cSo as long as you stay under them . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be something between us.\u201d</p><p>Something. Yes. Something with the thickness of a birch leaf.</p><p>As he stared up at the ceiling, the memory of her breasts seemed to hang up there in the dark. Like two round, peachy moons mounted from the rafters, tempting him to touch. To taste. Colin knew better than to stretch a hand toward the mirage, but his gullible cock strained and arced, ever hopeful.</p><p>He shut his eyes and tried to turn his mind to the least arousing things possible. Spiders with hairy legs. Those bumpy, long-necked gourds that made him think of poxy genitalia. Mashed peas. The dust-and-beeswax smell of impossibly old people.</p><p>Then an entirely different image bloomed in his mind. One that made him laugh out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She sounded sleepy. He envied her that.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just picturing your mother\u2019s reaction right now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cWhere is that Minerva?\u201d Laying aside her deck of cards, Mrs. Highwood snapped her fingers at one of the Bull and Blossom\u2019s serving girls. \u201cYou, there. What is your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Pauline, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPauline, then. Do dash over to the rooming house and tell my wayward daughter I wish her to join us here at once. At once! Tell her to put aside that scribbling. She\u2019s already missed tea, and dinner. She will take her lesson with Miss Taylor, and then she will serve as our fourth at whist. She will be an obedient daughter, or I will no longer claim her. I will wash my hands of her entirely.\u201d</p><p>With a curtsy, Pauline turned to do as she was bid.</p><p>Seated beside Charlotte at the pianoforte, Kate Taylor smiled to herself. Of all the hollow threats. She doubted Minerva would feel a single snowflake\u2019s chill of sorrow, should Mrs. Highwood resign her relentless campaign of feminine improvements and give her middle daughter up entirely.</p><p>Kate felt a great deal of sympathy for the harangued Misses Highwood\u2014at times, more sympathy than envy, which was saying something. Kate had no family at all, save the circle of female friendship here in Spindle Cove. No home, save for the Queen\u2019s Ruby. She was an orphan, raised on the kindness of anonymous benefactors and educated at Margate School for Girls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For all the nights she\u2019d spent weeping into her pillow in that drafty, austere attic dormitory, pleading and bargaining with God for a mother of her own . . . Occasionally, Mrs. Highwood\u2019s behavior made Kate thankful for unanswered prayers. Not all mothers were blessings, apparently.</p><p>\u201cBegin again at the coda, Charlotte,\u201d Kate told her young pupil. \u201cMind the rhythm here.\u201d She tapped the sheet music with a slender pointer. \u201cYour fingering\u2019s all wrong when you hit that run of sixteenths, and it\u2019s slowing you down.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over Charlotte\u2019s wrist to demonstrate, she said, \u201cBegin with your index finger, see? And then cross under with your thumb.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Charlotte imitated the technique.</p><p>\u201cYes. Two times slowly, for practice. Then try it up to speed.\u201d</p><p>As Charlotte repeated the passage, Kate heard a series of subtle cracks from the direction of the bar.</p><p>They came from Corporal Thorne. He sat with his rugged profile to them, his only companion a pint of ale on the bar. Whether the repetitive scales, the shuffling of cards, or Mrs. Highwood\u2019s shrill pronouncements were to blame, Thorne was clearly unhappy to be sharing the establishment with anyone.</p><p>As Charlotte started on her second repetition of the same passage, Kate watched the grim, enormous boulder of a man grimace at his ale. Then he brought his hands together on the counter and began to crack the knuckles of his left hand. One by one. Deliberately. In an ominous, vaguely threatening manner that suggested he might crack something\u2014or someone\u2014if the plodding musical exercise continued.</p> <p>\u201cMake that three times, Charlotte,\u201d Kate said, straightening her spine.</p><p>Thorne was an intimidating presence, to be sure\u2014but he would not put an early end to their lesson. Repetition was essential to music practice, and the ladies had every right to be here in the Bull and Blossom. It was both their tea shop and the gentlemen\u2019s tavern.</p><p>Just as Charlotte hit her stride with the coda, playing fluently at tempo, the doorbell jangled and Pauline returned from her errand.</p><p>\u201cWell, girl?\u201d Mrs. Highwood asked. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Minerva wasn\u2019t there, Mrs. Highwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Not there? Of course she\u2019s there. Where else would she be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t say, ma\u2019am. When I told Miss Diana you were looking for her, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Diana burst through the door.</p><p>The waxed playing cards slithered to the table as Mrs. Highwood looked up mid-shuffle. \u201cTake care, dear. You\u2019ll give yourself an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d Diana said, swallowing hard and drawing a slow, deep breath. She held up a piece of paper. \u201cMinerva\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stopped playing. \u201cWhat do you mean, she\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left a note. It must have fallen off the desk. I didn\u2019t find it until just now.\u201d Diana smoothed the paper and held it out, preparing to read.</p><p>As if they were in church rather than the tea shop, the ladies rose from their chairs in unison, preparing to hear the reading. At the bar, even Corporal Thorne perked subtly.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Dear Diana,\u2019 \u201d the flaxen-haired beauty read from the note, \u201c \u2018I am sorry this will come as such a surprise. You, Charlotte, and Mama are not to worry in the least. I am safe, traveling north with Lord Payne. We have eloped to Scotland to be married. We are . . .\u2019 \u201d Diana lowered the paper and looked to her mother. \u201c \u2018We are desperately in love.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>The silence was profound.</p><p>Charlotte was first to break it. \u201cNo. No. There must be some mistake. Minerva and Lord Payne, eloped? In love? It\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can they have been gone since morning?\u201d Kate asked. \u201cDid no one notice?\u201d</p><p>Diana shrugged. \u201cMinerva\u2019s always out exploring the cove and cliffs. It\u2019s not unusual for her to disappear before breakfast, only to appear again just as dark\u2019s settling in.\u201d</p><p>Kate gathered her courage and addressed the elephant in the room. \u201cCorporal Thorne?\u201d</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw Lord Payne?\u201d</p><p>The big man frowned at the bar and swore. \u201cYesternight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it must be true,\u201d Diana said. \u201cThey\u2019ve eloped.\u201d</p><p>A new concern pinched at Kate\u2019s heart. She crossed to Diana and touched her arm. \u201cAre you terribly disappointed?\u201d</p><p>Diana looked puzzled. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>Kate tilted her head toward the still-stunned Mrs. Highwood. \u201cI know your mother had such hopes for you and Lord Payne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I never shared them,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s charming and handsome enough, but my feelings for him never went beyond friendship. I often thought it would come as a relief, actually, if he were to marry another. But I never dreamed that Minerva . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva detests the man,\u201d interjected Charlotte. \u201cShe\u2019s told me so, many a time.\u201d She snatched the letter from Diana\u2019s hand. \u201cI cannot believe she\u2019d elope with him. I would easier believe she\u2019d been kidnapped by pirates.\u201d</p><p>Kate lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cSometimes apparent dislike can mask an underlying attraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut for months now, they\u2019ve done nothing but bicker,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cAnd half the time, Lord Payne can\u2019t even recall her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did ask her to dance the other night,\u201d Diana pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, they did dance,\u201d Kate said. \u201cBut rather disastrously. Still, who could have guessed this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. Because it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>Corporal Thorne shoved back from the bar and rose to his feet, nearly bashing his head on the exposed, black-painted rafters. In heavy strides, he crossed to join their group. \u201cPayne\u2019s up to something, I warrant. I\u2019ll go after them. If I ride out now, I can reach London by morning.\u201d He looked to Diana. \u201cIf they\u2019re anywhere on the Great North Road, Lord Rycliff and I will find them and bring your sister home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Everyone swiveled to face the source of this objection: Mrs. Highwood. The woman remained frozen in place, palms pressed flat to the table, staring straight ahead. Kate wasn\u2019t sure the matron had blinked once since Diana read the letter.</p><p>\u201cNo one is going after them,\u201d the older woman said. \u201cI\u2019ve known from the first, Lord Payne would be my son-in-law. My friends always tell me, my intuition is unparalleled.\u201d She pressed a hand to her bosom. \u201cOf course, I thought it would be Diana who\u2019d catch his eye, lovely as she is. But it seems I discounted Minerva\u2019s cleverness.\u201d Blue eyes gleamed. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what the cunning girl did to snare him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely Minerva\u2019s the one who\u2019s been snared,\u201d Charlotte argued. \u201cI tell you, she never would have run off with Lord Payne. She might have been kidnapped!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she\u2019s been kidnapped, Charlotte,\u201d Diana said. \u201cBut Mama, you must admit that this turn of events is highly unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable, more like.\u201d Thorne crossed his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s in love,\u201d Kate argued. \u201cLike the letter says.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shook his head. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible?\u201d Kate was highly annoyed on Minerva\u2019s behalf. \u201cWhy is it impossible that a man should fall in love with an unlikely girl? Perhaps Minerva\u2019s not the prettiest girl in the room. But maybe Lord Payne saw something of beauty in her curious mind, or her independent spirit. Is it truly so unfathomable, that an imperfect girl might be perfectly loved?\u201d</p><p>The Highwoods looked away in awkward silence, and Kate knew she\u2019d said too much. This was about Minerva, not her. Their situations weren\u2019t the same. Minerva might not be the prettiest girl in the room, but she was still a gentlewoman of good family and modest fortune.</p><p>Kate was alone and poor, atop being cursed with physical imperfection. No dashing lords had proposed to elope with her, nor even asked her to dance. But foolish as it might be, she held fast to the hope of love. She\u2019d been holding on to that hope all her life, after all. She could scarcely uncurl her grip now.</p><p>\u201cMinerva is my friend,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thrilled for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s your friend, you should be concerned.\u201d Thorne\u2019s glare was intense. \u201cShe needs rescuing.\u201d</p><p>Kate hiked her chin and gave him her profile. Her imperfect, port-wine-stained profile. \u201cShouldn\u2019t that be her mother\u2019s decision?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood grabbed her elbow. \u201cYes, Miss Taylor has the right of it! We should be celebrating. Imagine\u2014my awkward, prickly Minerva, eloped with a viscount. Some might call it unexpected, unbelievable. But unless someone convinces me otherwise . . .\u201d A smile spread across the woman\u2019s face, making her look ten years younger. \u201cI call it a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Minerva woke in the night.</p><p>Tangled with him.</p><p>She knew a moment of pure, paralyzing terror, until she recalled exactly where and when she was . . . and with whom. Once she\u2019d remembered that she was in a London coaching inn, and the heavy leg so casually thrown over both of hers belonged to none other than Lord Payne . . .</p><p>Then the true fear set in.</p><p>He sighed in his sleep, nestling closer. His arm cinched tight about her waist.</p><p>Oh, God. His arm was about her waist.</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. He was all over her, and she was all . . . under him. His scent and warmth covered her like a blanket. His chin rested heavy on her shoulder, and his nose jutted against the soft place beneath her ear. Yes, the embroidered sheet still formed a soft, pliant barrier between their bodies. But aside from that, they were so closely intertwined, they might have been one creature.</p><p>She stared up at the ceiling. Her pulse pounded in her throat. The desire to move was unbearable, and yet she didn\u2019t dare stir.</p><p>For untold minutes, she lay still. Just breathing. Staring into the darkness. Listening to the frantic beat of her heart and feeling the soft heat of his breath against her neck.</p><p>And then, suddenly, his whole body turned to stone. His grip around her waist tightened to a painful degree, making it difficult to breathe. The leg thrown over hers went rigid as iron. His warm breath ceased washing against her neck.</p><p>He began to tremble. So violently, he shook them both.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s heart rate doubled in both speed and intensity.</p><p>What should she do? Wake him? Speak to him? Remain still and simply hope this . . . episode . . . passed?</p><p>This dreadful sense of helplessness wasn\u2019t new. She felt the same whenever Diana was stricken with an asthma attack. Minerva could never do much to ease her sister\u2019s suffering during a breathing crisis, except to stay at her side and keep her calm. To let her know she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Perhaps that would help him. To know he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d</p><p>He drew a harsh, rattling breath. His muscles were coiled as tightly as springs.</p><p>One of her arms lay trapped at her side, pinned by the weight of his body. But she had the use of her other hand. She raised trembling fingers and laid a cautious touch to his forearm. With the fire banked, the room had long gone cold. But his skin was damp with sweat.</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d She traced her fingers up and down his forearm in long, calming strokes. She wished she could caress other parts of him\u2014his scalp, his back, his face. But unless he loosened his tight hold on her body, this was as much of him as she could reach.</p><p>Her attentions didn\u2019t seem to be helping. He shook violently now, and his breathing was erratic. His heartbeat hammered against her shoulder.</p><p>This was so much worse than in the cave. There, he\u2019d been mildly agitated. Now he seemed to be struggling for his very life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sound rasped from his throat. A raw, anguished, almost inhuman moan.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. Then more forcefully, \u201cNo. Won\u2019t let you. Get back. Get back, you bloody bitch.\u201d</p><p>She winced. She\u2019d never heard him speak in such a savage tone.</p> <p>Oh God. Oh, Colin. What are you facing in there?</p><p>Desperate to do something\u2014anything\u2014to pull him out of that dark, terror-stricken place, she resorted to a trick he\u2019d taught her on the dance floor. She slid her fingers to the vulnerable underside of his arm and pinched him, hard.</p><p>He jerked and startled, sucking in a deep, gasping breath. Like a drowning man who\u2019d just surfaced.</p><p>\u201cColin, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s Minerva. I\u2019m here.\u201d She twisted in his slackened embrace and rolled to face him. She stroked calming touches over his brow. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s all right. Just take deep breaths. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes, but the tension in his body ebbed. His breathing slowed to a normal rate. Her overtaxed pulse gratefully took the excuse to slow, too.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin.\u201d His voice was like a rasp rolled in cotton-wool. Rough and soft all at once. His fingers caught a lock of her hair, and he twisted it between his fingertips. \u201cDid I frighten you?\u2019</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>He muttered a curse and rolled her close to his chest. \u201cSorry, pet. All\u2019s well now.\u201d His chest rose and fell with a deep breath. \u201cAll\u2019s well.\u201d</p><p>Remarkable. After that episode he\u2019d just experienced, he was the one soothing her. And doing a very good job of it, too. His fingers grazed her temple in deft, calming strokes. The relief of knowing the crisis had passed . . . it left her sapped and boneless. Weak.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d she mumbled, pressing her brow to his chest. \u201cBrandy, tea? Would it . . . would it help to talk?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer, and she worried she\u2019d offended his pride.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her crown. \u201cJust sleep.\u201d</p><p>So she did as he told her. She curled into his strength and let his slow, steady heartbeat lull her back to sleep.</p><p>When Minerva woke next, it was daylight.</p><p>And she was alone.</p><p>She sat bolt upright in bed. Weak sunlight filtered in through the room\u2019s single, grimy window. In the daylight, the room looked even shabbier than it had the night before.</p><p>After donning her spectacles, Minerva looked around. All of her things were still there. But she saw no sign of Colin. Not his boots, not his coat, not his gloves, not his cravat hanging over the chair back.</p><p>Her stomach lurched.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t have gone.</p><p>She scampered from bed and began searching the table, the chest of drawers. Surely, he would have left a note, at least. When she found none, she hurried to wash and dress as quickly as possible. Rationally, she knew he was probably just downstairs, but she\u2019d feel much better when she laid eyes on the man himself.</p><p>Fortunately, the moment Minerva descended to the breakfast room, Colin rose from his chair to welcome her. \u201cAh. There you are.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d bathed and shaved. She could see that his hair was still damp behind the ears. The worst of yesterday\u2019s travel dust had been brushed from his coat, and it made a respectable dark-blue contrast with the snowy white of his fresh shirt and cravat. Someone had blacked and polished his boots to a healthy shine.</p><p>He looked well. Truly well. Not just handsome, but vigorous and strong. After feeling him groan and tremble beside her last night, this came as profound relief. She\u2019d been so worried for him.</p><p>\u201cColin, I . . .\u201d Strangely overwhelmed, she put a hand to his lapel.</p><p>\u201cI do hope you slept well. We\u2019ve been waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked in surprise. \u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear sister,\u201d he said loudly, taking her hand in his. \u201cAllow me to introduce the Fontleys.\u201d</p><p>Dear sister? She gawped at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr. Fontley and Mrs. Fontley.\u201d</p><p>He turned her, with all the finesse of a clockwork gear turning a porcelain dancer in a music box. Minerva found herself curtseying to a kindly-looking couple. Silver frosted the gentleman\u2019s thinning hair, and his wife smiled from beneath a tidy lace cap.</p><p>\u201cThe Fontleys have offered you space in their carriage. They\u2019re traveling north as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m so pleased to make your acquaintance,\u201d Minerva said, with genuine feeling.</p><p>With a hand placed to the small of her back, Colin swiveled her to face the other side of the breakfast table. \u201cAnd here are their children. Mr. Gilbert Fontley and Miss Leticia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Gilbert, a young man just on the cusp of adulthood, rose from his seat and made a gallant bow.</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Lettie,\u201d the bright-eyed girl said, offering Minerva her hand. \u201cEveryone does.\u201d</p><p>Lettie possessed the same sandy hair and flushed complexion as the rest of her family. She looked just a few years younger than Charlotte. Twelve, perhaps thirteen.</p><p>Gilbert brought a chair for her, and Minerva sat.</p><p>Mrs. Fontley smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re so pleased to have you joining us, Miss Sand. It\u2019s our honor to escort you to your relations in York.\u201d</p><p>Miss Sand? Relations in York? She shot Colin a look full of questions.</p><p>The teasing rogue didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Mrs. Fontley stirred her tea. \u201cI think it\u2019s so beneficial for Gilbert and Lettie to make the acquaintance of young people like yourselves. Doing such good in the world. Gilbert has his eye on the Church, you see. He\u2019ll be at Cambridge this autumn.\u201d</p><p>Gilbert spoke up. \u201cMiss Sand, your brother has been telling us about your missionary efforts in Ceylon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, has he?\u201d With an air of utter incredulity, Minerva looked to the \u201cbrother\u201d in question. \u201cPray tell. What tales of our good deeds have you been relating, Colin?\u201d</p><p>She laid heavy emphasis on his name. His real Christian name. After all, if he were truly her brother, she ought to call him by it.</p><p>Now, let\u2019s see if he could remember hers. And use it, consistently.</p><p>She propped her chin on her hand and stared at him, smiling.</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cI\u2019ve just been telling all about our time in Ceylon, dear . . . M.\u201d</p><p>M. So this was how intended to solve his memory problem. Not by actually remembering her name, but by reducing her to an initial. Magnificent.</p><p>\u201cMiss Sand, he\u2019s been telling us all about your years of missionary work, ministering to the poor and unfortunate. Feeding the hungry, teaching little children to read and write.\u201d</p><p>Lettie\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cDid you really spend your schoolgirl years curing lepers?\u201d</p><p>Minerva set her teeth. She couldn\u2019t believe this. Of all the false identities to assume. Missionaries curing lepers in Ceylon? \u201cNot actually, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat my dear sister means\u201d\u2014Colin slid his arm around the back of Minerva\u2019s chair\u2014\u201dis that it wasn\u2019t all hard work, all the time. We were children, after all. Our dear parents, may God rest their souls, permitted us ample time to explore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplore?\u201d Gilbert perked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Ceylon\u2019s a beautiful place. All those lush jungles and mountains. We\u2019d leave our family hut early in the morning, me and M, with just a bit of bread in our pockets. Then we\u2019d spend our whole day out adventuring. Swinging from vines. Devouring mangoes straight from the trees. Riding elephants.\u201d</p><p>Minerva looked around at the Fontley family. She couldn\u2019t believe that anyone would believe this ridiculous story. Elephants and mangoes? But they all stared rapt at Colin, a mix of wonder and worship in their matching blue eyes.</p><p>Well, at least this was some balm to the sting she\u2019d incurred that night in the turret. She wasn\u2019t his only dupe. Clearly, he employed this talent for willful, wild exaggeration regularly. And with consistent success.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d wander the jungle all day long?\u201d Lettie asked. \u201cWeren\u2019t you afraid of being eaten by tigers? Or getting lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, never. I might have worried, if I were alone. But there were always the two of us, you see. And we had a little system. A game we played whenever we went out adventuring. If we lost sight of each other in the dense jungle undergrowth, I\u2019d just call out, \u2018Tallyho!\u2019 and M would call back . . .\u201d</p><p>Colin turned to her, eyebrows raised, as though waiting for her to put the final link on this epic chain of balderdash.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cracked,\u201d she said.</p><p>He slapped the table. \u201cExactly! I\u2019d call out, \u2018Tallyho!\u2019, and she\u2019d call back, \u2018You\u2019re cracked!,\u2019 blithe as anything. And that\u2019s how we\u2019d keep from being separated.\u201d</p><p>Each and every member of the Fontley family laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat a clever game,\u201d the beaming patriarch said.</p><p>\u201cNothing will ever separate us, will it, M?\u201d Colin reached for her hand and squeezed it, gazing fondly into her eyes. \u201cI think I\u2019ll never feel such kinship with another soul as I do with my dear sister.\u201d</p><p>Across the table, Mrs. Fontley sighed. \u201cSuch good young people.\u201d</p><p>As the footmen secured her trunks atop the Fontley carriage some time later, Minerva took the first possible opportunity to draw Colin aside.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed in his ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making them feel comfortable,\u201d he murmured in reply. \u201cThey\u2019d never allow you to travel with them if we told the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But must you make the stories so absurdly exaggerated? Curing lepers and riding elephants in Ceylon? How do you even come up with such things?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s called improvisation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are decent people. It\u2019s wicked to tell them such horrid lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re traveling under false pretenses. On the premise of a false engagement. Using false names. And this was all your idea. This is hardly the time for moral scruples, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised a hand. \u201cIf my entertaining the Fontleys with a few exaggerated tales counts as wicked, I suggest you learn to embrace wickedness. For at least the remainder of the week. Their offer of transport is a true boon. It will save a great deal of money and perhaps preserve your reputation, as well. You have a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>She knew it was true. \u201cThat\u2019s all very well. But now I\u2019m the one who must ride in a carriage with them for days, living out your absurd fictions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So why not have fun with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun?\u201d</p><p>He took her by the shoulders and waited for her to meet his gaze. Minerva did so, with no slight reluctance. It was impossible to think clearly when she looked into those brilliant hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cLive in the moment, M. This is your chance to crawl out of that shell. There\u2019s an interesting, confident girl in there somewhere. She comes out for a peek every now and then. Try being her, for just a few days. You won\u2019t progress very far on this journey otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Minerva bit her lip. She wanted to think there was an interesting, confident girl inside her, and that, at last, someone saw that girl clearly. But for all she knew, he was working the same trick he\u2019d played on the Fontleys. Puffing her up with false praises. Telling her just what she wanted to hear.</p><p>Lying to her. Again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a few harmless exaggerations.\u201d He walked her slowly toward the carriage. \u201cThink of it like running down a slope. If you attempt to slow down and choose your steps, you\u2019re bound to trip up and stumble. But if you simply let yourself run with the story, everything will come out fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Miss Sand?\u201d Mr. Fontley said. \u201cMrs. Fontley and the children are already inside.\u201d</p><p>Minerva nodded.</p><p>Colin handed her into the carriage. Once she\u2019d taken a seat beside Lettie and arranged her skirts, her \u201cbrother\u201d closed the coach door and popped his head through the open window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be riding nearby, M. Never fear. If you have any need of me whatsoever, you know what to do.\u201d He flashed a smile and called out, \u201cTallyho!\u201d</p><p>In unison, Lettie and Gilbert called back, \u201cYou\u2019re cracked!\u201d</p><p>With a little groan, Minerva buried her face in her hands.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been like this between me and M,\u201d Colin said. As they walked through a little wooded area, he pushed aside branches so she could pass. \u201cEver since we were in our cradles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Lettie asked. \u201cEven as babies?\u201d</p><p>Minerva rolled her eyes. How did he have the energy to keep manufacturing this poppycock? She was exhausted. By the time they\u2019d stopped for luncheon and a change of horses, she\u2019d been running down his figurative slope all morning, churning out one vague falsehood after another to satisfy the Fontleys\u2019 boundless curiosity. She\u2019d hoped to find some brief escape by declaring her intent to walk and stretch her legs.</p><p>But of course, Colin would decide to accompany her. And Lettie and Gilbert would jump to follow.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Colin continued, leading them all on the path. \u201cMy sister and I have always had this deep, unspoken connection. We have whole conversations without exchanging a word.\u201d</p> <p>He looked to her then. She held his gaze.</p><p>He was right. They could have a whole conversation without exchanging a word. And the conversation they had right now went like this:</p><p>Colin, shut it.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I will, M.</p><p>Then I\u2019ll make you.</p><p>Really? How?</p> <p>I\u2019m not certain, but it will be slow and painful. And I won\u2019t leave any evidence.</p><p>\u201cShe saved my life once,\u201d he told the young Fontleys.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Lettie asked. \u201cMiss Em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes indeed. She delivered me, single-handedly, from death\u2019s clutches. It\u2019s a grand story.\u201d</p><p>Striding through the ankle-high grasses, Minerva choked on a laugh. Oh, I\u2019m sure it is.</p><p>\u201cDo tell us. I\u2019m certain the tale does Miss Sand great credit.\u201d Gilbert looked to Minerva with admiration in his eyes. And quite possibly a glimmer of infatuation.</p><p>Oh dear. Of all the times for a young man to finally take a fancy to her.</p><p>\u201cWell, it all started deep in the jungle,\u201d Colin said. \u201cWhile we were out exploring one day, I was bitten by a rare, highly venomous beetle.\u201d</p> <p>Lettie\u2019s eyes sparked. \u201cAnd Miss Em cut open the wound and sucked out the venom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. She couldn\u2019t do that. The poison was too fast acting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she dragged you back home, to get help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d Colin shook his head. \u201cI was too heavy for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I left him dying and went home for dinner,\u201d Minerva said cheerfully. \u201cThe end.\u201d</p><p>Gilbert laughed. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. You ran for help, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Colin said.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the stream\u2019s edge. Colin propped one foot on a fallen log.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll wager,\u201d said Lettie, flouncing down next to his boot, \u201cthat she dashed like mad all the way home, and then made it back just in time. Bringing along some native doctor to cure you with his mystic chanting and powders.\u201d</p><p>Smiling at the girl\u2019s imagination, Colin shook his head. \u201cNo. Actually, by the time she returned with help, it was too late. She couldn\u2019t heal me. I had died.\u201d</p><p>Everyone went silent.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Lettie frowned. \u201cBut that can\u2019t be. Here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gilbert asked.</p><p>Yes, what happened? Minerva almost added herself. Even she was breathless to learn what came next, when he\u2019d lay dying in the jungle after a rare Ceylonese beetle bite.</p><p>Nothing happened, you ninny. It\u2019s all a lie.</p><p>Colin cleared his throat. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t tell you precisely what happened. Because I slumped unconscious on the jungle floor, and I don\u2019t remember anything after that. I\u2019d fallen into a deep coma, it seems. The signs of life were so faint, my own family believed I was dead. They prayed over me, prepared my body and put it in a wooden coffin. And the next thing I knew, I woke up underground. In the dark. Buried alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d Lettie cried, clinging to his boot. \u201cWhatever did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cried. I wailed. I clawed at the planks sealing me in until my fingernails were torn to bloody nubs. I despaired and trembled. I screamed until my throat was raw.\u201d His voice had taken on a strange quality. He looked up, searching Minerva\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnd somehow, she heard me. Didn\u2019t you, M? You heard me, calling through the darkness. I was alone and frightened. But in the dark of night, you heard the anguished cries of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Minerva swallowed back the lump rising in her throat. She didn\u2019t like this story anymore. She wasn\u2019t sure what Colin was playing at. Obviously this description of his boyhood self, trapped and screaming in the dark, was meant for her. It would seem he hadn\u2019t forgotten last night\u2019s episode. He remembered it. All of it. And now he wished to . . . what, precisely? Thank her for her help? Mock her for her concern?</p><p>He asked, \u201cDo you want to tell the next bit, M?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He turned to the children. \u201cShe came running out to the burial site, began digging through the dirt with her bare hands. When I heard those noises . . . well, I thought at first I\u2019d truly died, and the hounds of hell were scratching at my coffin.\u201d</p><p>Lettie squeaked and bit her knuckle.</p><p>\u201cTo this day, I have no fondness for dogs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, how sad.\u201d</p><p>In her memory, Minerva heard the echo of his savage cries. Get back, you bloody bitch.</p><p>\u201cI tried to call out, but couldn\u2019t. The air was growing more and more close, and I could scarcely take a breath. As the sounds drew nearer, I managed to suck just a gasp of air into my lungs. Enough to call out one word.\u201d He paused dramatically, then whispered, \u201cTallyho?\u201d</p><p>The children held their breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can guess what sweet magic I heard in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cracked,\u201d they replied in hushed unison.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Colin said. \u201cShe\u2019d saved me from the very clutches of death. My dear, daring sister.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met, and Minerva had to look away. She didn\u2019t know what to feel, but she felt . . . something. And she felt it deeply.</p><p>Gilbert turned to her. \u201cHow brave you were, Miss Sand.\u201d</p><p>She fluttered a hand. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too modest. Always was.\u201d Rising from the fallen log, Colin playfully chucked her under the chin before leading the way back to the road. \u201cJust wait until you hear about M and the cobra.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u201d\u2014Colin tapped his fork against his now-empty dinner plate\u2014\u201dis the story of the cobra.\u201d He sat back in his chair, feeling satisfied.</p><p>All the Fontleys turned their gaze from him and looked to Minerva, awed.</p><p>Minerva glared at him. \u201cI am not a snake charmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Snake charmers need a flute.\u201d He turned to the Fontleys. \u201cI tell you, she had the creature entranced with her sweet voice alone. It wouldn\u2019t leave her side after that day. The scaly thing slithered in her footsteps, all over Ceylon. We made a pet of it. Named it Sir Alisdair.\u201d</p><p>Under the table, something sharp jabbed him in the thigh. He covered his yelp of pain with a cough.</p><p>Colin knew he\u2019d pay for this later. But he couldn\u2019t resist provoking her. Never had been able to resist it, ever since they\u2019d first met. Today, of all days, he wanted to draw her out, push her beyond those boundaries she\u2019d erected.</p><p>He wanted to be surprised.</p><p>And more than that\u2014he wanted to keep the attention on her. Because if he gave her the chance to direct conversation, he knew she\u2019d steer it in an unpleasant direction. One that involved last night. He didn\u2019t want to discuss last night. In his own, circumspect way, he\u2019d told her all she needed to know. As much as he\u2019d ever told anyone.</p><p>\u201cMiss Sand,\u201d Gilbert Fontley said, \u201chow can we convince you to sing?\u201d</p><p>Shock flared in her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Fontley is quite the lover of music,\u201d their mother said, patting her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cAs am I. Miss Sand, we would be so pleased to hear you. Do oblige us, dear. There\u2019s a pianoforte, just there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d She swallowed hard and said weakly, \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly.\u201d</p><p>Colin watched her as she surveyed the inn\u2019s crowded dining room. In a village as small as this one, the inn\u2019s dining room also served as the village public house. There were probably above thirty souls in the room, equally divided between travelers passing the night and local men enjoying a pint with the fellows. A good crowd.</p><p>Young Miss Lettie joined the campaign. \u201cOh please, Miss Em. Do sing for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, M,\u201d Colin said jovially. \u201cJust one or two songs.\u201d</p><p>Minerva\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cBut brother, you know I gave up singing. After that horrific incident with the . . . millipede and the coconut and the . . . the stolen rubies.\u201d Before he could press for details, she jumped to add, \u201cWhich we have sworn a pact on our parents\u2019 graves to never, ever discuss.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Now she was catching the spirit. \u201cThat\u2019s true. But it\u2019s my birthday. And you always make an exception on my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, Sand?\u201d Mr. Fontley exclaimed over her. \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you say so? We should drink to your health.\u201d The older gentleman called the serving girl and ordered sherry for the table.</p><p>As glasses were passed around, Minerva said pointedly, \u201cBut brother, you never drink spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do on my birthday.\u201d He raised the glass in salute, then drank.</p><p>He heard her growl.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you sing, Miss Em?\u201d Lettie pleaded again. \u201cI so long for a bit of music. And it is Mr. Sand\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>Soon all the Fontleys joined in the encouragement.</p><p>She turned to him and said simply, \u201cColin.\u201d Her wide, dark eyes held a frantic plea for reprieve. Don\u2019t make me do this.</p><p>He felt a twinge of conscience, but he wouldn\u2019t intervene. He\u2019d come to recognize that look in her eyes. Her eyes always caught that wild, desperate spark just before she did something extraordinary.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll sing.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the sherry glass in front of her, drained it in a single swallow, and set it down with a decisive clink. Then she flattened both hands on the tabletop and pushed to her feet.</p><p>In slow, determined strides, she walked to the pianoforte. She removed her spectacles and held them folded in her hand. She pressed her finger down on a single piano key and, closing her eyes, hummed the pitch.</p><p>And then she opened her mouth and sang.</p><p>Well. She sang very, very well.</p><p>Surprise.</p><p>The crowded room went so quiet, so quickly, Colin could practically hear the jaws dropping. The song she\u2019d chosen was an old, familiar ballad. No fancy scales or operatic trills. Just a simple, straightforward melody that suited her clear, lyrical voice. It wasn\u2019t a song fit for a musicale, or even one of the Spindle Cove ladies\u2019 salons. But it was perfect for a small country inn. The sort of tune that didn\u2019t gavotte, didn\u2019t mince around. That didn\u2019t bother dazzling the ear or engaging the mind, but went straight for the guts.</p><p>And the heart.</p><p>Good Lord. It was a bloody fool thing to think\u2014let alone say\u2014but her song arrowed straight for his heart.</p><p>No way around it. Colin was charmed. As charmed as a Ceylonese cobra. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More than that, he was proud.</p><p>When the ballad\u2019s lovers met their inevitably tragic end, and the crowd broke into enthusiastic applause, Colin clapped along with the rest. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Though she wasn\u2019t, really. He had no right to claim her. To think that all this time\u2014every day that he\u2019d resided in Spindle Cove\u2014this had been inside her. This glorious, soul-stirring song. The courage to unleash it before a crowd of strangers. The sweetness to calm him in the night, when he clawed his way back from hell.</p> <p>How had he never seen any of this? How had he never known?</p><p>The Fontleys\u2014and everyone else\u2014shouted for another song. Minerva shook her head, demurring.</p><p>\u201cJust one more,\u201d Colin called to her, cupping his hands around his mouth. \u201cSing my favorite.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look of strained patience, but she relented.</p><p>Another key struck. Another quietly hummed pitch.</p> <p>Another moment of sheer revelation.</p><p>She\u2019d warmed to it now. The singing, the attention. Her voice gained strength and confidence. She sang with her eyes wide open, and she sang directly to him. Well, he\u2019d asked for that, hadn\u2019t he? And it was the best not-an-actual-birthday gift Colin had ever received. Those sultry, ripe lips held him in thrall. Every time she drew a quick breath between phrases, her breasts fairly jumped for his attention.</p><p>If her first song had touched his heart . . . well, this one stroked him a ways lower.</p><p>It occurred to Colin that he should probably take pains not to be caught slavering over his own \u201csister.\u201d But a glance around the place told him he wasn\u2019t the only male in the room so affected.</p><p>Gilbert Fontley, in particular, was very bad off.</p><p>Without taking his eyes from Minerva, the young man leaned toward Colin. \u201cMr. Sand, do you think it\u2019s possible to fall in love in the space of a single day?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I only fall in love at night. Never lasts beyond breakfast, though.\u201d</p><p>Gilbert sent him a confused look. \u201cB-but . . . But I thought you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have our demons, Gilbert.\u201d He clapped the young man on the shoulder and leaned close. \u201cA word of advice. Cleave to the bosom of the Church.\u201d</p><p>Minerva finished her ballad, and this time he could tell no amount of calling or applause would persuade her to sing again. Even as everyone in the room leaped to their feet, shouting encouragement, she replaced her spectacles and began to make her way back to the table.</p><p>Colin pushed back his chair, meaning to welcome her back with some words of sincere praise. But as she started across the room, a large, unshaven man holding a tankard lumbered into her path. He engaged her in some sort of conversation. Colin couldn\u2019t make out their words over the din, but he didn\u2019t need words to understand what was happening.</p><p>That disgusting lout wanted his girl.</p><p>And Minerva wanted nothing to do with the disgusting lout. The brute put a grimy paw on her arm, and she stumbled in her effort to pull away. Her spectacles went just slightly askew. That small detail\u2014that tiny evidence of her disquiet\u2014was enough to make Colin see twenty shades of red.</p><p>He punched to his feet, craving blood.</p> <p>\u201cSir, unhand me.\u201d Minerva tugged against the revolting brute\u2019s grip. His breath reeked of ale and garlic. His body reeked of . . . other things, better left unnamed.</p><p>\u201cJes\u2019 another song, love.\u201d He held her elbow with one hand and pawed at her waist with the other. \u201cCome sit on my lap, give me a private performance.\u201d</p><p>His hand brushed her bottom.</p><p>Minerva recoiled. She felt dirty. Other women might know how to deflect this kind of unwanted attention, but she didn\u2019t. This never happened to her.</p><p>Then she caught sight of Colin, cutting a path to her through the crowded room. His stride was almost easy, unconcerned. But as he drew close, she could view the tense set of his jaw and the cold fury in his eyes.</p><p>He nudged the drunken lout with his arm. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut is that your hand on my sister?\u201d</p><p>The burly man straightened and adopted an affected, aristocratic tone. \u201cI rather think it might be, guv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Colin clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cThis is my hand on you.\u201d</p><p>He drove a full-force punch straight into the lout\u2019s gut. Then followed it with a smashing blow to the face.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s hands flew to her own mouth, covering her startled cry.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t even reel or blink. He simply went down. Hard. Taking an entire table and the accompanying glassware with him. The sounds of breaking glass and splintering wood crashed through the room, drawing everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>Colin stood over the brute, shaking out his hand and breathing hard. The look on his face was one of barely restrained fury.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d he said, his voice like cold steel. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand to Minerva\u2019s elbow and, with a nod in the Fontleys\u2019 direction, ushered her from the room. As they left, the dining room erupted into chaos. She flinched at the sounds of chairs scraping across floors, and angry voices lifting.</p><p>She distinctly heard Mr. Fontley shout, \u201cHow dare you molest that young lady.\u201d</p><p>And then Gilbert\u2019s reedy tenor. \u201cYou\u2019ll burn in hell for that. She\u2019s a woman of God.\u201d</p><p>They both paused on the bottom riser of the stairs. And broke into simultaneous laughter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get upstairs,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked, stopping her in the upstairs corridor. His gaze scanned her from head to toe. \u201cHe didn\u2019t harm you in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, thank you.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He unlatched the door. \u201cBest birthday ever.\u201d</p><p>They tumbled through the entry of their suite, laughing. As Minerva went to light the lamp, Colin slung his weight into a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, \u201care unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now.\u201d He grinned up at her. \u201cAdmit it. That was fun.\u201d</p><p>She felt the corner of her mouth tip, despite her. \u201cI . . . I never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never do what? Sing ballads in a public house? Inspire tavern brawls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of it. I never do any of it. I never even do this.\u201d She reached for his hand, turning it over in the light. \u201cOh, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just a scratch.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps, but Minerva hurried to fetch the washbasin and soap. She needed something to do. Otherwise, this restless, coursing energy she felt would spill out in other ways. Dangerous ways.</p><p>Even as she gathered the materials, her hands trembled. The man was a devil. Mayhem personified. She never knew what wild tale he\u2019d spin or what ill-considered action he\u2019d take next. Over the course of their journey, he could put everything at risk\u2014her reputation, her safety, her scientific standing.</p><p>Perhaps even her heart.</p><p>But she had to admit . . . he did make things fun.</p><p>Returning to the table with a clean handkerchief, she examined his wound more closely. He was right, it was just a scratch along his knuckles. But he\u2019d incurred the injury defending her. Minerva wanted to kiss this brave, wounded hand. She settled for dabbing it with a moist cloth.</p><p>She touched his signet ring. \u201cI wager that man will be wearing your family crest on his cheek for weeks.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. \u201cGood. He deserved far worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how easily you laid him flat,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he was so big. Where did you learn to fight like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoxing club.\u201d He stretched his fingers and winced a bit. \u201cAll the London bucks are mad for boxing. Gentleman Jackson\u2019s and so forth. The better question is . . .\u201d His voice darkened. \u201cWhere did you learn to sing like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d She kept her head bowed, examining his wound.</p><p>\u201cLike . . . that. I\u2019ve been living in Spindle Cove more than half a year now, and I\u2019ve attended countless numbers of those wretched salons, not to mention all the informal soirees at the rooming house. Church on Sundays. I\u2019ve heard Diana sing many times. I\u2019ve heard Charlotte sing many times. For God\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve even heard your mother sing. But never you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, tearing off a strip of linen for a bandage. \u201cI\u2019m hardly an accomplished songstress. All I know are the ballads I learned as a girl. Once I grew old enough, I shirked my music lessons whenever possible. I hated the bother of practicing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t believe singing\u2019s a bother to you. And I won\u2019t believe you never practice either, as easily as the words came to you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Minerva felt herself blush. She did practice, when no one was about. Singing to herself when out on her rambles. But since singing to oneself looked about as odd as reading while walking, it wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d admit to him. \u201cI leave the singing to Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You don\u2019t want to outshine her.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAs if I could ever outshine Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana is rather shiny, I suppose. Golden hair, luminous skin. Sunny disposition. All things radiant. Perhaps you couldn\u2019t outshine her.\u201d He cocked his head and regarded her from a new angle. \u201cBut Min? You could outsing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sisters. Not competitors.\u201d</p><p>He made a dismissive noise. \u201cAll women are competitors, and sisters most of all. Ladies are perpetually jockeying for position, sizing themselves up against their peers. I can\u2019t tell you how often I\u2019m enjoined to comment on which lady is the prettiest, the wittiest, the most accomplished, the lightest on her feet. And who solicits these opinions? Always women, never men. Men could not care less. About those comparisons, at least.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him warily. \u201cWhat comparisons do men discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer that some other time. When I\u2019m not bleeding and at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>Minerva wrapped the bandage tight. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking of callow young ladies in society. We\u2019re speaking of Diana. I love my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to hide your one talent, just so she won\u2019t suffer by comparison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy one talent?\u201d She cinched the bandage, and he grimaced with pain. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly my one talent, or even my best talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Now I see how it is.\u201d He nursed his bandaged hand. \u201cYou\u2019re every bit as competitive as the rest of them. Only you\u2019re vying for a different title. That of least attractive, least congenial. The least marriageable.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. He\u2019d doubtless meant the words to tease her, but something in them rang rather true.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I am.\u201d She folded the surplus linen and replaced it in her trunk. \u201cI\u2019m committed to my studies, and I\u2019m not sure I ever want to be married at all. Not to the sort of man my mother would wish, anyhow. So yes, I\u2019ve always been content to let Diana be the prettiest, the most elegant, the kindest. The best singer. She\u2019s welcome to have all the suitors.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. \u201cExcept me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a special case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And he really shouldn\u2019t look at her that way. So intensely. Searchingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you marry long ago?\u201d she blurted out. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to sleep alone, marriage would seem the logical solution. You\u2019d have a wife beside you every night.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDo you know how many husbands and wives actually sleep in the same bed after the honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome marriages are affectionless arrangements, I\u2019m sure. But more than a few are love matches. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d have trouble getting women to fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I married, I should have to keep a woman in love with me. Not just any woman, but one particular woman. For years. And what\u2019s more, I should have to stay in love with her. If by chance I met the woman I wanted to try this with\u2014and I haven\u2019t yet, after years of sampling widely\u2014how could I ever be certain of achieving that? You\u2019re the scientist. You tell me. How can love be proved?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Minerva shrugged. \u201cI suppose it must be tested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you have it. I always fail tests.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a pitying look. \u201cYes, of course. We both know that\u2019s why you never earned high marks in maths. It had nothing to do with a lack of effort. You simply couldn\u2019t pass the tests.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer. Just leaned back in his chair, propped his hands behind his head, and regarded her with an inscrutable expression. Whether his was a gaze of annoyance, admiration, appreciation, or anger, she could not have guessed.</p><p>With a sigh, she rose from the table. \u201cWe might as well sleep.\u201d</p><p>The suite had two connecting bedchambers\u2013to keep up appearances for the Fontleys. But they both knew they\u2019d only use this one. She crossed the room and began unbuttoning her spencer. She felt his eyes on her as she shook the garment from her shoulders, pulled her arms free, and set it aside. Didn\u2019t he have manners enough to look away? Her body warmed under his appraisal, growing light and hot as a cinder swirling through the smoky air.</p><p>She turned away from him and reached to loosen the hooks down the back of her gown.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d he said, suddenly behind her.</p> <p>She froze for a moment, seized by the instinct to shrug away. But this dress had stubborn fastenings. She would appreciate a little help.</p><p>\u201cJust the hooks,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Brushing some loose strands of hair aside, he began at the base of her neck. He loosed the hooks slowly, one by one. She crossed her arms over her chest, holding the gown in place as her neckline began to gape.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d His voice was a gentle murmur, sliding over her neck.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Barbara Allen.\u2019 How did you know it\u2019s my favorite ballad?\u201d The husky intimacy in his voice undid her.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it everyone\u2019s favorite?\u201d</p><p>His soft laugh in response was warm, authentic. \u201cDid we just find something in common?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have all kinds of things in common,\u201d she said, feeling the familiar stupidity descend. Here it came, the inane babble. \u201cWe\u2019re both humans. We both speak English. We both understand what a logarithm is. We both have brown hair, two eyes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both have skin.\u201d His fingertips grazed her exposed shoulder, and sensation rippled down her arm. \u201cWe both have hands. And lips.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. She held her breath for a long moment, before realizing she\u2019d braced herself for a kiss that wasn\u2019t coming. She cursed him, cursed herself. She needed to put all thoughts of his kiss out of her mind. It was just\u2014she couldn\u2019t stop picturing the way he\u2019d stared at her while she was singing downstairs. The way he\u2019d moved toward her, scything his way through the crowd.</p><p>The way he\u2019d laid that man flat, and bled for her.</p><p>She cleared her throat and stepped forward, still facing the wall. \u201cThank you for your assistance. Will you turn, please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve turned.\u201d The floorboards gave a weary creak of confirmation.</p><p>Minerva swiveled her head, stealing a glance in the mirror to make sure. She almost wished she would find him stealing glances at her, too. But evidently he\u2019d seen enough last night. He remained with his back to her as she drew her gown down over her hips and stepped out.</p><p>Once she\u2019d stripped down to her shift, she dove under the bed linens and turned her face to the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s safe now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe.\u201d He made a wry, disbelieving noise. \u201cFor whom?\u201d</p><p>She tried to feign sleep as he moved about the room, removing his boots, casting watch and cufflinks aside. Stirring the fire. Making all sorts of unapologetic, manly sounds. Men never hesitated to declare their presence. They were permitted to live aloud, in reverberating thuds and clunks, while ladies were always schooled to abide in hushed whispers.</p><p>The bed creaked loudly as he dropped his weight next to her. His arm brushed against her back. Just that slight contact set her whole body humming. As he settled into the bed, she was so aware\u2014so clearly, perfectly aware\u2014of every part of him. Every part of her. Everywhere their bodies touched, and everywhere they didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWill you be able to sleep?\u201d she asked, after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to talk?\u201d she asked the wall. She felt like a coward, unable to turn and face him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather listen to you. Why don\u2019t you tell me a bedtime story? One you read as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t read any stories as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that. You always have your nose in a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhen I was a girl, it took them ages to realize my farsightedness. Everyone thought I was just mischievous at best or dull witted, at worst. My mother chided me for frowning, for daydreaming. Diana would always be reading tales from her storybooks, but no matter how she tried to teach me, I couldn\u2019t make sense of the letters. We had a nursemaid who sang ballads as she went about her work. I used to follow her everywhere and listen, memorizing as many as I could. They were my stories.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cEventually, a governess realized I needed spectacles. When I first put them on my face, I can\u2019t even tell you . . . it was like a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally seeing properly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing I wasn\u2019t hopeless.\u201d A knot formed in her throat. \u201cI\u2019d believed there was something incurably wrong with me, you see. But suddenly, I could see the world clear. And not only the parts in the distance, but the bits within my own reach. I could focus on a page. I could explore the things around me, discover whole worlds beneath my fingertips. I could be good at something, for once.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he could understand, but this was why the symposium was so important to her. Why Francine meant everything. This was why, a few mornings ago, she\u2019d opened up the trunk that held her trousseau and swapped out those bridal fantasies for new, scientific goals. Minerva had never been the daughter her mother would have wished. She was different from her sisters, and she was reconciled to the fact. She could live with being a hopeless excuse for a fashionable, elegant lady . . . so long as someone, somewhere, respected and admired her just for being her. Minerva Highwood, geologist and bookworm and . . . and after tonight, sometime troubadour.</p><p>\u201cOnce I learned to read,\u201d she said, \u201cthey couldn\u2019t tear me away from books\u2014still can\u2019t. But I\u2019d already outgrown the fairy tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, sounding drowsy. \u201cThat was a fine bedtime story. Downtrodden girl. Kindly nursemaid. Happy ending. The fairy tales are pretty much all like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I was under the impression most of them feature a handsome, charming prince.\u201d</p><p>The silence was prolonged. And miserable.</p><p>\u201cWell, yours does have a knight,\u201d he finally said. \u201cSir Alisdair the Colleague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Hoping her voice didn\u2019t betray any disappointment, she curled her fingers in the bed linens, drawing them close.</p><p>His weight shifted beside her. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been wondering something. If that diary that so rhapsodically extolled my charms was the false one . . . what on earth did the real one say?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Kate Taylor cringed into her water goblet. This just didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>Across the dining table in the Queen\u2019s Ruby, Charlotte flipped through a small leather-bound book. \u201cThis and that . . . something more about rocks . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep looking,\u201d Mrs. Highwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s Minerva\u2019s only diary. She must have mentioned him somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Nichols, the rooming house\u2019s aging proprietress, directed the servants to serve dessert. As an apron-clad serving girl placed dishes of syllabub before each plate, Kate exchanged glances with Diana. She knew they had to be sharing the same mix of curiosity and mortification.</p><p>Naturally the elopement had been the talk of Spindle Cove, and Kate was as eager as anyone to learn the particulars of Minerva\u2019s unlikely romance. But reading her diary aloud at the dinner table? It did seem rather tasteless.</p><p>\u201cReally, Mama,\u201d Diana put in. \u201cIs it necessary to read Minerva\u2019s journal? Aloud? Shouldn\u2019t she be allowed some privacy?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood considered. \u201cOrdinarily, I would never snoop. Would I, Mrs. Nichols?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Nichols shook her head. \u201cNever, Mrs. Highwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in this case, the circumstances justify some investigation. Don\u2019t they, Mrs. Nichols?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mrs. Highwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Corporal Thorne keeps insisting he should chase after them, or at the least, alert Lord Rycliff. He seems to be under the mistaken assumption that Lord Payne is up to some sort of devilry. But I would never believe that of him. Would you, Mrs. Nichols?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not, Mrs. Highwood. He\u2019s an excellent young man. Always praises my pies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, here. Here\u2019s something about a grand discovery,\u201d Charlotte announced, opening the journal wide to a middle page.</p><p>Everyone at the table perked.</p><p>Charlotte scanned a bit further. \u201cNever mind. It\u2019s about lizards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizards!\u201d With a groan, Mrs. Highwood pushed away her serving of syllabub. \u201cI don\u2019t know how in the world she managed to snag him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t snag him, Mama. I keep telling you, she\u2019s been snagged.\u201d Charlotte flipped another page. \u201cIf she liked him, wouldn\u2019t she have confessed it to her own diary? I know I\u2019d fill whole books with poetry if a man so handsome as Lord Payne took a fancy to me.\u201d</p><p>Kate accepted a slender glass of cordial from a serving tray. \u201cPerhaps Minerva just isn\u2019t given to poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she ought to say something favorable, at least. See, look. She only just mentions him here, halfway through. And clever as she\u2019s supposed to be, she can\u2019t even spell his name. P-A-I-N, she has it.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled down at her lap. Somehow, she doubted Minerva had written it that way by mistake.</p><p>\u201cNever mind about the spelling, child,\u201d Mrs. Highwood urged. \u201cJust read it. What does she say?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sipped her lemonade in preparation. \u201c \u2018As today was Thursday, we were made to suffer Lord Payne\u2019s presence at dinner. I don\u2019t know whether to attribute my acute indigestion to his presence, Mother\u2019s fawning, or Mrs. Nichols\u2019s eel pie. It was a most disagreeable evening, all around.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that dated last summer?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cLast week.\u201d</p><p>Kate knew this would be the moment to defend poor Mrs. Nichols\u2019s eel pie. But really, the stuff was indefensible. By mutual, silent agreement, everyone took a spoonful of syllabub instead.</p><p>Then a sip of cordial.</p><p>Then syllabub again.</p><p>\u201cWell, there must be more.\u201d Mrs. Highwood waved her spoon at Charlotte. \u201cRead on, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am reading on.\u201d Charlotte flipped through the remainder of the diary pages. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much else to read. It\u2019s all rocks and shells and lizard prints. The only man she mentions regularly is some scientist. Sir Alisdair Kent. She seems to admire him a great deal. When she spares a word for Lord Payne, it\u2019s never kind.\u201d She snapped the journal closed. \u201cI told you she doesn\u2019t love him, Mama. She\u2019s been taken against her will. You must allow Corporal Thorne to find them.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood reached across the table. \u201cGive it here, child.\u201d</p><p>She took the journal from Charlotte, flipped it open to the last written page, held it at arm\u2019s length, and peered at it. Her frown of concentration quickly melted to an expression of delight.</p><p>\u201cAha. Here we are. An entry dated just three nights past. \u2018Distressing news at All Things. It\u2019s rumored that Payne will propose to D. The vile, deceitful man. After all he promised me last summer. I cannot allow it.\u2019 And then, a few days later is her last entry. The day after the dancing, my dears.\u201d Mrs. Highwood arched a brow. \u201c \u2018Payne now convinced. Plan sealed with kiss. We leave on the morrow.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She flung the book to the table, rattling the crystal. \u201cThere you have it, Diana. Your sister is a scheming, cunning temptress. She stole Lord Payne from right under your nose, and she\u2019s been plotting it since last summer. From the very first. Imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was never mine to steal.\u201d Diana blushed. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not how it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Kate said, trying to wrap her mind around the idea of Minerva Highwood as a shameless seductress\u2014and failing utterly. \u201cBut I think we can safely conclude that wherever Minerva went with Lord Payne, she went of her own accord. She certainly wasn\u2019t abducted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevious thing.\u201d Mrs. Highwood spooned a large bite of syllabub into her mouth. \u201cWhen did this happen? She never showed any interest in men. I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed Minerva knew a kiss from a carbuncle. And now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Charlotte breathed, suddenly freezing in place and staring rapt at her spoon. \u201cNow. Just imagine where she must be now.\u201d</p><p>Kate choked on a laugh.</p><p>Diana squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cCharlotte, please. Let\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>For the second time in as many nights, Minerva woke to tortured groans.</p><p>This time, they weren\u2019t Colin\u2019s.</p><p>When she jolted awake, she found him sleeping peacefully at her side. Through the wall, however, horrid noises reached her ears. Violent thumping and desperate cries.</p><p>\u201cColin. Colin!\u201d She shook his arm. \u201cWake up. Someone\u2019s being murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d He sat bolt upright in bed, and his head bashed against the sloping rafter. \u201cBesides me, you mean?\u201d</p><p>She laid a touch to his arm and gave a meaningful tilt of her head. \u201cListen.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>The sickening sounds of violence continued. She heard a woman\u2019s shriek.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prodded, growing frantic. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you dress, and quickly? Ring for the innkeeper, at least? We must do something.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and rubbed his face. \u201cThat is not murder you\u2019re hearing. No one\u2019s dying. Except in the French way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What can you mean, \u2018the French way\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopulation,\u201d he said, flopping back on the bed and flinging his wrist over his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re not fighting, whoever they are. They\u2019re having a grand time indeed.\u201d Under his breath, he added, \u201cCurse them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it always so loud?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly when it\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood?\u201d Minerva frowned, listening. Nothing about that sounded good. The poor woman was even crying out to God.</p><p>\u201cHow is it you\u2019re so curious and educated, and yet so na\u00efve? You do understand copulation, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. The science of it, anyhow.\u201d A shriek pierced through the wall. She clutched his arm. \u201cColin, are you sure . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He covered his face with a pillow and groaned into it. \u201cAnd here I thought bedding down alone would be the keener torture.\u201d</p><p>The rhythmic banging grew louder, faster. A low, masculine bellow joined the woman\u2019s shrieks.</p><p>And then it stopped.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Colin said, propping the pillow back under his head. \u201cThey\u2019re finished. Now it\u2019s over, and we can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. Deuce it. My body\u2019s too suggestible.\u201d He rolled to face her, and his fingertips caught the edge of her sleeve. \u201cPerhaps yours is the same? Are you aroused?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to make of her body\u2019s warm flush. Nor the way his thumb caressed her arm.</p><p>She said, \u201cI mainly feel confused.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cI won\u2019t believe you\u2019re that innocent.\u201d His hand swept down the side of her body. \u201cYou do understand there\u2019s pleasure in the act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gathered as much, yes. But if that\u2019s the case, why doesn\u2019t it sound more pleasant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the act of love is not civilized. It\u2019s nature at its purest, most basic form. Primal and wild. You ought to understand a little, if you\u2019ve ever . . .\u201d She could all but hear his eyebrows shooting up. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t. You, the woman of science, who can recite the logarithm that defines the precise shape of an ammonite\u2019s shell. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t understand the workings of your own body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201d Her breath grew shaky.</p><p>\u201cSurely it can\u2019t be,\u201d he said, his hand stealing over her thigh, \u201cthat this intrepid explorer of underwater caverns hasn\u2019t explored her own little cove?\u201d</p><p>Through the bedsheet, he touched her. There. Between the legs. White sensation arced through the darkness. A tiny gasp escaped her, but she quickly sealed her lips.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her heart drummed in her chest.</p><p>\u201cHm. I think you do understand pleasure.\u201d His touch moved in a devious circle. \u201cBut only the hushed, secret kind. You\u2019ve always been surrounded, haven\u2019t you? By sisters, servants. Did you stroke yourself this way? Clamping that jaw tight, turning your head to the pillow to be very, very quiet?\u201d</p><p>His fingertips made gentle sweeps, feathering over her intimate places in strokes so light they might have been excused as incidental, unintentional. But she knew better, and her body did, too. Her nipples drew to tight puckers, and dampness gathered between her thighs.</p><p>The forbidden, unexpected nature of his touch was almost more arousing than the physical contact.</p><p>A man was touching her, there.</p><p>Colin was touching her, there.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. She could not be allowing this to happen.</p><p>But it was happening, and she was allowing it, and\u2014sweet heaven, it was marvelous. Through the layers of her shift and the bed linens, he drew a single fingertip up her inner thigh, and her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. If I\u2019m wrong, don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m enjoying this idea far too much. The little scientist, conducting quiet surveys beneath her night rail. Or in the bath, perhaps. Curious fingers wandering, exploring. Chasing that pleasure \u2019round and \u2019round as it builds . . . and builds.\u201d His voice was dark, decadent. \u201cUntil the crisis shudders through you in perfect, devastating silence.\u201d</p><p>He gently cupped her mons and groaned a little. \u201cBy God, Min. A man\u2019s erotic imagination is powerful indeed. But I think that is the single most arousing image I\u2019ve ever entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . but you\u2019re wrong. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cMostly?\u201d</p><p>Good heavens, what had possessed her to add that word? This entire discussion was too mortifying to be believed. Had she conducted her own explorations? Yes. Had those furtive moments ever amounted to a shadow of the exhilaration she felt right now, with him? God, no.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt anything like this. Evidently, she was both a naughty girl and a poor scientist. A failure, all around.</p><p>\u201cI think we need another lesson, Min.\u201d</p><p>His words sent a thrill racing through her. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stroked his hand up to her belly. \u201cYes, you need to understand this. The wildness of it. How good it can be, when it\u2019s raw and lusty and loud.\u201d He flipped his hand, tracing the backs of his fingers just under the curve of her breast. \u201cYou need to know what you deserve from a man. Or you\u2019ll end up in some passionless marriage. Tethered to an ancient, dusty geologist whose ideas might inspire your admiration, but whose touch will never, ever make you writhe and moan and scream.\u201d</p><p>His touch slowed, then drew to a halt on her breastbone.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your body. With your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He said it so baldly. She didn\u2019t know how to respond. She\u2019d already trusted him with her safety and her possessions. She might even trust him with her virtue. But she knew she could never trust this man with her heart. And didn\u2019t that organ come part and parcel with her body?</p><p>But she wanted, needed his touch so badly. Her lips and tongue were clumsy with desire. She couldn\u2019t make herself say no.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cClose your eyes, and think of him.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cThink of whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf him, whoever he is. Sir Alisdair Kent. Or the fairy-tale prince. You must dream of someone. All young ladies do.\u201d</p><p>She supposed they did. All girls had a dream suitor, and Minerva was no different.</p><p>But most of them never had this chance, to lie next to him in the flesh. This was happening to her. Because\u2014though she tried not to indulge in fanciful dreams\u2014when she did give in and imagine herself feeling safe and adored in the arms of a handsome, charming, unattainable man . . .</p><p>That man looked a great deal like Colin.</p><p>She hated admitting it, even to herself. And the idea that he might suspect . . . that was too miserable to contemplate.</p><p>She felt the bed shifting. And then she felt his weight settle atop her. An entire man\u2019s worth of heat and muscle stretched over her body, with only a linen bedsheet to separate them.</p><p>She tensed. Everywhere.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he murmured, gently but insistently spreading her legs to accommodate the breadth of his hips. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I won\u2019t hurt you. I won\u2019t lift this sheet. You\u2019re safe beneath it. Just keep your eyes closed and your lips parted. And learn how this should feel.\u201d</p><p>Learn how this should feel. Shouldn\u2019t this feel tender and romantic?</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t lovemaking feel like love?</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t love. It was a diversion, a lesson. Just another elaborate pretense.</p><p>Her body\u2019s reaction, however, was real. Her limbs were restless beneath his. She was breathing so hard, she grew dizzy and faint.</p><p>He cupped her breast through the linen, circling his touch around its widest circumference before spiraling inward, toward the rapidly hardening peak.</p><p>\u201cA good lover,\u201d he murmured, planting hot kisses just beneath her ear, \u201cwill take time for you. He will always put your pleasure before his own. He will make you free to experience, free to touch. Free to ask for whatever it is your body craves.\u201d</p><p>His touch grazed her nipple. Just lightly, like the pass of a feather. The sensation was startling, exquisite.</p><p>\u201cDid you like that?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you want more?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, and yes, please.</p><p>\u201cThen you must tell me so. Not in words, if you don\u2019t wish. When you\u2019re caught up in lovemaking, words can\u2014and should\u2014fail you. But a man does perform best with encouragement. So if you wish for more, you must tell me so. With a gasp, or a sigh, or a little moan of pleasure. Let\u2019s try again, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Once again, his fingertip teased over her taut, aching nipple. Gone, almost before she could register the sensation.</p><p>And then nothing.</p><p>She bit her lip. She knew he was waiting on her response. Horrid, teasing man. He would drive her to the brink of trembling, molten pleasure, and then abandon her there. Unless she begged for more.</p><p>Minerva lay still and silent for what seemed an age, doing battle with herself. Struggling between the desire to take just a little more, and the fear of surrendering far too much.</p><p>Raw need and curiosity carried the day.</p><p>Her lips parted, and she released her breath as a slow, almost musical sigh.</p><p>He answered with a deep, resonant groan. \u201cYes. That\u2019s the way. Sigh for me again.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his thumb to her nipple and rolled it, teasing around and around the puckered nub. She sighed again, with more feeling this time, and he rewarded her with a light pinch. She arched into his touch, and her head rolled to the side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d He tweaked her nipple. \u201cAnswer.\u201d</p><p>A low moan eased from her throat. He was right. Giving voice to the pleasure made it that much sweeter, sharper. Real.</p><p>\u201cYes. God, yes. This is how to drive a man wild, pet.\u201d His hand shaped and molded her breast as he trailed kisses over her elongated throat, sipping and licking at her skin. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve made you sigh, all I can think is how to make you moan. Then whimper. Then cry out in helpless ecstasy.\u201d</p> <p>He shifted over her, redistributing his weight. He was so hard all over, pressing against her soft flesh. His muscled chest flattened her breasts. His knee wedged her thighs apart. And then that hard, eagerly thrusting organ she\u2019d brazenly observed and admired last night . . . he pressed it against her sex.</p><p>Pleasure rocketed through her. Intense. Consuming. Like nothing she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>She moaned, deep and lustily. Because she wanted more. More of his hardness, his heat. More of this enticing friction rubbing her through that cool, smooth linen.</p><p>He gave her just what she craved. He set a rhythm, slow and steady, rocking against her as he kissed her throat and nuzzled her linen-sheathed breasts.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he prompted, sucking her earlobe into his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me with your hands now. Hold fast to me. Move with me.\u201d</p><p>She clung to him, shameless, sliding her hands around his shoulders. Her arousal only climbed as she felt the flex and strain of his muscles beneath her palms. He was laboring so hard, and for her. All for her. She loved feeling the strength in his body as he moved over her, rubbed against her. Again and again and again.</p><p>Soon, he had her moaning with every delicious stroke. The louder she called to him, the more resounding his response. The mattress joined the erotic symphony, creaking in time with his strong, rhythmic thrusts. He quickened his tempo, and the bedpost added thumping percussion as it knocked against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Min. This is how it should be.\u201d Raw need edged his voice. \u201cNever settle for less. Be fearless. Wild and loud and lovely. God, you\u2019re so lovely.\u201d</p><p>It was dark, and she knew he could scarcely see her. But it didn\u2019t matter. She felt lovely. Beneath her touch, his fevered skin slid hot and beautiful. Together, they\u2019d made this stunning, gorgeous pleasure.</p><p>She chased the sensation, tilting her hips and riding his thrusts as they came faster, stronger.</p><p>Then something changed. Suddenly, the pleasure was chasing her. Hunting her down with ruthless intensity. She couldn\u2019t hide from it, couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>Her eyes flew open, wide and unfocused in the shadowy dark. \u201cColin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stroked on, relentless. \u201cYes, call my name. Louder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin, I\u2014\u201d Her voice caught on a fearful gasp. \u201cI can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight it. All\u2019s as it should be. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d As he surged on and on, his brow dropped to her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Here it came, the pleasure. Swirling, taunting. Pulling at her from the inside. Dragging her into some dark, strange place. She grasped him tighter, pressing her nails into the flesh of his shoulder.</p><p>Don\u2019t let me go.</p><p>He kissed her cheek, her lips. \u201cCome for me, darling. Come for yourself.\u201d</p><p>At last, she surrendered to it. She heard herself cry out as the bliss finally caught her, lifted her. Pulled her to fragments. Wrung her limp. Left her gasping for breath and changed inside.</p><p>And still he moved on, pumping his hips at a tortured, frantic pace. He framed her face in his hands, then drove his fingers back to twist in her hair. The delicious pull sent pleasure rushing through her again.</p><p>He held her still and tight, grinding his hardness against her. \u201cSorry,\u201d he groaned. \u201cToo good. Can\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>With a growl, he shuddered and jerked in her embrace. Then slumped heavy atop her, panting into the curve of her neck.</p><p>Her fingers relaxed their grip on his shoulders. Her hands trembled. She didn\u2019t know how to touch him. A bead of sweat trickled along her collarbone. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was hers or his.</p><p>What did this all mean? It wasn\u2019t really copulation, much less lovemaking. But it was real in some way. She didn\u2019t know how to think of him now. Much less how to look at him, speak to him in the morning. How did she think of herself, after she\u2019d moaned and sighed his name? Was she ruined? Was she a wanton?</p><p>He rolled to the side, one hand still tangled in her hair. His chest rose and fell with a heavy sigh. \u201cGood Lord, woman.\u201d</p><p>Woman. She was a woman.</p><p>\u201cYou are forever catching me by surprise. I begin as your tutor, teaching the lesson. And then somehow . . . minutes later, I\u2019m spilling like a schoolboy.\u201d He gave a husky, intimate chuckle.</p><p>And what seemed like seconds after that, he was snoring.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Wincing at the too-bright morning, Colin speared a hand through his hair. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened. I never do this. Never.\u201d</p><p>Minerva rolled over sleepily, rubbing her eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet dressed, and quickly. We\u2019ve overslept.\u201d</p><p>Thus began a mad, mutual dash to wash and dress and pack up all their things. The haste was convenient, in some ways. It postponed any discussion of last night.</p><p>It did not, however, erase his memories. Her every sound, every motion aroused him. The way she tugged her hairbrush through that love-tangled jumble of dark curls. The way her breasts jounced as she hopped on one foot, struggling to jam the other into her half-boot. When she reached out and clutched his shoulder to balance, Colin thought he might unman himself yet again. He hadn\u2019t been exaggerating last night. She made him randy as a youth, and twice as stupid.</p><p>Damn it, man. What were you thinking? You have rules about this.</p><p>Yes, he conceded. But he hadn\u2019t broken those rules. He\u2019d merely stretched them.</p><p>Stretched them. Stroked them. Humped them. Made them moan and sob.</p><p>He shook himself. Bloody hell. And here he had another long, dusty day of riding horseback facing him. Excellent. At least he wouldn\u2019t need to schedule additional time for guilt and regret.</p><p>Hopefully the grooms downstairs had already selected a horse and readied it with his tack and saddle. As travel went, renting a posting horse every twenty miles wasn\u2019t ideal. It wasn\u2019t doing his arse any favors, either. But to keep up with a coach\u2019s pace, Colin really had no alternative.</p><p>She drew aside the curtains and peeked out the window. \u201cOh, I see the Fontleys. They\u2019re getting in the carriage already. Surely they wouldn\u2019t leave without us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not.\u201d He joined her at the window. The Fontleys were, indeed, almost ready to depart. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that to you. Today\u2019s your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d She cast him a chastening look through askew spectacles. Then self-consciousness flickered across her face, as if she\u2019d felt some echo of the night before. She blushed, swallowed, and looked away.</p><p>He had the sudden, inexplicable urge to kiss her. But that would almost certainly be a bad idea, and anyway\u2014there wasn\u2019t time. They hurried down the stairs with a thunder of footfalls, struggling with the trunks as they came.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Colin called, hurrying ahead of Minerva. \u201cWe\u2019re coming! Tallyho!\u201d</p><p>One of the Fontleys\u2019 footmen stood perched on the back of the coach. Colin heaved the smallest trunk up to him, for storage. Then the second.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget this one,\u201d Minerva called, dragging the third trunk behind her. The one that held Francine.</p><p>As Colin turned to help her with it, he heard the crack of a driver\u2019s whip. Before he even understood what was happening, the coach had rolled into motion.</p><p>The Fontleys were driving away. Without them.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Minerva called. \u201cCome back!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fontley\u2019s head poked out the window. \u201cAnd subject my children to such reprehensible characters? I will not.\u201d As the coach trundled away at a clip, they heard her shouting, \u201cYou are not good people!\u201d</p><p>Minerva turned to him, stunned and breathless. \u201cWhat can she mean? Surely it wasn\u2019t the fact that you punched that man last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be. I can\u2019t think what we did to change their opinion, unless . . .\u201d His stomach rolled.</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they somehow heard us. Last night.\u201d</p><p>She paled. \u201cOh, sweet heaven.\u201d Her lip folded under her teeth. \u201cBut how could they have . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they couldn\u2019t have, unless they were right next door. Unless . . .\u201d Her gaze met his, wide and horrified. \u201cUnless they were the ones we heard.\u201d</p><p>Colin blew out a slow breath. He turned his head and stared after the coach. \u201cWell. Good for them. Well done, Mr. Fontley.\u201d</p><p>Minerva didn\u2019t share his amusement.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d She sat down on her one remaining trunk and dropped her head in her hands. \u201cThey must think us scheming charlatans. They know every word we said was false. Ceylon, the lepers, the stupid beetle bite. They know we\u2019re liars.\u201d</p><p>He ducked his head and scratched the back of his neck. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that\u2019s what they concluded.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cWhat else would they think? That we weren\u2019t lying? That we really are brother and\u2014\u201d He watched the look of abject revulsion creep across her face. \u201cNo. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said hastily. \u201cI\u2019m sure they concluded the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d She shuddered violently. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, pet. We know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we?\u201d</p><p>He felt the barb in her remark. Neither of them knew exactly what they were to each other, after last night.</p><p>But that conversation would need to wait. For the first time, Colin noticed how many people around the area were watching them. The look in their eyes wasn\u2019t friendly. As he turned casually to face the inn, the door slammed. He heard a latch scrape shut.</p><p>Renting a fresh horse was apparently out of the question. And he didn\u2019t suppose any of these villagers would be offering them a ride.</p><p>\u201cI should have known it was a bad idea,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI should have known I\u2019d pay for it somehow. Whenever you touch me, I end up humiliated.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and drew near to Minerva. \u201cWe\u2019d best leave this place. As soon as possible. Whatever the Fontleys concluded about us, it seems they shared those conclusions with everyone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where will we go? How will get there?\u201d She gestured after the long-gone carriage. Despair weakened her voice. \u201cThey took all my clothes, all my things.\u201d</p><p>He crouched before her. \u201cYou still have your purse?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still have Francine. You\u2019re sitting on her.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cMy scientific findings are in this one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen those are the most important things. Everything else is replaceable. We\u2019ll just walk to the next town up the road, and from there we\u2019ll start anew. All right?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He helped her to her feet, then stared at her trunk, considering how best to carry the thing. On his shoulder?</p><p>She clutched one handle with her gloved hand and lifted. \u201cI\u2019ll take this side, and you take the other. It will be faster this way.\u201d</p><p>His sense of chivalry rebelled, but she was right. Carrying the thing between them was really the best way.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d he said, as they walked down the road that led out of town, carrying a giant lizard\u2019s footprint. \u201cLet\u2019s have a smile. We\u2019ll be back underway in no time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took hours.</p><p>The next town couldn\u2019t be far, Minerva had reasoned. A few miles at most. But Francine hampered their progress. They kept stopping to rest, to change sides, to readjust the weight. And though Minerva kept telling herself the low shadow of cottages and a church would surely appear over the next rise, or just around the next bend in the road . . .</p><p>They walked for hours. Nothing.</p> <p>Coaches and carriages passed them regularly. But either they were full to capacity or they\u2019d been warned in the previous town to avoid a pair of charlatans walking north. Even if one of the coaches had slowed, it wouldn\u2019t have helped. Colin wouldn\u2019t ride in one. No, they had to walk for miles, hoping to find some village where she could find space in a carriage and he could rent a fresh horse. Who knew how far that would be?</p><p>The sun was high overhead, and she was growing faint. They\u2019d never even eaten breakfast. Fatigue and hunger conspired within her, whispering to each other in irritable voices. Thirst thickened her tongue.</p><p>She drew to an abrupt halt by the side of the road. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I won\u2019t go any farther.\u201d</p><p>He put down his side of the trunk. \u201cVery well. We\u2019ll rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want a rest, I want a coach. Perhaps one will stop for me, if I\u2019m alone. I\u2019ll stay here. You can keep walking.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cOut of the question. I know you don\u2019t have a high opinion of my character. But if you think I\u2019d abandon an unprotected gentlewoman by the roadside, you\u2019re mad. Do you know what kinds of brigands loiter along these coaching routes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe I do know.\u201d She stared at him pointedly.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a brigand now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou landed us in this predicament.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cYou think this is all my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s all your fault! I didn\u2019t ask you to tell the Fontleys all those wicked lies. I didn\u2019t ask to be made a party to your incorrigible behavior. I didn\u2019t ask you to teach me any . . . lessons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, of course not. You merely showed up at my door in the middle of the night and begged me to take you to Scotland.\u201d He jabbed a thumb in his chest. \u201cYou kissed me outside the Bull and Blossom. You dragged me into a bloody cave. I didn\u2019t ask for any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ruining this journey,\u201d she all but shouted. \u201cYou ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I beg your pardon, but I believe you signed on to be ruined!\u201d</p><p>Her hands clenched in fists. She tried to calm herself. \u201cWe made a simple agreement. You take me to Edinburgh. I give you five hundred guineas. I don\u2019t recall any negotiations about lying or singing or . . . or moaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I threw those in the bargain for free. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d The infuriating man walked in a slow circle, swinging his arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll rest a few minutes. And then we\u2019ll continue walking. The next village can\u2019t be far now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be moved from this spot.\u201d</p><p>He came to a halt behind her. His hands gripped her shoulders. \u201cYou will be,\u201d he muttered, \u201ceven if I have to forcibly move you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes I would.\u201d His hands massaged her neck and shoulders muscles\u2014not tenderly, but in the way a manager might loosen a boxer for a fight. It felt maddeningly wonderful.</p><p>Crouching, he swiveled her so that she faced the road ahead. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cI will push you, pull you, rattle you as I see fit. Because you\u2019ve a sparkling wit lurking beneath that dull exterior. Because you can sing, but you don\u2019t. Because you\u2019ve a fiery passion inside you, and it needs release. Because you can keep walking. You just need someone to push you over that next horizon.\u201d</p><p>Surely it was the effect of hunger and fatigue, not his rough, intimate voice. But she trembled, just a little.</p><p>\u201cThose are rather ironic words,\u201d she said, turning her head to face him. \u201cFrom a man who won\u2019t even ride in a coach.\u201d</p><p>His hands tensed.</p><p>\u201cHo, there!\u201d</p><p>On the road beside them, a carriage rolled to a halt. A young woman with a gaily beribboned bonnet called to them from inside.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, what misfortune has befallen you? Do you need assistance? Can we offer you some help?\u201d She opened the door. \u201cIt\u2019s just my sister and our companion with me, you see. Plenty of space.\u201d</p><p>Minerva rose from her trunk and looked to Colin. \u201cWell? Must I push you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ll ride. Just until the next town.\u201d</p><p>Minerva assessed the young woman in the carriage. She looked about the same age as Diana, and her bonnet and carriage marked her as a lady of some wealth. Judging by the fact that she was stopping to offer rides to strangers, she must be either exceptionally kind or rather stupid.</p><p>More likely, she was simply the sort of privileged, high-spirited girl who couldn\u2019t imagine anything bad happening to her\u2014because nothing truly bad ever had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so kind to stop for us,\u201d Minerva said, dropping a curtsy. \u201cI\u2019m Miss Sand, and this is . . . my brother. We\u2019ve had quite the misadventure this morning, I\u2019m afraid. If you could only take us to the next town, we\u2019d be so grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re still brother and sister?\u201d he murmured, lifting her trunk.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cBut keep it simple. No more missionaries. Or cobras. And most importantly, no more . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were hard as he looked her up and down. \u201cBelieve me. You needn\u2019t worry on that score.\u201d</p><p>Minerva absorbed the swift, ruthless stab to her pride.</p><p>\u201cJust slide your trunk here, in the compartment,\u201d the young lady directed. \u201cThere\u2019s no more room up top, I\u2019m afraid. Cordelia will bring a half dozen hatboxes on every journey.\u201d</p><p>After Minerva climbed into the carriage and took a place on the rear-facing seat, Colin lifted the trunk inside and slid it back as far as possible. Finally, taking one last deep breath as though he were preparing to submerge himself in the sea, he entered and settled his significant bulk beside her. His legs were nearly folded double.</p><p>\u201cCarry on, John Coachman!\u201d the young lady called.</p><p>As the carriage jolted into motion, Minerva felt Colin\u2019s muscles go rigid as iron. She knew that familiar pang of sympathy for him\u2014but truly, he had no one to blame for this situation but himself. And it would only be a short ride.</p><p>He\u2019d survive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Miss Emmeline Gateshead.\u201d The beribboned young woman stuck out her hand, and Minerva shook it. \u201cThis is my sister, Miss Cordelia Gateshead, and our companion, Mrs. Pickerill.\u201d</p><p>Minerva made her polite greetings to all three. She might as well have saved her breath. All three young women were instantly riveted to Colin. No surprise. The man drew female attention like a sponge draws water.</p><p>\u201cAnd what takes the two of you north?\u201d Miss Gateshead asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite catch your names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Minerva was suddenly panicked. \u201cWell. We . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell us! We\u2019ll guess,\u201d Cordelia said, smiling. \u201cIt will help to pass the time.\u201d She tipped her smile in Colin\u2019s direction. \u201cAre you an officer, back from the war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss. I\u2019m no hero.\u201d</p><p>Minerva would have said the same, a few minutes ago. But now she wasn\u2019t so sure. From the moment they\u2019d entered the coach, she\u2019d been aware of the tension in Colin\u2019s body. Now, her spectacles had begun to fog over from his shallow breaths. But no one else in the carriage suspected his struggles. He was enduring the torture quietly, manfully.</p><p>Perhaps even heroically.</p><p>\u201cPity, for you\u2019d look so fine in uniform.\u201d Emmeline\u2019s remark prompted a chastening harrumph from her companion. \u201cDid you come from Town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came through it,\u201d Minerva answered. \u201cBut home is rather further south. On the coast.\u201d</p><p>Cordelia gasped. \u201cI know. He\u2019s a pirate!\u201d The younger lady collapsed into giggles.</p><p>Emmeline turned her head and regarded Colin askance. A coquettish lilt stole into her voice. \u201cWell, I would believe it of him. He does have that roguish air.\u201d</p><p>Miss Gateshead, you have no idea.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a spy.\u201d This, from Mrs. Pickerill.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s annoyance neared its boiling point. She couldn\u2019t take any more of this silliness from the women, and Colin\u2019s quiet misery had her truly concerned. Now he seemed to have stopped breathing entirely.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell them the truth, brother?\u201d Perhaps it would help him to talk. He did love spinning outlandish tales. And if he were speaking, he\u2019d simply have to start breathing.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t like to say.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Pickerill looked suspicious. \u201cIt\u2019s simple enough, isn\u2019t it? Names, destination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Minerva jumped to agree, casually sliding her arm through Colin\u2019s. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a matter of how we are,\u201d she improvised. \u201cIt\u2019s who we might be that complicates matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d Miss Cordelia Gateshead inched forward on her seat.</p><p>\u201cDo tell them, brother,\u201d Minerva urged. \u201cIt\u2019s so very diverting. And I think what we need right now is a little diversion.\u201d</p><p>She gave his arm a surreptitious squeeze. I\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWell, you see . . . the truth of the matter is . . .\u201d He put his hand over Minerva\u2019s. \u201cWe might be royalty.\u201d</p><p>Every lady in the coach gasped, Minerva included. Well, she\u2019d asked for this. At least there\u2019d be no cobras or lepers this time.</p><p>\u201cRoyalty?\u201d Miss Gateshead sat tall. \u201cHow astonishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was our reaction, when the solicitors found us.\u201d Colin began to sound himself again. His incorrigible, devilish self. \u201cBut it\u2019s recently come to light that our father was possibly descended from the line of Prince Ampersand, ruling monarch of Crustacea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrustacea,\u201d Cordelia echoed. \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither had we!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWe had to dig out the atlas from our father\u2019s library and dust it off when we received the letter last month. A very small principality, apparently. High up in the mountains, along the border of Spain and Italy. The entire economy is based on the export of calendula and goat cheese.\u201d</p><p>Minerva bit back a laugh. Any imbecile with an atlas knew Spain didn\u2019t border Italy. And good luck growing calendula on a mountaintop.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the letter say?\u201d Cordelia asked.</p><p>\u201cYou see, some months ago, tragedy struck the tiny alpine paradise. The entire Crustacean royal family was wiped out by a particularly virulent strain of violet fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of violet fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither had we,\u201d Colin said. \u201cWe had to break out father\u2019s old medical tomes next. Didn\u2019t we, M?\u201d He patted her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare. But almost always deadly.\u201d He clucked his tongue. \u201cA true tragedy. It wiped out the prince, the queen mother, all the royal children. Unless they want to hand over the realm to this vile, sniveling, warty usurper called . . .\u201d He looked to Minerva. \u201cSir Alisdair, was it?\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cThey had to find someone in the royal line. They searched far and wide, and then they found us. So we\u2019re off to the ancestral family home, you see. To retrieve our birth records and the family Bible and such. By this time next month, you could be looking at the prince and princess of Crustacea.\u201d</p><p>Emmeline sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Minerva thought. Just like a fairy tale. Absolute rot, from beginning to end. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s no fairy tale,\u201d Colin said. \u201cDon\u2019t envy us our sudden elevation. If we are royalty, our lives will cease to be our own. We\u2019ll have duties, won\u2019t we? We\u2019ll have to leave England\u2014our beloved homes and friends\u2014behind. And then there\u2019s abandoning the hope of love.\u201d His expression went somber. \u201cA prince can never expect to find love.\u201d</p><p>In unison, the sisters pressed their hands to their hearts.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t?\u201d Cordelia asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t.\u201d With an air of thoughtful sincerity, he leaned forward. \u201cYou see, if I remained just poor, simple Mr. Colin Sand of Sussex, I could take a fancy to a pretty girl I met while traveling. Ask permission to court her. Take the time to become better acquainted. Share with her all my dreams and fancies and secrets, and learn hers. Bring her sweets and bouquets.\u201d He cast a wistful glance out the coach window. \u201cLike any man, I\u2019ve enjoyed my youth, sown my wild oats. But deep down, I always wanted that tender romance with the right girl. Someday.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. He spun these tales so convincingly, even Minerva had to remind herself it was all fabrication. She\u2019d once made the mistake of believing those lies. It\u2019s you, Minerva. It\u2019s always been you. She could still hear the mocking laughter ringing off the turret walls.</p><p>This time, at least, she could have been the one to laugh. The young Misses Gateshead were so far gone, they\u2019d all but tripped over the horizon.</p><p>Such charm was a talent, she had to give him that. Twenty minutes in the same carriage, and he had two well-bred gentlewomen utterly enamored with a reluctant prince who\u2019d turn down the riches of the world for a chance at true love. Their hearts, souls, smiles, and virtues could be his for a single, smoldering gaze. They\u2019d probably queue up to take turns.</p><p>Minerva suddenly realized that he\u2019d never unleashed his full seductive potential in Spindle Cove\u2014at least, not with Diana. A strange surge of gratitude took her by surprise.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m a prince,\u201d he said, smiling in that disarming, bashful way\u2014the way that revealed his single dimple as though it were a secret vulnerability only the love of a good woman could cure\u2014\u201cI of course will do my duty. I will do my best. But sometimes, I think it might be a relief to find it\u2019s all just a grand mistake.\u201d</p><p>The coach lurched to a sudden halt.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d exclaimed Emmeline, falling forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Minerva looked out the window for the first time in several minutes. This stretch of road passed through a wooded area. Perhaps they\u2019d come to a turnpike, or the road was muddy ahead.</p><p>Without warning, the door of the coach opened, just a crack.</p><p>In the opening, the barrel of a pistol gleamed.</p> <p>\u201cStand and deliver.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Colin very nearly laughed. Not out of amusement, but irony. It was really, truly absurd that part of him welcomed this turn of events. That he\u2019d rather face a highwayman at gunpoint than ride one minute longer in this hellish, suffocating coach. Even spinning outlandish claptrap and enjoying the company of three ladies couldn\u2019t distract him from the too-close walls and the too-warm air. When the carriage had lurched to its unexpected stop, Colin had gone a bit wild inside.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted out.</p><p>At the sight of the pistol, he\u2019d almost begged, Yes, shoot me. End this misery.</p><p>Until that pistol turned in Minerva\u2019s direction, and clarity descended. Now Colin wasn\u2019t panicked.</p><p>He was pissing angry.</p><p>He cleared his throat, drawing the bastard\u2019s attention. \u201cIf you must point that thing at someone, point it at me.\u201d</p> <p>The highwayman obliged him and threw a canvas pouch through the open door. \u201cPass the sack. Coin, jewels, watches, rings. All of it goes inside.\u201d An ominous click sounded as he cocked the pistol. \u201cAnd quickly.\u201d</p><p>The Misses Gateshead cowered together with their companion.</p><p>Colin retrieved the canvas pouch from the floor. As he teased the drawstring open, he spoke to the ladies in his calmest, most reassuring tone. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be done, I\u2019m afraid. We\u2019ll do as he asks, and then we\u2019ll continue on. Everything will be well.\u201d</p><p>Damn it all. Colin knew handing over the valuables was the only safe and responsible choice. Except for a knife buried deep in his boot, he was unarmed and at a distinct disadvantage. Presumably, the robber had associates holding the carriage driver and footmen at gunpoint, too. Any heroics Colin might attempt would doubtless end in someone\u2019s injury or death. With four ladies in the carriage, he couldn\u2019t take the risk. Still, he hated giving in. He cursed his own thoughtlessness. Why hadn\u2019t he brought a pistol on this journey?</p><p>The answer was simple. Because he hadn\u2019t expected to actually leave on this journey. He\u2019d tried to cancel the whole thing, that first morning by the road.</p><p>He should have tried harder.</p><p>With shaking fingers, the trio of ladies removed their lockets, bracelets, rings, and hair combs. He shook the few coins he carried from his own pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d The robber thrust his pistol in Minerva\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not wearing jewels,\u201d Colin said, angling himself between the pistol and her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that reticule?\u201d</p><p>Colin held out the canvas bag. \u201cThe reticule, Min.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Her dark eyes were wild with apprehension. \u201cBut it has all my\u2014\u201d</p><p>All her money. All their money. Yes, Colin knew. And from the look in her eyes, he knew she would likely do something very stupid to save it, if he didn\u2019t take command of this scene.</p><p>\u201cGive it here,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Her face blanched to the color of parchment as she unlooped the reticule from her wrist and dropped it in the canvas bag.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Colin pushed the heavy bag at the highwayman. \u201cTake it and begone. Before I change my mind and crush your miserable, reeking face with my boot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast.\u201d The robber flashed his pistol in the direction of Colin\u2019s signet ring. \u201cYour ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t come off.\u201d Colin demonstrated, tugging at the gold band. \u201cIf you want it, you\u2019ll have to take the finger.\u201d</p><p>The ladies gasped at this suggestion, drawing the highwayman\u2019s notice. From beneath his wide-brimmed hat, sharp eyes scanned the compartment.</p><p>His pistol pointed in Francine\u2019s direction. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the trunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Minerva jumped to answer. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>Bollocks. Wrong answer, pet. That trunk\u2019s contents were of no value to anyone, save Minerva herself. And a few dusty scientists, perhaps. But with her hasty denial, she\u2019d just given the impression that the trunk was filled with gold doubloons. Now the robber would not rest without taking it, and Minerva would not surrender.</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cMin, it\u2019s not worth your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my life. Without it, I\u2019ve done this all for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that,\u201d the highwayman ordered, holding the pistol steady with one hand and reaching for the trunk\u2019s handle with the other.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Minerva cried, holding it back. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s heart careened in his chest. Good Lord, the girl would get herself killed.</p><p>\u201cLeave the trunk,\u201d Colin said. He turned to the highwayman. \u201cLeave the trunk, and you can have me.\u201d</p><p>The robber\u2019s lip curled. \u201cYou\u2019re not my sort. But perhaps I\u2019ll take the trunk and the girl. I like \u2018em spirited.\u201d</p><p>It took everything Colin had not to slam his fist into the man\u2019s throat, that instant. Pistol or no pistol, he could pulverize the blackguard. He felt sure of it.</p><p>But there were others, he reminded himself. Outside the coach. An untold number of men, most certainly armed. He couldn\u2019t risk them firing on the ladies.</p><p>Colin steeled his jaw. \u201cWhat\u2019s the girl worth to you? A few minutes\u2019 fun? I\u2019m worth a fortune in ransom.\u201d He flashed his signet ring and brought out his most aristocratic accent. \u201cThousands. Let the ladies pass unmolested, and I\u2019ll come with you. No struggle.\u201d</p><p>He watched greed and suspicion wrestling in the robber\u2019s eyes. The man wanted to believe Colin, but he wasn\u2019t sure he could.</p><p>And then, from the opposite seat, Miss Cordelia Gateshead gave Colin the best, most timely gift he could ever hope to receive.</p><p>The girl clasped her hands together and sighed, \u201cOh, your royal highness. You mustn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Well. That sealed the bargain nicely.</p><p>As Colin made ready to leave the carriage, he pinned Minerva with a stern glare. \u201cListen to me,\u201d he whispered fast and fierce. \u201cYou go to the next town. You find a safe inn. You send word to my cousin, and then you bloody well stay there until he arrives. Do you hear?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shimmered with fear. \u201cBut, Colin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguments, damn it. Just do as I say. I need to know you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Her bottom lip trembled, and he couldn\u2019t resist soothing it with a brief, if rather unbrotherly, parting kiss.</p><p>\u201cGod be with you, Prince Ampersand,\u201d said Emmeline Gateshead, weeping into her handkerchief. \u201cAnd with the people of Crustacea.\u201d</p><p>As Colin alighted from the coach, he assessed the scene. As he\u2019d suspected, the highwayman had associates. Two that he could see, both armed. A stocky man held the horses by their leads and had a pistol trained on the driver. The third, youthful and lean, stood several paces to the rear, keeping a musket shouldered and cocked.</p><p>The first highwayman nudged Colin with a pistol to the back. \u201cLook what I have here, boys! It\u2019s a prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t look like a prince. He\u2019s got too many teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever he is, let\u2019s get him away from the road.\u201d The stocky man released the horses\u2019 leads and nodded to the driver.</p><p>The Gatesheads\u2019 coach jolted into motion, and Colin rejoiced to see it carrying all four\u2014five, if he counted Francine\u2014innocent females well away. He took his first deep breath since entering that godforsaken conveyance some miles back. So long as Minerva was unharmed, he could endure whatever came next.</p><p>If she\u2019d been hurt in any way, he could not have lived with himself.</p><p>Still prodding him along with the pistol, the highwayman pushed him toward the woods.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin is the Earl of Rycliff,\u201d Colin said, as they crunched over ferns and wove through stands of coppiced hazel. \u201cHe\u2019s trustee of my fortune. Send him a letter sealed with this\u201d\u2014he wiggled his signet ring\u2014\u201cand he\u2019ll arrange for whatever ransom you demand.\u201d</p><p>Possibly. Or, his cousin might send them a letter back saying, \u201cGo ahead, do me a favor and send the scoundrel to the devil.\u201d Depended on Bram\u2019s mood that day. It didn\u2019t really matter, as Colin had no intent to remain in the brigands\u2019 custody that long. These were petty thieves, not kidnappers by trade. They\u2019d surely slip up and give him a chance to escape. Perhaps before the morning was out.</p><p>Or perhaps not.</p><p>Once they\u2019d made their way well into the woods, his captor spun him about. He struck Colin across the face with the pistol. The blow sent his head whipping sideways and his brain reeling off to some sparkling, painful place.</p><p>All three of the men closed around him.</p><p>\u201cA prince, eh?\u201d The stocky one made a fist. \u201cDon\u2019t be expecting the royal treatment from us.\u201d</p><p>Colin straightened. Thanks to years of boxing at the club, he knew how to weather a few blows. He also knew he couldn\u2019t put his fists against three armed men. But he would not cringe or beg. \u201cI\u2019m actually not a prince. I\u2019m a viscount. If that helps.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t help. But it did earn him another blow, this one to the gut.</p><p>And so, as it happened, by the time the morning was out, Colin had not found an opportunity for escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rather, he\u2019d found himself beaten, bloodied, and tied to a chestnut tree.</p><p>Staring down the barrel of a gun.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>It was a fine day for target practice. Mild, sunny. Not overly breezy.</p><p>Kate Taylor cocked her pistol and stared down the distant bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>Weekly shooting lessons were the legacy of Miss Susanna Finch, a gentleman gunsmith\u2019s daughter and Spindle Cove\u2019s first patroness. She believed every young lady should know how to defend herself.</p><p>Susanna had married Lord Rycliff last year and was presently staying with him in London. So Kate had taken responsibility for the ladies\u2019 schedule in her absence.</p><p>On Mondays, they had country walks. Tuesday\u2019s sea bathing was on hiatus until summer, of course, but on Wednesdays, they turned their hands to gardening. And on Thursdays . . .</p> <p>Bang.</p><p>Thursday was their day to shoot. Here at Summerfield, the Finch estate. Sir Lewis Finch always made the young ladies welcome, offering his finest weaponry and refreshments for their enjoyment. The old man obviously missed his daughter greatly, and took some comfort in hosting her friends. And for her part, Kate couldn\u2019t get enough of being in a family home. Even if it wasn\u2019t her own. She loved soaking up the sense of shared history, old portraits, fond memories.</p><p>Charlotte Highwood tugged at her sleeve. \u201cMiss Taylor, look. Is that the militia?\u201d</p><p>Kate turned her gaze, staring over the open meadow. Indeed, the members of the local militia were dressed in full uniform and marching in formation. Straight for them, it would seem.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think they had drill today,\u201d Diana said.</p> <p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d And even if they did, why would they be marching here, toward Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s estate?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a sham battle.\u201d Charlotte perked with excitement. \u201cLadies versus gentlemen. Can we fall into a formation of our own? Fix bayonets and charge?\u201d</p><p>Diana tugged her sister\u2019s hair. \u201cGoose.\u201d</p><p>As the column of red-coated men approached, Kate recognized Corporal Thorne leading them. He wasn\u2019t difficult to make out. He stood several inches taller than most of the men. His shoulders were near twice as broad.</p><p>And his demeanor was a thousand times more unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Kate called, keeping her voice even. \u201cWeapons down, please. It seems the men have something they wish to discuss.\u201d</p><p>With a barked command, Thorne brought the men to a halt. Another harsh order, and they\u2019d fallen into a single line, facing the ladies.</p><p>He approached Kate. She grew uneasy, her spine withering in that massive shadow that completely blocked the sun. She hated his effect on her. So the man didn\u2019t like her. What of it? He didn\u2019t like anyone, and why should she care? Why should she allow him to make her feel so small, so powerless?</p> <p>\u201cCorporal Thorne,\u201d she said, nodding in lieu of a curtsy. \u201cTo what do we owe this . . . interruption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to conduct an inquiry. Of your ladies and my men. I want to know if anyone has reason to believe that Miss Minerva Highwood and Lord Payne were . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love?\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cInvolved. In any way.\u201d</p><p>Kate shrugged. \u201cI should think the fact of their elopement might serve as ample evidence of their involvement, Corporal Thorne.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. There\u2019s something not right about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Highwood has said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Miss Taylor. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what Mrs. Highwood has said,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t care. In Lord Payne\u2019s absence, I\u2019m in charge of the militia. And that means, I\u2019m responsible for the safety of this place and every man, woman, and child in it. Including Miss Minerva. If her health, happiness, or virtue is endangered in any way, it\u2019s my responsibility to see her back home. Safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she\u2019s not endangered, but merely eloped, happily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here to find out.\u201d</p><p>He took a few backward steps and called out. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk down this line of my men, and then going to walk up the line of ladies. And I\u2019m going to ask each of you the same question. Prior to their disappearance, did you have any reason to believe Lord Payne and Miss Minerva Highwood were . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love,\u201d Kate supplied for him, once again. \u201cYou seem to have a problem with that word, Corporal. Or is it a problem with the concept?\u201d</p><p>He betrayed no response.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that man,\u201d she muttered to Diana. \u201cEither he has rocks in his head or a stone for a heart.\u201d</p><p>Diana smiled. \u201cI doubt it. If either were true, Minerva would have been taken with him, and not Lord Payne. She does so love rocks and stones.\u201d</p><p>Corporal Thorne stood before Mr. Fosbury, the Bull and Blossom\u2019s proprietor. \u201cFosbury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore they disappeared, did you have any reason to believe Lord Payne and Miss Minerva held one another in affection?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fosbury chuckled. \u201cThe two of them? No, sir. That came as a true surprise.\u201d</p><p>Thorne moved down the line, to the blacksmith. \u201cDawes. Same question.\u201d</p><p>The big man tipped a gaze in the ladies\u2019 direction. \u201cNo, Corporal. From everything I saw, I would have marked him as fancying Miss Diana. And lieutenant or no, I think he\u2019s a right bastard for leading her on. If you do go after him, I\u2019d ask to join the pursuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s . . . kind of him, I suppose,\u201d Kate murmured to her friend. \u201cIf unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>Diana didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Corporal Thorne continued down the line, interrogating each of his men in turn. The vicar, a few farmhands. After the eighth or so staunch denial, Thorne slid Kate a brief, smug glance. A look that said, I told you so.</p><p>She merely raised her eyebrows in reply.</p><p>\u201cHastings,\u201d he barked, moving on to the next man. A fisherman, by trade. \u201cBefore they run off together, did you have any reason to believe Lord Payne and Miss Minerva Highwood were involved?\u201d</p><p>Hastings squared his shoulders. \u201cI did, sir.\u201d</p><p>Thorne pulled up short. He\u2019d already started moving on to the next militiaman. But in the wake of Hastings\u2019s reply, the hulking officer turned. He turned only his head, not his body. The motion struck Kate as menacing and unnatural.</p><p>He said, \u201cWhat was that, Hastings?\u201d</p><p>Even Hastings looked unnerved. \u201cI . . . I said I did, sir. Have reason to believe the two of them was carrying on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What? How?\u201d He fired the questions like howitzers.</p><p>Kate laughed nervously. \u201cOne question at a time, Corporal. Allow the poor man some opportunity to answer.\u201d</p><p>Oh, and the look he gave her then. It was pure dark, demanding threat. Well, Kate threw it right back. She was not one of his soldiers to be disciplined. Even without fortune or family, she was a gentlewoman. He had no power over her.</p><p>She thrust her hand behind her back, lest he see it trembling.</p><p>Hastings found his voice. \u201cI saw them together in the cove. Just a few days ago, as I was headed out with my nets in the early morning. Miss Minerva was in her bathing costume, and Lord Payne was stripping down to his breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA swim?\u201d Diana said. \u201cIn April?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what they done afterwards. I just know what I saw.\u201d Hastings shrugged. \u201cAnd when I come back in, a few hours later, they were just leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not my turn yet,\u201d Rufus Bright called from the end of the line, \u201cbut I saw them together too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Kate and Thorne spoke in unison, much to their shared dismay.</p><p>\u201cThe other night, when I was standing watch at the castle. Sometime after . . .\u201d Rufus shot a glance at the women and tugged his collar. \u201cSometime after midnight, I saw Miss Minerva leaving Lord Payne\u2019s quarters. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shrieked, then clapped both hands over her mouth. Diana tried to soothe her sister.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something that night?\u201d Thorne demanded. \u201cYou let her walk home alone, unprotected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have to admit it weren\u2019t the first time he\u2019s entertained a lady visitor after dark.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear Lord.</p><p>Kate strode forward. \u201cCorporal Thorne, isn\u2019t this enough? You wanted evidence. I believe Hastings and Rufus have given you ample proof. Now can we conclude this public inquisition, before we unearth more details that prove unnecessarily embarrassing to the Highwood family?\u201d</p><p>The big man released a slow breath. \u201cYou really think Payne will marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re right on that score. He will marry her. I\u2019ll see to that. The only question is whether he\u2019s doing it willingly now, or whether he\u2019ll marry her when he comes back\u201d\u2014the big man cracked his neck\u2014\u201cat the point of my pistol.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>God preserve him from incompetence.</p><p>As he sat on the forest floor, arms wrenched behind his back and tied around the trunk of a chestnut tree, Colin felt a pang of wistful nostalgia for the Spindle Cove militia. They might have been a sorry group of volunteers at the outset, barely able to march in time\u2014but this band of fool highwaymen made them look like a crack infantry unit by comparison.</p><p>First the thieves had argued for a good half hour over whether to believe he was a prince, a viscount, or a charlatan. Then they\u2019d argued for a similar length of time over what to do with him. Colin, of course, had plenty of suggestions\u2014each of which earned him another cuff across the face.</p><p>So far, these criminals had proven skilled at only one thing: Tying knots.</p><p>Finally, they\u2019d decided to report back to their leader\u2014some boss of their thieving gang, apparently. And so they\u2019d tied Colin to the chestnut tree and left their youngest, most anxious-looking member to watch over him. The young man sat about ten feet distant, keeping a pistol trained on Colin\u2019s chest.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the boy with the gun that troubled Colin, it was the ropes lashing him to this tree. He hated feeling confined, couldn\u2019t abide being bound to anything.</p><p>Stay calm. You\u2019ll be released. Eventually.</p><p>He was simply too valuable to kill. But the longer he remained tied here, the captive of the robbers\u2019 indecision, the longer it would take word to reach Bram. And the longer Minerva would be on her own, alone and penniless.</p><p>The thought of her huddled frightened and hungry in a strange village . . . it made him shake with impotent anger. He raged and strained against the chafing ropes.</p><p>Enough with patience. There was no waiting this out. He had to escape.</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d Colin asked his captor, trying to sound calm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d they leave you in charge of a valuable hostage? You look barely old enough to shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nineteen this summer.\u201d The robber scratched his jaw. \u201cReckon Grubb and Carmichael wanted to be the ones to tell the boss. They\u2019re probably fighting over it right now, who gets to tell the tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Colin tilted his head. Behind the tree, he struggled and pulled against the ropes binding his wrist. No slack. Damn it, if only he could reach the knife in his boot . . .</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cthis . . . Grubb and Carmichael, was it . . . wanted the glory for themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d He nodded. \u201cVery astute. But you know, you probably shouldn\u2019t have told me their names.\u201d</p><p>The younger man\u2019s eyes went wide. He cursed unimaginatively.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure Grubb and Carmichael won\u2019t kill you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He waved the pistol at Colin. \u201cDon\u2019t . . . don\u2019t . . . don\u2019t you say those names again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I can just forget them, is it?\u201d</p><p>The young man pushed to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll forget them if I shoot you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut then you\u2019d be in a very bad situation. Once Grubb, Carmichael, and this boss of yours come back and find you\u2019ve killed their valuable hostage?\u201d Colin whistled low. \u201cYou\u2019d not be long for this world then.\u201d</p><p>The robber\u2019s hands started to tremble. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree to this. I was just supposed to be lookout, while they done the robbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin said smoothly. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t agree to this. Kidnapping a peer of the realm? That\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, is it? I only wanted a few bob to take my sweetheart to the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy her a trinket, slide a hand under her skirts . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Colin paused. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. These boots I\u2019m wearing? They\u2019ll fetch a tidy sum in any city. If you untie me, you can have them. Run off, make your money, take your sweetheart to the fair. When the law comes looking for Grubb and Carmichael\u2014and mark my words, they will hang\u2014you\u2019ll be long gone. Forgotten. I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d</p><p>The youth eyed him warily, slowly approaching. \u201cI have a better idea. Mayhap I\u2019ll just take your boots. And then I\u2019ll leave you here.\u201d</p><p>A sliver of fear pierced Colin in some vital artery. His composure bled from the wound in gasping spurts. Just the image of being left alone, tied to a tree . . . with night coming, eventually . . .</p><p>He could have begged the man to shoot him dead.</p><p>Instead, he closed his eyes.</p> <p>Stay calm. This was what you wanted. What you knew he\u2019d do.</p><p>Still holding the gun with one hand, the youth began tugging at Colin\u2019s left boot with the other.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get it off that way,\u201d Colin said, forcing a nonchalant tone despite the sweat trickling down his back. \u201cYou may as well set aside the gun. There\u2019s nothing I can do, trussed like this.\u201d</p><p>After a few more moments of struggling, the robber swore and did as Colin suggested, setting the pistol to the side and wrestling the boot with both hands. At last, it slid free with a whooshing sound.</p><p>Casting the first boot aside, he started to work on the other.</p><p>\u201cSlowly, now,\u201d Colin joked. \u201cHave a care for my aging joints.\u201d</p><p>In actuality, he cared nothing for his joints. He was wagering everything on the hope of that small folding knife secreted in his right boot. If the thing slid free where he could see it . . . and if his captor didn\u2019t notice it . . . and if he could somehow manage to get the knife into his hands . . . in a matter of minutes, he could cut himself free.</p><p>But if any one of those things went wrong, he\u2019d remain tied here. For only the Devil knew how long. Until night, most likely. Until the dark descended, thick with ominous rustling. Until thirst and hunger became animate demons, tasked with his ceaseless torment.</p> <p>Until the wild dogs came.</p><p>Jesus. Please, God, no.</p><p>His heartbeat thundered in his chest.</p><p>As the youth lifted his leg and tugged on the boot, Colin flexed his leg muscle, pulling the boy close. He had to keep that knife within reach when it fell. If the thing went flying when the boot came off . . .</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. He could feel the boot starting to give way.</p><p>Crack. A faint snap in the undergrowth drew his attention.</p><p>His captor didn\u2019t notice the sound. He was too absorbed in his struggles with the boot. But Colin slid his gaze to the side, and what he saw there stalled his pounding heart.</p><p>Minerva.</p><p>Minerva Highwood, in her governess-blue traveling gown, slowly emerging from the undergrowth. Creeping toward them with all the stealth of a cat, intent on grabbing the discarded pistol. She put a finger to her pursed lips, gesturing for Colin\u2019s silence.</p><p>Colin made his eyes wide. No, he mouthed. No. Go back.</p><p>She crept closer still. Her foot snapped a branch.</p><p>This time, the robber noticed. His head whipped up, swiveling toward Minerva.</p><p>With a vicious growl, Colin gathered his strength and kicked him in the face. Scissoring his legs, Colin caught the man by the throat. He had him stunned and caught off guard. But he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold him long.</p><p>\u201cGet the pistol,\u201d he managed.</p><p>As Minerva dove to retrieve the weapon, Colin tightened his legs about the highwayman\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he said, his voice strained with effort. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking that she\u2019s just an innocent miss with spectacles. That she can\u2019t possibly know how to fire that weapon. But you\u2019re wrong. She\u2019s had training.\u201d He raised his voice. \u201cMin, show him. Shoot that birch tree over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not firing at a tree! I\u2019d waste my shot, and I haven\u2019t more powder. Then what help would I be? Really, Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Colin said to the suffocating man. \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d He released the robber with one final half-strength kick to the jaw. \u201cNo sudden moves.\u201d</p><p>Minerva focused her gaze and held the pistol steady. \u201cDo I shoot him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, there\u2019s a knife in my right boot. Fetch it, kindly.\u201d</p><p>Keeping the pistol trained on the robber at all times, she moved sideways until she could reach the boot. She found the knife with one hand and fumbled it open, wielding it like a dagger.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, glaring down at the highwayman. \u201cSo where do I stab him?\u201d</p><p>Stab him? Colin stared up at her, amazed. Her hair was hanging half loose, curling around her shoulders. Her eyes sparked with feral intensity. Her plump lips curled in a little snarl.</p><p>He\u2019d seen this wild, savage look on her face before. In Spindle Cove, he\u2019d known her to fell a grown man with her rock-filled reticule, and once she\u2019d even challenged Colin to a duel. She wore that look of righteous fury when she thought her sister was in danger, or one of her friends. Even Francine.</p><p>But this was the first time she\u2019d worn that look defending him.</p><p>Amazing. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. But here she was, for him. Willing to shoot or stab a man in his defense. And she was goddamned beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t stab him, pet,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou use the knife to cut me loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh yes.\u201d A drunken laugh bubbled from her throat. \u201cI suppose that makes more sense.\u201d</p><p>Working one-handed, she couldn\u2019t free him as quickly as he might like. But a few minutes\u2019 sawing and hacking at the ropes, and she had him freed.</p><p>Colin took the pistol from her the first instant he could, and promptly bashed it across the robber\u2019s face, knocking him cold. He plucked the powder horn and spare lead shot from the man\u2019s insensible form.</p><p>He turned to Minerva. \u201cHurry. We must be gone before he wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Colin. They hit you.\u201d She took a handkerchief from her pocket and dabbed at the bloodied corner of his mouth, wincing as she did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about our money?\u201d she asked, looking around.</p><p>\u201cGone with the other robbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. At least I still have a sovereign. It\u2019s sewn in the lining of my stays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he muttered, cramming his left foot back into its boot. \u201cAren\u2019t you resourceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound upset.\u201d She balled the handkerchief in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI am upset.\u201d He pushed to his feet and began walking in the direction from which she\u2019d come. They needed to be gone, as soon as possible. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even here. Minerva, I gave you specific instructions to ride on to the next town. Where you\u2019d be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I made Miss Gateshead let me out, a quarter mile down the road. I . . .\u201d She grabbed for his wrist. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just leave you.\u201d</p><p>He turned and stared at her.</p><p>God, he didn\u2019t know how to feel. Relieved to be free? Infuriated with her for flouting his commands? Overwhelmed with gratitude to see her whole and safe, and to have her here with him? The emotions seething within him were some mixture of all these.</p><p>He knew one thing. He didn\u2019t dare touch her right now. Whether he ended up shaking her senseless, clutching her mindlessly to him and sobbing into her skirts, or tupping her on the forest floor until his bollocks ran dry . . .</p><p>She\u2019d get hurt, one way or another. And that would make this whole damned ordeal for naught.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d As they left the small clearing, she called him aside. \u201cMy trunk\u2019s over here. I hid it under some branches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought Francine?\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s why she\u2019d made such a delayed appearance.</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t leave her behind.\u201d She knelt on the forest floor and began clearing branches from atop her hidden trunk. \u201cNot after what you\u2019d done to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I\u2019d done to . . . to save Francine?\u201d He crouched beside her, helping in the excavation. \u201cYou are an intelligent girl, Min. But sometimes you can be remarkably stupid. I wouldn\u2019t give two fingernail shavings to save this miserable piece of plaster. Much less risk my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the five hundred guineas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you couldn\u2019t pay me five thousand guineas to sit roped to a tree like that. I would never have left with those highwaymen if you hadn\u2019t forced me to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForced you?\u201d Her tone jumped an octave. \u201cI didn\u2019t force you. I could have throttled you myself when you volunteered. I was so frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was either volunteer or watch you be murdered. You\u2019d have risked everything to save this wretched lizard, if I hadn\u2019t intervened. And you\u2019d have ended up dead. Or worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d He started to reach for her, then thought better of it. He gestured impatiently instead. \u201cYou left me no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She touched a hand to her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have put you in that position. It\u2019s just . . . my life\u2019s work is in this trunk. It\u2019s my one chance at gaining recognition from my peers, my one chance at success. I\u2019ve already risked so much for it. When that highwayman tried to take it, I didn\u2019t think, I just . . . reacted.\u201d Sniffing, she looked up at him. \u201cCan you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, certainly. I understand. What\u2019s in this trunk is your life\u2019s work, and I\u2019m just the useless fellow traveling with you this week. Of course, Francine\u2019s safety comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head so hard, her spectacles went crooked. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re twisting my words. Colin, listen. In that frantic moment in the carriage, yes\u2014I might have risked my own life to save this trunk. But you must believe me when I tell you this. I did not mean to risk yours. That\u2019s why I came back.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. Hard to argue further, when she put it that way.</p><p>Truly, what could he say? Admit that he\u2019d been harboring some absurd male fantasy of her running through the woods to save him, hair flowing loose behind her, breasts heaving with every pace . . . aided by helpful songbirds chirping directions . . . simply because she\u2019d known in her heart that he needed her help? Because the moment the Gatesheads\u2019 carriage had rolled away, she\u2019d realized that science meant nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014to her without him, and now she would fall at his feet and beg to be his sultry-lipped love slave forevermore?</p><p>No. Of course not. She\u2019d come back because it was expedient to her goals, and the decent thing to do. She was both driven and loyal, as ever. Nothing between them had changed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn it.</p><p>He rose to his feet and took one of the trunk handles in his hand. \u201cWe need to be moving. The young one I clobbered won\u2019t give chase. He\u2019ll be too busy running for his own life. But once his associates realize I\u2019m missing . . .</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d She lifted her side of the trunk. \u201cThey might be after us.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>They walked on and on through those woods, carrying Francine between them. By the position of the afternoon sun at their backs, Minerva knew they were traveling north. They hadn\u2019t crossed any large bodies of water, so she assumed they were still on British soil. Beyond that, she could not have said. She wasn\u2019t sure Colin knew, either.</p><p>Goodness, had it really been just that morning when she\u2019d plunked herself on the side of the road and declared she could not walk another step? Colin had insisted she had the strength in her, and it annoyed her to admit he\u2019d been right. She\u2019d walked miles and miles farther now, with nothing to eat since last night\u2019s dinner.</p><p>Putting one boot before the other required all her powers of concentration. Hunger dogged her every step, gnawing at her from the inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Colin stopped in his tracks. \u201cAnd here I thought I hated the country.\u201d</p> <p>Minerva looked up. They\u2019d entered a clearing. A wide, green meadow in the middle of the forest. The entire space was carpeted with bluebells. Thousands upon thousands of sweetly curving green stalks, their tips heavy with sprays of blue-violet blossoms. The sunlight shone from above and slanted through the trees, catching the blooms at different angles. The whole scene sparkled.</p><p>It was magical.</p><p>Colin said, \u201cEven I, jaded as I am, have to admit that\u2019s bloody lovely.\u201d</p><p>Minerva was so famished, all she could think to reply was, \u201cDo you suppose they\u2019re edible?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. She smiled. And just like that, their mood lightened. The highwaymen were behind them. They were healthy and whole, and they still had Francine. Her stomach might be empty, but a sense of hope swelled within her breast.</p><p>Perhaps all was not lost.</p> <p>As they strode through the meadow, she had the eerie sensation of walking atop waves. Except this was a sea of petals, not saltwater. Her toe caught on a fallen branch, and she stumbled a bit.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was just distracted. Wondering how much loam is in this soil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He set down his side of the trunk. Minerva did the same.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said. \u201cLoam. A mix of clay and sand. In order for the soil to support this many bluebells, it would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing in the middle of this\u201d\u2014he spread his arms wide to indicate Nature\u2019s splendor\u2014\u201cand you\u2019re thinking about loam in the soil? You spend far too much time staring at the ground.\u201d</p><p>Rounding the trunk, Colin plucked her off her feet. With gentle strength, he tumbled her into the bluebells. She lay flat on her back, breathless and dizzy from the sudden inversion. From the sudden nearness of him.</p> <p>He lay down next to her. \u201cThere. Have a rest. Look up at the sky for a change.\u201d</p><p>Minerva stared up from the uneven ground. Her heartbeat drummed in her ears, and a crushed green scent engulfed her senses. The grasses and bluebells towered over her, swaying in the gentle breeze and dripping loveliness. Above everything, the sky hovered brilliant and blue. Nearly cloudless, save for a few wispy, changing puffs of white that were apparently too proud to mimic rabbits or dragons or sailing ships.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to be seeing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What do people see when they gaze at the sky? Inspiration? Beauty?\u201d She heard him sigh. \u201cTruth be told, this view always intimidated me. The sky\u2019s so vast. I can\u2019t help but feel it has expectations of me. Ones I\u2019m already failing.\u201d He was silent for a long moment. \u201cIt reminds me of your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She dug her elbow into his side. \u201cMy eyes are brown. And my back\u2019s growing damp. This is definitely very loam-rich soil. I just needed to look at the sky to realize it.\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle, he rolled over and pinned her with one leg. \u201cDo you know, you are the most surprising woman.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cYou have a way of surprising me, too. Not always pleasantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf surprises were always pleasant, there wouldn\u2019t be much surprise in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a few wisps of hair from her face, then removed her spectacles and laid them atop the trunk.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s pulse pounded as he slowly lowered his head and kissed . . . the tip of her nose.</p><p>She blinked up at him, trying hard to focus and read his expression. Was it teasing or affectionate? She couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you weren\u2019t expecting it. Which kind of surprise was it? Pleasant or otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll try again.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her temple. Then her chin, her jaw, the place between her eyebrows.</p><p>His tongue flicked over her ear.</p><p>Slid down her neck.</p><p>Dipped into the warm, sensitive valley between her breasts.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cColin.\u201d</p><p>He clutched a fistful of her skirt and brought her pelvis flush with his.</p><p>\u201cMin,\u201d he groaned against her neck. \u201cI know it\u2019s mad, but I need this right now. Right here, in the midst of all this beauty. I need to feel you hot and alive beneath me.\u201d</p><p>As he leaned in to kiss her mouth, she put a hand to his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>His hand swept over her body. \u201cLast night wasn\u2019t good?\u201d</p><p>Shadowy memories of that frantic, wicked, grinding pleasure assailed her. She grew damp between the legs, and it had nothing to do with the loamy soil.</p><p>\u201cIt was very good. But it was confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\u201d He cupped her breast and thumbed her nipple to a stiff, aching peak. \u201cIt\u2019s physical. Instinctual. Releasing tension in a mutually pleasurable way.\u201d</p><p>He seeded kisses along her neck, and tendrils of desire unfurled from each one. Still . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not . . .\u201d She gasped at another greedy kiss. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable being the instrument of your release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so one-sided. I promise, you\u2019ll enjoy it, too.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt that. His hand found its way under her neckline, and he slipped his fingers beneath the fabric to curl around her breast. With practiced skill, he eased the soft globe up and free.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he breathed, circling her bared nipple with his fingertip. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft. So warm and soft and sweet.\u201d</p><p>He took her nipple in his mouth. He moaned, drawing lightly on the tip with delicious suction, then swirling his tongue around the peak.</p><p>Minerva reeled with the exquisite sensations. The way he was touching her, kissing her, licking and suckling her . . . it felt so good. The pleasure was so sharp, it made her ache deep inside. It was impossible to feel this and not crave more.</p><p>But Colin wasn\u2019t the only one with principles. He wasn\u2019t the only one who could make rules. She just couldn\u2019t take any more \u201clessons\u201d or pretending. She only wanted this if it was real.</p><p>His leg snaked between hers. \u201cYou have so much fire in you, Min. A natural talent for passion.\u201d</p><p>A talent for passion? Her?</p><p>\u201cEven if that were true,\u201d she said, \u201clook where indulging it has landed me.\u201d Thrown off one carriage, robbed on the next. Lost in the woods. Hungry, almost penniless.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s landed you here. In the most beautiful afternoon to ever grace the English countryside. Sprawled on a lush carpet of bluebells, staring up at a heartbreakingly blue sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>They were silent for a time. Then she sensed his demeanor make a sudden shift. The muscles of his chest tensed beneath her touch. His tone changed.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, withdrawing his fingers from her bosom. \u201cSo that\u2019s the problem. Not the setting, not the notion of pleasure. It\u2019s me. You think you\u2019re here with the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rolled away from her. \u201cYou\u2019d rather be sharing all this with someone else. Someone like Sir Alisdair Kent. Talking of loam and soil composition, and denying the part of yourself that screamed my name last night.\u201d</p><p>Blushing, she tucked her breast back into her bodice and fumbled for her spectacles. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being cruel.\u201d He pushed to his feet, brushing off his dirt- and grass-streaked breeches. \u201cI just feel sorry for you, is all. I\u2019ve been trying to break you out of that shell, teach you how to enjoy life. But now I can see you don\u2019t want it. You\u2019re going to die curled up in that hard, brittle cage you\u2019ve constructed. I hope Sir Alisdair doesn\u2019t mind cramped quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now I should apologize? For wanting something more than carnal \u2018lessons\u2019 on your charity? After all, that\u2019s the best an awkward bluestocking like me could hope for. Is that it?\u201d Minerva struggled to her feet. \u201cAt least Sir Alisdair would remember my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He closed the distance between them, standing so near his chest grazed her breasts. \u201cBut could he kiss you so hard, you forget it?\u201d</p><p>For a hot, confusing moment, his breath mingled with hers.</p><p>But before she could think of any possible retort, he retreated. He picked up the trunk and shouldered it.</p><p>\u201cCome along,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cBy this time, we must be nearly there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly there? Nearly where?\u201d</p><p>Minerva lagged behind him, trying to understand his irrational anger. And here common wisdom would argue that women were the sex with changeable moods.</p><p>They walked on for perhaps a quarter hour more, and then they emerged from the woods at the edge of a crest.</p><p>In the distance, down the slope, sat an immense stone manor house, bordered by gardens and outbuildings.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d she breathed. \u201cWhat is that place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinterset Grange,\u201d he answered. \u201cI knew we had to be close. A good friend of mine resides there. We need a place to stay the night. To lie low, in case those highwaymen are still sniffing about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to just appear on your friend\u2019s doorstep? Uninvited, out of nowhere?\u201d She waved a hand between them. \u201cLooking as we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no one will blink. Guests are always coming and going from Winterset Grange. Whenever the duke\u2019s in residence, it\u2019s one never-ending bacchanal.\u201d</p><p>Minerva stared at him. \u201cThe duke? We\u2019re going to be guests of a duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a royal duke,\u201d he said, as if this should be some comfort. \u201cHal\u2019s an amiable fellow, you\u2019ll see. He\u2019s patron of a popular gambling circle called the Shilling Club. I\u2019m a member. He\u2019d never begrudge my lack of an invitation, so long as I show up with money to lose at his card table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t any money to lose at his card table. We have precisely one sovereign to our names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails, details.\u201d</p><p>They started down the grassy slope. The vast, sprawling manor house seemed to inflate as they approached. As if some mischievous boy were behind the thing, huffing air into it like a scraped pig\u2019s bladder. It was just grotesquely large, its windows deep-set and hooded, like leering eyes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like this. Not one bit.</p><p>As they neared the drive, Colin pulled her into the gardens, behind a windbreak of cypress trees. After dipping a handkerchief into a trickling fountain, he swabbed his face and neck clean, then retied his cravat. He brushed the dust from the front of his coat and gave a brisk, jaunty toss of his head that instantly tamed his hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So wretchedly unfair. Thirty seconds\u2019 toilette, and he looked better than she could have managed with hot tongs, curling papers, and the assistance of two French lady\u2019s maids.</p><p>\u201cAm I presentable?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re every bit as unjustly handsome as always.\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head and peered at her. \u201cNow, what can we do about you?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. What indeed. \u201cLikely nothing, my lord,\u201d she said acidly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t go in looking like that\u2014all pinned and laced and buttoned up. Not if you\u2019re meant to pass as my mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour . . .\u201d She lowered her voice, as though the cypresses had ears. \u201cYour mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else am I to explain your presence? I\u2019ve been friends with the Duke of Halford for years. I can\u2019t tell him you\u2019re my sister. He knows very well I have none.\u201d His hands went to the buttons of her traveling spencer. Beginning at the one nearest her throat, he slipped them loose, one by one. \u201cFirst, we need to do away with this.\u201d When he had the two sides divided, he pushed the garment from her shoulders and shook loose the sleeves. All the while, Minerva stood there numbly, not even knowing how to protest.</p> <p>He folded her jacket and tossed it aside. \u201cThis won\u2019t do either,\u201d he grumbled, eyeing her shot-silk traveling gown. \u201cYou should have worn the red today.\u201d</p><p>Minerva bristled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this gown?\u201d She liked this gown. It was one of her best. The peacock blue suited her coloring, or so she\u2019d been told.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too modest by far,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look like a governess, not a mistress.\u201d</p><p>Modest? She stared down at the silk. The bodice fit close across her bosom, and the empire waist cinched her tight around the ribs, flaring to a full, draped skirt. It was a form-fitting, curve-emphasizing silhouette\u2014one that had felt positively daring, in the seamstress\u2019s fitting. The sleeves, especially. They puffed a bit at the shoulder, then gathered with a ribbon garter just at the top of the arm. From there, they hugged her arms tight, all the way down to the wrist.</p><p>He reached for one of those ribbon bows, worrying the lace between his fingertips before skimming a light touch all the way down to her cuff. A heady sensation slid through her, coasting on the sheen of silk.</p><p>See? These sleeves were cunning, sensual sheaths of fabric. Nothing modest about them at all.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps this will help.\u201d He closed his fingers about the cuff and gave it a ruthless yank.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>And just like that, the cunning sleeve was gone. His sharp tug made a rent in the seam below her ribbon ties, and he frayed the rest of it loose with devious fingers. Within moments, he had the entire sleeve destroyed and he\u2019d set to work on the other.</p><p>In the end, he left her with abbreviated puffs of fabric covering her shoulders. Two little apostrophes of silk, where full parentheses had been.</p><p>After standing back a moment to look at her, he untied one of the ribbon bows and left its ends dangling.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow arched. \u201cIt makes a suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe suggestion being that I\u2019m loose?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour words, not mine.\u201d He framed her waist in his hands, and spun her around\u2014so that she faced away. His hands went to the row of hooks down the back of her dress. Beginning at the base of her neck, he undid them one by one.</p><p>\u201cNow this is too much,\u201d she protested, trying to wriggle away. \u201cI won\u2019t be made to look slatternly.\u201d</p><p>He held her tight. His breath fell hot and rough on her neck. \u201cYou\u2019ll be made to look the way I wish you to look. That\u2019s the point of a mistress, after all. No doubt Sir Alisdair Kent likes his women looking prim and demure, but you chose me as your travel partner. I have a reputation to maintain.\u201d</p><p>He unhooked her dress to the midpoint of her back, just between her shoulder blades. Then he worked the widened neckline over the slopes of her shoulders, shimmying it down to a most indecent latitude. The edge of her chemise was exposed, making a lacy ruff of white to frame her exposed cleavage.</p><p>After whirling her back to face him, he surveyed his handiwork. Minerva flushed with shame. He\u2019d taken her perfectly respectable traveling gown and turned it into an off-the-shoulder ensemble befitting a pirate wench.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t through with her yet. He lifted his hands to her hair and began plucking the pins from her failing chignon. If she weren\u2019t faint with hunger and terrified of being stranded penniless in the Midlands, she would not have stood for such treatment.</p><p>This went beyond teasing. Could he . . . could he possibly be envious?</p><p>\u201cReally, Colin. I\u2019m sorry if you resent my regard for Sir Alisdair. But humiliating me this way is hardly going to earn you my good opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d He pulled the last of the pins free and shook her hair loose about her face. \u201cBut I\u2019m convinced it will add greatly to my personal satisfaction. And it will save us both a great many prying questions.\u201d</p><p>He removed the spectacles from her face and folded them, tucking them inside his breast pocket.</p><p>\u201cI need those.\u201d She reached for them.</p><p>He caught her wrist. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. From the moment we walk through those doors, you\u2019re not leaving my side, do you hear? Believe me, you don\u2019t want any of Halford\u2019s guests thinking I mean to share you.\u201d</p><p>Share her? What sort of den of iniquity were they entering?</p><p>\u201cFor my part,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll behave as if I\u2019m your slavish, besotted, jealous protector.\u201d</p><p>She bit back an unladylike laugh. \u201cNow that will be the role of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you . . .\u201d He tipped her chin with a single fingertip. \u201cYou had better play your part to perfection, my pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy part? I don\u2019t know how to be a mistress.\u201d Certainly not among dukes. She became an absolute pudding around powerful men.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t sell yourself short. I think you\u2019ll do very well indeed. You see, a mistress is a sharp, savage little creature. When it suits her, she can make a man feel as though he\u2019s irresistible, desirable, endlessly fascinating. The only man in the world.\u201d He leaned closer, lowered his voice to a dark whisper. He was too near for comfort or clarity, just a blur of male ferocity. \u201cShe moans as if she means it. And when she\u2019s got what she wanted, she\u2019ll make it bitingly clear that the man means nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014to her at all. I think you were born to that role. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice wavering. \u201cHow dare you suggest that I\u2019m some sort of . . . Last night was all your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can hardly be the first woman to pass an enjoyable night in your arms and want little to do with you the following day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. You\u2019re merely the most recent in a long, distinguished line. And don\u2019t harbor any illusions you\u2019ll be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so angry? Why am I singled out for such cruel retribution? What wound can I have possibly caused you, save a miniscule twinge to your pride?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Then he reached up with both hands and pinched her cheeks. Hard.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Reeling, she clapped her hands over them. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a blush on those cheeks if you\u2019re to play my trollop, and we haven\u2019t any rouge.\u201d One of his arms shot around her, gathering her close. He traced her bottom lip with his thumb. \u201cAnd these lips are looking entirely too pursed and pale.\u201d</p><p>Bending his head, he caught her mouth in a harsh, bruising kiss. His tongue thrust between her lips, making a thorough, claiming sweep of her mouth. Then he caught her bottom lip and gave it a teasing, puppyish tug with his teeth. He left her mouth swollen, stinging with pleasure and pain.</p><p>She dug an elbow into his side, using all the strength in her arm to lever some distance between them. He released her, and she stumbled a few steps back.</p><p>She touched her fingertips to her mouth, checking for blood. \u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d</p><p>He released a long, frustrated breath. With some distance between them, she could better make out his expression. It was one of lean, wary hunger.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, Min.\u201d He bent to pick up the trunk. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>If Winterset Grange looked austere and forbidding from the outside, its interior resembled something out of Ancient Rome at its peak of debauchery and excess.</p><p>Being without her spectacles was both a hindrance and a blessing. Everywhere Minerva turned, she saw blurred depictions of flesh. Paintings of lascivious nudes covered the soaring walls, stacked bosom-to-backside three tiers high. Decadent sculptures winked out from alcoves. Some ambitious decorator had splashed gold leaf over everything.</p><p>The sculpture nearest Minerva appeared to be Pan, cavorting and twisting atop a Corinthian column. If she squinted, she could make out the fine silver and rosy veins of the stone. Italian, most definitely.</p><p>\u201cSuch lovely marble, to be so misused.\u201d She ran her fingers over the cool, smooth stone. Then withdrew her hand immediately when she realized the cylindrical protuberance she\u2019d grasped was not a horn, nor a pipe.</p><p>Casting about for a safe place to rest her gaze, she looked to the wallpaper. A traditional, pleasant gold-and-white toile pattern of couples dancing. Or were they?</p><p>She squinted and peered closer, forcing the pattern into focus.</p><p>No, the couples weren\u2019t dancing.</p><p>\u201cPayne! It is you.\u201d A man sauntered across the hall to them, dressed in a lazily tied banyan. He seemed young\u2014near to Colin\u2019s age, she\u2019d imagine\u2014and he brought with him an air of cultivated dissipation and the vague scent of opium smoke. He was flanked by two women even more scantily clad than he\u2014one smooth and fair, the other titian-haired. Minerva couldn\u2019t make out the women\u2019s expressions, but their sensuality was a palpable force. She felt their gaze on her, cool and prickling.</p><p>This mousy girl can\u2019t be one of us, she imagined them thinking.</p><p>I\u2019m not, she wanted to shout. She had this brief, vivid vision of giving Colin, his debauched friend, and these two loose women a good dressing down, smashing priapic Pan to the floor, whirling on her heel, and\u2014</p><p>But she had no money. Nowhere to go, and no means of getting there. She didn\u2019t even have her spectacles.</p><p>So Minerva lifted her chin and cocked her hip. She shuffled closer to Colin and moved to prop her arm on his shoulder. Of course, with her vision so hampered, she misjudged and propped her arm on air. She stumbled and fell into him instead, splaying one arm over his chest and trying for all the world to look as though she\u2019d meant to do that.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think anyone was fooled.</p><p>One woman began giggling. The other laughed out loud.</p><p>Minerva wanted to sink through the floor.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d the man she presumed to be the Duke of Halford said, \u201cyou remember my good friend Payne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d one of them cooed. \u201cWe\u2019re old friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Now Minerva wanted to sink through the floor and die there. She understood Colin was angry, but how could he do this to her?</p><p>Colin inclined his head. \u201cAlways a pleasure, Hal. Sorry to arrive unannounced. Hope you don\u2019t mind the imposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever an imposition! But gods, you did appear from nowhere. I didn\u2019t even hear your carriage in the drive.\u201d The man relinquished his hold on one of the ladies and gave Colin a genial punch on the arm. \u201cThe butler told me you\u2019d arrived, and I didn\u2019t believe him. Last I heard, that cousin of yours had you on a short leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve slipped it, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Your timing couldn\u2019t be better. Prinny\u2019s expected to pop round later this week. Girls, go find that puckered housekeeper of mine and tell her to ready Payne\u2019s usual suite.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d</p><p>Halford sent the ladies on their way with a resounding smack to the backside. Then Minerva felt the duke\u2019s gaze slide to her. Her skin crawled.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s see to your baggage. Aren\u2019t you going to introduce her, Payne? Don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen this one before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t.\u201d Colin trailed a reassuring touch down her back. \u201cMelissande is new.\u201d</p><p>Melissande? She briefly closed her eyes to avoid rolling them.</p><p>\u201cNot your usual sort, is she?\u201d the duke asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed variety. She may look innocent, but in the bedchamber she\u2019s very surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she, now?\u201d The duke spoke to her. \u201cWell, then Melissande. Surely my friend will have told you, we\u2019re all friends at Winterset Grange. Aren\u2019t you going to show your host a bit of appreciation? Perhaps you could start with a kiss.\u201d</p> <p>Her stomach lurched.</p><p>Colin\u2019s arm tightened around her waist, lashing her to him and forbidding her to move. He said easily, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse her. She doesn\u2019t speak a word of English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word?\u201d The duke chuckled. \u201cParlez-vous francais?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo French, either. She hails from some tiny Alpine principality. Can\u2019t even recall the name of it. They have their own dialect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d The duke considered. \u201cFortunately, pleasure is a universal language.\u201d He swept a finger over Minerva\u2019s bared shoulder.</p><p>She glared at him, seething. Duke or no duke, ruse or no ruse, symposium or no symposium\u2014Minerva refused to abide such treatment. Even if she lacked a proper lady\u2019s beauty, accomplishments, and social graces, she was a gentlewoman and a free-thinking individual. She had her dignity.</p> <p>When Halford\u2019s presumptuous touch trailed downward, teasing toward her d\u00e9colletage, she bristled\u2014and smacked his hand away.</p><p>Then she bared her teeth and gave a little growl. Violence was a universal language, too.</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself, Halford.\u201d Colin tensed. No good humor in his voice now, only threat. \u201cThis one\u2019s not to be trifled with. A friend of my cousin\u2019s in the War Office asked me to keep on eye on her. There are rumors, suspicions. The Crown\u2019s intelligence suggests she\u2019s either a princess in exile or a cold-blooded assassin.\u201d</p><p>The duke gave a bark of laugher. \u201cJudging by that bruise on your jaw, my wager\u2019s on the latter. But speaking of wagers, come along. Everyone\u2019s in the card room.\u201d</p><p>The duke turned on his heel\u2014his bare heel, for he seemed to be wearing nothing beneath the banyan\u2014and padded down a long corridor.</p><p>Colin and Minerva lagged several steps behind.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m a cold-blooded assassin?\u201d she hissed. \u201cWhere do you come up with these things?\u201d</p><p>He shushed her, purposely slowing his paces so that they\u2019d drop even farther behind. \u201cIt\u2019s called improvisation, remember? I had to offer some explanation for your behavior.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of them, the duke called out to a friend as he turned a corner.</p><p>Once Halford was out of sight, Minerva stopped dead in the corridor, wrenching out of Colin\u2019s embrace. She didn\u2019t understand how he could do this to her\u2014be so protective and self-sacrificing one moment, and then so patronizing the next.</p><p>\u201cI do not deserve this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust because I made the mistake of accepting your . . . attentions . . . last night, that does not make me a whore. How dare you lump me in with those debased women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, those women would not call themselves debased. And what makes you think they\u2019re whores? Perhaps they\u2019re ladies, every bit as pedigreed and well-bred as you, who understand what you don\u2019t. How to enjoy themselves. How to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She jabbed a finger in her own chest. \u201cI understand how to enjoy myself. I understand how to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and drawled, \u201cOh, of course you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you.\u201d Now she jabbed the same finger in his chest. \u201cHow dare you bring me to this place and subject me to that leering, grabby duke.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her wrist and lowered his voice. \u201cHow dare I, indeed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to see his expression to know he was angry. The fury radiated from him.</p><p>\u201cHow dare I risk my life to save yours, when you all but threw yourself to the highwayman. How dare I bring you to a comfortable house, where we can find food and a night\u2019s shelter after a day of rambling woods and fields. How dare I.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid up her shoulders and stopped halfway between her head and neck. As though he were trying to decide whether to kiss her or throttle her.</p><p>She would put up a fight, either way.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into that card room now. We will eat, drink, and play their game. As soon as we\u2019re able, we\u2019ll slip upstairs and have a good night\u2019s sleep. I swear to you, you\u2019ll leave this house tomorrow morning with both your virtue and that disapproving personality intact\u2014tucked safe inside your little shell\u2014so long as you do two things.\u201d He gave her head a little shake. \u201cStay close to me and play your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part of a cold-blooded assassin? I could get inspired for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part of my lover.\u201d His fingers slid up and through her hair, dragging exquisite sensation over her scalp. \u201cSearch deep inside this clever mind, and try to see if you can\u2019t dredge up the imagination to pretend. To convince those around us that you find something in me to admire. That against all odds, you actually prefer my company to a clod of dirt.\u201d</p><p>The ragged hurt in his voice took her by surprise. So here was the reason for his changing moods and erratic behavior. Somehow, in attempting to guard her own fragile emotions, she\u2019d managed to make him feel lower than dirt.</p><p>\u201cColin . . .\u201d She stroked his lapel. \u201cI can convince them I like you. That won\u2019t require imagination.\u201d</p><p>This thumb traced her jaw, and his voice went husky. \u201cWon\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one will believe we\u2019re lovers. You heard those women laugh. You said it yourself, back in Spindle Cove. No one will believe you want me.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he slid his hands down her back. Cupping her backside in two hands, he lifted her and pressed her into the nearest alcove. The possession in his manner thrilled her, and so did the press of his hard, muscled body against hers.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her ear. \u201cWhat if I said I was an idiot that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you everything\u2019s changed?\u201d He kissed her neck. \u201cThat in the past four-and-twenty hours I\u2019ve wanted to murder three different men just for daring to touch you\u2014one of them a duke. That I am desperate with longing, consumed with wanting you. As I\u2019ve wanted no other woman in all my debauched, misspent life.\u201d</p><p>His tongue traced her pulse, and her breath caught. \u201cThen I would doubt you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . .\u201d Because I doubt myself. \u201cBecause I know how easily you lie.\u201d</p><p>He clutched her bottom, bringing her pelvis flush with his. His hardness ground against her, sending pleasure rushing through her veins.</p><p>\u201cFeel that?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She nodded. Good Lord, how could she not?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hard for you for days, Minerva. Since before we even left Spindle Cove. If you believe nothing else, believe this.\u201d He rocked against her. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>Colin was done pretending.</p><p>He ushered Minerva into the card room. After he\u2019d greeted the half dozen familiar faces assembled about the green felt tabletop and introduced his feisty foreign mistress-or-murderess Melissande, he took his own chair.</p><p>And taking Minerva by the hips, he put her on his lap. Nestled her sweet little backside on his left thigh, draped one arm about her shoulders, and let his hand dangle directly over her breast. With lazy motions, he traced the delicate border where her altered neckline chafed against her exposed d\u00e9colletage.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling her ear. While he was in the neighborhood, he took the chance to catch her tiny earlobe with his teeth.</p><p>In sum, he made the two of them very, very cozy. Not to create appearances for Halford\u2019s sake. Not to prove a point to her, or to anyone.</p><p>Simply because he wanted her. And he was done pretending otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWell, Payne.\u201d The duke reached for the deck of cards. \u201cThe game is brag.\u201d</p><p>Colin surveyed the coins and gambling tokens scattered on the table. \u201cStake me a sovereign\u2019s worth, will you? I\u2019m not carrying much coin on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course.\u201d The duke slid him two stacks of shillings, each ten pieces tall.</p><p>Minerva tensed in his lap.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he murmured against her hair. \u201cTrust me.\u201d She should understand this was necessary. A few hours at the card table earned their board and keep.</p><p>She made a doubtful noise in her throat. But she kept still.</p><p>\u201cBe a good host, Hal, and have one of these liveried jackanapes fetch my lady food and wine? She could do with some nourishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo could you, from the looks of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Colin grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ve quite exhausted each other over the past few days.\u201d</p><p>The gamblers around the table laughed heartily. The duke merely waved for servants to bring refreshments and began to deal the cards. Halford was always all business, in the card room.</p><p>Colin turned his attention to the cards. Minerva turned hers to the food.</p><p>She took care of him, in small ways. While he concentrated on the hand he was dealt, she had his glass filled with claret. Now she prepared for him a slice of roast pork, sandwiched between two halves of a buttered roll. In the process, she dabbed a bit of butter on her thumb. She put her thumb to her mouth and sucked it clean. Colin knew she didn\u2019t intend the motion to be coy or provocative. Which made it arousing as hell.</p><p>He\u2019d noted this about her, ever since that first night in the turret. There was an earthy, natural sensuality in her, but it only emerged when she felt confident. Or when she\u2019d had a little wine. He wondered what it would take to coax this Minerva out into the world, permanently. She would need a steady supply of assurance, he supposed. Perhaps her participation in the Royal Geological Society could give her that, to some degree. But the right man could do far more. The right man could plant seeds of confidence, deep inside her, and nurture them to healthy, robust vines that reached and stretched, offering sweet, bountiful fruit.</p><p>The only fruit she cared for at the moment was the plate of grapes and apricots before them. Filling her famished belly was clearly her primary goal, and she went about it with energy\u2014devouring wedges of cheese and slices of ham. When a passing servant offered her a tray of bite-sized tarts, she abandoned her wineglass with an eager gasp and reached for a tart with either hand.</p><p>She popped one in her mouth and offered the other to him.</p><p>Rather than take it with his fingers, he grasped her wrist to hold it steady. Then he devoured the morsel of pastry directly from her fingers, letting his tongue swirl over her fingertips. She sighed, and the little sound was more honey-sweet and sinfully delicious than a jam tart could ever hope to be.</p><p>Halford cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s your bet, Payne.\u201d</p><p>Colin shook himself and sent a shilling wobbling toward the center of the table. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>He played, they ate. When they\u2019d both consumed their fill, Colin waved for servants to remove the plates and trays.</p><p>Minerva made herself comfortable in his lap. Her fingers curled into the fringe of hair at his nape, toying idly. She stroked up and down the tendons of his neck, soothing away the tension coiled there. Little brushes of kindness he didn\u2019t deserve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pressed his lips to her ear and whispered, \u201cYou do know I\u2019m sorry? For earlier.\u201d</p><p>She gave a slight nod.</p><p>With a breathy groan, he slid his arm to her waist and gathered her close. She laid her head on his chest.</p> <p>He kissed her crown. \u201cSleep, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>She released a full-body sigh and melted in his embrace. This easy intimacy between them . . . it made sense, he supposed, given their adventures over the past few days and nights. But still, it came as a surprise.</p><p>He\u2019d been physically intimate with many women, and he\u2019d felt emotionally close to others. But thus far, he\u2019d assiduously worked to keep the two social spheres separate. There were women Colin counted as friends, and then there were women he bedded. Anytime he\u2019d allowed the two groups to overlap, it meant trouble.</p><p>Minerva Highwood had meant nothing but trouble to him, since the very first.</p><p>But by God, he\u2019d returned the favor. As she curled into his chest, she felt so small and fragile against him. In the past four-and-twenty hours, she\u2019d walked untold miles across the English countryside, surrendered all her money at gunpoint, pulled a knife on a highwayman, and entered a house that oozed such Bacchanalian excess as to send a gently-bred virgin screaming. And all this, just one day on the heels of her first proper orgasm.</p> <p>Never once had she dissolved into helpless tears. Or begged him to just please take her home. Not one woman in a hundred would handle herself so well in similar circumstances.</p><p>He made a vow to himself, then and there. If he did nothing else right in his life, he would do this: deliver Minerva Highwood to Edinburgh for her scientific presentation. On time, in one piece. And with her virtue intact.</p><p>Some way, somehow, he would make these good intentions come out right.</p><p>He gently stroked her hair and back with his left hand as he gathered his cards with the right. \u201cSleep,\u201d he murmured again.</p><p>As she shifted in his lap, her thigh rubbed against him. His body\u2019s reaction was immediate, instinctual. Blood rushed to his groin, hardening his cock and loosening his tenuous hold on those cherished principles. He wanted her physically, and he couldn\u2019t pretend otherwise.</p><p>But he must endeavor to hide this other, more visceral reaction\u2014the overwhelming, tenderness rising in his chest.</p> <p>The simple, unthinkable fact that he cared.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Once again, Minerva woke in his arms. She was growing accustomed to waking like this\u2014embraced by his heat, his strength, his clove-spiced scent. She didn\u2019t hurry to rouse herself, but hovered in that half-dream world for just a minute longer. Sighing into his waistcoat and hugging his neck tight.</p><p>She trusted this man. He was a known liar and shameless rake, but she trusted him. Enough to fall asleep in his arms amid all this debauchery.</p><p>She blinked at the card table, trying to bring the confusion of cards and coins into focus. How much time had passed? It felt very late. Most of the players seemed to have already retired for the night. Only Colin and Halford remained.</p><p>She stared hard at the heap of shilling pieces in front of them. Had he increased their funds enough to continue their journey? Those coins had numbered twenty at the outset of the game.</p><p>Now she counted . . .</p><p>Four.</p> <p>Her heart stopped. Oh, God. How could he? She\u2019d trusted him, and he was losing everything.</p><p>Then she shifted her gaze to the cards in Colin\u2019s hand. What she saw gave her reason to breathe again. His cards looked promising. She couldn\u2019t make them out exactly\u2014not without her spectacles. But she could see they were all red and they were all face cards. Simple logic told her, that had to add up to something good. A pair of knaves, at the least.</p><p>She looked to the center of the table, heaped with coins. More than enough money to replace what the highwayman had taken. Perhaps this was all part of Colin\u2019s plan.</p><p>\u201cA poxy pair of nines, that\u2019s all.\u201d The duke threw down his cards. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can do better, Payne.\u201d</p><p>Yes! He could. She curled her fingers around the edge of his waistcoat pocket, faint with excitement.</p><p>Colin held his silence for a time. \u201cSorry to prove you wrong, Hal,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you have me beat.\u201d He laid his cards facedown on the table before him.</p><p>With a greedy laugh, the Duke of Halford gathered his winnings.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s hand slipped from Colin\u2019s pocket. She was stunned. Aghast. Four shillings. They were down to four shillings now. She had to get him away from this card table before he lost everything they had.</p><p>But how? She couldn\u2019t even speak to him, thanks to his wild tales. These people all believed her to be Melissande, a refugee princess from some tiny Alpine principality. Or, alternatively, an assassin who just might garrote them all in their sleep. And in her spare time, Colin\u2019s mistress.</p><p>His worldly, sensual mistress.</p><p>Minerva bit her lip. Perhaps there was a way to lure him from this betting table without words.</p><p>Adjusting her weight in his lap, she stretched up one hand to stroke his hair. The heavy brown locks sifted between her fingers, stroking like feathers over her palm. With her other hand, she teased loose his cravat knot until the entire length of fabric slid from his neck in a slow, sensual glide. She thought she heard him moan, a little.</p><p>She nuzzled into his neck. The scent of brandy clung to his skin, dark and intoxicating. Without her spectacles, at this close range, he was little more than an unshaven blur. But he was an achingly handsome blur, nonetheless. Craning her neck, she kissed his cheek.</p><p>His breath caught, and she almost lost her nerve to continue. But she\u2019d started this, and now there was no retreating.</p><p>Tilting her head, she pressed a kiss to the underside of his jaw.</p><p>Across the table, the duke gave a dry laugh.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s heart stalled. She froze, lips pressed to Colin\u2019s unshaven throat. What had she been thinking? A brazen seductress? Her? Of course Halford wouldn\u2019t believe it. No one in his right mind would believe it.</p><p>\u201cPayne,\u201d the duke said, \u201cperhaps you\u2019d care to sit out this round? It would seem the fetching Melissande needs putting to bed.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed in his throat. \u201cShe can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the duke replied, with a knowing chuckle. \u201cBut can you? I\u2019ve never seen a man\u2019s knuckles quite that shade of pale.\u201d</p><p>Exhilaration swarmed through her body. Halford did believe it. Colin was affected. She was a seductress. But she still hadn\u2019t succeeded in her goal\u2014pulling Colin away from the card table.</p><p>Minerva redoubled her efforts. She wove her fingers tight into his hair. She licked his neck, dragging her tongue from his pulse to his earlobe. With the tip of her tongue, she traced his ear\u2019s every whorl and ridge.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTake me upstairs. Now.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s hand fisted in the back of her dress, stealing her breath with a swift yank. But the sharp, secret rebuke only inflamed Minerva\u2019s rebellious nature. Whose idea had it been for her to play this role? He had no right to complain. Besides, a part of her was enjoying this. Judging by the hard, heated ridge pulsing against her thigh, a part of him was enjoying it, too.</p><p>This doesn\u2019t lie.</p><p>She kissed his collarbone, dropping her fingers to his shirt closures. Slipping loose one, then two, and snaking her fingers inside to caress his smooth, muscled chest.</p><p>The duke observed, \u201cYou\u2019re getting rather low in your stack, Payne. Since you\u2019re so uninterested in enjoying Melissande yourself, perhaps you\u2019d care to make a friendly wager. I\u2019d lay a great deal of money against such obvious and abundant . . . charms.\u201d</p><p>Minerva had to work, very hard, not to betray her understanding with a sour look. Or a violent heave of her stomach.</p><p>Colin tensed as well. \u201cTread with caution, Halford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s not as though she can understand a word we say.\u201d The duke shuffled and dealt the cards. \u201cOne hand, one winner. You put your girl on the table, and I\u2019ll toss in one of mine. Whoever wins can enjoy double the amusement tonight.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in Colin\u2019s body went instantly hard as stone. One of his hands balled in a fist. The other went to the pistol tucked at his hip.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s blood turned icy in her veins. These protective impulses were all well and good, but the last thing she needed was for Colin to start trouble with the duke. They\u2019d be cast out from Winterset Grange\u2014running through the night this time, with nothing but the clothes on their backs.</p><p>A matter of minutes stood between them and disaster. But she could tell from his stormy expression, Colin wasn\u2019t thinking more than ten seconds into the future.</p><p>Lifting Minerva off his lap, he pushed to his feet. He leveled a finger at the duke. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>Smack.</p><p>Minerva slapped him, square across the face.</p><p>Colin blinked at her, clearly stunned.</p><p>She lifted her shoulders. He\u2019d left her no choice. She had to stop the men\u2019s argument somehow. And Colin couldn\u2019t start a fight with the duke if she started a fight with Colin first. So . . .</p><p>Smack. She used her left hand this time, whipping his head the other direction.</p><p>Then she stood back, seething as dramatically as she imagined a dark-haired Alpine princess-assassin with hot blood could possibly seethe. Adopting a nonspecific accent\u2014something halfway between Italian and French\u2014she narrowed her eyes and said, \u201cYoooo. Bass. Tard.\u201d</p><p>His brow wrinkled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cYoo!\u201d She shoved at his chest with both hands. \u201cBass. Tard.\u201d</p><p>Rising from his chair, Halford laughed. \u201cI believe she\u2019s calling you a bastard, friend. You\u2019re in for it now. Seems the wench understands a bit of English after all. Whoops.\u201d</p><p>At last, Colin caught on. \u201cB-b-but Melissande, I can explain.\u201d</p><p>She circled him, snarling. \u201cBass. Tard. Bass. Tard.\u201d</p><p>When he spoke again, she could tell he was struggling not to laugh. \u201cCalm down, pet. And whatever you do . . . please, I beg you, don\u2019t go into one of your fits of wild temper and uncontrollable passion.\u201d</p><p>Incorrigible rogue. She had no doubt he meant that as a dare.</p><p>Well, then. She would accept it.</p><p>Minerva reached for a glass of claret on the table. She downed most of it in a single gulp, then dashed the remainder straight in Colin\u2019s face. Wine splashed them both. Ruby-red rivulets streaked down his stunned expression.</p><p>With a little growl, she threw herself at him, catching him by the shoulders and wrapping her legs over his hips. She licked the wine from his face, running her tongue over his cheeks, his chin . . . even his eyebrows. And then she ended her madwoman mistress performance with a slow, deep, savage kiss on the lips that had him moaning into her mouth and clutching her backside in both hands.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d she growled against his lips. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>At last, he carried her from the room. And kissed her until they were halfway down the corridor. There he stopped, apparently unable to hold back the laughter one moment more. He pressed her to the wall and wheezed helplessly into her neck, shaking with laughter.</p><p>Well, she was glad someone found this amusing.</p><p>Still laughing, he set her on her feet and tugged her up a flight of stairs and down a side corridor. He flung open the door of a suite, obviously familiar to him. In decor, it suffered the same excess of gold leaf and dearth of good taste as the rest of Winterset Grange.</p><p>\u201cOh, Min. That was excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u201d\u2014she banged the door shut\u2014\u201dwas humiliating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a first-rate mistress performance.\u201d He shrugged out of his coat, set aside the pistol, and began unbuttoning his waistcoat. \u201cWhat the devil was that, with the . . . the licking, and the wine? And how on earth did you think to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called improvisation! Running down the slope and all.\u201d She thrust her hands through her wild, unbound hair, making a frantic survey of the room until she found Francine\u2019s trunk, tucked neatly beneath a scroll-legged side table. \u201cI had to get you away from the card table before you lost all our money and ruined everything. We already owe him sixteen shillings from my sovereign. Aren\u2019t debts of honor supposed to be paid immediately?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She crossed to him and boldly reached inside his waistcoat. As her fingers brushed against his chest, she heard his breath catch.</p><p>\u201cI need these,\u201d she explained, suddenly timid. She withdrew her spectacles from his inside pocket and fit them on her face. It felt good to put the room in focus.</p><p>She only wished the lenses could help her make Colin out. Just what had he been doing downstairs? Trying to end their journey here? Perhaps he\u2019d had enough of her and Francine and had decided he\u2019d rather sponge off the duke\u2019s generosity at Winterset Grange until his birthday.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Shilling Club,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play with shillings, but they stand for a hundred pounds each.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred pounds?

She pressed a hand to her brow. \u201cBut how will we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d He removed the waistcoat and set it aside. \u201cI always lose, I never pay. They know I\u2019ll be good for it in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why lose at all? I could make out your cards on that last hand. They were better than the duke\u2019s. You let him win.\u201d</p><p>He tugged loose his cravat and slung it over the back of a chair. \u201cYes, well . . . everyone loves a gracious loser. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always welcome at any card table, any evening, here or in London. I have no shortage of friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFriends.\u201d She spat the word. \u201cWhat makes people like that your friends? The fact that they\u2019ll allow you to sit at their table and lose heaps of money? That hardly fits any definition of friendship I know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Merely sat on the edge of the bed to remove his boots.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t respect you, Colin. How could they? They don\u2019t know you at all. Not the real you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you an expert on the real me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not even certain you know who you are. You just become whomever the situation requires.\u201d</p><p>He kicked his boots aside and passed wordlessly into a connecting room. Presumably a dressing or bathing area. She heard the sounds of water splashing into a basin.</p> <p>She raised her voice. \u201cI mean, I am beginning to notice a pattern. All your guises are variations on the same theme. The charming, fun-loving rogue with the not-so-deeply hidden pain. Obviously, it works for you nicely. But doesn\u2019t it grow tiresome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiresome indeed.\u201d He strolled back into the room with his hair damp and his shirt untucked and cuffed to the elbows. \u201cMin, please. I\u2019m a little drunk and extremely fatigued. Can we hold the rest of this character dissection for the morning?\u201d</p><p>She released a sigh. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get in bed. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>With a bit of contortion, she managed to undo the hooks at the back of her gown. She drew the tattered, wine-stained silk down over her hips and cast it aside on the chaise longue. The thought that she had nothing else to wear tomorrow was lowering indeed. At least in the morning, she could ring for a proper bath. For now, she did her best with the washbasin and soap.</p><p>After rebuttoning her shift, she lay down on the bed next to him, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>A few minutes passed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. Something lay heavy on her mind, and she didn\u2019t have anyone else to tell. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know me, either.\u201d</p><p>His reply was groggy. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Alisdair Kent.\u201d At the mention of his name, she felt the sudden tensing from Colin\u2019s side of the bed. \u201cI mean, he knows of my scientific findings, and he admires my intellect. But he doesn\u2019t know the real me. I\u2019ve conducted all my Society business through written correspondence, and I\u2019ve always signed myself M. R. Highwood. So Sir Alisdair . . . well, he thinks I\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>Several moments passed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in for a great surprise.\u201d</p><p>She giggled up at the ceiling. \u201cIndeed he is.\u201d Whether it would be a pleasant or unpleasant surprise, she was afraid to guess.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s odd, \u201c he said. \u201cThere was genuine affection in that letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMere friendly interest, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so convinced. Perhaps he\u2019s in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave a queer flutter. Not at the idea, but at the sound of that word from his lips: love.</p><p>\u201cHow could that be?\u201d She rolled onto her side, bending her elbow and propping her head with her hand. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said? Sir Alisdair thinks I\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I heard you.\u201d Devilish eyes slid to meet hers. \u201cPerhaps he thinks you\u2019re a man, and he\u2019s in love with you. Poor fellow has some heartbreak ahead of him, if so.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, unsure of his implications.</p><p>He chuckled low. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to me, pet. My bollocks are aching, and my pride is smarting. I\u2019m foxed, and I\u2019m feeling very wicked tonight. If you know what\u2019s best for you, you\u2019ll ignore me and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are your bollocks aching?\u201d She sat up. \u201cWere you injured somehow? Was it the highwayman?\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he threw his wrist over his eyes. \u201cMy dear girl, you might be a brilliant geologist, but your grasp of biology is dim indeed.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze to the front of his breeches. They were impressively tented.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, M.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will. Not yet.\u201d With sudden determination, she plucked at the buttons of his falls. She had one side completely unfastened before he managed to struggle up on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulging my curiosity.\u201d She snaked her hand under the fabric, and he flinched. A heady surge of power rushed through her. The wine she\u2019d drunk downstairs was doing its work, melting away her inhibitions. She wanted to know and see and touch it\u2014this most honest, real part of him.</p><p>This doesn\u2019t lie.</p><p>She said, \u201cI did as you asked and played your mistress downstairs, and I\u2019ve earned this much. I want to see and touch it properly. I never had the chance, before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo be calm. What was it you told me? Think of it as an . . . an excavation.\u201d Smiling, she curled her fingers around his hard, hot length. \u201cIt\u2019s in the name of science.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s in the name of science.</p><p>Hah. That was a first-rate line, that was. Ranked right up there with, \u201cYou could save my life tonight,\u201d and \u201cDarling, teach me what it means to love.\u201d Colin made a mental note to remember that one for the future.</p><p>Then her hand closed around his swollen cock, and his mental slate blanked.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d he heard himself mutter. This was dangerous. He was half drunk and scarcely in control of himself as it was.</p><p>Rules, he reminded himself. He had rules.</p><p>But curiously, none of them covered virginal caressing in the name of science. Leave it to Minerva Highwood to transform bedsport into a completely new endeavor.</p><p>She held him gently for a moment, rubbing her thumb up and down the underside of his cock. The slight, delicious friction did more to tease than satisfy. Then she released her grip and began tugging down his breeches and smallclothes, wrestling them over his hips.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the way,\u201d she explained, when he sent her a scandalized look.</p><p>He let his head fall back on the pillow, resigned. He had no idea how to arrest this scientific exploration, and truthfully\u2014no desire to do so anyway. He helped her by lifting his hips and kicking out of his breeches, once she had the fabric bunched around his knees.</p><p>\u201cOh, why stop there,\u201d he muttered, gathering his shirt in both hands and drawing it over his head before flopping back onto the mattress. \u201cThere. Now you have your life model. Explore at will.\u201d</p><p>And she did. She explored his body\u2014every inch of it\u2014at a leisurely pace that made him fair crazed with desire. He began to regret offering himself as a subject of experimentation. When she dragged a light touch down the center of his chest, a damned snail could have raced her fingertip.</p><p>Too exhausted and intoxicated to do otherwise, Colin simply lay there and endured. Suffered her slow, sweet exploration of his arms, chest, abdomen\u2014God, his nipples. He emitted a sound that he feared was not quite manly when she grazed his nipples. All the while, his ignored cock leaped and strained for her attention, arcing up to his navel in what he assumed must be quite livid shades of plum and dusky red.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean to torture me,\u201d he gritted out, \u201cyou\u2019re doing an excellent job of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d She skipped her fingers over his collarbone. She was deliberately teasing him now, the minx.</p><p>With a curse, he grabbed her hand and dragged her touch where they both wanted it. The relief was immediate, intense. And nowhere near enough.</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d She spoke the word in an awed, highly gratifying tone that made him wonder why he didn\u2019t debauch virgins more often. \u201cIt\u2019s so very . . . stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it that way.\u201d Unable to resist, he curled his hand over hers and silently urged her to grip tighter, showing her how to stroke. She obliged him for a few tantalizing pulls.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call it?\u201d she asked. \u201cI know there are different names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames? Like Peter, Belvedere, Sir Charles Grandison?\u201d His breath was shaky. \u201cIt\u2019s just my cock, pet.\u201d</p><p>She stroked down to the root and grasped the base tight. \u201cYour cock.\u201d</p><p>Oh, holy God. She drove him wild when she talked that way.</p><p>\u201cI quite like your cock. Smooth as talc on the outside.\u201d She slid her hand up again. \u201cBut like granite beneath.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. A strained, ha, ha, ha, I may die of this laugh. \u201cWell. We both know how you love rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love rocks, as a matter of fact.\u201d A coquettish smile crept into her voice. \u201cI find them utterly fascinating. I\u2019m forever taking them in hand. Exploring their every ridge and contour.\u201d She skimmed a petal-soft fingertip over the head of his cock, tracing the flared ridge of the crown and the dewy slit at the tip. Then her touch teased down his length, all the way to the root. \u201cSome of them have very interesting veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you ever\u2014in the name of science, of course\u2014put these utterly fascinating objects in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He slapped a hand over his eyes. This\u2014this\u2014was why he had the rules about virgins. The lewd request had just flowed out of him, in a lascivious drawl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m drunk, Min.\u201d He waved his hand in dismissal. \u201cForget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget you said that?\u201d Her hand gripped his cock tight, as if she could wring an answer from its tip. \u201cWhat a suggestion. Do women really . . .\u201d She swallowed, audibly. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hear a very bald, very earthy, completely scientific truth?\u201d He struggled up on his elbow, reaching one hand toward her face. He cupped her cheek in his hand, traced her parted lips with his thumb. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered hoarsely, \u201chave the most goddamned erotic mouth I\u2019ve ever seen. These sweet, plump lips drive me wild. It\u2019s impossible to look at you and not . . . not wonder, how it would be.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cYou\u2019ve wondered.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOh yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019ve actually spent time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHours, probably, if you added it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He slid his thumb between her startled lips, pressing it deep into her hot, wet mouth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other, unmoving. Then, after a prolonged, excruciating hesitation, she closed her lips around his thumb. Her tongue curled beneath it, gently tickling. Stroking. A bolt of sensation shot straight to his cock. He groaned with helpless pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, yes. That\u2019s the way.\u201d He slid his thumb out half an inch, then pushed it in again, deeper. Her cheeks hollowed as she lightly suckled. \u201cYou are unspeakably clever, Min. And so . . . so damned lovely.\u201d</p><p>She moaned a little as he withdrew his thumb from her mouth. Her lips cinched him so tightly, he heard a small popping sound when it finally slipped free.</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d he muttered, collapsing to the mattress. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p> <p>She regarded his cock, holding it steady in her grip and giving it a bold, assessing look. Just the thought of watching his length disappear into her mouth . . . it was almost enough to bring him off, right then.</p><p>But then his damned conscience caught up with him. \u201cMin, you needn\u2019t . . . hell, you really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You want it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith every corpuscle in my body, believe me. But I can\u2019t ask it. And you shouldn\u2019t offer. It would . . . it would make things awkward in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She convulsed with laughter. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. Because we\u2019ve been getting along so smoothly as it is.\u201d</p> <p>With a toss of her head, she flipped that mane of long, dark wavy hair over her shoulder, and then her head\u2014that enticing mouth\u2014began a slow yet steady descent. She was true scientific adventuress, this girl.</p><p>Rules.</p><p>He had to have some rule against this. And even if he didn\u2019t have a standing rule\u2014any code of conduct that allowed him to slide his cock into a virgin\u2019s mouth but not her cunny? Well, that code probably needed some rethinking.</p><p>But then her sweet kiss was upon him. And then he was in the hot, slick heaven of her mouth. No more thinking would happen tonight.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he moaned, as her warmth enveloped him. \u201cOh, Minerva.\u201d</p><p>Her lips slid downward, slipping over the swollen crown of his erection and partway down the shaft. Then she suckled lightly, her tongue caressing him in sweet waves. His hips arched off the bed, and he cursed.</p> <p>She pulled away, leaving his cock glistening, aching, and quite possibly hard enough to crush stone. Colin struggled to master his disappointment. She\u2019d performed her experiment, and now she was satisfied. He would not, could not ask for more.</p><p>But rather than abandon him entirely, she began to press little kisses up and down his length. He closed his eyes, reveling in the coy whispers of sensation. It was the sweetest torture he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>When she took him in her mouth again, he slid deeper this time. Near halfway inside. Her slow, slippery retreat drove him wild with need. He writhed on the bedclothes, grappling for restraint.</p><p>No restraint to be found.</p><p>Rutting bass-tard that he was, he reached for her and did what he\u2019d been longing to do for ages. He tangled his hand in all that dark, silky hair and made a tight fist. And then he guided her, teaching her how to please him. Dragging her lush, hot mouth up and down his length, in a deep, steady rhythm.</p><p>He was a cad. He was a monster. He was going to burn in the fires of hell.</p><p>It would be worth it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he told her, wincing at the exquisite pleasure. \u201cMin, that\u2019s so good. You\u2019re so good.\u201d</p> <p>He relaxed his grip on her hair, and she backed off him again, sitting straight.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He gulped for air. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to continue.\u201d As if that made him some kind of generous saint.</p><p>She only smiled. First, she removed her spectacles, folded them, and set them aside. Then she readjusted her position, hiking her shift to her knees and straddling his sprawled leg as she bent to once again take him in her mouth.</p><p>He groaned. She was such a quick study. This was serious now. Shameless, he watched those plump, ripe lips sliding up down his cock. The tight, wet friction was only part of the pleasure. The rest came from the sweet triumph of being stroked by her, pleased by her. Most of all, just being inside her, in some way. He\u2019d been wanting this so damn badly. Those nights of lying next to her, wanting to be inside her. To be part of her.</p><p>To feel joined, and not alone.</p><p>He stroked a fond caress down her body and reached for the hem of her shift, drawing it up. He slid a hand beneath the frail linen, sliding a touch up the bare expanse of her thigh. She moaned, spreading her legs a little. He took the encouragement, stroking higher still. Until he cupped her sex in his hand, dewy and flushed, guarded by enticing curls.</p><p>Yes. God, yes.</p><p>He slid a finger between her slippery folds, rubbing up and down her sex. She whimpered and ground her hips, seeking his touch. He slipped his middle finger inside her tight sheath, moving in slow, shallow thrusts that she began to mimic with her mouth. When he moved faster, so did she. When he pressed his finger deeper, she sank down, taking him almost to the root.</p><p>The pleasure was so acute, so intense. He couldn\u2019t take much more of this.</p><p>He cupped his hand, so that the heel of his palm would rub against her pearl. Moaning with pleasure, she pressed into his touch. She rolled her hips at a brisk, frantic pace, and for the first time, her own rhythm faltered.</p><p>\u201cMin,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>She lifted her head, glassy-eyed and flushed with arousal. His left hand remained blissfully lodged between her thighs. He put his right hand over hers where she gripped the base of his erection.</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d He dragged her hand up and down. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They worked each other in a firm, steady rhythm, staring into one another\u2019s eyes as the pleasure mounted. Until her eyelids flickered closed, and little frown lines appeared between her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cYes, love. That\u2019s it.\u201d His own head rolled back on the pillow, as he stroked them both faster. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cried out. Her intimate muscles clenched and pulsed around the buried girth of his finger. And then his own climax erupted, sending pure bliss quaking through his body and white light flashing behind his eyelids.</p><p>In the aftermath, he kept his eyes closed. He slid his finger from her sex and drew her shift back down her thighs. His chest rose and fell with his heavy breaths. He tried to coax her down to lie beside him, but she stayed where she was\u2014straddling his leg, hand curled around his flagging erection.</p><p>Now that curiosity had been satisfied and her own need slaked, he expected her to recoil from him. Surely she\u2019d realize how callously he\u2019d just used her, and what liberties he\u2019d taken with her body and her trust. He fully expected her to hate and loathe him with a renewed\u2014nay, unprecedented passion.</p><p>When he finally summoned the fortitude to lift his head and gauge her reaction, he found her replacing her spectacles. Her expression did not hint at hatred or loathing, but rather . . .</p><p>Scientific interest. Of course.</p><p>\u201cOh, Colin.\u201d She dabbed a fingertip to his sticky abdomen, then rubbed her fingers together, as though testing the quality of his seed. \u201cThat was fascinating.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>He\u2019d been right. Things were a bit awkward in the morning.</p><p>Leaving Colin to his sleep, Minerva crept out of bed as stealthily as possible and rang for the maid. She met the servant at the door to the suite, using ridiculous pantomime to ask for a hot bath drawn in the adjoining room.</p><p>She felt a pinch of anxiety as the servants brought up the heated water and tub, cringing to imagine how this all looked. A young, unmarried woman sharing a room with a naked, sleeping lord? But the maids acted bored and businesslike, not shocked. Minerva soon realized that for servants at Winterset Grange, this was hardly a scandal. It was merely . . . Friday.</p><p>Lord, it was Friday. The number of days before the symposium was dwindling, and here they\u2019d barely made it one third of the way to Edinburgh.</p><p>Despite the urgency that calculation implied, she took her time in the bath. The maids had brought her scented oils and soaps, rose petals for the bathwater and cool cucumber slices to soothe her eyes. Minerva accepted assistance in washing her hair. Then she dismissed the servants and lingered in the tub until the water went cool, feeling the soreness and tension ebb from her muscles.</p><p>As she toweled dry, she rued the fact she had nothing to wear but the same beleaguered shift and ruined silk gown from yesterday. Perhaps there were spare clothes to be found somewhere in this house, but she didn\u2019t know that she could stomach wearing some mistress\u2019s castoffs. But then her eye fell on her trunk. The trunk that held Francine\u2019s footprint, Minerva\u2019s scholarly notes, and . . .</p><p>Her trousseau.</p><p>Wrapped in the towel, she padded across the room and undid the buckles on the trunk. Carefully laying aside all her journals and papers, she removed the rolls of white cloth padding the plaster cast. For the most part, these bulky cylinders of white were embroidered bed sheets and tablecloths and pillowcases. But there were other items, of a more personal nature.</p><p>Lacy chemises. Gauzy fichus. Bosom-lifting corsets. Silk stockings and ribbon garters.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten these things, tucked inside her trunk for years now. It had seemed she\u2019d never have a use for such sensual, indulgent attire. She\u2019d all but given up on the idea of marriage.</p><p>After this journey\u2014heavens, after last night\u2014marriage seemed less likely than ever. But that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t use these things, or that she must deny this side of herself. The items in this trunk were elegant and sensual, and they were hers. Whether or not she had a husband to display them for.</p><p>She unfurled a pristine white chemise, low-cut in both the front and back and worked with lace at the neckline. Setting aside the sprig of dried lavender tucked inside for freshness, she drew the sheer fabric over her body and stood before the mirror.</p><p>Twisting to view herself from different angles, she ran her hands down her torso, pulling the sheer fabric tight. Until the wine-colored buds of her nipples showed through, and the dark triangle between her legs as well. She skimmed her hands down her body again, enjoying the soft heat of her flesh beneath the cool fabric. The gentle curves of her breasts, belly, and hips. As she watched her own hands stroking over her skin, her pulse quickened.</p><p>This body wanted.</p><p>This body was wanted, by him.</p><p>In the bedchamber, Colin stirred and mumbled in his sleep. Minerva jumped, then pressed her hands to her mouth to keep from laughing aloud.</p><p>She donned a pair of sheer silk stockings and tied them with pink ribbons. She called the maid back in to lace her into a French divorce corset that lifted and separated her breasts to quite flattering effect. With reluctance, she put on the blue silk again. But the effect was much better with her pristine, lacy chemise peeking out at the top. And she found an embroidered white overskirt in her trunk, rather like a pinafore. It covered most of the wine stains.</p><p>Her hair was still damp, so rather than pin it all up, she merely gathered a few locks from the front and secured them with tortoiseshell combs. The rest of her hair hung loose and heavy about her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Colin tangled in the sheets, propped up on one elbow and rubbing his unshaven face with the other hand.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, resisting the urge to make a girlish twirl and beg for his approval.</p><p>He blinked and focused his gaze. A smile crooked his lips. \u201cWell, Min. Don\u2019t you look pretty.\u201d</p><p>Giddy joy fizzed through her. It was a simple compliment, but a perfect one. She would have doubted him, if he\u2019d called her \u201clovely\u201d or \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201cstunning.\u201d But \u201cpretty\u201d? That, she could almost believe.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked. She wouldn\u2019t mind hearing it again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the picture of a fetching country lass.\u201d His gaze raked over her body and lingered on her enhanced, lace-framed cleavage. \u201cYou make me want to find a hayloft.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, just as she supposed any fetching country lass would.</p><p>He yawned. \u201cHow long have you been out of bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour. Perhaps more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t wake?\u201d His brow wrinkled. \u201cRemarkable.\u201d</p><p>The maid brought a breakfast tray. While Colin rose from bed and went about his own toilette, Minerva feasted on coddled eggs, buttered rolls, and chocolate.</p><p>\u201cDid you save me any?\u201d he asked, strolling back into the room some quarter-hour later.</p><p>She looked up, saw him, and let her spoon clatter to the table. \u201cNow, that\u2019s just unfair.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen minutes. Twenty, at most. And in that time, he\u2019d bathed, shaved, and dressed in a spotless pair of new breeches and a crisp, laundered shirt.</p><p>Perhaps she looked \u2018pretty,\u2019 or \u2018fetching.\u2019 But he looked magnificent.</p><p>He adjusted his cuff. \u201cI always keep a few items of clothing here. No coat though, unhappily. I\u2019m stuck with the same one I\u2019ve been wearing.\u201d</p><p>It was petty of her, to take that as some consolation. But she did.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d He sat down across from her and plucked a thick slice of toast. \u201cAbout last night.\u201d</p> <p>She flinched. \u201cMust we discuss last night?\u201d</p><p>He buttered his toast in slow, even strokes. \u201cI think we must. Some apologies are probably in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Nodding, she swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>He choked on his bite of toast.</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou were exhausted and more than a little drunk, and I was unspeakably shameless.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and made noises of disagreement. He washed his toast down with a quick sip of tea.</p> <p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d He reached across the table to touch her cheek. \u201cYou were . . . a revelation. Believe me, you have absolutely no reason to apologize. The shamelessness was all mine.\u201d His eyes grew troubled. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should continue this journey, pet. I told myself I\u2019d see you to Scotland unharmed. But if we continue sharing a bed, I\u2019m at serious risk of harming you. Irrevocably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow lifted. \u201cI think you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>She did know. He meant that he wanted her, more than he\u2019d wanted any woman in his debauched, misspent life\u2014and he wasn\u2019t certain he could honor his promise not to seduce her.</p><p>Her pulse pounded. With exhilaration, with fear. \u201cBut we can\u2019t go back now. We can\u2019t just give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could be back in London tonight. I\u2019d take you to Bram and Susanna\u2019s house, and we can tell everyone you\u2019ve been their guest all this time. There may be some talk, but if my cousin throws his name behind you\u2014you won\u2019t be ruined.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the tablecloth. The thought of simply turning around and returning to Spindle Cove, without ever reaching Edinburgh . . . she\u2019d been prepared to go back ruined and disgraced. But she didn\u2019t know that she could live with going back defeated.</p><p>And how could she return to her old life, and just pretend none of this ever happened? Impossible.</p> <p>\u201cMin . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do this, Colin. We can reach Edinburgh in time. And I can keep you in your place, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. I\u2019ll go back to being shrewish and unattractive. I\u2014I\u2019ll stash a cudgel under my pillow.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m satisfied now. You know, in terms of my curiosity. After last night, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen all there is to see.\u201d</p><p>His voice darkened in a thrilling way. \u201cBelieve me. You haven\u2019t seen a fraction of what I could show you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t tell me that.</p><p>\u201cColin, please.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them. \u201cThink of the money. Think of the five hundred guineas.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the money, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen think of Francine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of what she represents. What if long ago, before the first man ever drew breath, there were creatures like her everywhere? Giant lizards, roaming the earth. Even flying through the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . .\u201d She could tell he was struggling not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI know you find it amusing, but I\u2019m being serious. Discoveries like her footprint, they\u2019re changing history\u2014or at least, our understanding of it. And there are a good many people who don\u2019t like that. Geologists might seem boring, but we\u2019re really renegades.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been with a great many women, but Francine just might be the most scandalous, heretical female to ever share your bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>He did laugh then, good-naturedly.</p><p>Impulsively, she grabbed his hand. \u201cColin, please don\u2019t take this from me. This is my dream, and I\u2019ve already risked so much. I\u2019d rather fail than forfeit.\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep breath.</p><p>She held hers.</p><p>\u201cHalford never rises before noon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should slip out as soon as possible, to avoid questions.\u201d</p><p>The relief seeped through her, warm and sweet.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d She reached for his hand and squeezed it. \u201cBut we have so little money. Where will we go?\u201d</p><p>He bit into his toast and chewed. With a shrug, he eventually answered, \u201cNorth.\u201d</p><p>It was truly amazing, she thought, how far a man could travel on charm alone. By midmorning, Colin had wheedled them a chain of rides with tradesmen and farmers, working them toward a place where they could rejoin the Great North Road.</p><p>After pausing to chat with a local gentleman farmer, he strode back to Minerva where she waited by a rail fence.</p><p>He squinted at her through the bright morning sunlight. \u201cHe says he can offer us a ride to Grantham this afternoon, in exchange for a few hours\u2019 work this morning. He has his farmhands thatching a cottage roof. If we help, we can have space in his wagon afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ride all the way to Grantham? That would be wonderful. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cI take it he doesn\u2019t realize you\u2019re a viscount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA viscount? Wearing this?\u201d Smiling, he indicated his dusty, bedraggled topcoat. The fabric retained just a memory of its original deep blue. His boots hadn\u2019t been blacked in days. \u201cNot a chance. He assumes us to be common travelers, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d How to put this in a way that wouldn\u2019t offend his pride? \u201cColin, have you ever thatched a roof before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said gamely, helping her lift Francine\u2019s trunk over the stile. \u201cThis is my grand opportunity.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>They crossed a hopfield, lined with neat rows of poles and ambitious green tendrils just starting to climb them. Minerva could see the cottage in the distance. Several men were scaling ladders and carting up bundles of fresh, golden longstraw to layer on the roof. They looked like ants swarming over a dish heaped with yellow custard.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Colin removed his cravat and wound it around the pistol before shoving both into his coat pocket. Then he removed the coat altogether and handed it to her. \u201cLook after this.\u201d</p><p>With that, he joined the men at their labor. Minerva found herself quickly drafted into the women\u2019s portion, sorting and bundling the straw as it was forked from the wagon. She supposed if she could be a convincing missionary or assassin, she ought to be able to do this. After all, she was used to working long hours with her rock hammer.</p><p>An hour later, her back was aching and her exposed forearms had acquired a thousand tiny abrasions. Her head felt swollen with the thick, sweet scent of the straw. She wasn\u2019t particularly good at the work, and she could sense that she was coasting by on the other women\u2019s forbearance. But she wouldn\u2019t give up.</p><p>She stood tall for a minute to stretch her back. Shading her eyes with one hand, she scanned for Colin among the men. There he was, near the top of the roof, fearlessly straddling two rafters. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation or a hint of imbalance, he walked across ten feet of narrow, sloping beam to accept a fresh bundle of straw. Of course, he\u2019d taken to this easily\u2014the same way he took to everything.</p><p>She watched him for a few minutes. Placing the straw in a thick layer, then pinning it down with twists of split hazel. He lifted a flat-head tool that looked something between a currycomb and a mallet. With swift, strong arcs of his arm, he pounded the thatch into place. He paused to wipe his brow and toss a comment to his fellow laborers. From the way they all laughed, she supposed it must have been a good joke.</p><p>Minerva found herself caught between admiration and envy. She seemed doomed to move through life feeling the perpetual outsider, whereas Colin could fit in anywhere. But for the first time, she saw his charm in a different light. Not as lubricant, of either a social or sexual variety, but simply as an expression of his true self.</p><p>He caught sight of her and lifted a hand in greeting. \u201cTallyho!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile and shake her head, whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re cracked.\u201d</p><p>Cracked indeed.</p><p>Cracked open, more like. Come out of his shell.</p><p>How funny. He was forever chiding Minerva, telling her to emerge from her protective cage. But didn\u2019t everyone have a shell? Hard, external armor protecting the soft, vulnerable creature beneath?</p><p>Perhaps, she thought, people were more like ammonites than one would suppose. Perhaps they too built shells on a consistent, unchanging factor\u2014some quality or circumstance established in their youth. Each chamber in the shell just an enlargement of the previous. Growing year after year, until they spiraled around and locked themselves in place.</p><p>Colin\u2019s shell had been formed by tragedy. His parents\u2019 death had defined the shape of that first protective chamber. He\u2019d owned it, grown to fill the shape of it, enlarged it with room after mournful, troubled room. But what if the person inside those many hollow, echoing chambers wasn\u2019t a tragedy at all? Just a man who genuinely enjoyed life and loved people, but happened to have two dead parents and a stubborn case of insomnia?</p><p>And who was she, beneath all her layers? A bookish, awkward girl who couldn\u2019t be bothered to care for anything but fossils and rocks? Or a bold, adventurous woman who\u2019d risked everything\u2014not on the hopes of achieving professional acclaim, but on the slim chance of love. Of finding that one person who could understand her, appreciate her, and let her understand and appreciate him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t lie. In Spindle Cove, she\u2019d entertained vain fancies that Sir Alisdair Kent might be that man. But now, looking back, she had to own another difficult truth. Whenever she\u2019d imagined herself with Sir Alisdair\u2014gazing deep into eyes that reflected acceptance, desire, affection, and trust\u2014those eyes had looked a great deal like Bristol diamonds. And they were anchored by a strong jaw and single, reluctant dimple.</p><p>She was so confused. In the immediate future, she wanted\u2014needed\u2014to share Francine\u2019s footprint with the scientific community. Beyond that, Minerva didn\u2019t know what she wanted anymore. And even if she could discern what future she wanted . . .</p><p>How would she bear it if that future didn\u2019t want her?</p><p>When the thatching was finished, the laborers gathered at long, planked tables for a simple midday meal. Minerva helped the other women pass baskets of fresh bread, sausages, and hard cheese. Ale flowed freely from a cask.</p><p>The general mood turned from one of work to one of anticipation. The men washed and put on their coats, and the girls removed aprons and tied ribbons in each other\u2019s hair. The wagon that had so recently been heaped with straw for thatching was swept and hitched to a strong, sturdy team.</p><p>\u201cOur chariot awaits.\u201d Colin extended a hand to Minerva. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>He helped her into the wagon, and then loaded the trunk. She pushed it to the far end of the wagon bed, and they sat in a row\u2014all three of them. Minerva folded her legs beneath her. Colin stretched his out. Francine kept her foot in the box. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind the wagon?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook as head. \u201cNot so long as it\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>All the other farm workers crowded in, and just before the rear gate was latched, a half dozen pink, squirming piglets were added to the mix. One of them found its way to Minerva\u2019s lap, rooting adorably in the white folds of her overskirt, where the keen little creature knew she\u2019d saved some cheese from their luncheon.</p> <p>\u201cAre we all traveling to Grantham?\u201d Minerva wondered aloud, feeding the piglet a morsel of cheese.</p><p>The young woman seated across the wagon stared at her, as though she were a simpleton. \u201cIt\u2019s fair day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ah. Fair day. This would explain the air of excitement. And the piglets.</p><p>As the wagon started off down the road, the girls in the wagon shifted and coalesced, forming a loose knot. They whispered to each other, shooting furtive glances at Colin and Minerva.</p><p>Minerva could tell they were speculating on their relationship. Wondering whether or not this handsome stranger was available. After a bit more whispering and nudging, they seemed to nominate a bold-looking brunette to find out.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Mr. Sand,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhat takes you and your lady friend to the Grantham fair?\u201d</p><p>Minerva held her breath, foolishly hoping to be claimed as something other than his sister. Something more than a mistress.</p><p>\u201cBusiness,\u201d Colin said easily. \u201cWe\u2019re circus folk.\u201d</p><p>Circus folk?</p><p>\u201cCircus folk?\u201d several of the girls echoed.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He lazily riffled a hand through his hair. \u201cI walk the tightrope, and my lady here . . .\u201d He stretched his arm around Minerva, drawing her close. \u201cShe\u2019s a first-rate sword swallower.\u201d</p> <p>Oh my God.</p><p>Minerva clapped a hand over her mouth and made helpless snuffling sounds into her palm. \u201cCaught a bit of straw dust,\u201d she explained a few moments later, wiping the tears of laughter from her eyes.</p><p>She slid a look at Colin. The man was unbelievably shameless. Incorrigibly handsome. And\u2014oh, heavens. She was a feather\u2019s brush away from falling hopelessly in love with him.</p><p>\u201cA sword swallower,\u201d the brunette echoed, casting a skeptical glance at Minerva.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. She has a rare talent. You must believe me when I say, I\u2019ve spent several years in the circus world, and I\u2019ve never seen her like. You should have seen her performance just last night. Sheer brilliance, I tell you. She has this way of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Minerva elbowed him, hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He caught her by the chin, turning her face to his. His eyes danced with amusement. \u201cReally, pet. You are entirely too modest.\u201d</p><p>She took a long, dizzying tumble through his warm, affectionate gaze. And then he kissed her. Not quite on the mouth, not quite on the cheek. Just at the corner of her smile.</p> <p>The wagon hit a rut in the lane, jolting them apart. Minerva laid her head on his shoulder and sighed with happiness.</p><p>Across the wagon, the rest of the women sighed with disappointment.</p><p>Yes, girls. Go weep in your aprons. He\u2019s taken. For today, at least.</p><p>Minerva laced her hand with Colin\u2019s and gave it a squeeze of thanks. Along with all the blissful pleasure he\u2019d so masterfully coaxed from her body, he\u2019d now introduced her to an entirely new sensation.</p><p>So this was how it felt to be envied.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said the brunette, \u201cyou never do know who you\u2019ll meet along the Great North Road, do you? Just yesterday, my brother said one of his friends passed time with a long-lost prince.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the wagon laughed, except Minerva. Colin\u2019s arm tightened around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d the girl went on. \u201cHe was a prince, traveling in common clothes.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, another young woman shook her head. \u201cYour brother\u2019s spinning tales again, Becky. Imagine, a long-lost prince in disguise, traveling this stretch of road. What\u2019s he doing? Coming to the fair?\u201d She giggled. \u201cI\u2019d never give that tale any credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Minerva smiled to herself, nestling closer to Colin. \u201cI could believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d The brunette arched an eyebrow. \u201cIf this prince does exist\u2014he\u2019d better hope he doesn\u2019t meet with my brother\u2019s friends. They\u2019ve a score to settle with His Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>There was no leaving Grantham tonight. Not for love, money, giant lizards, or whatever fool motive was now driving Colin on this quest.</p><p>Every wagon, coach, and pony cart in the county must have been rolling into town for the fair. None of them were leaving.</p><p>He fought his way through the jostling throng of horses and carts, back to where he\u2019d left Minerva. As a cartload of crated chickens rolled out of his way, he caught sight of her through the flurry of white feathers.</p><p>He stopped dead in his tracks, transfixed. Admiring.</p><p>She sat atop her precious trunk of course, chin propped in her hand. She\u2019d allowed her spectacles to slide down toward the tip of her nose, so she could peer over them\u2014as she always did when regarding something more than a dozen paces distant. Her long dark hair tumbled about her shoulders in fetching waves, and the late afternoon sun gave it warm, reddish highlights. With her teeth, she worried that plump, sweet bottom lip, and her toes tapped in time to some distant music.</p><p>She was lovely. Just the picture of a wide-eyed country lass, taking in the fair.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, approaching her. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019d have better luck later this evening.\u201d He cast a look over his shoulder, toward the bustling green. \u201cFor the meantime, we might as well see the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t any money.\u201d She pushed her spectacles back up on her nose and held up a thin gold coin between her fingertips. \u201cThis one sovereign must stretch all the way to Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>He took it from her and slipped it in his breast pocket. \u201cIt costs nothing to look. And we\u2019ll need to eat something, sometime. But we\u2019ll be frugal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA frugal brother and sister?\u201d she asked, peering up at him. \u201cA frugal gentleman and his mistress? Or frugal circus folk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrugal sweethearts.\u201d He extended a hand to her. \u201cJust for today. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Smiling, she put her hand in his, and he pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Ah, the sweet, unveiled affection in her eyes . . . it warmed his heart, and then wrung it fierce. A better man wouldn\u2019t play this \u2018sweethearts\u2019 game with her when he knew very well it couldn\u2019t lead to more.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t a better man. He was Colin Sandhurst, reckless, incorrigible rogue\u2014and damn it, he couldn\u2019t resist. He wanted to amuse her, spoil her, feed her sweets and delicacies. Steal a kiss or two, when she wasn\u2019t expecting it. He wanted to be a besotted young buck squiring his girl around the fair.</p><p>In other words, he wanted to live honestly. Just for the day.</p><p>He hefted Francine\u2019s trunk and balanced it on his right shoulder, offering Minerva his left arm. Together they moved through the crowds and past the church. They walked down the rows of prize livestock brought for show, giving the pigs and stoats ridiculous names, then debating which deserved the ribbon and why.</p><p>\u201cHamlet must get the ribbon,\u201d Minerva argued. \u201cHis eyes are the brightest, and his haunches the most fat. He also keeps himself quite clean for a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Hamlet is a prince. I thought you bestowed your greatest favor on knights.\u201d He pointed. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d prefer Sir Francis Bacon over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe filthy one wallowing and grunting in the mud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand grunting is a mark of porcine intelligence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She gave him a look. \u201cEven I have standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d He added under his breath, \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>They wandered down rows of booths displaying as exotic an array of wares as one could hope to find in the English Midlands\u2014everything from oranges to ormolu clocks, French bonnets to scented bootblack. Colin wished he could buy her one of everything, but settled for spending sixpence on a length of blue ribbon to match her gown.</p><p>\u201cIn case you\u2019re wanting to tie back your hair,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDid you want me to tie back my hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I quite like it down.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re nonsensical.\u201d</p><p>He made a show of bristling in mock offense. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know how to take a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift?\u201d She laughed and nudged his side. \u201cYou bought it with my money. But thank you.\u201d She kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>For a shilling and scattered pence, Colin purchased their supper\u2014a small pitcher of fresh milk and two meat pies. They found a clear place on the green and sat facing each other on the trunk. Minerva spread out her handkerchief as a makeshift tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hungry,\u201d she said, staring at the food.</p><p>He handed her one of the pies. \u201cThen have at it.\u201d</p><p>She bit into the crescent-shaped pastry, slowly sinking her teeth through the layers of flaky crust. Her eyelashes fluttered, and she gave a moan of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh, Colin. That\u2019s marvelous.\u201d She swept her tongue over those ripe, sultry, pouting lips.</p><p>He stared at her, suddenly helpless to move or speak. Raw, animal lust gripped him, and gripped him hard.</p><p>He had to feel those lips on him again. Had. To. This wasn\u2019t a mild expression of preference. This was an imperative. His body was insistent. To continue his existence on this earth, he now needed the following: food, water, shelter, clothing, and Minerva Highwood\u2019s lips.</p><p>Sending him a coy glance through her dark eyelashes, she took a sip of milk. Then she licked her lips again.</p><p>Correction. He needed food, water, shelter, clothing, Minerva Highwood\u2019s lips, and . . . Minerva Highwood\u2019s tongue.</p><p>Memories of the night before flashed through his mind. He didn\u2019t even try to force them back. No, he let them surface, taking time to engrave each carnal, erotic moment on his memory. Each blissful moment must be recorded, so he could mentally relive that scene in months and years to come. Out of not just desire, but need.</p><p>Those lips. That tongue.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Er . . . yes.\u201d He shook himself. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>Colin bit into his own pie. It was good and savory, still warm from the oven. He enjoyed it. But not nearly as much as he enjoyed viewing her enjoyment.</p><p>Remarkable. He\u2019d wooed lovers with jewels and Venetian lace, taken them to view operas from the most lavish box in the theater, fed them oysters and sugared berries from silver trays. But he\u2019d never known the sort of pure, honest pleasure he felt right here, right now. Devouring meat pies with Minerva Highwood in the middle of a country fair.</p><p>Licking her thumb clean, she tilted her head to regard the sky. \u201cIt\u2019ll be twilight soon. Should we try our luck finding transport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>They picked up Francine and carried her between them, ambling toward the carriage mews and stables. As they went, they passed a row of booths and carnival games.</p><p>A small girl yanked at Colin\u2019s coat front. She was waifish but bright-eyed, dressed in a patched yellow dress.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you and the lady have your fortune told, sir?\u201d The girl indicated a tent a few paces away. \u201cMy mum tells fortunes for a sixpence. She can see the future, clear as looking through a glass windowpane. She\u2019ll tell you everything you want to know about your life, love, and children. Even the day of your own death!\u201d She all but chirped this last.</p><p>Colin smiled, setting down the trunk. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a tempting offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin, we can\u2019t,\u201d Minerva whispered in his ear. \u201cWe\u2019ve only eighteen shillings to our names. We can\u2019t be wasting any of it on fortune-tellers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew she was right, but something in the girl\u2019s gap-toothed smile tugged at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, pet?\u201d he asked the girl.</p><p>\u201cElspeth, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, Elspeth.\u201d He leaned down close. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t buy a fortune from your mother. I\u2019m a rather fragile soul, you see. I\u2019m not sure I could bear up under the revelation of my future loves and children, much less the date of my own death. So why don\u2019t I tell your fortune instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fortune?\u201d She narrowed her eyes with precocious cynicism. With her tongue, she worked a loose front tooth back and forth. \u201cHow are you going to tell my fortune?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, easy as anything.\u201d Colin drew a penny from his pocket and placed it in the girl\u2019s hand. \u201cI see a sweet in your future.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth smiled and closed her hand around the penny. \u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><p>As she scampered off, he cupped a hand around his mouth and called after her, \u201cA sweet, remember. Don\u2019t go making me a charlatan. Be sure not to spend it on anything else.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to find Minerva staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt is true,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhat you told her just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell her just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you fear the future.\u201d</p><p>His chin ducked, as if he were instinctively dodging a blow. His brain rang, as though he\u2019d failed to evade it. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said something quite like it.\u201d</p> <p>Had he? Perhaps he had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I fear the future. I just find it\u2019s best not to form expectations. Expectations lead to disappointments. If you expect nothing, you\u2019re always surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re never really satisfied. You never experience the joy of working toward a goal and achieving it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. Must she always be so damned perceptive?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t it grow tiresome? she\u2019d asked him last night, referring to his live-for-the-day, Devil-may-care, insert-blithe-motto-here lifestyle.</p><p>Yes, it did rather grow tiresome. Colin envied men like his cousin, who had their sense of duty and purpose whittled so sharp, it could balance on a rapier\u2019s edge. Men like Bram woke up each morning knowing exactly what they meant to accomplish, and why, and how. Hell, Colin envied the men he\u2019d worked with this morning, thatching a cottage roof.</p><p>And he envied Minerva her scholarly dedication and discoveries. More than she could ever suppose.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me, don\u2019t I want to do something useful with my life . . . ? Of course I do. But I\u2019m a viscount, pet. There\u2019s a responsibility inherent in that. Or there will be, once I finally gain control of my accounts. Mostly, my task is to stay alive and not cock things up. I can\u2019t risk my life purchasing an officer\u2019s commission, or sign on with a pirate crew for larks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t lords supposed to manage their lands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I don\u2019t?\u201d He threw her a look. \u201cBelieve it or not, I go through pots of ink every month, ensuring that my estate is well managed. And I do my part to keep it in excellent condition by staying far away, myself.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI know some gentlemen develop intellectual interests or political pursuits to occupy their time. But what can I say? I\u2019m not a specialist. I\u2019m passably good at a thousand things, but I don\u2019t particularly excel at any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack of all trades,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, something like that. If I could engage in trade, which I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>They were silent for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cYou do have talents, Colin.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a lascivious wink. \u201cOh, I know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. I\u2019m good at lying, drinking, pleasuring women, and inciting tavern brawls.\u201d Pulling up short, he stopped before a booth with a toss game. \u201cAnd this. I\u2019m good at things like this.\u201d</p><p>He picked up one of the round wooden balls, tossing it into the air and catching it in his hand. Testing its weight as he rolled it from palm to fingertips and back.</p><p>\u201cHow do I play?\u201d he asked the woman behind the table.</p><p>\u201cThree pence for a try, sir. You throw the ball in the baskets.\u201d She waved to a large basket right up front. Behind it, a series of similar baskets were lined up\u2014in gradually diminishing sizes. \u201cA pitch in the first basket earns you an apple. Next basket, an orange. Then peaches, cherries, grapes.\u201d She swept to the end of the row and pointed out a tiny woven basket, probably smaller than the ball itself. \u201cHit the last, you\u2019ve won yourself a pineapple, direct from the Sandwich Islands.\u201d</p><p>Right. Colin smirked. The stumpy, shriveled pineapple on display looked to have come from a fruitier\u2019s glasshouse, via several weeks\u2019 travel around the English countryside.</p><p>Easy enough to see how the game worked. In essence, players traded three pence for an apple. If they had a bit of skill, they took away an orange, as well.</p><p>Clearly, no one ever won the pineapple.</p><p>He laid three pennies on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll have a go.\u201d</p><p>The apple came easily, as it was supposed to do. He handed the shiny round fruit to Minerva, who\u2019d taken a seat on the trunk. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he urged. \u201cLife\u2019s uncertain. Eat it now.\u201d</p><p>By the time he\u2019d won her the orange and a trio of fine, ripe peaches, Colin had amassed a small crowd of children. As he sized up his toss for the cherries, he slid a glance to the side and instantly gathered where they\u2019d come from. Little Elspeth had joined Minerva on the trunk. Peach juice dribbled down her chin as she bit into the fruit from one side, carefully avoiding her loose tooth. Apparently, the penny sweet hadn\u2019t been enough for her. She\u2019d come back for more, and she\u2019d brought all her friends.</p><p>When he\u2019d tossed and won, Colin passed the net of cherries to Minerva for distribution. \u201cOne apiece,\u201d he called to the gathered boys and girls. \u201cNo spitting the stones.\u201d</p><p>From the cheer that rose up, one would think he\u2019d passed around gold coins.</p><p>Minerva was pressed and jostled from all sides, but she flashed him a wide smile as she opened the net. \u201cDon\u2019t you want one?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Her smile\u2014genuine, adoring\u2014was the best reward he could imagine.</p><p>\u201cGrapes next!\u201d called one boy. \u201cCor, I\u2019ve never even tasted a grape. Not in all my life.\u201d</p><p>The stout woman behind the table crossed her arms. \u201cGreedy little beggars. Go on with you. He won\u2019t win the grapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Colin rolled the wooden ball in his hand, assessing. The basket he needed to hit was some ten paces back, and approximately the size of a saucer. If he lobbed it too directly, the ball would glance off the basket\u2019s edge. His best shot was a high arc, to send the ball sailing up and then directly down.</p><p>He lofted the ball high in the air. The children held their breath.</p><p>And a few moments later, Colin was handing round clusters of red grapes. They were seedy and a bit shriveled. Half on their way to becoming raisins, in some cases. But a boy who\u2019d never tasted a grape before wouldn\u2019t know to complain. The children popped them into their mouths and made a contest of outdoing one another\u2019s sounds of delight.</p><p>\u201cThe pineapple!\u201d they all called next, jumping up and down. \u201cWin us the pineapple!\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s mouth tugged sideways. The pineapple basket looked about the size of a teacup. He wasn\u2019t sure it was even possible to fit the wooden ball inside it, let alone do so from a distance. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes raised, children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I\u2019ve dreamed of pineapples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum\u2019s a housemaid. She\u2019s tasted \u2019em. Says they\u2019re like ambrosia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it, sir!\u201d Elspeth cried.</p><p>Colin tossed the wooden ball to the plucky girl. \u201cRub it for luck, pet.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she did so and handed it back.</p><p>He gave Minerva a wink and a shrug. \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d</p><p>Then he eyed the basket, sized up his shot . . . and threw the ball.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>As the wooden ball sailed through the air, all the hopeful children clutched their hands together and held their breath. Minerva held her breath along with them. And she didn\u2019t even care for pineapples.</p><p>Go in, she willed. Go in.</p><p>It didn\u2019t go in.</p><p>When the ball bounced off the basket\u2019s rim and thudded to the ground, she couldn\u2019t resist joining the collective groan of disappointment.</p><p>Colin shrugged and pushed a hand through his air. \u201cSorry, lads and lasses. Did my best.\u201d He was good-natured in defeat. A gracious loser, as always. But she could tell he was disappointed, too. Not over his bruised pride, but on account of the children. He wanted to give them a treat to remember, and who could blame him?</p><p>Thrusting caution and frugality aside, Minerva pushed her way to the table and addressed the booth\u2019s mistress. \u201cHow much for the pineapple? Will you take three shillings?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes flared with greed, but her mouth was firm. \u201cIt\u2019s not for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a go, then.\u201d A well-dressed young gentleman stepped to the fore. He looked to be the local version of a dandy\u2014probably the son of some country squire, unleashed on the fair with a generous allowance of pocket money and an inflated sense of self-importance. He was flanked by a couple of friends, both of whom looked eager to be amused.</p><p>\u201cSorry, gents.\u201d The stout woman crossed her arms. \u201cThis booth is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity,\u201d said the suave-looking young gentleman, casting a superior glance at Colin. \u201cI\u2019d rather looked forward to showing this fellow up.\u201d</p><p>His friends laughed. Meanwhile, the children gathered around Colin, as if they\u2019d claimed him for their own and must come to his defense. It was terribly sweet.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Colin amiably, \u201cyou\u2019re still welcome to have a go. If it\u2019s a contest of marksmanship you\u2019re after, one can be arranged. With targets and pistols, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Excitement whispered through the assembled children. Apparently, the promise of a shooting match was an effective balm to their disappointed pineapple hopes.</p><p>The young man looked Colin up and down, smirking. \u201cI warn you, I\u2019m the best shot in the county. But if you insist, I should be glad to trounce you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should be glad to take my money, too. Let\u2019s place a wager on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Name your bet.\u201d</p><p>Colin rummaged through his pockets, and Minerva grew alarmed. He might well be an excellent shot, but surely he wouldn\u2019t risk all their money.</p><p>\u201cFive pounds,\u201d Colin said.</p><p>Five pounds?</p><p>\u201cFive pounds?\u201d the young gentleman echoed.</p><p>Minerva couldn\u2019t help herself. She went to his side, whispering, \u201cFive pounds? Are you mad? Where do you mean to come up with five pounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d From his innermost pocket, Colin drew a small, folded square of paper. \u201cJust found it in my coat pocket. Must have been there for months. I\u2019d forgotten it.\u201d</p><p>She unfolded the paper and adjusted her spectacles. It was indeed a bank note for five pounds.</p><p>Five pounds. All this time she\u2019d been fretting over how to stretch their shillings and pence, and he\u2019d been carrying five pounds in his pocket. The impossible knave.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t risk this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wager.\u201d The dandy pulled out a coin purse and shook loose five sovereign pieces. He dumped them into Minerva\u2019s hand. \u201cFive pounds.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear. She didn\u2019t have a good feeling about this.</p><p>They made a veritable parade, the whole group of them trooping to the edge of the fairgrounds, where a shooting contest could safely be staged. Dusk was gathering by the time a straw-stuffed target had been mounted, and a sizable crowd had amassed to watch\u2014not just the children, but adults, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne shot each,\u201d the overconfident dandy said, tilting his head toward the bull\u2019s-eye lodged in the center of a freshly plowed field. \u201cClosest to center wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fair,\u201d Colin said. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>The younger man made a show of cleaning and loading his expensive, polished double-barreled pistol. It was a Finch pistol, Minerva noted with some amusement. Her friend Susanna would have a good laugh at that.</p> <p>With pomp and an undue air of gravity, the self-styled dandy leveled his pistol and made his shot. A dark circle appeared on the target, several inches left of center.</p><p>The younger man accepted the smattering of applause with a bow. Minerva rolled her eyes. The ladies of Spindle Cove could shoot better than that.</p><p>Surely Colin could, as well.</p><p>For once, Colin didn\u2019t attempt any showmanship. He merely shook off his coat and swept a hand through his wavy hair. And those two small gestures were enough to make him the desire of every woman, the envy of every man, and the idol of every child in attendance. Good heavens, he was beautiful.</p><p>She was so dazzled by his good looks, Minerva nearly forgot to work herself into a state of sheer anxiety. Before she knew it, he\u2019d stepped up, leveled the pistol, and made his shot. As the smoke cleared, she whipped off her spectacles to stare at the target.</p> <p>Dead center, of course.</p><p>The children went wild with whoops and hollers. A few of the older boys tried, unsuccessfully, to lift Colin on their shoulders for a victory salute.</p><p>And Minerva curled her fingers over the small fortune in her hands. Ten pounds. Ten pounds changed everything. Now they were truly back on schedule. They would make it to Edinburgh. Francine would have her day.</p><p>When Colin untangled himself from the jubilant children and turned to her, grinning . . . oh, she could have kissed him. Right in front of all these people.</p><p>But the defeated dandy wanted words with him first.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cheat.\u201d The young man stared Colin down. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of swindler you are, but my father\u2019s the magistrate in these parts. I think he\u2019ll need to have a talk with you. And that five-pound note will need to come along, as evidence. Surely you\u2019ve stolen it.\u201d</p> <p>Stepping back casually, Colin slid his arms into his coat sleeves. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s friend stepped forward, brandishing a fist. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve found some.\u201d</p><p>Minerva knew that in a fistfight Colin could take one or both of these young men easily. But if the dandy were truly a magistrate\u2019s son, a brawl would be a very bad idea.</p><p>And must they always flee a scene in the mayhem of violence and rioting? Could they walk away just this once, with ten pounds in their pocket and some levity in their step? Just this once?</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Colin said, clapping each man on the shoulder. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, and it wasn\u2019t very sporting of me. But surely we can settle this without involving magistrates. How about this\u2014just to prove I\u2019m a decent fellow, I\u2019ll give you a chance to win it all back. Double or nothing.\u201d</p><p>The dandy sneered at him. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Colin replied, speaking in a smooth, conciliatory tone. \u201cNot you and me. We\u2019ll have our seconds shoot it out. Your man here\u201d\u2014Colin tapped the friend on the shoulder\u2014\u201dagainst my girl.\u201d He looked to Minerva.</p><p>Oh, no. Colin, don\u2019t do this to me.</p> <p>\u201cAgainst your girl?\u201d The dandy chuckled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll even remove her spectacles.\u201d Colin raised open hands in a gesture of surrender. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want trouble. You can lead me away in shackles and throw me in the stocks, but you won\u2019t get any richer. There\u2019s five pounds in it for you this way.\u201d</p><p>The dandy pulled straight and smiled. \u201cAll right, then. As you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble or nothing.\u201d Colin called Elspeth to his side, picked her up by the waist and set her atop the fence. \u201cLittle Elspeth here will hold the purse.\u201d He took the ten pounds from Minerva and put it in the girl\u2019s hands.</p><p>The young gentleman raided his coin purse and borrowed a few pounds from his friends. Finally, he\u2019d cobbled together his portion and gave it to smiling Elspeth, who knotted it all in a handkerchief.</p><p>He handed his pistol to his eager companion, who quickly proved to be a middling marksman as well. He hit the target, but well wide of the center.</p><p>It was Minerva\u2019s turn. Her nerves did a frantic jig in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cGive us a moment,\u201d Colin said to the gentlemen, smiling. \u201cLet me show her how the thing works.\u201d</p><p>The men had a good laugh amongst themselves as Colin drew her forward, to the shooter\u2019s mark.</p><p>\u201cColin, what were you thinking?\u201d she whispered, trembling. \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to shoot, of course. And you\u2019re going to hit the target, dead center.\u201d With confident fingers, he removed her spectacles, folded them, and tucked them into his coat pocket.</p><p>He put the reloaded pistol in her hand. Then, approaching her from the back, he wrapped his arms around hers and raised the gun, as though teaching her how to shoot.</p><p>\u201cAfter you make your shot,\u201d he murmured in her ear, \u201cyou grab the purse from Elspeth. I\u2019ll get Francine. And we\u2019ll run, as hard as we can, down that lane.\u201d He pointed the pistol to the side, indicating the direction. \u201cDon\u2019t stop for anything. Don\u2019t even pause to look back. I\u2019ll catch up to you, promise.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, savoring the comfort of his strength and warmth. \u201cBut . . . but what if I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t miss.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her earlobe, then stepped back, releasing her arms. \u201cGo on, then. Make me proud.\u201d</p><p>Minerva leveled the pistol at the target, giving her eyes time to focus. Her hands trembled. She tried to remember all the tips Susanna and Miss Taylor had given her. Like all the Spindle Cove ladies, she\u2019d learned to shoot\u2014but her marksmanship had never been especially consistent. Mama had made no secret that she found Minerva\u2019s participation in the activity laughable.</p><p>A mostly blind girl, armed with a pistol? Mama would say. My dear, the gentlemen already keep their distance. There\u2019s no need to frighten them off with guns.</p><p>Minerva took a deep breath and tried to banish the sounds of laughter.</p><p>\u201cFrancine,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthis is for you.\u201d</p><p>And just as she began to squeeze the trigger, a voice called out about the crowd\u2019s hushed silence\u2014freezing her finger in place and turning the blood in her veins to ice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him, right over there!\u201d</p><p>No. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cGo get him, boys!\u201d the voice shouted. \u201cThere he is! It\u2019s Prince Ampersand of Crustacea!\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Minerva lowered the gun and looked to Colin.</p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d he said, eyes wide and fierce. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>With a sudden, stone-cold certainty, Minerva raised her arms, took aim, and fired the pistol. Without pausing to see how her shot had landed, she grabbed the money from Elspeth and ran. The children\u2019s wild cheer of triumph told everything she needed to know. What she\u2019d already known, in her bones.</p><p>She\u2019d hit dead center. Just as Colin had said.</p><p>Grinning to herself, she ducked her head, pumped her arms and legs, and raced down the lane.</p><p>Her breath and heartbeat pounded so loud, she could barely hear her own boots slapping the dirt. But soon she became conscious of another set of footfalls behind her. She didn\u2019t dare slow or turn to ascertain whether they belonged to Colin. She just kept running like the Devil was on her heels.</p><p>And it occurred to her, as she made that mad dash down the lane\u2014clutching a blazing hot pistol in one hand and a fistful of money in the other\u2014that this surely must mark some turning point in her life. Really, there was no going back from this.</p><p>Today, all her mother\u2019s judgments had been proved false. She wasn\u2019t plain, but pretty. She wasn\u2019t distracted and awkward, but confident and a crack shot.</p><p>Most of all, Minerva was not hopeless. She had twenty pounds. She had an important scientific discovery.</p><p>And she had Colin, the most handsome, charming devil in England, coming fast on her heels. Save for the ransom-minded highwaymen and angry magistrate\u2019s son chasing after them . . .</p><p>Life had never been so good.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he called, overtaking her as they neared the town\u2019s borders. He had Francine lifted in his arms, leading the way as he turned down an alleyway. They clattered down the narrow, shadowy corridor, then found an arched passage that led through the churchyard wall and out into the countryside.</p><p>Carrying Francine between them now, they ran into the sunset. Only when they\u2019d covered two meadows, vaulted a stile, and crested a hill did they pause for breath and dare to look back.</p><p>They saw no one.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cElspeth and her army. They provided a diversion. But we\u2019re not safe yet.\u201d Panting, he nodded toward a nearby hut. \u201cOver there.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a dwelling proper. Just a cramped shelter for shepherds to sleep in while their flock grazed these fields. Tonight, it was empty. Likely all the sheep had been penned somewhere so the shepherds could enjoy the fair.</p><p>Colin had to stoop to fit through the small doorway. Inside, they found just a small cookstove, a lamp, various crooks and other shepherding implements . . . and a narrow cot.</p><p>Still breathing hard from exertion, Minerva found a flint and lit the lamp. \u201cDo you want to know something?\u201d As the yellow light warmed the space, she turned her gaze to Colin. \u201cToday is my birthday.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not really.\u201d She giggled helplessly. \u201cBut if it were, it would have been the best one ever. Colin, you were unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were amazing.\u201d He took her by the waist. His chest rose and fell with a resonant sigh. \u201cYou are amazing.\u201d</p><p>His words of praise gave her gooseflesh. But as he pulled her close, a strange round obstacle squished between them.</p><p>His brow wrinkled in confusion.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, laughing. Pulling back a bit, she fished the obstacle out of her overskirt pocket and held it up for his view. \u201cI saved you a peach.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the peach. Then he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d</p><p>Awareness tingled over every inch of her skin. The hunger in his eyes, the smoldering heat between their bodies . . . this wasn\u2019t a lesson, or an experiment to satisfy scientific curiosity. It wasn\u2019t pretense of any sort.</p><p>This was real.</p><p>He bent his head by slow degrees, teasing out the moment. Making her reach for him, stretch for him, ache for him. Until finally, his hand slid to cradle her neck and he took her mouth in a deep, passionate kiss.</p><p>She let the peach slip from her fingers and tumble to the straw-covered ground, the better to fill her hands with him. They kissed and grappled, tangling tongues and weaving their fingers into each other\u2019s hair. It seemed they couldn\u2019t get close enough, couldn\u2019t kiss deeply enough, couldn\u2019t press enough skin to skin.</p><p>Her nipples came to tight points. She felt the hard ridge of his erection, jutting against her belly. And her mind slowly caught up to what their bodies already knew. There was only one way to satisfy this need. Only one means of achieving the closeness she craved.</p><p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d He slid his tongue from her throat to her ear. \u201cI want to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>Just at the words . . . that bold, unequivocal statement of intent . . . fire raced through her veins. Hot, powerful, consuming.</p><p>There were a dozen reasons why she might refuse him. But they were all someone else\u2019s reasons. Her mother\u2019s, her peers\u2019, society\u2019s. She\u2019d already left all those expectations behind. If Minerva consulted herself, there was no question. Her body craved the feel of his skin against hers. Her ever-curious intellect was eager to experience physical passion, with him. And her heart . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, her heart was already his for the breaking.</p><p>His hands went to the knotted overskirt ties. With deft motions, he untied them and slid the garment free. Then he started on the row of hooks down her back.</p><p>His voice grew rough with need. \u201cI promised you I wouldn\u2019t do this. Hell, I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t do this. But I can\u2019t help it, Min. I want you so badly.\u201d</p> <p>She kissed his throat and pressed her body to his, hoping to show him what she couldn\u2019t quite find words to say. That she wanted him, too. Needed his touch. As he worked the closures of her gown loose, she tangled her fingers in his wavy hair.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>His hands went to her shoulders. His gaze searched hers. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want this, tell me so.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cSay the word, and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>In answer, she merely drew the sleeves of her gown down her arms and pushed the blue silk to her feet. He took one of her hands to steady her as she stepped free of the gown.</p><p>Standing back a pace, he made a wistful noise in his throat. \u201cJust look at you. So lovely.\u201d</p> <p>She warmed with pleasure as he surveyed the items she\u2019d drawn from her trousseau that morning. Her lacy white chemise, bosom-flattering corset, and silk stockings. If she\u2019d been saving them for anything other than this moment with him, she couldn\u2019t remember it. This mad, triumphant day at the fair; this snug, humble place to spend the night. The unveiled desire in his eyes as he regarded her.</p><p>This felt like all she\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>She opened her trunk and found those embroidered sheets she\u2019d stitched and saved for some unlikely wedding night. Together, they spread them on the narrow cot.</p><p>Even if she went to her grave a spinster, she would still have known more passion in this one night than some women experienced in a lifetime. She vowed to savor every touch. Remember every caress. Keep her eyes open for each and every moment. Even now, as he kissed the soft place beneath her ear.</p><p>He took her by the waist and spun her around. With her back to him, she trembled as he worked the laces of her corset loose. At last, the restrictive garment fell away from her body, and she drew a deep, intoxicating breath.</p><p>With a soft groan, he gathered her close. The solid muscles of his chest supported her weight as he lifted and cupped her breasts through her chemise. Her breath quickened as he stroked and caressed the soft globes, thumbing her nipples to taut, eager peaks.</p> <p>She turned in his embrace, wanting her turn to touch. Sliding her hands under his lapels and toward his shoulders, she cleaved the coat from his body. He shook the heavy garment down his arms and tossed it aside. She gathered the loose fabric of his shirt and yanked it free of his waistband, sliding her hands beneath to explore the smooth, muscled contours of his torso.</p><p>He lifted his arms overhead\u2014as much as he could, with the low ceiling\u2014and she drew the shirt up and over his shoulders. Once his shirt was removed, he directed her to do likewise. Minerva stretched her arms tall as he gathered the thin, gauzy fabric of her chemise and drew it up her body. Slowly, reverently. Until he pulled the shift over her head and arms. With a flick of one hand, he tossed it aside. Then his hands made a slow, languid sweep back in reverse\u2014skimming down her stretched arms, over her breasts, her waist, her hips. Awakening every part of her with his touch. His palms were a little roughened from his thatching work that morning, but the delicious friction only increased her excitement.</p><p>It let her know this was real.</p><p>She stood before him bare, save for her stockings and garters. He ran one hand over her backside and down her thigh. She thought he would untie her garter, but instead he smoothed his hand over the delicate silk. Lifting her leg, he wrapped her thigh over his hip, drawing her close. Her breasts met his bared chest, and as they kissed she couldn\u2019t help but rub them against his solid heat, easing their dull ache. He moaned into her mouth.</p><p>He worked a hand between them, gently cupping and stroking her sex. A muscle in her inner thigh quivered, and she felt herself growing damp.</p><p>He pressed two fingers inside her, pushing deep. Until the heel of his hand rested firm against her mound. Her body\u2019s reaction was immediate, intense. As he rocked his hand back and forth, she moved with him, riding his motions and moaning in time to his gentle thrusts.</p><p>So close. She was already so close.</p><p>He withdrew his fingers, and she whimpered at the sudden loss.</p> <p>As he lifted her and lay her down on the bed, his voice shook with need. \u201cDamn it, I know I should be selfless. I should give you pleasure first. But I want to be in you. I want to be so deep inside you when you come.\u201d</p><p>To that, she could muster no protest.</p><p>She watched him as he sat on the trunk and wrestled out of his boots and breeches. As his erection sprang free of his unbuttoned falls, she reached for the enticing, dusky curve. He made her free to explore, spreading his thighs wide so she could stroke his full length and cup the vulnerable sac beneath. He sighed deeply as she caressed him. She dabbed at the bead of moisture welling from his tip, spreading it with circling motions of her thumb.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist, staying her hand. With a hoarse chuckle, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t take much more of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come to me.\u201d The words made her feel bold and seductive. She stretched sinuously on the cot, making her whole body an invitation writ in pale pink calligraphy.</p><p>He wasted no time accepting. He moved between her legs, spreading her thighs wide. The full length of his shaft teased up and down her sex, making her mindless with pleasure. By the time he positioned the broad, smooth head of his cock at her opening, she ached to be filled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet,\u201d he groaned, pushing forward. \u201cSo wet and so tight.\u201d</p><p>At the slow, startling invasion, she couldn\u2019t suppress a sharp cry of pain. Her eyes flew wide, and she gasped for breath.</p><p>It was done. He was in her. They were making love.</p><p>It felt . . . wonderful and terrible, all at once. The flood of sensations and emotions overwhelmed her. Her breasts molded to the firm weight of his chest. Her heart swelled with a poignant tenderness.</p><p>But mostly\u2014between her legs, it hurt like the devil.</p><p>Colin knows what he\u2019s doing, she told herself. Surely it would start to feel marvelous soon.</p><p>Any moment now.</p><p>He slid out a little, then pushed back in. Plunging deeper this time, and stretching her wider. She knew from her own explorations, he was thickest at the root. The further he advanced, the more the pain increased. She wavered on the brink of begging him to stop altogether.</p><p>\u201cCan you . . .\u201d She panted for breath. \u201cJust wait. A moment.\u201d</p><p>With a curse, he pressed his brow to her shoulder. \u201cI hate that I\u2019ve hurt you. I hate that I\u2019ve done this to you at all.\u201d He lifted his head. \u201cGod, Min. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll make it up to you, I swear. I don\u2019t know how, but . . . I\u2019ll make it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make it good.\u201d She gave him a brave smile. \u201cYou do know how to do that?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tipped in a lopsided, arrogant grin. \u201cThat much I hope I can manage.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t press any deeper. Instead, he gave her the pause she\u2019d requested and refocused his attention on matters close to hand. Balancing his weight on one elbow, he framed her breast in his cupped fingers and sucked her nipple into his mouth. He mouthed her lazily, swirling his tongue around and over the sensitive peak. With every flick of his nimble tongue, a shiver of bliss spread through her body.</p><p>As he transferred his attentions to the other breast, the pain where they were joined began to ease. Her intimate muscles relaxed around his girth, and the swollen bud at the crest of her sex ached for attention. Instinctively, she arched and rolled her hips, seeking friction. She found it\u2014but the motion also pulled him deeper, brought them closer.</p><p>She gasped, surprised by the sudden pleasure. He moaned around her nipple.</p><p>All pain was forgotten as she tried to duplicate the sensation, writhing against him again. Then again, and again. Taking him deeper in tantalizing increments. With each motion, his pelvis rubbed hers just where she needed it, taking her arousal to new heights.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, shifting his weight and driving forward. \u201cThat\u2019s it, love.\u201d He slid one hand beneath her bottom, lifting her up and against him as he thrust deeper still. \u201cIt\u2019s better now, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He thrust harder. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She clutched his shoulders. \u201cOh, Colin. It\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>Burying his face in her neck, he muttered something that sounded like, Thank God. He set a rhythm, strong and steady, probing just a bit deeper with every stroke. She felt him reaching places she hadn\u2019t dreamed existed. And still, she craved more. When his full length was at last buried inside her, he rested a moment, holding their bodies close and joined.</p><p>His eyes shone with emotion. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting this, Min. For longer than you could know.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cSo have I.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her sweetly as he began to thrust again. Deep and steady. Real and true. She arched into his motions, growing desperate for more. At his silent urging, she wrapped her legs over his, and he slid deeper still. Now he stroked against some dark, sweet, essential place inside her, wrenching a joyful sob from her throat with each teasing thrust. She clutched at his back, digging her fingernails into his flesh. Her teeth scraped his shoulder.</p><p>Don\u2019t stop. Please, don\u2019t ever stop.</p><p>She rode the wave of pleasure higher and higher, until it broke. He held her tight, stroking on and on as she spiraled and tumbled through bliss.</p><p>He raised up on his arms, working her from a new, deeper angle. His pace accelerated, and the force of his thrusts increased. She loved feeling the need strung tight in his muscles. Loved knowing how much he wanted her, seeing the pained expression of desire on his face. Loved taking him just as deep and as hard and as fast as he wanted to go. As though if they collided hard enough, they might be meshed into one person.</p><p>They could be meshed into one person, if he didn\u2019t take care.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she panted. \u201cWe must be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. You just feel . . .\u201d He groaned on a deep, hard thrust. \u201cSo sweet. So right. So good. So . . . very . . . very . . . very . . .\u201d</p><p>With a deep, guttural cry, he pulled free of her body. He slumped forward, shuddering in her arms. His seed spilled over her belly like a confession of some kind. A warm, vital secret.</p><p>She stroked his back as his breathing eased. He was so quiet. This was Colin in her arms, and he was never quiet. As he lay there, heavy and silent atop her chest, she began to worry. Had she . . . performed . . . well? Perhaps she hadn\u2019t done enough, or maybe she\u2019d done too much. Perhaps he would have wished her to be louder or bolder or . . . just different, somehow.</p><p>She was on the verge of apologizing and begging him to give her a second chance, when he rolled to the side.</p><p>\u201cOh, Min. That was unbelievable. I never dreamed how good it could be with . . .\u201d He smoothed her hair back from her face. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>Tears of relief and happiness pricked at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>He flopped onto his back and propped his head on one arm. \u201cYou know, I probably shouldn\u2019t say this. But you could ask me for anything right now\u2014anything at all\u2014and it would be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d She giggled. \u201cWhatever would I wish for? Gold, silver, pearls, rubies . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. And done and done and done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours. I\u2019ll go snag it for you, just as soon as I\u2019ve caught my breath. A few stars as well, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She nestled close to him. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I can\u2019t imagine anything that would make this moment better.\u201d</p><p>But that was a lie. There was one thing she wished she dared ask of him. If she could have anything she desired, she would ask only this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Love me.</p><p>Love me, and let me love you.</p><p>The words burned on her tongue, but Minerva couldn\u2019t give them voice. What a hopeless coward she was. She could pound on his door at midnight and demand to be respected as an individual. She could travel across the country in hopes of being appreciated for her scholarly achievements. But she still lacked the courage to ask for the one thing she wanted most.</p> <p>To be loved, just for herself.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Somewhere, a dog howled in the night.</p><p>Colin sat up with a start, shaking and drenched in sweat. He flung open the door of the shepherd\u2019s hut and drew greedy gulps of the fresh, cool night air. As his pounding heartbeat slowed, he leaned his brow on his wrist and swore violently.</p><p>Light, soothing caresses trailed up and down his back. Her touch didn\u2019t ask questions or make demands. It simply let him know he wasn\u2019t alone.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d she eventually asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing out of the usual. Just took me by surprise. The last few nights, I haven\u2019t woken at all. I\u2019d almost begun to think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was your cure?\u201d He heard a wry smile in her voice. \u201cI think I hoped so, too. But I suppose it was a foolish notion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot foolish.\u201d He exhaled, running his hands through his hair and gathering his wits. \u201cIt\u2019s just this place, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too small and dark. We can take our blankets and lie under the stars. Or we can just give up sleeping altogether and walk toward the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s ages before dawn yet. I can go back to sleep, but I think . . .\u201d He fumbled for his discarded neck cloth and wiped the sweat from his brow and neck. \u201cI think perhaps I\u2019d like to talk.\u201d</p> <p>The words came as a surprise to them both. They didn\u2019t pretend that he had the weather or coaching routes or any other topic on his mind. She knew instantly what he meant.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She sat up. \u201cShall I light the lamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t bother.\u201d With the door open, some moonlight shone through the opening. He could discern the silvered outline of her profile, and the concerned glint in her dark eyes. That was enough.</p><p>He drew her down beside him, nuzzling in her thick, jasmine-scented hair. He was unsure how to begin. He\u2019d never spoken of that night with anyone, not in detail. But years of keeping his silence hadn\u2019t seemed to help matters. Perhaps it was time to try talking instead. He had to do something, if he was ever going to put this behind him. To seize control of his days and his nights, and weave them into some semblance of a normal, boring life.</p><p>He wanted that kind of life. He wanted Minerva to be part of it.</p><p>\u201cIt will be unpleasant to hear,\u201d he warned her. \u201cAre you certain you won\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against his chest. \u201cYou lived through it, Colin. I can find the strength to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should wait for daylight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to wait, we can wait. But I\u2019m ready now if you are.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep, slow breath and then plowed straight in. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what caused it. The accident, I mean. We were coming home from a visit with some neighbors. It wasn\u2019t a long trip. We had no footmen with us, only a driver. I\u2019d fallen asleep on the rear-facing seat. My parents sat together, across from me. I remember listening to them talk and laugh about something. My mother was teasing my father for his overindulgence, I think. I drifted off to the sound of their voices. And then I woke sometime later. To screams.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her arms about his torso. \u201cYou must have been so confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. I had no idea what was happening. It was dark, and we\u2019d careened off the road. I\u2019d fallen from the seat. Somehow, I learned that the carriage had overturned and I\u2019d landed atop the door. I\u2019d cut my head on the latch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She felt for the scar on his temple.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOther than that, I seemed to be unharmed. But I was terrified. The darkness was so complete. Like wearing a blindfold. And the smell of blood . . .\u201d His gut clenched, and he paused to master his composure. \u201cIt was so thick. Smothering. I called for my mother, and she answered. Her voice was weak and strange. But she just kept telling me over and over that all would be well. That I must be brave. That surely someone would come to help us soon. I wanted to believe her, but I knew she was unable to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was the driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeverely injured. He\u2019d been thrown from the driver\u2019s box some distance back, but we couldn\u2019t know it at the time. We only heard the horses in agony. Theirs were the cries that woke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew that already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my mother did. The way they\u2019d landed . . .\u201d He drew a shaky breath. \u201cThis is the unpleasant part, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d She stroked his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a spike of some sort. To this day, I\u2019m not certain whether it was part of the carriage or something in the ditch. A bit of fence, perhaps a branch . . . but they were impaled on it. The both of them. It went all the way through my father\u2019s chest and then into my mother\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered in his embrace. \u201cOh. Oh, Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets worse, I\u2019m afraid. As long my mother kept talking, I knew she was alive. And even when she couldn\u2019t speak anymore, her breathing was so raspy and loud. But when even that stopped . . . I went utterly mad. I panicked. I wanted out. I screamed and beat on the carriage walls until I think I went unconscious. And then\u2014\u201d He choked back his emotion. He\u2019d come this far. He had to get it all out now. \u201cAnd then the wild dogs found us. Drawn by the noise and the scent of blood. They finished the horses. I passed the first half of the night screaming to get out, and second half praying they wouldn\u2019t get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d He felt her tears, hot and wet against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quickly, holding her tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He knew well what a disturbing picture it made. Which was precisely why he\u2019d never shared it. Not with anyone. He hated that such a gruesome tableau would be seared on her imagination. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you should.\u201d Sniffing, she lifted her head. \u201cYou did absolutely right. To think, you\u2019ve been keeping that to yourself all these years? I\u2019m the one who should be sorry.\u201d She worked her arms around his neck and hugged him tight. \u201cColin, I\u2019m sorry. They\u2019re pathetic words, and they\u2019re not enough. But I\u2019m so, so sorry. I wish with all my heart you hadn\u2019t suffered so. But I\u2019m glad you told me everything.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in her hair. For a moment, he feared he would weep. And then he realized, if he did weep\u2014even noisily, messily, uncontrollably\u2014she wouldn\u2019t shrink from him. She probably expected him to shed some tears. These soft, sweetly fragrant arms would hold him as long as he needed to be held.</p><p>So he decided to let the tears come.</p><p>And then they didn\u2019t. Odd.</p><p>For whom should he cry? For his parents? He\u2019d grieved their loss, yes. And he missed them still. But mourning only lasted so long. It was the horror of that night that had lingered. The fear. And the shame.</p><p>The deep, buried, unvoiced shame.</p><p>\u201cFor years,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI thought it was my fault. That if I hadn\u2019t fallen asleep, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cBut that\u2019s nonsensical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a child. There was nothing more you could have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And as a grown man, I understand that, rationally. But . . .\u201d But he\u2019d never managed to rid himself of the notion. It was as though he needed someone else to confirm his innocence. Someone very intelligent and logical. Someone he could trust to always give him the unvarnished truth.</p><p>Someone like Minerva.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Sweet, darling Min. From the first, this was what he\u2019d loved most about her. Her certainty.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to his jaw. He took a deep, slow breath. Remarkable, how much lighter he felt. As though without her arms anchoring him, he might simply float away.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something?\u201d he asked drowsily. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought my parents\u2019 death was like something from a ballad. They loved each other so very much. Even as a boy, I could see it. It seems almost fitting that they met such a poetic end. Always together, united even in death. As tragedies go, you must admit\u2014it\u2019s a rather romantic one.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a long time, but he knew she wasn\u2019t sleeping. Her fingers teased through his hair.</p><p>He\u2019d almost drifted off when he heard her reply.</p><p>\u201cIf you write the verse, I\u2019ll sing it.\u201d</p><p>Minerva didn\u2019t sleep any more that night. Her heart and mind were too full. And somehow, she knew he\u2019d sleep more soundly if she kept the vigil for him.</p><p>As the first rays of dawn seeped into the hut, she stretched her left arm. First overhead, drawing blood to her numbed, stiff fingers. Then habit and necessity drew her arm to the side, where she groped for her spectacles.</p><p>With an incoherent murmur, Colin turned in his sleep. He threw a leaden arm over her torso, and his fingers fumbled for her breast.</p><p>Oh, heavens. Her heart froze for a moment, refusing to beat. Then it underwent a rapid, prickling thaw. It hurt, the way snow-numbed fingertips stung, when thrust in a basin of warm water. Breathing suddenly required conscious thought.</p><p>She reached for her spectacles every morning, first thing. Because she could make no sense of the day without them.</p><p>Colin reached for her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t \u201cheal\u201d him. No woman could. Events that far in the past just couldn\u2019t be undone. But perhaps he didn\u2019t need a cure, but . . . a lens. Someone who accepted him for the imperfect person he was, and then helped him to see the world clear. Like spectacles did for her.</p><p>An hour from now, the idea would seem absurd. But these first misty rays of morning forgave all kinds of foolishness. So just for a moment, she let herself dream. She let herself imagine how it would be to wake like this every day, feeling essential to him. The last thing he touched at night, and first thing he reached for every morning\u2014out of familiarity and a desire to feel whole.</p><p>By the time he stirred with wakefulness, pressing kisses to her cheek, she wanted it so keenly, so desperately, some raw, throbbing part of her heart was already mourning the disappointment.</p><p>She turned away from him, onto her side\u2014not wanting to explain how she\u2019d managed to make herself so overwrought even before breakfast. He nestled behind her, cradling her body with his own. The pose emphasized all the contrasts of their physiques. The hard contours of his chest pressed along her back. The coarser hair of his legs rubbed against her smooth thighs.</p><p>Beneath the linens, his hands roamed her curves with hot, possessive intent. Cinching an arm about her waist, he drew her close. His arousal pulsed against her lower back.</p><p>\u201cMin,\u201d he breathed, nuzzling the curve of her neck. \u201cI need you again. Can you take me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded her assent. But before she could turn to face him, he\u2019d cupped and lifted her leg, shifting position behind her. His hardness wedged between her thighs.</p><p>She tensed, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d He kissed her neck as his fingers slid down her belly, working their way to her cleft. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her intimate flesh with skill and patience. Until she was not only ready, but desperate for him.</p><p>\u201cLove me,\u201d she begged. Because she could speak the words right now, without risking too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took his erection in hand, tilted her hips to just the right angle, and eased inside.</p><p>She was tender from the night before. But he was gentle, holding her curled in his arms and loving her in slow, deliberate strokes. The sweet warmth between them grew and spread. She relaxed her body, undulating with his thrusts so that they moved as one.</p><p>He palmed her breast and pinched her nipple. Then his touch drifted down her body.</p> <p>Yes. Lower. Touch me there.</p><p>He knew what she craved. He caught her pearl with his fingertips and worked her in tight, feverish circles until she shuddered and cried out with the exquisite pleasure. As her climax receded, he withdrew, finishing with a few hard, desperate thrusts between her thighs. As he came, she savored his low growl.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d She felt his smile against her nape.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>His tone changed. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so? Are you wishing we hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Screwing up her courage, she twisted to face him. \u201cI have no regrets. None. But I want assure you, just in case it needs saying . . . I don\u2019t have any expectations.\u201d</p><p>Only hopes. Wistful, foolish hopes.</p><p>He blinked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any expectations.\u201d</p><p>Surely he must understand what she meant. \u201cWhat we shared was wonderful. But I don\u2019t want you to worry that I\u2019m expecting something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cHow very generous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you relieved?\u201d She didn\u2019t understand the annoyance in his voice.</p> <p>He rolled onto his back, rubbing the bridge of his nose. \u201cMinerva, I can\u2019t decide which of us you\u2019re insulting more. After last night, you should have expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpectations of what?\u201d She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cOf me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were the one who argued against having any expectations at all. Isn\u2019t that your grand life philosophy? You said expectations lead to disappointments. That if you expect nothing, you\u2019re always surprised.\u201d</p><p>He gave a bark of laughter. \u201cIn that case . . .\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. His hazel eyes sparked with intensity.</p><p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p> <p>Well, Colin thought. He\u2019d certainly managed to surprise her.</p><p>Whether the surprise fell into the \u201cpleasant\u201d or \u201cunpleasant\u201d category, he wasn\u2019t sure. The latter, he suspected.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move a muscle. But behind her spectacles, her eyelashes worked like twin ebony fans. \u201cMarry? You?\u201d</p><p>He tried not to take offense. \u201cI must say, Minerva. That\u2019s not exactly the breathless, overjoyed acceptance a man might wish to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t exactly the ardent, heartfelt proposal that might warrant one. In fact, I\u2019m not sure it counts as a proposal at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, I suppose.\u201d He lightened his tone. \u201cYou have a temporary reprieve. Right now, out of bed with you. We have to make haste if we\u2019re going to reach York tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait.\u201d As he sat up, she grabbed his arm. \u201cI\u2019m so confused. Is this like one of those silly duels gentlemen arrange for show? You fire off a haphazard proposal at dawn, it sails straight over my head, and somehow honor is satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that at all. I\u2019m serious. I mean to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you\u2019d sworn off marriage.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI seem to recall you saying something similar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Colin, I do appreciate the gesture.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI think. But I won\u2019t marry you simply because you\u2019re feeling a sudden twinge of conscience. We both knew from the outset I\u2019d be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn appearance, yes. But this is actuality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn actuality, I don\u2019t feel ruined at all.\u201d She gave him a sheepish half smile. \u201cOnly a bit tender in places. Did last night feel like some grave mistake to you?\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek. \u201cGod, no. The furthest thing from it.\u201d</p><p>He let his gaze wander her sweet, lovely face. After the night they\u2019d shared, something in his soul finally felt put right.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s this truly about? What on earth can you be thinking?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to sit up. The bedsheets slipped to her hips, revealing her bare torso.</p><p>Colin\u2019s breath left his body. Damn if she didn\u2019t look just exactly the way she had that first night. Her spectacles slipped to the end of her nose, her unbound hair tumbling about her shoulders, her bared breasts tempting him with their touchable perfection.</p><p>A low groan rattled loose from his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cthat last night was inevitable, and I should have known as much the day we left Spindle Cove. I\u2019m thinking that what I ought to do, as a gentleman, is call an immediate halt to this journey and make swift arrangements for a proper wedding.\u201d He stayed her objection with a touch to her lips. \u201cI\u2019m thinking what I\u2019d like to do is push you back on that bed, bar the door, and spend the next week learning your body from the inside out. But mostly, Min . . .\u201d</p><p>He pushed her spectacles back up her nose, so that she could focus on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that I made you two promises. To get you to your symposium, and to do so without seducing you. I\u2019ve broken one of those. But I damn well mean to make good on the other.\u201d He rose from the bed and offered her a hand. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking this conversation will have to wait. We have no time to waste.\u201d</p><p>With a bewildered shake of her head, she took his hand. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Taking a leather bucket from the shepherd\u2019s hut, Colin fetched water from a nearby stream. While Minerva performed her ablutions inside the dwelling, he doused himself in the frigid water\u2014shirt and all.</p><p>His shirt needed washing, and he needed a bracing, icy bath to punish his lustful loins into submission. He\u2019d taken her virtue last night. Then he\u2019d taken her again this morning. He\u2019d broken all his own rules, forsaken what few remaining principles he held. No matter what objections she raised or how many of his own stupid words she threw back at him, his conscience insisted there was only one course of action.</p><p>He must marry her.</p><p>But he had to get her to that symposium first.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to marry him simply because he\u2019d ruined her, and Colin didn\u2019t want that either. No, he wanted her to marry him because he\u2019d helped her triumph. He would prove to her\u2014to himself\u2014that he could be good for her.</p><p>As he submerged himself in the cold water, an insidious, shadowy doubt swirled through his thoughts.</p><p>The road to Edinburgh is paved with good intentions.</p><p>He forced the doubt away, rising to the surface and pushing the water from his face. This time was different. Today, everything was different. For God\u2019s sake, he hated the country\u2014and yet, here he was in the middle of a pasture, making his way to a shepherd\u2019s hut, absurdly wishing he could lease it as a summer home.</p><p>When he returned to the hut, soaked and shivering, Minerva gave him a baleful look through her spectacles. \u201cYou\u2019ll catch cold.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, wringing out his shirttails. \u201cThe sun will dry it soon enough. First order of business when we reach York\u201d\u2014he yanked his breeches up and fastened them under his dripping shirt\u2014\u201dis fresh clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s even possible to make the symposium?\u201d She counted the days on her fingers. \u201cOnly three more nights between now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will make it. We\u2019ll reach York tonight. From there, with our replenished funds, it\u2019s a new journey. We\u2019ll take just a few hours to eat and shop and hire a post-chaise, and then we\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll be miserable. Post-chaises are so small and cramped. Not to mention expensive. We won\u2019t have enough funds to rent you horses past York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the fastest way. If we travel straight through, we\u2019ll make Edinburgh just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravel straight through? We won\u2019t stop for nights?\u201d Her eyes filled with concern.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere won\u2019t be time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Colin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we haven\u2019t time to debate it, either.\u201d He picked up one side of Francine\u2019s trunk. \u201cLet\u2019s be on our way.\u201d</p><p>Money made everything easier. They found a proper breakfast, a ride to the next coaching town, and from there, Colin rented a horse to ride alongside her coach. His last horse of the journey.</p><p>They reached York in late afternoon. He sought out the largest and best of the coaching inns. Holding Minerva close at his side, he approached the innkeeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, sir?\u201d the distracted innkeeper asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need a good dinner. A few hours\u2019 use of a room, just to rest and change. And then I\u2019ll need to inquire about hiring a post-chaise to take us north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far north are you traveling?\u201d the innkeeper asked.</p><p>\u201cEdinburgh. We mean to travel straight through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d The man eyed them with suspicion, his rheumy eyes ranging over their bedraggled attire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay in advance,\u201d Colin offered.</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed. That you most certainly will.\u201d The innkeeper cocked one eyebrow and rubbed the top of his head. He named a figure, and Colin counted out the money.</p><p>He leaned forward and addressed the man in low tones. \u201cListen, perhaps you can help me with something else. My lady here\u2019s been parted from her baggage. Before we continue, I need to find her a new gown. Something pretty.\u201d</p><p>The innkeeper eyed Minerva. \u201cMy missus can find her something, I warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe finest quality this will buy.\u201d To the amount he\u2019d paid for the post-chaise, Colin added several sovereigns.</p><p>Minerva gasped. \u201cColin, don\u2019t. We can\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not negotiable. You must have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>The innkeeper laughed. \u201cCome now, miss. Surely he don\u2019t have to draw you a picture. Elopement or no, a man wants his bride dressed proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Minerva called after him as he shuffled off, disappearing through a doorway. \u201cSir, we\u2019re not eloping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you aren\u2019t,\u201d he called back. \u201cNone of you young lovers are.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Colin.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no use arguing. Do you think he\u2019ll believe we\u2019re headed for a geology symposium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d she said, as they sat down at a table to order their dinner. \u201cWe have had uncommonly good luck today. Reasonably fine weather, except for that short rain. No loss of money or belongings. No fisticuffs. No highwaymen. I keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see those kidnappers chasing after Prince Ampersand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about them. We will have left those highwaymen far behind. Believe me, that group wasn\u2019t sufficiently organized or industrious to follow us beyond their own county.\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cBut I have to admit, I wouldn\u2019t be at all shocked to see someone else catch up to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBram. Or Thorne, or both. When my cousin heard of this, I can\u2019t imagine his reaction was favorable. He knew I had no plan of marrying, as of two days before we left. And if Susanna expressed any doubts as to your willingness . . . I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to decide you needed rescuing.\u201d</p><p>The serving girl brought them two glasses of claret. Colin ordered them a hearty meal of beefsteak, fish stew, sauced vegetables, and apple tart. His stomach growled with hunger.</p><p>\u201cBut I left a note,\u201d Minerva said, once the serving girl had gone. \u201cI told my sister we\u2019d eloped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSlim evidence, on its own.

There was something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Intrigued, he leaned forward. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, um . . .\u201d Blushing, she took a large gulp of wine. \u201cYou might have written me a letter.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne!\u201d</p><p>Samuel Thorne paused in the act of lifting his shovel. He\u2019d know that voice anywhere.</p><p>Damn it. Not her. Not now.</p> <p>\u201cCorporal Thorne, I\u2014\u201d Miss Taylor turned a corner and stopped short when she caught a glimpse of him. \u201cOh. There you are.\u201d</p><p>Blast. Weren\u2019t gently bred ladies supposed to have some rules of decorum that prevented them from surprising half-dressed men at their labor? How the hell was he supposed to greet her with mud streaking his shirt and sweat matting his hair to his scalp?</p><p>Throwing aside the shovel, he hastily wiped his face with a bit of sleeve. He jerked his collar closed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have the good sense to avert her eyes. She just stared at him, wide-eyed and curious. He had half a mind to pull the shirt over his head, cast it aside, and say, Here. Look your fill. This is what years of thieving, prison labor, and battle do to a man.</p><p>He almost chuckled at the thought. Oh, she\u2019d run screaming then.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt your . . . digging.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here, Miss Taylor? What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>She waved a paper clutched in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve come to prove it to you. The truth of the elopement. I have here a love letter, addressed to Minerva Highwood from Lord Payne himself. Miss Charlotte found it in Minerva\u2019s stocking drawer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d Thorne would swallow nails before he\u2019d believe Payne to be in love with Miss Minerva Highwood. It still ate at him, that he hadn\u2019t chased after the couple that very first night. But what was he to do, when the girl\u2019s own mother forbade it?</p><p>Now if only Miss Taylor would let the topic rest. He suffered enough torment in her presence already, without this added deviling.</p><p>She approached and offered him the letter. \u201cRead it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Good God. Now she meant to test his alphabet. Thorne eyed the envelope. A queasy feeling curdled in his gut. He knew his letters reasonably well\u2014better than most men of his station\u2014but he needed time and concentration to sift through a missive of that length. And he\u2019d have an even harder time of it, trying to read with a raging beauty hovering over his shoulder. How was he supposed to put two sounds together in her presence?</p><p>He held up his grimy hands in excuse. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to read it to me.\u201d</p><p>She shook open the paper. \u201c \u2018My darling beloved Minerva,\u2019\u201d she read aloud.</p> <p>And that was the last bit he heard. Oh, she kept reading. And he kept listening. But he wasn\u2019t hearing the words anymore\u2014just her clear, bright voice.</p><p>So strange. She had music in her voice, even when she wasn\u2019t singing. The melody hummed in his body. Not in a pleasant way. It hurt. The same way it would feel if he drove his shovel full-strength into soil and met unyielding rock instead. The shock of it reverberated all through his bones, his teeth.</p><p>His heart.</p><p>And now he hadn\u2019t a damned idea what the hell she was reading anyway. He would have had better luck staring stupidly at the paper himself.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cPayne did not write that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. He signed his name.\u201d</p><p>Thorne cocked his head and stared at the address on the paper\u2019s reverse. \u201cThat\u2019s not Payne\u2019s handwriting.\u201d That much he could discern without effort.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She flipped the paper back and forth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his hand. I know it\u2019s not.\u201d Wiping his hands on his breeches, he strode over to the turret Payne had been using as his personal quarters. He unlocked and opened the door, proceeding straight to the small writing desk.</p><p>He rifled through a stack of papers until he found one in the right penmanship. Then he handed it to her. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>She held up the two and compared them. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It is different penmanship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you so. He didn\u2019t write that letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. Who else would write this, then sign it with Lord Payne\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA cruel joke, perhaps. To build up her hopes. Or maybe she wrote it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Minerva.\u201d</p><p>He watched as Miss Taylor\u2019s bottom lip folded beneath her teeth. Then he forced himself to look elsewhere.</p><p>She said, \u201cBut somehow, it seems to have worked out anyway. They did elope together.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, resisting the urge to tell her everything he\u2019d learned from Mrs. Ginny Watson the other day. When confronted, the young widow had told him all about Miss Minerva\u2019s midnight visit to Rycliff Castle. Thorne knew the truth now, beyond all doubt.</p><p>Payne and Miss Highwood had not eloped.</p><p>They would, however, end up married. He would ensure that much. If Payne dared to come back from this jaunt a bachelor, he would not remain so long. He\u2019d walk Miss Minerva down the aisle of St. Ursula\u2019s if Thorne had to prod him at knifepoint. Protecting the women of this village was his duty, and he took it seriously.</p><p>Which was exactly why he kept his mouth shut now.</p><p>Miss Taylor didn\u2019t need to know the particulars of all Mrs. Watson had told him. If it pleased this girl to believe in true love and tales that ended happily for all concerned, Thorne would carry all manner of unpleasant truths to his grave. After all, this secret was hardly the first. Just one of many he\u2019d vowed to keep, for her happiness\u2019s sake.</p><p>She sifted through the papers.</p><p>He crossed his arms. \u201cWhat, are you snooping now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested. \u201cWell, maybe. Goodness, he writes a great many letters to his stewards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I have a well to dig, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She plucked a paper from the stack. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d She read aloud. \u201c \u2018Millicent . . . Madeira . . . Michaela . . . Marilyn . . .\u2019 And this is written in his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? It\u2019s a list of names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A list of women\u2019s names, all of them beginning with M.\u201d A flush rose on her throat. \u201cThe letter means nothing, but this . . . this is proof. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Payne always acted as though he couldn\u2019t remember Minerva\u2019s name. Calling her Melissa and Miranda and every other \u2018M\u2019 name under the sun. But he must have done it on purpose, don\u2019t you see? Just to tease her. He even went to the trouble of writing out this list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat proves him even more of an blackguard, to my mind.\u201d</p><p>She clucked her tongue impatiently. \u201cCorporal Thorne. You really don\u2019t understand a thing about romance.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shrugged. She was right. He understood desire. He understood wanting. He understood loyalty and bone-deep devotion that stretched back to a time before this woman\u2019s earliest memories.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t know a damn thing about romance.</p><p>She ought to thank God for it.</p><p>There she went, right now\u2014flashing him a fearless smile. No one smiled like that at Thorne. But she\u2019d always been this way. Cheerful, in the face of everything. Singing like a little angel, even when she stood at the very gates of hell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d she said. \u201cApparent dislike often masks a hidden attraction.\u201d</p><p>He felt his face go hot. \u201cNot in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. This list doesn\u2019t prove Lord Payne\u2019s a blackguard.\u201d She tapped the paper against Thorne\u2019s chest. \u201cIt proves he was smitten.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>\u201cI demand to know what was in this letter.\u201d Wearing a devilish grin, Colin chased her up the coaching inn staircase.</p><p>Minerva cringed. She never should have mentioned it. \u201cCan we move past this, please? You plagued me all through dinner. I\u2019ve told you, I don\u2019t recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you, I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you believe me.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door to their chambers. While they\u2019d been eating downstairs, a manservant had been dispatched to fetch a few gentlemen\u2019s necessities for Colin. And the finest secondhand gown three pounds could purchase had been laid out by the maid. A surprisingly lovely muslin frock\u2014ivory, block-printed with tiny pink sprigs.</p><p>A banked fire smoldered in the hearth. And the bed, heaped with pillows and quilts . . . oh, how Minerva\u2019s road-weary body yearned to sink into that bed and stay there for days.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to change before our post-chaise is ready.\u201d She ducked behind a dressing screen in hopes of hiding from this conversation.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have a shave.\u201d She heard him cross to the washstand. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to keep on deviling you, until you confess everything. Did I compose pages of description? Compare your eyes to Brighton diamonds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Bristol diamonds. And no, you did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha. So you do remember the contents.\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath. \u201cVery well. Yes. I do remember. I remember that letter word for word.\u201d</p><p>Water splashed in the basin, and she heard the scratch of his shaving brush against his stubbled jaw. The familiar scent of his shaving soap filled the air. It smelled of cloves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Behind the screen, she picked at a ragged fingernail. \u201cYou wrote that you\u2019d been studying me, when I wasn\u2019t aware of it. Stealing glances when I was lost in thought, or when my head was bent over a book. Admiring the way my dark, wild hair always manages to escapes its pins, tumbling down my neck. Noting the warm glow of my skin, where the sun has kissed it. You wrote that you\u2019re consumed by a savage, visceral passion for an enchantress with raven\u2019s-wing hair and sultry lips. That you see in me a rare, wild beauty that\u2019s been overlooked by other men. Sound familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t.\u201d He muttered a curse and tapped his razor on the washbasin. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have remembered everything I said that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly I could. And what better words to fill a forged letter from you? They were all yours, after all.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou wrote that I was the true reason you\u2019d remained in Spindle Cove all those months. And the letter ended with the sweetest words. \u2018It\u2019s simply you, Minerva. It\u2019s always been you.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time. For as long as it took her to undo fourteen hooks at the back of her abused blue silk gown and pick loose the knots of her corset laces and unbutton all the tiny closures of her shift. For as long as it took for him to finish shaving and cross the room in slow, measured footfalls.</p><p>She heard a creak as he flung himself on the bed. \u201cGod, I was such an ass.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t offer any argument to the contrary.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know the most ironic thing about it, Min?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always liked you.\u201d</p><p>Minerva paused in the act of tying her garter. She allowed herself one moment of absurd, heart-pinching hope before making a loud sound of disbelief. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAll right, perhaps I didn\u2019t always like you.\u201d</p><p>See? She yanked her petticoat laces tight.</p><p>He went on, \u201cBut you have to admit, there was something between us from the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like antagonism, you mean?\u201d She stepped into the new gown and bounced on her toes, tugging the fabric over her petticoats and stays. The fit was rather tight. \u201cThe hostility of two barn cats fighting in a sack?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just . . .\u201d His voice went thoughtful. \u201cI always felt that you could see me, somehow. In a way no one else did. That with those fetching little spectacles, you could peer straight through me. And you made no secret of the fact that you despised what you saw, which marked you as far cleverer than most. I couldn\u2019t rid myself of this fascination with you. Your sharp gaze, your enticing mouth, your complete invulnerability to all my charms. If I treated you poorly\u2014and I know I did, to my shame\u2014it was because I always felt rather hopeless around you.\u201d</p><p>Her spine snapped straight. She couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing.</p><p>She poked her head around the dressing screen and stared at him. He lay on the bed, freshly shaven and washed, legs crossed at the ankles and arms propped behind his head. His posture said, Yes, ladies, I truly am this handsome. And I don\u2019t even have to try.</p> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said. \u201cFelt hopeless around me? Oh, Colin. That is too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d His gaze was sincerity itself.</p><p>Minerva took refuge behind the screen. She was surprised her pounding heartbeat hadn\u2019t knocked it over.</p><p>\u201cI never despised you,\u201d she said. \u201cJust so you know.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to make a sound of utter disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cVery well, I may have despised you a little. But only because . . .\u201d She sighed, unable to deny it any longer. \u201cOnly because I was so wretchedly infatuated with you. I didn\u2019t want to be, but I couldn\u2019t help it. All you had to do was glance my direction, and my heart would go all fluttery. Every time I tried to say something witty in your presence, it came out shrewish or dull. I\u2019ve always considered myself an intelligent person, but I vow, Colin\u2014no one has ever made me feel so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. That\u2019s . . . oddly gratifying.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little at the memories, and at herself. \u201cAnd all the while, everyone in Spindle Cove would talk about what a perfect match you made for Diana. I heard it at the tea shop, at the All Things, around the fire of an evening . . . Just underscoring again and again, no one would ever pair you with a girl like me. And that much I could have lived with, but the prospect of being your sister-in-law?\u201d She swiped at a welling tear with her wrist. \u201cI love my sister. I\u2019ve always tried not to envy Diana her sweetness or elegance or beauty. But I would have envied her you, and the thought made me ill. So if we\u2019re vying for the crown of Most Hopeless, I do think I had it won.\u201d</p><p>After a long silence, he clapped his hands together. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready to trade that crown for a five-hundred-guinea prize. I see our post-chaise out the window. It\u2019s nearly ready.\u201d</p><p>She emerged from behind the dressing screen. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d She turned and fretted in the mirror. \u201cWill the gown do?\u201d</p><p>He came to stand behind her, settling his strong hands on her shoulders and waiting until she went still. \u201cThe gown will do. You, on the other hand . . .\u201d</p> <p>She . . . ? Wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>Out of self-preservation, she tried to twist away from their reflection. His hands tightened on her shoulders, forbidding her to move. She watched him carefully, cautiously in the mirror as his gaze wandered her form.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take the suspense. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Colin. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Min,\u201d he said, in a tone of wonderment. As if his own words took him by surprise. \u201cLord above. You\u2019re stunning.\u201d</p><p>She huffed a protest. \u201cI\u2019m not. You know I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever called me so before. I\u2019m twenty-one years old. If I were beautiful, surely someone would have noticed by now.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to think on this for a moment, dropping one hand to straighten the trim on her sleeve. \u201cIt is hard to imagine anyone overlooking beauty on this magnitude. Perhaps you weren\u2019t beautiful until very recently.\u201d</p> <p>A nervous laugh rose in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t undergone any dramatic transformation.\u201d She searched her own reflection, just to make sure. The same wide brown eyes stared back at her, encircled by brass wire rims. They anchored the same rounded face and funny, heart-shaped mouth. Her skin had freckled and tanned over recent days, but other that that . . . \u201cI\u2019m the same as I ever was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d he said simply, still drinking in her reflection. \u201cI\u2019m altered. Destroyed. Utterly laid waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t tease me.\u201d I can\u2019t bear to be hurt like that again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not teasing you. I\u2019m complimenting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I don\u2019t want compliments. I\u2019m not fanciful that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fanciful?\u201d He laughed. \u201cMin, you have the wildest imagination of anyone I know. You can look at a queer-shaped hole in the ground and see a vast, primeval landscape overrun with giant lizards. But it\u2019s too much to believe you\u2019re beautiful?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>He mused, \u201cMaybe \u2018beautiful\u2019 isn\u2019t the proper word. It\u2019s too common, and the way you look is . . . rare. You deserve a rare compliment. One sincerely meant, and crafted just for you. So there will be no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, you needn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. I\u2019m going to compliment you. Honestly. No raven\u2019s-wing nonsense. You needn\u2019t say a word in return, but I will insist you stand there and take it.\u201d</p><p>She watched him in the mirror as his brows drew into a frown of concentration.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d he said, \u201cyears ago, I heard this fellow speak at the Adventurers Club. He talked about his journeys into the Amazonian jungles.\u201d</p><p>Minerva didn\u2019t like where this excursion was headed. She had the dreadful feeling he was going to compare her to some strange carnivorous plant. One that lured its prey with garish red flowers and the scent of decaying meat.</p><p>\u201cHe was an entomologist, this fellow.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Worse! Insects. He was going to compare her to some giant hairy-legged jungle insect. One that spat venom, or ate small rodents.</p><p>Calm down, she told herself. It might be a butterfly. Butterflies were pretty. Even beautiful, depending on the variety. She heard they came big as dinner plates, in the Amazon.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow, this fellow had spent all this time with the natives, in the thick of the jungles, hunting down hard-shelled beetles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeetles?\u201d The word came out as a whimper.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t remember, to be honest. I slept through much of his talk, but what I recall is this: this native people he lived with, deep in the jungle\u2014their language had dozens of words for rain. Because it was so common to them, you see. Where they lived, it rained almost constantly. Several times a day. So they had words for light rain, and heavy rain, and pounding rain. Something like eighteen different terms for storms, and a whole classification system for mist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>His touch skimmed idly down her arm. \u201cBecause I\u2019m standing here, wanting to give you a fitting compliment, but my paltry vocabulary fails me. I think what I need is a scientific excursion. I need to venture deep into some jungle where beauty takes the place of rain. Where loveliness itself falls from the sky at regular intervals. Dots every surface, saturates the ground, hangs like vapor in the air. Because the way you look, right now . . .\u201d His gaze caught hers in the reflection. \u201cThey\u2019d have a word for it there.\u201d</p><p>Entranced by his touch and his warm, melting tone, she watched her own eyes go glassy in the mirror. She leaned back a fraction, resting against his chest. His heartbeat pounded against her spine, echoing through her chest like some distant drum.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019d be so many words for beauty there,\u201d he went on, bringing his lips close to her ear and dropping his voice to a murmur. \u201cWords for everyday showers of prettiness, and the kind of misty loveliness that disappears whenever you try to grasp it. Beauty that\u2019s heralded by impressive thunder, but turns out to be all flash. And beyond all these, there\u2019d be this word . . . a word that even the most grizzled, wizened elders might have uttered twice in their lifetimes, and in hushed, fearful tones at that. A word for a sudden, cataclysmic torrent of beauty with the power to change landscapes. Make plains out of valleys and alter the course of rivers and leave people clinging to trees, alive and resentful, shaking their fists at the heavens.\u201d</p><p>A hint of sensual frustration roughened his voice. \u201cAnd I will curse the gods along with them, Min. Some wild monsoon raged through me as I looked at you just now. It\u2019s left me rearranged inside, and I don\u2019t have a map.\u201d</p><p>They stared into the mirror. At each other, at themselves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fallen in love with you,\u201d she said, with quiet resignation. \u201cIf I appear changed somehow, I can only imagine that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>She watched him carefully for his reaction. His face became a mask, frozen in time. Eternally handsome and emotionless.</p><p>And then, finally . . . a hint of a roguish grin cracked at the corner of his mouth. \u201cOh, Min\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She stood tall, putting distance between them. She just knew he was going to make some jesting remark to dispel the tension. Oh, Min, don\u2019t fret. You\u2019ll get over it soon. Or, Oh, Min, think of poor Sir Alisdair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do that.\u201d She turned away from the mirror, toward him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare make a joke. It took a great deal of courage to say what I did. And you don\u2019t have to speak a word in return, but I will insist you be man enough to take it. I won\u2019t have you making light of my feelings, or making light of yourself\u2014as if you\u2019re not worthy of them. Because you are worthy, Colin. You\u2019re a generous, good-hearted person, and you deserve to be loved. Deeply, truly, well, and often.\u201d</p><p>He looked utterly bewildered. Well, what did he expect, after the power he\u2019d given her? He couldn\u2019t compare a woman to a torrentially beautiful monsoon, and then look surprised that he\u2019d gotten wet.</p><p>\u201cYou reckless man.\u201d She laid a touch to his cheek. \u201cYou really should be more careful with those compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and straightened his tattered lapels. \u201cI know you have this idea that we\u2019ll marry in Scotland. To satisfy honor, I suppose. While you\u2019ve given me this momentary burst of courage, I\u2019ll tell you this. I will not marry you to satisfy honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Difficult as it was, she forced herself to meet his gaze. \u201cI will only marry you if you love me, and if you can allow me to love you.\u201d A bittersweet smile curved her lips. \u201cThat first night in the turret, you gave me a taste of how it would feel to have your love. It was the most thrilling sensation I\u2019ve ever known. For a moment, I felt as though anything\u2014absolutely anything\u2014could be possible. When it turned out to be false . . . it crushed me, Colin. More than I care to admit. I would rather die a spinster\u2014poor, ruined, scorned, and alone\u2014than suffer that heartbreak daily.\u201d</p><p>Regret creased his eyes at the corners. \u201cThat\u2019s just it, pet. I start with good intentions, but . . . the people around me get hurt.\u201d</p><p>So there it was. Her emotion-swelled heart was beating on borrowed time.</p><p>Seeking consolation from the man who\u2019d soon break it seemed stupid indeed, but she did so anyway. She let her forehead lean against his shoulder. He put his hands on her arms, rubbing lightly up and down. His chin rested square and heavy on her head.</p><p>\u201cI will get you and Francine to Edinburgh in one piece.\u201d He pressed a firm kiss to the top of her head. \u201cIf I can promise you nothing else, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>For the love of tits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin considered himself a patriot and a devoted servant of the Crown. But by God, right now he hated England. This damnable country, plagued with endless rain and cursed with muddy, rutted, barely passable roads.</p><p>Their first day out from York had gone well. Smooth transitions when they changed horses. He passed a few brief stints inside the coach, but spent most of the journey riding next to the postilion. The roads and weather had stayed fair. His hopes had run high.</p><p>Then, today, the rain had started. And it had kept on. And on.</p> <p>At one coaching stop, they had waited an hour before a fresh team was available. The road conditions were so poor in stretches, their pace slowed to a crawl.</p><p>And all along, a clock ticked down inside Colin\u2019s mind. Every hour of slow, inching progress set them further and further behind schedule. The delay was making him wild inside.</p><p>He had to get Minerva to her symposium on time. He\u2019d promised. If he couldn\u2019t see this journey through, how could he ask her to trust him with the rest of her life? Good intentions and pretty compliments weren\u2019t enough. He had to prove this to her, and to himself.</p><p>All was not lost yet. They still had enough time to reach Edinburgh, but their cushion was dwindling. There was no more room for error. When they\u2019d taken luncheon a few hours ago, Colin had told himself\u2014from here on out, everything needed to go right.</p><p>Some fifteen miles after that, they were stuck.</p> <p>The crisis had started at the last coaching inn. There were no horses to be hired, and\u2014due to the rains and mud\u2014no horses expected to come available. Colin had used all his powers of persuasion and a significant sum of money to convince the postilion to forge ahead with the same team\u2014promising him if he turned onto a side road, Colin knew of a place some miles distant where strong, fresh horses could be had.</p><p>And that would have worked brilliantly, if they hadn\u2019t lurched into a rut halfway there, burying two of the wheels spoke-deep in mud.</p><p>Colin tried to lighten the weight. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>He went round the back of the coach and pushed with all his might as the postilion whipped the horses. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Now soaked with rain and covered in mud, he struggled to hold despair at bay. This could be accomplished. It wasn\u2019t too late. They might have been able to pull free with a fresh team, but these poor beasts were simply exhausted. After discussing matters with the postilion, he helped the man unhitch the team and returned to Minerva.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, opening the door to speak with him. \u201cIs he walking away with the horses?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re too tired to pull out of this mire, so he\u2019s going to switch them for new. I told him of a place nearby. We\u2019ll just wait here until he returns.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him closely. \u201cWait here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cIn the rain?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his face to the sky. \u201cI think it\u2019s clearing a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case.\u201d She opened the door and stepped out from the post-chaise, immediately sinking ankle-deep in mud. \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he urged. \u201cGet back in the coach. The rain\u2019s not really clearing at all.\u201d</p><p>Raindrops dotted her spectacles. \u201cSo even that was a lie?\u201d</p> <p>Bloody hell. \u201cI was trying to sound optimistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d Staring down the road, she shook her head. \u201cColin, you have to admit it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He knew what words were coming, and those words would have destroyed him. \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m merely stating facts. Even if the postilion returns, we\u2019ll still be hours behind schedule. And with this rain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d He grabbed her by the upper arms, turning her to face him. The rain had plastered little wisps of hair to her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not over, Min. I made you a promise. I will get you and Francine to Edinburgh in one piece.\u201d He slid his hands up and down her arms, chafing them over the fabric. This scrap of cloth the innkeeper had sold them was much too thin for this weather. \u201cNow get back in the coach before you catch your death.\u201d</p><p>She started to reply, but the distant slap of hooves against mud interrupted her. Colin turned in surprise. A carriage was approaching, drawn by an impressive team of four.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said, releasing her. \u201cI told you. Look, here comes our salvation now.\u201d</p><p>As the coach drew closer, Colin stood to the side of the road, waving his arms. The driver slowed the team.</p><p>One glass window swung open, and a face peered out. A kind-faced woman with graying hair and a lace cap. Wonderful. Colin was a wild success with silver-haired ladies.</p><p>This particular one narrowed her eyes and said, \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Damnation. Really, what were the chances?</p><p>\u201cWhy, Mrs. Fontley,\u201d he said, forcing a grin. \u201cHow lovely to see you again. And fortunate, too. As you can see, we\u2019re in a bit of a muddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to be in prison, you villain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say.\u201d Mr. Fontley\u2019s face squeezed into the frame. \u201cYou have quite a lot of nerve, Sand. If that is your real name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, actually. I lied to you in London, and that was wrong. But I\u2019ll tell you the truth now. I\u2019m a rather useless insomniac viscount, but\u201d\u2014he gestured at Minerva\u2014\u201cmy companion here is a brilliant geologist. There\u2019s a symposium, you see. We need to get to Edinburgh by tomorrow, so she can present her findings about giant lizards and possibly alter our understanding of the world\u2019s natural history.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fontley squawked in disbelief. \u201cLizards? First cobras, now lizards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. This is nothing like the cobras. I swear on my life, this time I\u2019m telling you the absolute truth.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fontley signaled the driver with a knock on the roof. \u201cOnward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. You can\u2019t leave us here.\u201d Colin grabbed the door latch.</p><p>Through the window, Mrs. Fontley beat at his fingers with a folded parasol. \u201cGet away from our carriage, you vile people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilbert!\u201d Minerva rapped at the coach\u2019s front window. \u201cGilbert, please. Can\u2019t you convince them to help us?\u201d</p><p>The youth pressed his fingertips to the glass and gave her a sorrowful look. \u201cI\u2019ll pray for you.\u201d</p><p>The driver whipped the team into motion, and Colin had to pull Minerva away lest she be caught under the wheels. As the coach departed, the footmen tossed down two rectangular objects. They landed in the center of the road with a sick thud, spattering them both with mud.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s trunks.</p><p>Colin stared at them, trying to laugh. He couldn\u2019t. None of this was amusing anymore.</p><p>Pushing rain off his face, he turned to Minerva and found her watching him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d he told her. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re going to say that this is all my fault. That if I\u2019d never lied to the Fontleys, they would have helped us just now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. Just crossed her arms and looked at her boots, encased in mud.</p><p>\u201cBut then I would say to you,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat if I hadn\u2019t lied to the Fontleys, we would have never come this far at all.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cDo you often have arguments with yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll say, \u2018But Colin . . .\u2019 \u201d He raised his voice in a lilting imitation of hers. \u201c \u2018If only we had taken the mail coach, we\u2019d already be in Edinburgh.\u2019 And on that score, you would be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t put words in my m\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waved her off. \u201cYou\u2019re shivering. Did you have a cloak in one of those trunks?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re fine.\u201d The rain picked up strength, and he had to raise his voice to shout through it. \u201cYou\u2019re wet, and getting wetter. You\u2019re here, and not in Scotland. You\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re with me, and not some better man.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re fine, Min.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she finally shouted back, balling her hands into fists. \u201cI\u2019m not fine. I\u2019m disappointed and heartbroken and m-miserably cold. Are you happy now?\u201d</p><p>God damn it. He pushed both hands through his hair and stared down the road. Such a simple thing, a road. Just a strip of dirt running from one place to another. And everyone else in the civilized world, when they wanted to travel from one place to another, would simply get inside a blasted carriage and ride there. Any other man in England could have already delivered her to Edinburgh.</p><p>Any other man would be waiting out this downpour with her in a safe, dry place.</p><p>He strode to the post-chaise door and held it open. \u201cGet inside.\u201d</p><p>Minerva gave up arguing and got inside. Colin joined her, shutting the door behind them. It was a tight fit, what with three occupants. Francine had been riding inside the cab ever since the rain began.</p><p>Once he\u2019d wrestled out of his wet coat and draped it over her lap, Colin unknotted his neck cloth. He slid the length of fabric free, using the drier bits to swab his face and neck.</p><p>She watched him with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long. I gave the postilion explicit directions. He\u2019ll return soon, and we\u2019ll be on our way. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing with the pistol?\u201d</p><p>As she looked on, he retrieved the gun from under the seat and began to load it with ball and powder.</p><p>\u201cSimple precaution,\u201d he said. \u201cStuck like this, we\u2019re a sitting target for thieves.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to interpret his dark mood. This was more than just the closeness of the carriage. He seemed to be blaming himself for everything, the weather included. And she was angry with herself for letting him goad her into heaping yet more recriminations. None of this was his fault.</p><p>\u201cColin, this entire journey was my idea. I\u2019m sorry to have put you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to discuss it.\u201d He recapped the powder horn.</p><p>She tried to respect his wish for silence, but it wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>After a minute, he said lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s not better weather. His fingers drummed against the windowpane. \u201cAll sorts of impressive crags and boulders in this area. You\u2019d be in heaven.\u201d</p><p>She flicked a glance at the window and the square of gray downpour it held. \u201cSo you\u2019ve journeyed this way before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, countless times.\u201d</p><p>Countless times? That made no sense. She thought he\u2019d avoided the country, ever since . . .</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d The chilling realization sank into her bones. She reached for his hand. \u201cColin. We\u2019re not close to your home?\u201d</p><p>The silence confirmed what he wouldn\u2019t say. Her heart pinched. So this was why he knew where the postilion could find fresh horses. He\u2019d simply sent the man to his own estate.</p><p>\u201cWas it very near here?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe accident?\u201d</p><p>He drew a slow breath that seemed the product of great effort. \u201cActually, no. It wasn\u2019t terribly near.\u201d</p><p>But neither was it terribly far, she imagined.</p><p>Overwhelmed with emotion, she nestled close, lacing her fingers tight with his. He was in a cramped, stuffy carriage with her, with night coming on, stuck on the very same roads that had claimed his parents\u2019 lives and destroyed his innocence.</p><p>This was as close as Colin Sandhurst could come to walking barefoot down the brimstone avenues of hell, and he was doing it for her.</p><p>For her.</p><p>She clutched him tighter still. Thank you, she wanted to say. Thank you for believing in me. For braving this for me. If I didn\u2019t love you so madly already, I surely would now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she knew tearful professions were hardly what he needed at the moment. This situation called for distraction.</p><p>She said, \u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long. What shall we do with ourselves to pass the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you read me your presentation again, and I can pretend to pose thoughtful questions?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed a little.</p><p>His voice warmed. \u201cNo, truly. I like listening to it. I can\u2019t pretend to understand every word in your presentation, but I don\u2019t have to be an expert to know you\u2019ve something important to say. I don\u2019t need to be a geologist to understand that it\u2019s well-written and carefully reasoned. And the way you pronounce all those polysyllabic words?\u201d His thigh nudged hers. \u201cMakes me rock hard, every time.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. Not just at the carnal suggestion, but at his honest appreciation for her scholarship. For all his teasing over the months, she had to give him this: he\u2019d never once suggested she lacked a mind of her own, or insinuated her sex must be an intellectual handicap. How many men of his rank and importance would so readily recognize a young unmarried woman as their academic superior?</p><p>She supposed she\u2019d find out when they reached Edinburgh.</p><p>If they reached Edinburgh.</p> <p>\u201cWe will make it,\u201d he insisted, as though he could read her thoughts. \u201cGo ahead, read through the presentation again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s growing too dark for me to read my notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Looking drawn and tense, he leaned against the carriage wall. He tugged at his open collar. \u201cNight will be coming on soon, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Drat. Minerva winced. Of all the stupid things to say.</p><p>He was working mightily to conceal his physical discomfort, but she knew this was misery for him.</p><p>\u201cColin, why don\u2019t we just get out and walk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s pouring rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little wet won\u2019t hurt us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would chill you. And it would demolish Francine. In a lighter rain, the trunk might keep her dry. But a downpour like this? You know the rain will pound right through the seams. The plaster would disintegrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll just leave her here in the carriage.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOut of the question. I\u2019ve done far too much and come much too far with that scaly old girl. She\u2019s not getting out of my sight now. I\u2019m fine. I can do this, Min. The postilion will be back soon with fresh horses, and we\u2019ll be moving on.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice would brook no argument.</p><p>\u201cWell, we must have some distraction in the meantime.\u201d She perked. \u201cI know. Let\u2019s list naughty-sounding mathematical terms.\u201d In her most tarty, breathy voice, she whispered, \u201cParabola.\u201d</p><p>After a pause, his fingers squeezed hers. \u201cTessellation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBinomial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy stop there? Trinomial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just wicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ve been saving this one.\u201d He leaned close to whisper in her ear. \u201cAnnulus.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she crawled into his lap. \u201cOh, Colin. This is why I love you.\u201d</p><p>His hands went to her waist. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake. Because my adolescent mind always wandered to ribald places when I should have been attending my studies?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDid I need a better reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think so. Yes.\u201d His brow met hers, and his voice dropped to a raw whisper. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, Min. You must know that\u2019s why. You need a much better reason to love me, and I\u2019m trying like hell to give you one.\u201d</p><p>Dear, foolish man. By shifting her weight and pulling at her skirts, she managed to straddle his lap. \u201cJust kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Framing his face in her hands, she brushed her lips against his. Then he kissed her back, fierce and deep. Their tongues tangled and played.</p><p>She guided his hand to her breast. He moaned into her mouth as he cupped and kneaded, smoothing his palm over the fabric-cloaked bud of her nipple. Their kisses became greedy, urgent. He ravaged her mouth with his lips and tongue, and she gave back as good as he gave.</p><p>The firm ridge of his arousal announced itself, thrusting against her inner thigh. His free hand found her backside and grabbed tight, grinding her pelvis against his.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sat back to loosen her bodice. \u201cYes. Make love to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin, I want . . .\u201d He worked for breath as he pushed up her skirts. \u201cJesus, I can\u2019t be gentle right now. I can\u2019t make love to you. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered with disappointment, pressing her body to his. She needed him so badly, and she could feel the significant proportions of his need for her. He couldn\u2019t say no.</p><p>His sweaty brow pressed against her neck. He licked, then nipped the top of her breast. \u201cYou deserve sweet, tender love. A man who\u2019ll give you anything you desire. But right now, what I want is to take. To take you hard and fast and wild enough to light up the whole damn night.\u201d</p><p>His fingers delved under her petticoats and found her sex, plunging deep without preliminary.</p><p>She gasped. She was so ready for him, his fingers slipped right in.</p><p>\u201cCan I . . .\u201d He pushed deeper, grunting. \u201cWill you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew his fingers and began fumbling with the buttons of his breeches falls. \u201cSay it. I need to know you understand, that you\u2019re fully willing.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t merely willing. She was wanting, desperately.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>Arousal rushed through her. She actually felt herself go damp and pink.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she said louder, this time owning the words. Owning the wildness that was a part of her, too. \u201cTake me. Now.\u201d</p><p>He positioned himself and entered her on a hard, almost painful thrust. She cried out with the joy of it. With fierce digs of his hips, he worked deeper still. Her pelvis banged his, and the entire post-chaise jounced and rattled on its springs.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Minerva. I don\u2019t deserve you. You\u2019re so good. So hot and so wet and so very, very good to me. Clever, foolish, lovely thing.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord, did the man never stop talking? Minerva didn\u2019t want to converse right now. She just wanted . . . deeper. Harder. More.</p><p>She caught his earlobe between her teeth and growled, spreading her legs to draw him closer still. He clutched her hips and pumped wildly, guiding her up and down his length. She rode his thrusts with abandon, bracing one arm against the carriage roof for better leverage. They clung to each other with teeth and nails, making harsh, snarling, animal sounds.</p><p>The whole coach bucked and swayed with their frantic rhythm. The square windowpane fogged over with the heat of their passion.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered closed, blocking out what daylight remained. His arousing words became inarticulate grunts. Their rhythm took on a power of its own, became a force unto itself.</p><p>In his arms, she was speechless, helpless, heedless, mindless. She knew nothing but sensation. Nothing but him.</p><p>When the climax hit her, she gave a helpless, keening cry of joy. Pleasure racked her body. He withdrew from her all too soon, growling curses and blessings and spurting warmth against her thigh.</p><p>\u201cMin.\u201d His hot, openmouthed kisses covered her face and throat. His voice was raw with emotion. \u201cMin, don\u2019t ever leave me.\u201d</p><p>She laced her arms around his neck. \u201cColin, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud, brittle snap interrupted her. Followed by a creak of metal and a shivering, shuddering moan.</p><p>And then they were falling. Falling in each other\u2019s arms, as the whole post-chaise toppled to the side.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Together, they slid to the end of the bench, slamming against the wall of the post-chaise. Then the wall became the floor, as the whole business tipped on its side.</p><p>The coach hit the mud with a thick squelch. They broke apart, and Minerva\u2019s shoulder jarred painfully as she bounced against the side panel.</p><p>\u201cMin.\u201d He scrambled to her side. \u201cMinerva, tell me you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she hastened to say. \u201cUnharmed.\u201d</p><p>Mostly.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t tell him so, but her shoulder did ache a bit. Nevertheless, this was hardly a dramatic, deathly carriage accident. The post-chaise hadn\u2019t even been in motion. It was really no more than falling off a fence, or out of a tree.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t die.\u201d He clutched her tight. \u201cIf you died, I\u2019d beg God to take me, too.\u201d</p><p>Lord, what a statement. She forced herself to ignore its implications and keep to the task at hand: reassurance.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not dying. I\u2019m not even injured.\u201d</p><p>He searched her face. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bleeding anywhere? You can feel all your limbs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel my arms around you?\u201d</p><p>She stroked up and down his back, until he released a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He moved his weight off her chest, laughing a bit. He passed a hand over his face. \u201cGood God. I didn\u2019t realize how unstable these contraptions are without a team hitched to them. I suppose we were too . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cZealous?\u201d She smiled. \u201cWell, look at it this way. The wheels aren\u2019t stuck in the mud any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is true. Let me help you up.\u201d</p><p>They untangled their knot of limbs. Colin rose first, then offered his hand.</p><p>As she got her feet under her, Minerva\u2019s boots sloshed. Water was seeping in through the coach\u2019s damaged side panels, puddling at their feet.</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d</p><p>Colin had noticed it, too. He tipped the trunk, using his boot to move it away from the growing puddle. Francine was packed so tightly, she\u2019d no doubt survived the fall\u2014but she wouldn\u2019t survive a soaking.</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t our . . . you know . . . that toppled the chaise. At least, not entirely.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe road is flooding. That\u2019s why the wheels slid free.\u201d</p><p>The muddy water lapped at her hem. \u201cWe should get out of here. Right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Colin raised his hands and pushed on the door overhead.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>With a curse, he caught the door latch and rattled it violently. \u201cOpen, damn you,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said, trying to keep him calm. \u201cWe\u2019re not trapped. If you break the window, I can crawl through and open it from the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You always were the clever one. Move aside and cover your head.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d obeyed, he took a handkerchief from his breast pocket and wrapped it tight about his knuckles. Then he grabbed the pistol by the barrel and used it to smash at the windowpane. Two good swings, and he had it cracked.</p><p>Small bits of glass rained down on Minerva\u2019s bowed head and shoulders. When the shower of glass had ceased and true raindrops made their way inside, it seemed safe to look up. She glimpsed him clearing the few remaining jagged shards from the edges of the window opening.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He cupped one hand and held it out. \u201cYou put your boot in my hand and your hand on my shoulder. I\u2019ll lift you up.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>As her head and shoulders emerged through the small opening, Minerva braced her hands on either side of the makeshift hatch. She hauled the rest of her body up and through. Rain doused her instantly, plastering her hair to her neck and brow. She swiped it away, impatient.</p><p>Once she had her entire body outside the carriage, she knelt on the top\u2014which had recently been the side\u2014and pulled at the door latch with both hands, rattling and cursing the twisted bit of metal.</p><p>\u201cDrat. The latch is jammed from this side, too.\u201d She peered down at him. \u201cJust come through the window, like I did. It will be a tight squeeze, but you\u2019ll fit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll fit. But Francine won\u2019t.\u201d He hefted the trunk with both hands, lifting it above the water. It was far too big to fit through the window. \u201cGo on. Take shelter under some trees. I\u2019ll keep her dry until the rain lets up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave you here? Alone?\u201d</p><p>A flicker of some emotion passed over his features, but he squelched it. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll stay within shouting distance. You know our system, M. Tallyho, and all that.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. Impossible man. Not five minutes ago, he\u2019d clutched her in his arms and begged her to never leave him. Pledged to follow her to the grave, if it came to that. He honestly thought she would abandon him now? Leave him trapped in a darkened carriage, alone, on these same roads that had claimed his parents\u2019 lives?</p><p>He truly was cracked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not leaving this trunk.\u201d</p><p>She rattled at the door latch again. It still refused to budge. \u201cPerhaps I can break it open. Hand me the pistol, will you?\u201d</p> <p>Reaching up through the broken window, he handed her the weapon. She unwrapped it, slid her palm around the grip . . .</p><p>And then leveled it at him.</p><p>\u201cCome out of there, Colin.\u201d</p><p>She spoke with cool, unruffled calm, shielding the gun from the rain with her body. Minerva didn\u2019t mean to really threaten his life. She just hoped to shock him out of his stubborn, foolish wish to stay inside that coffin.</p><p>Well, he certainly looked surprised.</p><p>His incredulous gaze flicked from her face to the pistol in her hand. \u201cMin, have you gone mad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might ask you the same! It\u2019s over, Colin.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cIt\u2019s over. We\u2019re not going to reach Edinburgh, and this isn\u2019t worth another moment of your distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with my \u2018distress.\u2019 This is your life\u2019s work in this trunk. I\u2019m not leaving it. And we can still make the symposium, Min. As soon as the postilion returns . . .\u201d</p><p>Minerva looked up and around. No sign of the postilion or horses anywhere. Muddy runnels swelled in the road, carrying a tide of leaves and sticks coursing past. And the rain only pounded harder, pinging and thundering against the shell of the coach.</p><p>She had to raise her voice to call over the din. \u201cThe water\u2019s rising, and night is falling. The post-chaise is damaged. Even if the horses arrive, the road will be impassable. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlast it, Min. Don\u2019t you give up on this. Don\u2019t you give up on me. I made a promise to you, and I will damn well keep it. I will find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>A startled cry stole the rest of her argument. The overturned coach lurched a half foot sideways. The rising rainwater had buoyed the hollow, overturned post-chaise, allowing it to slip over the mud.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s gut clenched. She had to get him out. His stubborn insistence on remaining in the carriage was now not only foolhardy, but dangerous. If the water kept rising, they could slip right off the road.</p> <p>She thrust the pistol forward. \u201cColin, drop the trunk. We both need to leave this coach. No more arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI won\u2019t do it, Min.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you leave me no choice.\u201d</p><p>She steadied the pistol, cocked the hammer, aimed\u2014</p><p>And fired.</p><p>\u201cHoly\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bang.</p><p>When the pistol went off, Colin\u2019s first thought was: My God. She did it. She actually shot me.</p><p>His second thought was: When the hell were my blood and guts replaced with gritty white powder?</p><p>As the dust settled, Colin slowly realized that she had not shot him. She\u2019d sent a bullet whizzing straight through her trunk. And the plume of white powder that exploded through the dim interior was not the remnants of his calcified heart.</p><p>It was Francine.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>God damn it. He wished Minerva had shot him in the guts instead. It would have hurt less. And at least his guts might have a chance of mending. Francine, on the other hand . . .</p><p>Francine was gone.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014?\u201d He choked on the plaster dust. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you left me no choice,\u201d she cried, flinging the pistol away. \u201cNow come out of there. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s over.</p><p>Yes, it was over. All of it, over. She\u2019d just shot a bullet through all her hopes and dreams. It didn\u2019t matter if the postilion arrived with four fresh horses. It didn\u2019t matter if the clouds suddenly parted and a hot-air balloon descended to whisk them to Scotland. Without Francine, it was over.</p><p>He swallowed back the bitter lump in his throat. There was nothing left to do but admit defeat.</p><p>He\u2019d failed her. He\u2019d managed to fail her, despite all his best efforts. His good intentions landed like mortar shells, and this time Francine had taken the hit.</p><p>He hoisted himself out through the broken window. He jumped from the post-chaise first, landing in calf-deep water. \u201cJump into my arms,\u201d he directed.</p><p>Minerva obeyed. She clung to his neck, just as though he were the hero in her fairy tale and not the villain ruining everything. \u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>Colin stared down the road, peering through the tapering rainfall. Could those shadows be . . . ?</p><p>Horses. Yes, they were. A fine team of four from his own stables. At last, here came the postilion\u2014accompanied by two of Colin\u2019s own grooms from Riverchase.</p><p>He released his breath and told her, \u201cHome. We go home.\u201d</p><p>The distance to Riverchase was only a few miles, but the road conditions forced him to take those miles at a painfully slow walk. He held Minerva in front of him on his horse, trying his best to shield her from the cold and wet.</p><p>For a while, he thought she\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>Until she mumbled, \u201cColin? What is that vast, impressive-looking place in the distance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Riverchase. My estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be. It\u2019s lovely. All that g-granite.\u201d</p><p>He laughed inwardly. She would notice that first. \u201cIt\u2019s local stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet it sparkles in broad daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s luminous.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arm about her, drawing her close. For the first time, he noticed how violently she shivered against his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust cold. So c-cold.\u201d</p><p>Swearing under his breath, Colin nudged the horse into a trot. The rain was dwindling to a mere trickle, but she\u2019d already been soaked through. He had to get her before a fire, and quickly.</p><p>At least the Riverchase staff had been warned by the postilion that their master was in the neighborhood. The entire house had been thrown into readiness. When Colin rode up in the drive, the front door opened and a bevy of servants sallied forth.</p><p>Colin slid from the horse first, then helped Minerva drop into his arms. Sliding one arm about her back and lashing the other beneath her thighs, he carried her up the fourteen granite stairs and through the main entry.</p><p>The old, familiar housekeeper, Mrs. Hammond, hurried to greet him. It must have been almost two years since he\u2019d seen her, but he cut the salutations short.</p><p>\u201cHave you laid a fire?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the drawing room, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Shifting Minerva\u2019s weight in his arms, he strode past the housekeeper and turned directly into the drawing room. He laid Minerva\u2019s sodden, shivering form on a plush divan and pushed the entire thing\u2014furniture and woman\u2014forward, until it sat a few feet from the hearth. The fire was young and blazing. Scorching flames leaped and danced.</p><p>\u201cThis is a lovely room,\u201d Minerva said weakly. \u201cI\u2019m so gl-glad to\u2014\u201d Her teeth chattered. \u201cTo have this chance to see your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush. Don\u2019t try to talk. You can have the grand tour later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Her thin, quivering attempt at a smile made him want to howl with anguish. It should not be this way. He slipped the spectacles from her face, wiped them dry, and replaced them on her nose.</p><p>Mrs. Hammond stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cBring blankets,\u201d he ordered. \u201cA clean shift, I don\u2019t care whose. Hot tea immediately, and other refreshment as you\u2019re able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Once the woman disappeared, Colin set about the work of removing Minerva\u2019s soaked clothing. She tried to help him, but her fingers were shaking too hard.</p><p>\u201cBe still, pet. Allow me.\u201d</p><p>In the end he gave up on the buttons and hooks and drew the folding knife from his boot, using it to slice her gown at the seams. He peeled the drenched fabric from her body, tossing her garments into a heap by the fire. As he hacked away at the sweet, gauzy muslin, he wanted to weep.</p><p>A week ago had he harbored some vague concern that he might ruin this girl? Taint her reputation beyond repair? Or, horrors\u2014steal her virtue?</p><p>She should have been so lucky.</p><p>Look at her now. Curled up, shivering uncontrollably. Skin pale, lips blue, gown in rags. Dreams left shattered and strewn on a country road, and all her hopes for the future vanished. As he undressed her, he found a horrific bruise swelling on her shoulder.</p><p>This went beyond social ruin. This was complete and total devastation he\u2019d wrought upon her.</p><p>The deep, eviscerating pain Colin felt at that moment told him two things, both equally tragic.</p><p>He loved her, beyond anything.</p><p>And she was lost to him, forever.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Amazing, what an hour\u2019s rest, a warm fire, and a spot of doctored tea could do for a girl\u2019s constitution. As she snuggled into her warm nest of blankets, Minerva decided fleecy quilts were her new favorite attire.</p><p>And she\u2019d yet to have the promised grand tour, but judging by what little she\u2019d glimpsed thus far, Riverchase was the finest home Minerva had ever dripped inside.</p><p>If only Colin would abandon his post by the hearth and come sit next to her, she would feel completely restored. He looked so miserable. She started to rise and go to him. But he stayed her with an outstretched hand and single, harsh word.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His voice and his eyes were so cold. Minerva shrank back into the divan.</p><p>He stared into the fire. \u201cI\u2019m sending you back to London. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d Her breath caught painfully. \u201cYou\u2019re sending me to London? Not taking me.\u201d</p><p>Now that Scotland was no longer their destination, she supposed it made sense that they would turn back. But tomorrow? Separately?</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s safer that way. And more expedient. Naturally, you\u2019ll have outriders for your security. Mrs. Hammond, my housekeeper, will travel as your companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ride ahead to warn Bram, so he\u2019ll be expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff? But what will you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d He gestured vaguely. \u201cSome version of it. That we left Spindle Cove with plans to go to Scotland, but it didn\u2019t work out. And that I\u2019m asking his and Susanna\u2019s help in salvaging your reputation. We\u2019ll tell everyone you never traveled past London. That you fell ill that first night, and you\u2019ve been staying with them the whole week.\u201d</p><p>The prospect of so much deceit made Minerva\u2019s stomach churn. \u201cSusanna is my friend. I don\u2019t want her to lie for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch things are done all the time.\u201d</p><p>Minerva knew this much was true. More than one of the young ladies she\u2019d met in Spindle Cove had been sent there to weather a scandal or indiscretion. As the village\u2019s erstwhile patroness, Susanna kept a great many secrets. And society at large owed her a great many favors of discretion, no doubt.</p><p>But it would be one thing to conceal this journey from public notice, and another thing to banish it from their own memories. He spoke as if they would be strangers to each other, from this point forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is what you truly want?\u201d she asked him. \u201cTo just pretend none of this happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what occurs, you will never lack for anything. Once I gain control of my accounts, I\u2019ll quietly settle some money on you. Enough that you\u2019ll be able to live as you desire. Set up house in any place you wish. Devote your life to your scholarship. You and your sisters will always have my protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour protection? Am I to be your mistress, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed a sob. \u201cNot even that?\u201d</p><p>With a muttered curse, he crossed the room and sat beside her. \u201cMinerva, I would never degrade you that way. After all the pain I\u2019ve caused you, I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you banished me from your sight.\u201d He dropped his head to his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t make me list all the ways I\u2019ve failed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll list everything you\u2019ve given me. Hot tea and blankets. A day at the fair. An apple, an orange, peaches, cherries. The chance to win twenty pounds in a shooting contest. The courage to sing in a tavern. My first honest compliments. Breathless passion, and enough adventure to last a lifetime. Just think, in this one week alone I\u2019ve been a missionary, an assassin, a long-lost princess . . . and, we can\u2019t forget, a sword swallower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me.\u201d Looking up, he gave her a half smile. \u201cSo long as I live, I will never, ever forget that.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart warmed to see that flash of his familiar good nature. This was the Colin she knew and loved.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAfter all that adventure, perhaps being a simple geologist would have come as a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t lie to me, Minerva.\u201d His hand went to her cheek. \u201cI know how much it meant to you. You can\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not disappointed.\u201d</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t. And she couldn\u2019t hold back the tears any longer. He held her in his arms while she had a good little cry for poor, pulverized Francine and all those smashed scientific ambitions.</p><p>After a few minutes, she wiped her eyes. \u201cI just wanted to leave a footprint. Make my own lasting mark on this earth, the same way Francine left hers. To post a little sign that will survive for generations to come: \u2018Minerva Highwood was here, and the world is just a little different for her presence.\u2019 I just wanted to make an impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you should have done.\u201d He rose from the divan and strode to the hearth, where he tapped the mantel with his fist. \u201cYou would have done. Your only mistake was joining up with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it was. Haven\u2019t you noticed, Min? I leave impressions everywhere. Except in my case, they\u2019re not footprints. They\u2019re more like craters.\u201d</p><p>With a single finger, he nudged a porcelain shepherdess toward the edge of the mantel and then\u2014</p><p>Smash it went on the hearthstone.</p><p>\u201cOh look,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cColin Sandhurst was here.\u201d He sent another figurine careening to its doom. \u201cAnd here.\u201d A third crash. \u201cHere, as well.\u201d</p><p>As the melody of destruction trailed off into silence, Minerva took a deep breath and forced herself to be calm. \u201cColin, do you . . .\u201d She steeled her nerve. \u201cCould you love me?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t ask me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t answer you. Because no matter what I say, I\u2019ll make a hash of it somehow. I can\u2019t even get your plaster lizard footprint to Scotland. How could I ever be trusted with something so precious as your heart?\u201d</p><p>Drawing a blanket about her shoulders, she pushed to her feet. She crossed the room and moved to stand at the opposite corner of the hearth.</p><p>\u201cColin, if you could love me . . . nothing else would matter. You\u2019re worth so much more than a science prize of five hundred guineas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do you think?\u201d He cast a pointed glance around the magnificently furnished drawing room. \u201cYes, I\u2019m worth a great deal more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this was never about the money. I know how much it meant to you. You were so driven to attend that symposium. You\u2019ve risked everything, Min. Security, reputation. Your very life. And I destroyed those dreams.\u201d</p><p>She touched his wrist and waited until he met her gaze. \u201cYou didn\u2019t destroy my dreams. You broke me out of my shell. There was bound to be a bit of a mess.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a light caress against her cheek and whispered, \u201cMin.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and wiped a lingering tear. \u201cDespite everything, this has been the most exciting, magical week of my life. I\u2019m only sad that it\u2019s ending this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s just wrong, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He took up the poker and stirred the fire with agitated motions. \u201cI had this idea, you see. More of a foolish hope, I suppose. That all through this mad, tumultuous journey . . . we\u2019d been writing the story of our future.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cDo you mean we were actually going to become missionaries in Ceylon? Or join up with a circus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t mean that we\u2019d been foretelling our future. I meant, I hoped we\u2019d been writing the story of our future. The tale we would tell and retell, over goblets of wine at dinner parties, and on dreary spring days when it\u2019s too muddy for lawn bowls. Do you know what I mean? That it would be our story, Min. One we\u2019d remember and laugh over for years to come, even tell some bits to our . . .\u201d His voice trailed off as he replaced the poker in the andiron.</p><p>\u201cTo our what?\u201d Her heart missed a beat. \u201cTo our children?\u201d Had he been dreaming of a life with her?</p><p>\u201cMinerva, you\u2019re the most clever person I know. You can look at a queer-shaped hole in the ground and see a rich, vibrant ancient world. Look at me now.\u201d</p><p>Looking him in those fiery Bristol-diamond eyes was never a trial.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you see a pleasant future with me?\u201d</p><p>She reached for him, teasing her fingers through his hair. \u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at you, my thoughts are something like this: God only knows what trials lie down that path.\u201d Smiling, she slipped her arms around his neck. \u201cBut take heart, Colin. Some women like to be surprised.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long, breathless moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said darkly. He caught her up in one swift motion. \u201cSurprise.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Colin flattened her to the wall, greedily clutching her everywhere he could reach. Pressing fervent kisses to her brow, her cheek, her lips.</p><p>He needed this. Needed her.</p><p>Needed it now.</p><p>He yanked the buttons of her shift loose. Unfastening some, simply popping others from their threads. Soon the frail linen garment lay discarded at her feet.</p><p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d With a resonant sigh, he pressed the full length of his clothed body to her nakedness. Bracing his hands against the wall, he nudged her thighs apart with his knee. Bending his head, he kissed and licked her neck, all the while grinding his desperate erection against her heat.</p><p>A groan welled in his chest. \u201cI need you, Min. Need you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she breathed. Her arms draped over his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m yours. A sweet pang of emotion wrenched his heart. Still, he kept his hands braced on the wallpaper\u2014not trusting himself to touch her yet.</p><p>He backed up a bit, wanting to see. To admire.</p><p>She reached for him. \u201cColin . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d His voice shook with desire. \u201cLet me look at you.\u201d</p><p>She fell back against the wallpaper, displaying herself for his view. He\u2019d never dreamed a woman could be so beautiful.</p><p>She looked more luminous against this wall than a Dutch master\u2019s painting ever could. Her flawless skin would make a porcelain shepherdess weep bitter, envious tears. And her breasts . . .</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a decorative parallel for her breasts. But they made him hard as the parquet floor. Her breasts were every bit as wildly arousing as the first time he\u2019d glimpsed them in that London inn.</p><p>He kissed his way down her elegant throat, pausing to suckle each of those luscious nipples as he sank to his knees. When his knees met the floor, he made himself comfortable there, resting on his haunches. Pressing light kisses to her navel. Nuzzling her thigh. Settling in for a nice long visit.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He nudged her legs apart and sifted through her dark curls. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting this forever.\u201d</p><p>She laughed nervously. \u201cWe\u2019ve been traveling a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been forever.\u201d He parted her with his fingers, exploring her folds and circling his thumb over her swollen pearl. \u201cYou can\u2019t know, Min. You can\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a single, chaste kiss to her sex. Just a prelude, so she wouldn\u2019t be too shocked.</p><p>Then he slid one arm under her knee, hooking it over his shoulder. With his hands, he bracketed her hips, reaching toward her sex with both thumbs to spread her wide to his view. To his kiss.</p><p>She made a strangled noise. \u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d He blew the word over her delicate flesh. \u201cYou had your chance to explore every bit of me. Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>And explore he did. Most thoroughly. He ran his tongue\u2014just lightly\u2014over every flushed, dewy petal of her sex. Down one side, up the other . . . until he centered on that swollen bud at the crest. Again, teasing lightly. Just lightly. Until her breath went ragged and she arched her hips, digging her heel into his back to pull him close.</p><p>Yes. That\u2019s it. Hold me close and tight. Claim me. Make me a slave to your pleasure.</p><p>But something wicked in him wouldn\u2019t give her what she craved. Not yet. He kept up his light, teasing attentions. Until she rocked against his mouth in an urgent rhythm, and needy whimpers eased from her throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, Colin. Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>So blasphemous, but he loved being classed above the divine in her universe. Even if only for a brief, wanton second.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling?\u201d he murmured, between slow, languid strokes of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI need . . . I need something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He dipped his tongue inside her.</p><p>She gasped and bucked. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Her grip twisted in his hair. Her heady taste lingered on his tongue. He needed more, too. And he couldn\u2019t wait a moment longer.</p><p>Lowering her leg to the ground, Colin pushed to his feet and hastily stepped out of his unfastened trousers. He pulled his shirt over his head and cast it aside. Clutching her backside in both hands, he lifted her against the wall. He pinned her with a fierce gaze, determined to read her every emotion.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me, Min?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She writhed against him, wild and slick and hot.</p><p>\u201cLove me?\u201d His voice was so hoarse with yearning, the words got lost in his throat. He slid into her, pushing his hard length into her tight body. \u201cLove me,\u201d he grunted, driving the words home on a thrust. \u201cLove. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gasped with pleasure, canting her pelvis to take him deep. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pumped her steadily, driving into her at just the angle he knew she craved. \u201cLove me. Don\u2019t ever stop. You hear me? It won\u2019t be this good with anyone else. Only me, Min. Only me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d She dug her nails into his shoulders and pulled herself off the wall, confronting him face to face. Her tongue made a quick, hungry swipe at his. \u201cI love you. Stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>He pressed her back against the wall. No more discussion. Only joining and clasping and thrusting. And kissing, hot and wet and deep. Only this desperate, visceral need to get closer, in every possible way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without warning, her body bowed and tensed. She clung to him as the crisis hit, crying out against his ear. Her intimate muscles tightened, sending pulsing waves of friction down his cock.</p><p>This time, he didn\u2019t hold back. Couldn\u2019t, even if he tried. He rode the crest of her pleasure, thrusting frenzied as her climax pulled him straight into his own.</p><p>When he came inside her, the sheer blinding joy of it was like nothing he\u2019d ever known. It took him outside himself. Sent him spinning into a strange, dark place. He was lost there, for a moment, stranded in bliss. But soon, her soothing caress led him back.</p> <p>She would always lead him back from the darkness.</p><p>How could she not? She held his heart.</p><p>\u201cMinerva.\u201d Spent and trembling, he buried his face in her neck. \u201cI need to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This is a very important question. One I\u2019ve never posed to any woman before. I want you to think carefully about your answer.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAfter all this madness is over, and I see you safely back home . . . do you think you could see fit to . . .\u201d He swallowed hard and lifted his gaze to hers. \u201cTo let me court you?\u201d</p><p>Her lips fell apart. \u201cCourt me. You . . . you want to court me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Very much so. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin, you do realize you\u2019re currently inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exquisitely aware of that, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers sifted through the hair at his temples. \u201cThen the horse is through the gate, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t you think formal courting would be an unnecessary bother at this point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bother at all.\u201d He kissed the confused twist from her lips. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s necessary indeed. You deserve to be courted, Min. Flowers, picnics, walks in the park, and all the rest of it. And if I do say it myself, I have a suspicion I\u2019ll be rather brilliant at courting, once I apply myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sure you will be, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe season will be in full swing soon.\u201d He gently withdrew from her, then set her back on her toes. \u201cI\u2019ll convince your mother to send you to London, so I can lavish attention on you in front of the entire ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth would we manage that, after we\u2019ve returned unwed from this scandalous journey? Even with your cousin\u2019s help, the gossip will be vicious.\u201d</p><p>He tsked. \u201cEven if there is some scandal and we\u2019re denied vouchers at fusty old Almacks, what of it? We\u2019ll be welcome any number of other places. Balls, opera, the theater, Vauxhall. We\u2019ll be the talk of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can imagine. They\u2019ll all be wondering what that awkward little bluestocking slipped in your wine to make you go so addled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t speak that way.\u201d He propped a finger under her chin. \u201cI hate it when you speak ill of yourself, Min. I\u2019d visit bodily harm on anyone who dared insult you, but I don\u2019t know how to guard you from yourself. So kindly do me a favor, and just . . . don\u2019t. All right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Her bottom lip trembled. He traced it fondly. \u201cSpoiling you will bring me so much pleasure. I\u2019ll make you feel like a queen. I\u2019ll do everything I can to win you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Colin, don\u2019t you realize . . .\u201d Affection warmed her brown eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to win me. I\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>He scooped her into his arms and carried her back to the fire, setting her on the carpet. Her chemise was rumpled and torn, so he retrieved his shirt and helped her into it. He fit it over her head, lifting her dark, lovely hair through the collar and arranging the locks about her face. His shirt looked well on her, the open collar offering a saucy glimpse of her unbound breasts. Her eyes shone, and a pretty blush kissed her cheeks.</p><p>God, he loved the look of her well tumbled. His heart and his loins argued he should marry her at once and keep her here, so he could start enjoying this sight every day. Every night.</p><p>But for once, he was going to let his brain make the decisions. When he acted on impulse, even his best intentions went bad. A hasty marriage, tempting as it sounded, simply wasn\u2019t the right way.</p><p>He pulled on his discarded trousers and sat cross-legged with her, before the fire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so young,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only five years younger than you. When my mother married, she was seventeen and my father was forty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAnd this week has been tumultuous, to put it mildly. I want to give you some time, back in the normal world, to make sure of your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure of my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to be courted. You deserve to know you have choices before you go committing your life to anyone\u2014least of all a blighter like me. You deserve a look at Sir Alisdair Kent. He might not be so warty after all.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face. \u201cI love you, Colin. Nothing\u2019s going to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, sweet girl.\u201d He gathered her in his arms and held her imprudently tight.</p><p>I love you. Nothing\u2019s going to change that.</p><p>Oh, how he wanted to take that bold, unequivocal statement and grasp it as truth. Carve it in stone, tattoo it on his flesh, spell it out in little mosaic tiles embedded in this very floor. The Gospel According to Minerva, never to be doubted. But he\u2019d learned too much\u2014from her, from life\u2014and he knew well how little she\u2019d seen of the world. His jaded soul craved assurance. At least a few months\u2019 worth of it.</p><p>Of all people, she ought to understand the value of a scientific test.</p><p>\u201cIf what you say is true . . .\u201d He pulled back to look her in those dark, beautiful eyes. \u201cThen there\u2019s no harm in waiting, is there?\u201d He caressed her cheek, trying to coax a smile. \u201cI\u2019m no stranger to impulsive decisions. They don\u2019t turn out well. When I marry you, I want everyone to know\u2014and that includes the two of us\u2014that it\u2019s not a rash, impetuous whim. I want to wait until after my birthday, so there\u2019ll be no suspicion that gaining control of my fortune had something to do with it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter your birthday? You\u2019re suggesting we live separately, for months?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI suppose so, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the nights, Colin? How do you plan to get through all those nights?\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could stand it if . . .\u201d</p><p>He hushed her with a kiss. \u201cThe wedding vows must wait. But I swear to you here and now, Minerva\u201d\u2014he took her hand and pressed it to his heart\u2014\u201cso long as I live, I won\u2019t pass a night in any other woman\u2019s arms. I can\u2019t pretend waiting for you will be pleasant, but I\u2019ll muddle through. It\u2019ll be a great deal easier to stand the darkness if you\u2019re the warm, lovely beacon of light at the end of it.\u201d</p><p>She looked disappointed, and he hated himself for that. But of all the things he\u2019d ever done in his life, he needed to take care and do this right. If that meant moving at the pace of a sea snail, so be it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is ideal, you\u2019ll see. We do everything backward. It\u2019s just how we are. We began with an elopement. After that, we made love. Next, we\u2019ll progress to courting. When we\u2019re old and silver-haired, perhaps we\u2019ll finally get around to flirtation. We\u2019ll make fond eyes at each other over our mugs of gruel. We\u2019ll be the envy of couples half our age.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, Colin. If they could see me right now, I\u2019d be the envy of every woman in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few in Scotland, too. You forget, I was raised very near the border.\u201d</p><p>He made the comment lightly, but its import sent a shiver of excitement through his bones.</p><p>Scotland.</p><p>The change in Colin was immediate. Minerva watched the expression on his face shift from warm affection to cold determination, in an instant.</p><p>She dragged a coy, sensual touch down his chest, hoping to change it back.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He pushed to his feet, offering her a hand. \u201cCome, now. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain on the way upstairs. We\u2019ve no time to lose.\u201d</p><p>Bewildered, she accepted his hand. He helped her up, then gathered all their discarded clothes. \u201cBy now your rooms will be prepared. They\u2019ll have fetched your trunks from the road. I\u2019ll see you to your suite, then send a maid to help you bathe and dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>He glanced out the open window. \u201cDawn will be coming on soon.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand to the small of her back and gathered her close, leading her out of the room and to a grand, sweeping staircase. As they rushed up the steps, Minerva tried not to think too hard about the fact that she was tiptoeing barefoot through one of England\u2019s grandest, most historic estates in nothing but Colin\u2019s lawn shirt. Scandal personified.</p><p>But then . . . someday she would be this house\u2019s mistress. Perhaps. Assuming the courtship went smoothly.</p><p>Lord, she was so confused.</p><p>\u201cAnd while I\u2019m bathing and dressing, where will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be doing likewise,\u201d he said. \u201cBathing, dressing. And then seeing to the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll need to leave as soon as possible.\u201d He stopped. \u201cWhich door was it . . . ? Aha. Here\u2019s your suite.\u201d</p><p>He led her into an exquisite sitting room decorated in ivory and sage green. Minerva could barely spare a glance to admire the carved moldings, or to emit a sigh of pleasure, as her travel-weary toes sank into the plush carpet pile.</p><p>\u201cColin, we just arrived here. We\u2019ve barely slept in days. Can\u2019t we at least rest before we go dashing off again? This is the most beautiful room I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful in it.\u201d Leaving her standing in the center of the carpet, he made a circle of the room. First, he pulled back the drapes. A silver glimmer of dawn filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows. \u201cYour dressing room\u2019s here,\u201d he said, indicating an open door. \u201cAnd the bedchamber\u2019s through that. I hope you\u2019ll have more time to explore it the next time we come through.\u201d He passed closed doors, pointing. \u201cBath. Closet.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, then opened them again. \u201cColin. Where on earth do you mean to take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Scotland. To the symposium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . it\u2019s too late. The symposium is today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why we must hurry. We\u2019ll arrive late. It can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would we even arrive at all? No more coaches, Colin. We can\u2019t.\u201d She knew how miserable he\u2019d been in the post-chaise last night. She wouldn\u2019t put him through that again, ever.</p><p>\u201cI have a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Francine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill exists. Plaster cast or no plaster cast. Her footprint exists. She left her mark on the world.\u201d He approached and took her hands in his. \u201cAnd so will you, Min. Perhaps you won\u2019t be assured the prize without the evidence in hand. But you\u2019ll be there, and you\u2019ll make your impression.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>A maid appeared in the bathing-room doorway. She cleared her throat and bobbed in a curtsy. \u201cMy lady, your bath is prepared.\u201d</p><p>Colin dismissed the servant with a nod.</p><p>He squeezed Minerva\u2019s hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve come this far. We\u2019re not giving up now. This is the story of our future\u2014the one we\u2019re going to tell our friends and dinner guests and children and grandchildren\u2014and the story doesn\u2019t end with defeat. It ends in triumph. Your triumph.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her hands to his lips. Kissed one, then the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She melted inside.</p><p>\u201cJust trust me to get you there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then make me proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d An hour later, Minerva stood on the Riverchase front steps, dressed in her best remaining traveling habit, made of a dark green twill. She hoped she looked optimistic, if she didn\u2019t quite feel it. \u201cWe\u2019re journeying to Edinburgh in this?\u201d</p> <p>She peered into the misty dawn. In the drive sat the highest-sprung, most richly upholstered and gaily-painted phaeton she\u2019d ever seen in her life. The narrow seat, built to accommodate only two persons\u2014one driver, one passenger\u2014must have hovered at least six feet from the ground. The little sporting carriage was hitched to two of the finest, most perfectly matched black warmbloods Minerva could imagine. They looked more like racing stock than coaching beasts.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be safe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t exactly the family model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll glow in the dark.\u201d She winced as the first ray of sunlight hit daffodil-yellow lacquer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s garish and flashy and reckless, yes.\u201d Colin tugged on a bit of leather tack, testing its strength. \u201cBut it is the fastest conveyance to be had in England. Won it in a game of cards, a few years back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won it. But do you know how to drive it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Minerva approached the phaeton with no small degree of trepidation. But she forced the nerves down, determined to be brave. Colin was putting all his faith in her. She had to make this worth it.</p><p>With a groom\u2019s assistance, she managed to climb into the seat. The team danced with impatience, and the phaeton swayed on its springs. Minerva\u2019s head spun.</p><p>Don\u2019t look down, she told herself.</p><p>Of course, the next instant she looked down. Did such prohibitions ever work?</p> <p>Hoisting himself into the seat, Colin landed next to her. He pulled down the brim of his hat and gathered the reins. \u201cSeventy-three miles. That\u2019s the distance to Edinburgh. If the weather holds, we can cover twelve miles an hour, easily, in this phaeton. Fifteen, if I press. With any luck, we\u2019ll arrive by noon. We can do this, Min. We really can.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou do . . .\u201d Threading her arm though his, she swallowed hard. \u201cColin, you do know how to drive this thing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou keep asking me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep refusing to answer.\u201d</p><p>He turned his gaze to the road and flicked the reins, nudging the team into a walk. \u201cI don\u2019t like to ride in carriages. Driving is a different matter.\u201d</p><p>Once they\u2019d rounded the turn in the drive, Colin snapped the reins and gave the horses their head, urging them into a canter.</p><p>They didn\u2019t canter. They flew.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The wind took her startled laughter and whipped it across the sprawling grounds of Riverchase.</p> <p>This must be what a bullet feels like.</p><p>Powered by those two majestic, elegant animals, the phaeton rocketed down the straight gravel drive like the angels\u2019 divine chariot. The seat was so lightly sprung, Minerva scarcely felt the ruts in the road.</p><p>When they reached the end of the drive, Colin slowed the team and guided them onto the main road with skill and ease. He looked as though he\u2019d been born with reins in hand.</p><p>She leaned closer, forced to shout over the roar of wind and hoofbeats. \u201cTeasing man. You do know how to drive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour-in-Hand Club!\u201d he called back, giving her a sly wink. \u201cAll the rage in Town.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Minerva clapped a hand over her bonnet, was too exhilarated by the rush of wind and speed to complain. Yes, of course. The rascal was a member of every club that would have him. Gentlemen\u2019s clubs, boxing club, gambling club, adventurers club. Why not a driving club, too?</p><p>That was his life, in London. All those clubs. All those friends. All those glittering, opulent amusements.</p><p>All those women.</p><p>As they raced northward, her mind spun faster than the phaeton wheels.</p><p>His suggestion of a public courtship thrilled her, to be sure. Attending balls and operas on the arm of the dashing, handsome Lord Payne? The thought alone made her heart skip beats. And she believed him when he said he cared for her. He wouldn\u2019t lie about that.</p><p>He\u2019s driving breakneck to Scotland for you, she told herself. Of course he cares.</p><p>Then again . . . just a few days ago he\u2019d devoted an afternoon to thatching a cottage roof. He\u2019d thrown himself into the menial labor with strength and enthusiasm and good humor. But he hadn\u2019t pledged to spend the rest of his life doing it. Was his sudden attachment to Minerva just a product of the extreme circumstances?</p><p>And if she was doubting his attachment, maybe he doubted her love.</p><p>Or maybe he simply doubted her. Perhaps he doubted she could make a proper viscountess, and who could blame him? For God\u2019s sake, think of that enormous, beautiful house and estate. Who would ever think Minerva could be its mistress? She\u2019d already left the drawing room a shambles and dripped rainwater all over the entry carpet. The servants would hate her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but worry over a hundred separate things. Colin must be worried, too. He\u2019d admitted his uncertainty. That\u2019s why he wanted to wait.</p><p>Waiting was wise, she reasoned. Delaying an engagement was the sensible, prudent course of action.</p><p>So why did it terrify her?</p><p>They stopped thrice to change horses and take refreshment, always hurrying back to the road at the first possible moment. The landscape rolling by was green and lushly curved. A recumbent goddess, awakening from her winter sleep.</p><p>The wind, by contrast, was a cold, cruel witch.</p><p>Minerva huddled under a woven rug for warmth, but the chill clawed straight through it. When the road straightened and he could spare some slack on the reins, Colin drew her close, putting his arm about her shoulders. She nestled into his side, comforting herself with his familiar warmth and scent. Watching his gloved hands guide the team with arousing, confident motions.</p><p>She slid an arm about his waist, hugging him tight. It didn\u2019t matter what happened today, or tomorrow. This\u2014just this\u2014was worth everything.</p><p>They neared Edinburgh just as the midday sun reached its zenith.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d he said, climbing back into the seat after stopping to ask directions of a tradesman. \u201cReady for your grand moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t know I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve lost all my notes and sketches. They won\u2019t believe me about Francine without the evidence. And after traveling seventy miles in a single morning, my hair must be a perfect fright.</p><p>They\u2019re all going to laugh. Oh God. I just know they\u2019ll all laugh.</p><p>Terror had her insides knotted. But she refused to give her fears a voice. She\u2019d promised Colin she wouldn\u2019t speak ill of herself again.</p><p>\u201cI think so. If you\u2019re with me, I\u2019m ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>He drew the horses to a halt, right in the middle of the street.</p><p>\u201cAre we there?\u201d she asked, looking about.</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d With a single gloved fingertip, he turned her face to his. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think I should do this on the doorstep of the Royal Geological Society.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her. Right there in the street and with such sweet, tender passion, all her worries receded, pushed aside by the swelling emotion in her heart.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked, gathering the reins.</p><p>She nodded, feeling her confidence return. \u201cThank you. I needed that.\u201d</p><p>Another few minutes\u2019 travel down crowded, cobbled streets, and Colin pulled the team to a stop in front of a stately brick edifice. He tossed the reins and a coin to a waiting boy before rounding the phaeton to help her alight.</p><p>\u201cHurry, now. You\u2019re just in time to make a fashionably late entrance.\u201d</p><p>Arm in arm, they raced up the steps. Minerva was so occupied trying not to trip over her skirts, she didn\u2019t notice a doorman\u2014or anyone, for that matter.</p><p>Until a deep voice drew them to a halt.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon. Just where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>Minerva winced. She should have known it couldn\u2019t be so simple.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here for the geology symposium,\u201d Colin told him. \u201cAnd we\u2019re running late, due to a travel mishap. So if you\u2019d kindly step aside . . .\u201d</p><p>The bearded man stood firm. He thumped a paper clipped to a writing board. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. But admittance is for Society members only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a member.\u201d Minerva came forward. \u201cI\u2019m a member of the Society. My name\u2019s M. R. Highwood. It must be on your list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Behind his gray beard, the man flushed an unseemly shade of red. \u201cYou would claim to be M. R. Highwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do more than claim it. I am Miss Minerva Rose Highwood. I can\u2019t believe the name would be unfamiliar to you. My findings have been published in no fewer than five issues of the Royal Geological Journal in the past seventeen months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Min?\u201d Colin\u2019s hand brushed the small of her back. \u201cFive times? That\u2019s brilliant, darling. I\u2019m so proud.\u201d</p><p>She blushed a little. At least someone appreciated her accomplishment. Someone marvelously handsome and kind and intelligent and, against all odds, purportedly devoted to her.</p><p>This pompous oaf standing before her, waving his silly list . . . he couldn\u2019t intimidate her. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cMadam, there must be some misunderstanding. The members of this Society are all gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has definitely been a misunderstanding,\u201d she said, smiling patiently now, \u201cbut the misunderstanding isn\u2019t mine. For the past two years, I\u2019ve paid my dues and submitted my findings and engaged in written correspondence as a full member of this organization. I have never claimed to be male. If the membership made the mistaken assumption otherwise, I cannot be responsible for it. Now will you kindly allow me entrance? I have a paper to present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He pulled up straight and turned to Colin. \u201cWe cannot allow this. Unless she has some\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, why are you talking to him?\u201d Minerva interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m standing right here, and I can speak for myself.\u201d</p><p>The man sighed heavily. \u201cMy dear girl, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a girl. Nor am I \u2018dear\u2019 to you, unless\u2014\u201d Good Lord, she hoped this red-faced prig wasn\u2019t Sir Alisdair. Sir Alisdair had seemed so much more reasonable than this. \u201cListen, Mr. . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Barrington.\u201d She smiled with relief. \u201cI\u2019m here to present my findings at the symposium. I\u2019m an esteemed member of the Society, with an impressive record of scholarship, and I have something of value to contribute to these proceedings. I also happen to be female. I\u2019m a woman who knows a great deal about rocks. I suggest you find the stones to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Colin choked on a laugh. \u201cWell done, love. Brava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Barrington looked decidedly less amused. \u201cThis symposium is restricted to members of the Royal Geological Society and their guests. And as membership is restricted to gentlemen, so this door is barred to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now.\u201d Colin intervened. She recognized him bringing forth his most commanding, lordly tone. \u201cWe can settle this some other way, surely. I happen to be rather fond of joining clubs. Now, what must a man do to become a member of your Society?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lengthy application process. A letter of inquiry must be made, including a personal statement of research interests and any relevant publications. References must be provided\u2014three, at the minimum, and no more than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Here\u2019s my application, if you\u2019d be so good as to take dictation. I\u2019m Colin Frederick Sandhurst, Viscount Payne. As for geological interests, I\u2019m told my estate sits atop the largest vein of usable granite in all Northumberland. For references, I name my cousin, Lord General Victor Bramwell, the Earl of Rycliff. Second, my dear friend the Duke of Halford. And thirdly . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Minerva cleared her throat. \u201cAhem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirdly, M. R. Highwood,\u201d Colin finished.</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Colin raised a finger. \u201cI believe that\u2019s \u2018my lord\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, I\u2019m sure the Society is honored by your lordship\u2019s interest. However . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that in lieu of the regular dues and as a concession to my expedited application process, I\u2019m willing to pledge an annual sustaining subscription of . . . say, a thousand pounds?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Barrington seized.</p><p>\u201cOh, very well. You drive a hard bargain, Barrington. Make it three.\u201d He smiled broadly in the face of silence. \u201cWell. Now that that\u2019s all settled, I\u2019ll be entering the symposium. Miss Highwood will come as my guest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, my lord, unmarried women cannot attend as guests. It\u2019s not proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of ammonites, man! That\u2019s just stupid. Why on earth would the Society need to protect unmarried women from bone-dry lectures regarding soil composition? Do your members find themselves whipped into some sort of dusty frenzy, from which no delicate lass would be safe?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Barrington tugged on his coat. \u201cSometimes debate does get heated.\u201d</p><p>Colin turned to her. \u201cMin, can I just hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun him through with something sharp?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably a worse idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no getting around it.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019ll just have to go in and give the presentation for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. You\u2019ve heard me read it so many times. I know it contains a great many polysyllabic words, but you\u2019ll rise to the challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva, these are your findings. These are your peers. This should be your moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d Tears prickled at the corners of her eyes, and she impatiently blinked them back. \u201cThey won\u2019t let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let unmarried ladies in. So marry me. Right here and now.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him, shocked. His Bristol-diamond eyes shone, brilliant and sincere. \u201cMarry? But we . . . we can\u2019t possibly\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took her hands. \u201cThis is Scotland, Minerva. We don\u2019t need a license or a church. We only need witnesses. Barrington here can serve as one, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned, just as another man opened the door and joined them on the stoop.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d the newcomer asked in a deep, solemn voice.</p><p>Minerva\u2019s eyes swept him from boots to crown. He was tall and handsome and . . . well, tall and handsome some more. He struck quite the fine figure, silhouetted in the door.</p><p>He asked, \u201cBarrington, who are these people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Colin said. \u201cThis fine-looking fellow can serve as our second witness. We have Mr. Barrington, and we have\u201d\u2014he clapped the newcomer on the shoulder\u2014\u201cMr. . . . ?\u201d</p><p>The man blinked at Colin\u2019s presumptuous gesture. \u201cI\u2019m Sir Alisdair Kent.\u201d</p><p>Minerva clapped a hand over her shocked laughter.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Colin\u2019s hand made two slow, heavy pats on Sir Alisdair\u2019s shoulder, as he sized the man up with a sweeping gaze. \u201cRight. You would be.\u201d He heaved a sigh and turned to Minerva. \u201cThis is probably where I should step aside and let you two get more acquainted\u2014\u201d</p><p>No!</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Her heart flipped. Thank heaven.</p><p>He wrapped her gloved hands in both of his and stared deeply into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMinerva, I love you. I\u2019d been waiting to tell you so at a better moment. In some more romantic time and place.\u201d He threw a glance at their surroundings. \u201cBut here and now will have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere is fine,\u201d she managed. \u201cNow is good.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hands. \u201cI love you. I love that you\u2019re clever and loyal and curious and kind. I love that you\u2019re often so fearless and bold and strong\u2014but I also love that you\u2019re occasionally not, because then I can be strong for you. I love that I can tell you anything. Anything at all. And I love that you always have something surprising to say. I love that you call things by their right names. That you aren\u2019t afraid to call a tit a tit, or a cock a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Sir Alisdair interjected, \u201cbut what in God\u2019s name are you on about?\u201d</p><p>Minerva couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d Colin told the man irritably. \u201cI promised this woman months of tender courtship, and thanks to your Society and its inane, archaic rules, I must cram it all into the space of five minutes. The least you could do is not interrupt.\u201d</p><p>Sir Alisdair spoke directly to Minerva. \u201cIs this man harassing you, Miss . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cIt is Miss Highwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said gently. \u201cYes, it is Miss Highwood. I apologize for the confusion. And I\u2019m so sorry if I\u2019ve caused you any . . . disappointment.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked as he looked her up and down. \u201cMerely surprise, Miss Highwood. Merely surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. She\u2019s a very surprising woman.\u201d Colin cleared his throat. \u201cOnce again, man. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Minerva pulled Colin a few steps away. \u201cNever mind him. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>Once they had a bit of privacy, his eyes gentled. \u201cAs I was saying, pet. I love that you call things by their right names. That you\u2019re bold enough to call a tit a tit, and a cock a cock. But most of all, I love that even after this mad, reckless week with me\u2014even with your heart and reputation and future hanging in the balance\u2014you were brave enough to call love love.\u201d His hands framed her face. \u201cBecause that\u2019s exactly what this is. I love you, Minerva.\u201d A look of exultant joy lit his eyes, as though he\u2019d just unearthed the scientific discovery of a lifetime. \u201cWe love each other.\u201d</p><p>A knot rose in her throat. \u201cYes. We do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you, for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen here.\u201d He released her hands. Catching his glove between his teeth, he tugged it loose and then discarded the thing entirely. His fingers went to the signet ring on his little finger, and he twisted it back and forth. And back and forth. He grimaced. \u201cThis may take a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin, really. You don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost have it,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. His face was red and contorted with effort. \u201cWait . . . wait . . .\u201d</p><p>He turned away and crouched, still tugging at the ring. Minerva began to grow worried for him.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Panting for breath and wearing an expression of triumph, he held up the ring for her inspection. \u201cI haven\u2019t removed this ring since I was a boy. It was my father\u2019s of course, and it came to me after his death. It started out on my thumb, then made its way down every finger. It\u2019s been on that last finger so long, it almost became a part of me. But now I want you to wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you must.\u201d He turned her hand palm up and dropped the ring in it. \u201cIt\u2019s my most cherished possession, Min. You must wear it. That way, I\u2019ll always know the two things dearest to me are in the same place. It will be a true help. Most convenient.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the ring. Then she stared at him, breathless with emotion.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she hastened to assure him. \u201cOf course I want to marry you. But I thought you wanted to wait, go slowly. Have a proper courtship. It seemed so important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u201d\u2014he gestured at the door and the symposium going on within\u2014\u201dis important to you. Which means it\u2019s everything to me.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she watched as he sank to one knee.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Minerva. Stay with me forever. Let me cherish you always. Give me the lasting joy of calling you my own.\u201d He slipped the signet ring on her gloved finger. \u201cBut marry me today. So I can share you with the world.\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at him, her heart swollen with love\u2014and her mind decided that the world would never see a better man.</p><p>With a few hasty vows uttered right here on these steps, he offered to make all her dreams come true. And she could make Colin all hers. Forever.</p><p>\u201cWell, girl?\u201d Behind them, Mr. Barrington thumped his board. \u201cDo you mean to marry the fellow or not?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>\u201cCan I interest you in some lace today, Miss Taylor?\u201d As Kate entered the All Things shop, Sally Bright straightened behind the counter. The fair-haired young woman laid aside the newspaper she\u2019d been reading. \u201cOr a new ribbon, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Kate shook her head, smiling. \u201cJust some ink. I haven\u2019t any reason for new lace or ribbons today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Sally plunked a bottle of ink on the counter. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I hear.\u201d</p><p>The sly note in the girl\u2019s voice made Kate snap to attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>Sally feigned innocence. \u201cOnly that someone made a trip up to Rycliff Castle the other day. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Kate felt her cheeks heating. Which annoyed her, because she had nothing whatever to feel embarrassed or ashamed about. \u201cYes, I did walk up to the castle. I needed to speak with Corporal Thorne. We had a . . . a disagreement to settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Sally\u2019s brow arched. \u201cA disagreement to settle. Well, that all sounds very proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t improper, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re suggesting.\u201d</p><p>Kate declined to mention the fact that she\u2019d come upon the man at his labor. Half-dressed, drenched with perspiration. All that bronzed skin stretched over a hard, muscled body . . . his broad-shouldered silhouette was burned into her memory now. As though she\u2019d stared directly at the sun, and the impression lingered on her retinas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just teasing you, Miss Taylor. I know there\u2019s nothing untoward between you. But mind you be careful. You don\u2019t want the wrong idea getting around. Else you\u2019re sure to suffer a plague of small mishaps. Salt will find its way into your sugar bowl, pins will be left in your hemmed skirts, and so forth.\u201d</p><p>Kate frowned. \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnvy. Half the women in the village will be wishing you ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d envy me? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCor, you truly don\u2019t know.\u201d Sally straightened the pieces of jewelry in the display case. \u201cFrom the moment Lord Rycliff\u2019s party rode into the village last summer, I know all you ladies of the Queen\u2019s Ruby had your eyes on Lord Payne. Dashing, handsome, charming. What gentlewoman wouldn\u2019t take a fancy to him? But there\u2019s other women in this village, Miss Taylor. Serving girls, sailors\u2019 widows, housemaids . . . women who won\u2019t bother to dream of a viscount. They\u2019ve all been jostling to catch Corporal Thorne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? But . . .\u201d Kate slapped at a gnat pestering her neck. \u201cBut he\u2019s so big. And rough. And coarse mannered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Sally gave her a knowing smile.</p><p>Kate wondered at it.</p><p>\u201cSo far, it\u2019s all come to naught. Traps have been laid for him all over this village, but he\u2019s evaded every one. Rumor is, he\u2019s got himself an \u2018arrangement\u2019 with a widow next town over. Goes to pay her a kindly visit once or twice a month, if you catch my meaning.\u201d</p><p>Kate did catch Sally\u2019s meaning. And it made her suddenly, unaccountably nauseous. Naturally, Corporal Thorne had the right to do whatever he pleased with whomever he pleased. She just didn\u2019t like knowing about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Much less picturing it.</p><p>She gave herself a brisk mental shake.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can spread the word\u201d\u2014and she knew Sally would\u2014\u201cthat the women of Spindle Cove have nothing to envy. There\u2019s absolutely nothing between me and Corporal Thorne. Nothing but polite acquaintance on my side, and certainly no affection on his. The man barely tolerates my existence.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne had been only too eager to see Kate leave that day. She recalled the terse impatience in his motions as he\u2019d shown her to the castle gate, once their conversation was concluded. Evidently, digging a well was more entertaining.</p><p>Sally shrugged, wiping a dusting cloth over the shelves behind the counter. \u201cYou never know, Miss Taylor. No one thought there was anything between Miss Minerva and Lord Payne, either. And look at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s entirely different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt . . . just is.\u201d Kate was saved by the clip-clop of hoofbeats and a rumble of approaching carriage wheels.</p> <p>In an acrobatic maneuver, Sally clutched the shelf with one hand and leaned her weight to the other side, craning her neck to peek out the shop\u2019s front window. Glimpse achieved, she dropped her dusting cloth.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment, Miss Taylor. That\u2019s the post. I have to meet it, or they\u2019ll be ever so angry. Those mail-coach drivers are surly ones. They don\u2019t even like to slow down.\u201d</p><p>While Sally gathered the post, Kate fished in her reticule for coins to pay for the ink. There weren\u2019t all that many coins left. Winter and early spring were lean seasons for a music tutor in a holiday village. She had to exercise constant frugality.</p><p>\u201cDo you have change for a half crown?\u201d she asked, as Sally came back through the door.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment . . .\u201d The young woman sifted through the small bundle of envelopes and letters. She seized on one missive, separating it from the stack. \u201cCor. Here it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere what is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA letter from Miss Minerva.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s heart jumped in her chest. The whole village had been waiting for word from Minerva. She rushed to Sally\u2019s side. \u201cThat\u2019s her penmanship. I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Sally squealed. \u201cIt\u2019s sealed with Lord Payne\u2019s crest, just look.\u201d</p><p>Kate ran her fingers over the bumpy red wax seal. \u201cIndeed it is. Oh, this is wonderful news. Mrs. Highwood should have it at once. I\u2019ll take it to her at the Queen\u2019s Ruby.\u201d</p><p>Sally clutched the envelope to her chest. \u201cAbsolutely not. No one\u2019s getting this away from me. I have to be there when she reads it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what of the shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, this is the Bright family. There are a half dozen of us.\u201d Sally dashed to the storeroom door and called through it. \u201cRufus, mind the counter. I\u2019ll pop back in ten!\u201d</p><p>Together, they raced across the green and through the door of the Queen\u2019s Ruby. They found Charlotte and Mrs. Highwood in the drawing room. The former, working an embroidered pillowcase. The latter, drowsing on the divan.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Highwood!\u201d Sally called.</p><p>The matron woke with a snort. Her head swiveled so abruptly, her lace cap went askew. \u201cWhat? What is it? Who\u2019s murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s been murdered,\u201d Kate said, smiling. \u201cBut someone may have been married.\u201d</p><p>Sally pressed the letter into the older woman\u2019s hand. \u201cGo on, Mrs. Highwood. Do read it. We\u2019re all desperate to know.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood looked at the envelope. Her face blanched. \u201cOh my saints. My dear, darling girl.\u201d With trembling fingers, she broke the seal and unfolded the letter.</p><p>Charlotte put aside her embroidery and huddled near.</p><p>The older woman thrust the letter at her youngest daughter. \u201cHere, you read it. My eyes are too bad. And my nerves . . .\u201d</p><p>Sally clutched Kate\u2019s arm, and they all waited in breathless anticipation.</p><p>\u201cAloud, Miss Charlotte,\u201d Sally urged. \u201cDo read it aloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018My dear mother,\u2019\u201d Charlotte began. \u201c \u2018I know you must be wondering what has become of your wayward daughter. I must admit, the past week has not unfolded quite as I\u2019d planned.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Kate murmured.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ruined,\u201d Mrs. Highwood said weakly. \u201cWe\u2019re all ruined. Someone fetch my fan. And some wine.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte went on reading. \u201c \u2018Despite the travails of the road, we\u2014\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe!\u201d Sally echoed. \u201cTake heart, Mrs. Highwood. She wrote \u2018we\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018We are settled in Northumberland at present.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNorthumberland.\u201d The color returned to Mrs. Highwood\u2019s cheeks. She sat straight on the divan. \u201cHis estate is there. He told me so once. Oh, what was the name of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018And it\u2019s with great pleasure,\u2019 \u201d Charlotte continued, \u201c \u2018that I write to you from . . .\u2019\u201d She lowered the paper and smiled. \u201c \u2018From the beautiful library at Riverchase.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>Two weeks later</p><p>My dear daughter, the Viscountess Payne,</p><p>The bells are ringing in St. Ursula\u2019s today! I told the vicar they must, no matter that you\u2019re all the way in Northumberland. How happy we were to receive your letter. As my friends always tell me, my intuition is unparalleled. I always knew that rascal Payne would be my son one day. But who could have guessed his viscountess! You have done your mother proud, dear. Of course, you must take time for your honeymoon, but do think of returning to Town for the celebrations of the Glorious Peace. Diana must be next, you know. She will be well placed to take advantage of your new connections. I have higher hopes for her prospects than ever. If you can catch Payne, surely Diana can snare a duke!</p><p>Yours, etc.</p><p>Mama</p><p>With an amused smile, Minerva refolded the letter and placed it in her pocket.</p><p>She paused in the middle of the path, drawing a lungful of the warm, fragrant late-spring air and loosening her bonnet strings to let the straw bonnet slip down her back. Then with a light step, she continued on the country path that led from the village to Riverchase.</p><p>Bluebells waved drunkenly on their slender stalks, begging to be plucked. As she went, she stopped to gather them, along with primrose and a few remaining daffodils. She had quite a posy accumulated by the time she climbed the hill. As she neared the ridge\u2019s apex, a smile bloomed across her face. She warmed with joy, just anticipating the sight of the familiar granite facade.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Riverchase she first glimpsed as she crested the hill.</p><p>It was Colin, walking down the same path\u2014toward her.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d he called, drawing near. \u201cI was just on my way to the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see you, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I was on my way to see you.\u201d She gave him a shy smile, feeling that familiar touch of giddiness.</p><p>He gestured at her bouquet of wildflowers. \u201cCollecting flowers today? Not rocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like flowers sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. Vases of flowers are much easier to send round to the cottage.\u201d His gloved fingertip caressed her cheek. \u201cMiss Minerva, may I . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kiss?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She offered her cheek to him, leaning in to accept the tender, courtly gesture. But at the last moment, he turned her face to his and kissed her on the lips instead. Oh, he was ever the scoundrel, and she was glad of it. Their kiss was brief, but warm and sweet as the afternoon sun.</p><p>After a moment, he straightened. His gaze wandered her form. \u201cYou look . . .\u201d He shook his head, smiling a little. \u201cCataclysmic with beauty today.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, taking a moment to recover from his masculine splendor. \u201cYou rather devastate me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think my kiss can take all the credit for that lovely blush, but I doubt it\u2019s the truth. What has you so self-satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kiss has a great deal to do with it. But the post came through this morning.\u201d She fished a pair of envelopes from her pocket. \u201cI had two rather interesting letters. The first is from my mother. She extends her felicitations on our marriage.\u201d</p><p>She handed him the letter from Spindle Cove. He unfolded the page and scanned its contents. As he read, the corner of his mouth curled in amusement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cI know she\u2019s dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. She\u2019s a mother who wants the best for her daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mistaken, is what she is. I didn\u2019t tell her we\u2019d married. I only said we\u2019d stopped at your estate, and she shouldn\u2019t expect me back for a month or more. But she\u2019s obviously assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all assumed. I had a letter from Bram just the other day. He wanted to know why I hadn\u2019t sent the solicitors written proof of our marriage yet. \u2018Don\u2019t I want my money?\u2019 he asked.\u201d</p><p>Together, they turned to walk toward Riverchase.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll learn the truth eventually,\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cYes, they will. You said you had two interesting letters. Who sent the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Alisdair Kent.\u201d</p><p>She noted a slight hitch in his step. The subtle hint of jealousy thrilled her more than it ought.</p><p>\u201cOh, truly?\u201d he said, in a purposely offhand tone. \u201cAnd what did the good Sir Alisdair have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. Only that the Royal Geological Journal has declined to publish my paper about Francine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He stopped dead and turned to her. The affectionate sparkle in his eyes became a flash of something irate, verging on murderous. \u201cOh, Min. That\u2019s bollocks. They can\u2019t have done that to you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSir Alisdair said he tried to argue on my behalf, but the other journal editors would not be convinced. My evidence was specious, they said; my conclusions were too great of a reach . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCodswallop.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cCowardly bastards. They just won\u2019t be outdone by a woman, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Min. We should have gone in to the symposium that day. You could have presented your findings in person. If only they\u2019d all heard you speak, you could have convinced them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d She reached for his hand and squeezed it. \u201cDon\u2019t ever be sorry, Colin. I never will be.\u201d</p><p>They stood there for a long moment, smiling a little and gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. Lately, they could spend hours like this\u2014a palpable happiness and love welling in the space between them.</p><p>Minerva couldn\u2019t wait to be his wife. But she would never regret refusing to marry him that day in Edinburgh, at the threshold of the Royal Geological Society.</p><p>He\u2019d been through so much just to get her to that doorway. Faced his deepest fears, committed feats of daring. Opened his heart to her, and his home as well. He\u2019d given her courage and strength and hours of laughter. Not to mention passion, and all those fervent words of love. In proposing to her, he\u2019d made the bravest leap of faith she could imagine.</p><p>In return, Minerva wanted to give him this much, at least. The proper courtship he\u2019d wanted. A chance for their love to take root and grow. When she recited those wedding vows, she wanted him to know they were vows of freely given, lasting devotion, not a hasty grab at scientific glory.</p><p>Colin deserved that much.</p><p>They\u2019d turned their backs on Mr. Barrington and the Royal Geological Society that day. But Sir Alisdair Kent had the curiosity to follow. He invited them for a meal at the nearby inn, where they spent several hours engaged in scholarly debate with his friends. Sir Alisdair and company listened, questioned, argued, and generally afforded Minerva the respect due an intellectual peer. Colin saw that the wineglasses never went empty and kept his arm draped casually, possessively, over the back of her chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, it wasn\u2019t a medallion and a prize of five hundred guineas, but it was a symposium of sorts. And it had been well worth the journey.</p><p>Afterward, she and Colin had traveled straight back to Northumberland. Colin installed her in a lovely cottage in the village, with his housekeeper Mrs. Hammond as chaperone. And then he\u2019d gone about living up to all his promises of a tender, attentive courtship. He called on her most mornings, and they went for long, rambling walks in the afternoons. He brought her gifts of sweets and lace, and they kept the errand boys dashing back and forth with notes that needed no signatures. Several times a week, she and Mrs. Hammond dined at Riverchase, and he took Sunday dinner at the cottage.</p><p>They also spent time apart. She, writing up her Spindle Cove findings and exploring the new craggy landscape. Colin, surveying the estate with his land steward and making assessments and plans for the future.</p> <p>As for plans for their future . . . Minerva tried to be patient.</p><p>If Colin had taken a hurtling leap of faith when he\u2019d proposed, her gesture of faith had been more of a long, slow skate on thin ice. As much as she\u2019d been enjoying their courtship, she tried not to think about the potential for heartbreak. There was always the chance that he might change his mind.</p><p>But in the month or so since returning from Edinburgh, they\u2019d survived their first argument\u2014a dispute over, of all things, a missing pair of gloves. They\u2019d also weathered their second clash. It had begun as a tense disagreement over whether Minerva could safely explore the local crags unaccompanied. (Of course she could, was Minerva\u2019s opinion. Colin begged to differ.) The tense disagreement exploded into a grand row that involved loud denouncements of female independence, male arrogance, fur-lined cloaks, rocks of all sorts, and\u2014inexplicably\u2014the color green. But the eventual compromise\u2014a joint excursion to the crags that became a passionate, frantic tryst in the heather\u2014quite took the edge off their anger.</p><p>Since then, their courtship had been as sweet and tender as ever\u2014but not entirely chaste.</p><p>Minerva put her arm through his, and they resumed walking down the path. \u201cI\u2019m not deterred. I\u2019ll find some other way to publish my findings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way. If you can wait five more weeks, I\u2019ll celebrate my birthday by printing a copy for every household in England.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cA few hundred copies would do, and there\u2019s no need to rush. Francine\u2019s footprint survived in that cave for millions of years. I can wait a bit longer to make my own mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I tell you there\u2019s already a deep, permanent, Minerva-sized footprint on my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She kissed his cheek, savoring that hint of cloves from his shaving soap. \u201cDo you have any business this afternoon? I was hoping to spend a few hours poking through the Riverchase library.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment. \u201cIf an afternoon in the library is your desire, you shall have it. But I confess, I had something else in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA wedding.\u201d</p><p>Minerva nearly dropped her posy of flowers. \u201cWhose wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can. The vicar\u2019s read the banns in the parish church three times now. I sent him a note before I left the house this morning, and I asked the butler to ready the chapel. By the time we return, all should be ready.\u201d</p><p>Minerva blinked at him. He\u2019d been planning this? \u201cBut I thought we agreed to wait until after your birthday.\u201d</p><p>His arms went around her, wreathing loosely about her waist. \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t. I simply can\u2019t. I slept well last night. But when I woke this morning, I missed you so intensely. I don\u2019t even know how to describe the sensation. I looked at the other pillow, and it just seemed wrong that you weren\u2019t there. As though I\u2019d woken up missing my own arm, or half of my heart. I felt incomplete. So I rose, and dressed, and I just started walking toward you\u2014because I couldn\u2019t move in any other direction. And then there you were, walking toward me. Flowers in hand.\u201d</p><p>Emotion glimmered in his eyes, and he touched her cheek. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a whim. I simply can\u2019t stand to spend another day apart. I want you to share my life and my home, and . . .\u201d He cinched her tight, drawing her body in exquisite contact with his. He bent his head, pressing kisses to the soft place beneath her ear. \u201cAnd I want you to share my bed. As my wife. Tonight.\u201d</p> <p>His kisses made her dizzy with longing. She clung to him tight. \u201cColin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Min. I love you so much, it terrifies me. Say you\u2019ll marry me today.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back a little. \u201cI . . .\u201d Swallowing hard, she ran a trembling hand down her butter-yellow muslin. \u201cI should at least change my frock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d He shook his head, framing her waist in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect. Utterly perfect, just as you are.\u201d</p><p>Emotion swelled in her heart and thickened her throat. She felt like pinching herself, just to make sure she wasn\u2019t dreaming. But she never could have dreamed something so wonderful. She was perfect. He was perfect. This moment was perfect. She was afraid to speak, for fear of ruining it somehow.</p><p>Don\u2019t pause to think. Just run down the slope.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she finally blurted out. \u201cYes. Let\u2019s get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis very hour.\u201d A giddy grin stretched her cheeks, and she couldn\u2019t hold back the pure joy any longer. She launched herself at him, flinging her arms around his neck. \u201cOh, Colin, I love you so much. I can\u2019t possibly tell you. I\u2019ll try to show you, but I\u2019ll need years.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWe have decades, darling. Decades.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes\u2019 hasty walk saw them to the chapel door. While Colin went to find the vicar and round up a few servants as witnesses, Minerva passed into the small churchyard and came to stand before a slab of flawless granite, polished to a mirror gleam.</p><p>She stood there for a long minute, unsure how to begin. Then she took a deep breath and dabbed a tear from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry we\u2019ll never meet,\u201d she whispered, laying her posy atop the late Lord and Lady Payne\u2019s grave. \u201cBut thank you. For him. I promise, I\u2019ll love him as fiercely as I can. Kindly send down some blessings when you can spare them. We\u2019ll probably need them, from time to time.\u201d</p><p>By the time she left the churchyard and rounded the chapel corner, she caught sight of Colin leading the vicar, butler, and house servants marching in a bemusement-day parade. Holding open the door, he waved them all into the chapel.</p><p>\u201cCome along, now,\u201d he said, tapping his boot with impatience.</p><p>When the rest had all filed in, and only the two of them were left standing at the door, he caught Minerva\u2019s gaze. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, breathless. \u201cIf you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so sure of anything.\u201d He reached for her hand and kissed it. \u201cYou belong beside me, Min. And I belong beside you. I know it in my heart. I feel it in my soul. I\u2019m certain, in every possible way.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d never been more handsome.</p><p>\u201cCertainty becomes you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Smiling, he laced her arm through his, leading her into the chapel.</p><p>And that was how the grand, epic story of their future\u2014the tale they\u2019d tell friends and dinner party guests and grandchildren for decades to come\u2014ended. Just as a proper fairy tale should. With a romantic wedding, a tender kiss . . .</p><p>And the promise of happily ever after. </p> </body></html>"]
